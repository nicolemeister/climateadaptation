That was COP15 (COP stands for \"conference of the parties\"), and it was held in Copenhagen. I write \"near\" a COP because back then fashion was not considered central to the climate conversation. It wasn't, somehow, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">serious</emphasis> enough.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fashion was so marginalized, in fact, that in order to talk about its role in creating, and fighting, climate change, it had to hold its own conference. And so the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, which focuses on sustainability, was born.       </p><p>It took more than a decade, but things have changed. There has been a lot of talk this year about financial bigwigs finally coming to the COP table, but this is the first year that fashion had a meaningful, extended presence. As Stella McCartney, who created a special \"Future of Fashion\" materials exhibition at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery said, after almost two decades of pushing fashion to acknowledge its effect on the environment, she was a \"COP virgin\" no longer.       </p><p>Here's what else stuck with me from COP26.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. There was plenty of official action.</emphasis></p><p>Smack in the middle of the Blue Zone (the official delegate area - that is, the one where world leaders spoke), there was an installation by a fashion collective called Generation of Waste made to mimic a bar chart of the various stages of textile waste, from design through raw materials, garment production and so on.       </p><p>The United Nations Environment Program released a new version of the fashion charter initially created in 2018, now with 130 signatory companies, including, for the first time, LVMH, and with stronger commitments to halve carbon emissions by 2030 (and reach net zero by 2050).       </p><p>On the fringe, Federico Marchetti, the former Yoox Net a Porter chairman, unveiled a digital ID created by the fashion task force of Prince Charles's Sustainable Markets Initiative: a scannable garment tag that acts like a DNA trace for a product's manufacturing history, using blockchain technology.       </p><p>And Textile Exchange, an NGO that sounds like a fabric trading post but actually focuses on creating global standards in fashion, presented a trade policy request to national governments supported by 50 brands. That is an unsexy term for a plea to create tariff and import-export structures that incentivize companies to use \"environmentally preferred materials\" rather than, say, polyester. Which is, by the way, the most used material in the entire fashion industry.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. A fake fact was finally abandoned.</emphasis></p><p>No one uttered the now discredited but formerly very popular \"fashion is the second most polluting industry on the planet\" fake stat. Everyone has finally agreed it's one of the worst, and that's plenty bad enough.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. \"Degrowth\" is the word of the moment.</emphasis></p><p>Degrowth: meaning to make less product. Meaning the action taken in response to the fact that in the first 15 years of this century, clothing production doubled in volume, but the number of times a garment was worn before being thrown away decreased 36 percent. For a long time the response to this kind of data was to urge consumers to \"buy less!\" and \"wear longer!\" Now it seems that brands have owned up to their role in the problem.       </p><p>That said, it's hard to imagine Bernard Arnault of LVMH or Ralph Lauren standing up at their annual shareholders meeting and announcing that their strategy for 2022 is \"degrowth.\" (It almost sounds like a potential \"Saturday Night Live\" skit.) Except that Halide Alag\u00f6z, the chief sustainability officer of Ralph Lauren, revealed during a New York Times Climate Hub panel that the brand had secretly been trying it out.       </p><p>Yup: Ralph Lauren has been practicing degrowth. Not that they call it that, exactly.       </p><p>The company calls it \"financial growth through degrowth of resources,\" according to Ms. Alag\u00f6z. Which is a terrible name for an interesting initiative, but Lauren is working on it. What it discovered was that it could decouple production from profits, so that even as the company made less stuff, it was able to make money - largely by maximizing its understanding of sell-through. It ended up with less wasted product that had to be downstreamed to outlet stores.       </p><p>\"We have seen our financials getting better although we produce less units compared to five years ago,\" Ms. Alag\u00f6z said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Resale becomes reuse.</emphasis></p><p>Designers are also getting creative when it comes to product that exists in the world. One of my favorite points came from William McDonough, an author of \"Cradle to Cradle,\" a sort of founding manifesto on the circular economy, who pointed out that we should think of garments as source materials that can be re-sourced for second and third use.       </p><p>This is exactly what the British designer Priya Ahluwalia was thinking when she teamed up with Microsoft to create a platform called Circulate, which allows consumers to send their own used clothes to her company. If the clothes are in acceptable condition, they will get remade and incorporated into her next collection, and the donor will get \"reward points\" toward a new purchase with the brand. It's a sourcing hack Ms. Ahluwalia said has opened up a whole new channel for fabric and ideas for her.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. But watch out for \"regenerative.\"</emphasis></p><p>It's a growing buzzword in fashion, thanks to regenerative agriculture, a farming technique that helps to restore soil health and nutrients. One of the less discussed aspects of fashion is just how intertwined it is with agriculture - many brands are now investing in supporting regenerative farming - but the word has jumped its tracks and filtered up to companies that boast about a \"regenerative strategy\" and \"regenerative tactics,\" which seems to mean ... well, it&amp;#39;s not clear what it means. But it sounds good, right?       </p><p>This is the sort of fuzzy language that can lead to charges of greenwashing, which is why Textile Exchange is working on a specific definition, out next year.       </p><p>Honestly, they could expand the definition to encompass a whole lexicon of fashion so everyone would be using the same language. For example, another word I bet we will hear more of comes courtesy of a McKinsey report: \"nearshoring,\" which is to say using suppliers that are not necessarily in your country but are not halfway around the world. After all, according to a presentation by the British brand Bamford, the average merino wool sweater journeys 18,000 miles during its production cycle, from raw material to factory to atelier to shop.       </p><p>A project for COP27, perhaps. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008078659</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6442-F6C1-DYR7-C1X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 20, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001PNE</classCode><className>LVMH MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS316992 WOMEN'S HANDBAG &amp;

The focus here is farming, culture, the environment, climate change and, yes, great-tasting wine.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the polarizing subject of natural wine arises, the discussion generally spirals to the stereotypes: flawed and funky wines, hippie producers and the debate over definitions. But a new documentary film, \"Living Wine,\" hopes to change that trite discussion.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The film, which opens in selected theaters July 15, focuses on a small group of natural wine producers in California. It examines, with far more nuance than is typical, the myriad reasons they choose to work in natural wine, along with the many rationales for consumers to drink it.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this context, natural wine is presented neither as a trend nor a generational emblem. Involvement is a conscious choice. Though their reasons may overlap, each of the producers in the film has a different point of emphasis.       </p><p>Gideon Beinstock and Saron Rice of Clos Saron in the Sierra Foothills make wine without additives because they believe that method makes the best wines and offers the best expression of their vineyard.       </p><p>\"The fact that we don't add anything is not because it's natural,\" Mr. Beinstock said. \"It's because, why would I add anything? It will not improve the wine.\"       </p><p>Darek Trowbridge of Old World Winery in the Russian River Valley believes in the traditional methods embodied by his ancestors, who planted a vineyard in the area almost 100 years ago, before chemical farming became the norm. He wants to express the distinctive terroirs of his vineyards, but he sees himself as a custodian of nature, too, a role that he holds sacred.       </p><p>\"I try to work to do good on my farm for the land, for the ecosystem,\" he said. \"Where I reside spiritually is where I want to reside as a farmer and not separate the two.\"       </p><p>For Megan Bell of Margins Wines, who shares a production facility outside of Santa Cruz with James Jelks of Flor\u00e8z Wines, the reasons are more political, born of her demeaning experiences as a young woman in a male-dominated winery in Napa Valley.       </p><p>\"I hated my job,\" she said. \"I loved what I physically did, but the culture and the way that I was treated, I dreaded going to work every day. Nobody wants to be at work when their abilities are doubted constantly.\"       </p><p>She is a minimalist, trying to work efficiently rather than trying to make art, and has chosen to work primarily with grapes and areas that she believes are ignored by the corporate wine world, which she might not have left if she hadn't felt driven out.       </p><p>\"If I worked in a nicer industry, I never would have started my own company,\" she said.       </p><p>The reasons to make natural wines are primarily cultural for Dani Rozman of La Onda, in the Sierra Foothills. He wants to wean Americans from the notion that the American wine industry traces directly to modern Europe. Instead, he wants to focus on North and South America, and their centuries of shared grape-growing and winemaking history that began when Spanish missionaries planted the list\u00e1n prieto, or mission, grape in the Americas.       </p><p>Having worked with farmers in Chile gave him insight into alternatives to mainstream winemaking. \"All the equipment is developed to make winemaking easier, but that doesn't make it better,\" he said.       </p><p>Following their personal muses, these producers have all ended up outside conventional winemaking, and have gravitated to styles of farming without chemical fertilizers and sprays, while employing traditional, preindustrial production methods.       </p><p>Looming over all is the climate crisis, which in California has caused intense heat waves, drought and repeated threats of deadly, destructive fires. Over the course of filming, each of these producers was directly affected by the fires.       </p><p>While these winemakers do not say they work specifically to combat climate change, the film addresses the vast harm that conventional agriculture has exacted on ecosystems and the climate. It also holds out hope that, if the world could step away from chemical farming and focus on building soil health and other regenerative methods, agriculture could be an important part of the solution.       </p><p>Lori Miller, the producer and director of \"Living Wine,\" said she was drawn to these subjects because they work on the fringe.       </p><p>\"I love telling stories about people outside the normal corporate world, people who are not playing the game but are inspired from within,\" she said in a phone interview. \"This story fell within the mold.\"       </p><p>Though Ms. Miller, whose producer credits include \"They Came to Play\" and \"Shakespeare High,\" counts herself as a food and wine lover, she knew little about natural wine before beginning this project.       </p><p>Her brother, Ben Miller, and his family had moved into a new home outside of Santa Rosa, which came with a vineyard. They were dismayed to learn that the vineyard had been regularly sprayed with the herbicide glyphosate, which could have seeped into the well that supplied their household water. He was introduced to Mr. Trowbridge, who began the process of weaning the vineyard from chemical treatments.       </p><p>\"That was the impetus for learning more about this,\" Ms. Miller said. \"I started looking into the wines I was buying, and I had no idea.\"       </p><p>She said she tries to buy and cook only organic foods, and was shocked to learn that most of the wines she was drinking bore no relation to the foods she was buying.       </p><p>\"I had always assumed wine was a natural beverage,\" she said. \"But if you go to the grocery store and pull something off the shelf, the likelihood is it was farmed with chemical inputs or farmed in a way that was terrible for the environment.\"       </p><p>Ms. Miller imagines that those who watch the film might be very much like her, hyperconscious about where their food comes from but giving little thought to the wine. The first words in \"Living Wine\" come from Mr. Trowbridge:       </p><p>\"The natural wine movement is about 20 years behind the organic food movement,\" he said. \"You can't see the processing, but typically wine is a manufactured, machine-driven product. That means adjuncts to make it work in a timely manner.       </p><p>\"People just don't understand that,\" he continued. \"I didn't know that until I got a master's degree in winemaking.\"       </p><p>With the help of two proponents of regenerative agriculture, Elizabeth Candelario and Dr. Timothy LaSalle, the film traces the rise of chemical agriculture to the repurposing of closed munitions factories after World War II. Nitrogen that went into bombs was instead used to make fertilizer, while nerve gas became an ingredient in pesticides.       </p><p>With the support of the government and Big Agriculture, students and farmers were taught an industrialized form of agriculture to increase production. The industrial methods resulted in far more specialized farming rather than in the more natural, complex ecosystems of preindustrial farming, and built a dependency on Big Ag corporations.       </p><p>\"Nature only works in whole systems,\" Dr. LaSalle said. \"She can't work separated out. When you bring something in, it changes and causes unexpected consequences.\"       </p><p>The film never loses the thread between agriculture and wine, which in many people's minds is simply a product on a supermarket shelf.       </p><p>\"Every form of agriculture is detrimental to the environment, on any scale, even a garden, but we try to minimize the footprint,\" Mr. Beinstock said.       </p><p>Their winemaking facilities are rustic, far from the wealthy tourist outposts in the popular imagination. They are designed for work, and the labor is difficult. The motivation is more personal expression than profit, yet choosing to work outside the mainstream is stressful in its own ways.       </p><p>\"I'm at a spot still where I've been on food stamps for a year and I still have other jobs,\" said Ms. Bell, of Margins Wines. \"Because I'm putting all my money into my business.\"       </p><p>She and Mr. Jelks, of Flor\u00e8z Wines, outfitted their utilitarian facility with secondhand equipment and castoffs. It's not ideal, and not easy, but it's liberating.       </p><p>\"We just stay scrappy and resilient, and we never stop,\" Mr. Jelks said.       </p><p>As for natural wines themselves, the film acknowledges that consumers may require time to adjust to them because of expectations that arise from years of drinking commonplace examples, just as a farm-raised tomato might prove shocking to one accustomed to glossy supermarket tomatoes.       </p><p>At a tasting contrasting conventional and natural chardonnays, one consumer described the conventional bottle as \"all the things you're programmed to expect in a chardonnay.\" The natural example was different, she said, but was \"probably a more true expression of what the actual grape is.\"       </p><p>Like a good natural wine, the film is not without some minor blemishes.

The Group also uses \"comparable\" data to measure organic growth. \"Comparable\" revenue refers to 2021 revenue adjusted as follows by:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0neutralizing the portion of revenue corresponding to entities divested in 2021;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0including the portion of revenue corresponding to entities acquired in 2022;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0remeasuring 2021 revenue at 2022 exchange rates.These adjustments give rise to comparative data at constant scope and exchange rates, which serve to measure organic growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring operating income</emphasis>The Group's operating income includes all revenues and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating performance as reflected in its recurring operating income. They include changes in Group structure, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\"Recurring operating income\" is therefore a major indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EBITDA</emphasis>The Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This financial indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free cash from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow</emphasis>The Group uses an intermediate line item, \"Free cash flow from operations\", to monitor its financial performance. This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).The Group has also defined an indicator, \"Available cash flow from operations\", in order to take into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest) pursuant to IFRS 16, and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.\"Available cash flow\" therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received, less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net debt</emphasis>Net debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items, including the impact of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effective tax rate on recurring income</emphasis>The effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to the effective tax rate excluding tax effects relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/de7782ec-3f5d-4674-aaca-6568d0c228f1\">Press release - 2022 Annual Results - 15 02 2023</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000782751en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67JM-38M1-F15W-N339-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3718\"/><timeReceived>07:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 15, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

On a reported basis, sales increased by +13.9%, benefiting from a positive forex impact of +4.9%, reflecting in particular the appreciation of the US dollar and various Asian and Latin American currencies against the euro.

Recurring operating margin stood at 12.2%, down-154 basis points (bps) compared to last year. This decrease was mainly driven by the strong negative impact of input-cost inflation net of productivity, estimated at c. -730 bps. This negative effect was partially offset by the positive effect of topline drivers - including volume, mix and price -\u00a0for a combined estimated impact of c. +570\u00a0bps.</p><p>Danone accelerated its reinvestment journey in the second half of 2022: reinvestments in A&amp;P, product superiority and capabilities had a negative effect of -105 bps in H2 2022, resulting in full-year impact of -58 bps in 2022.

Horizon Organic and Wallaby represent approximately 3% of Danone's global revenues and had a dilutive impact on Danone's like-for-like sales growth and recurring operating margin in 2022.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">February 6, 2023:</emphasis>Danone inaugurated its new Research and Innovation Center on the Paris-Saclay campus, dedicating a new space to develop the products of the future within its ecosystem. This research center will be dedicated to the development and innovation of Danone's fresh dairy, plant-based products and natural mineral water categories. It will include laboratories at the forefront of research and pilot production sites for innovation and limited production of specific prototypes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">V. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</emphasis></p><p>At its meeting on February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors closed statutory and consolidated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year. Regarding the audit process, the statutory auditors have substantially completed their examination of financial statements as of today.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VI. NEW FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STARTING FROM Q1 2023</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial disclosure</emphasis></p><p>As announced in January 18, 2023, Danone's external reporting will be adjusted to reflect the organizational changes. Starting from Q1 2023, the company will report its key indicators (net sales, like-for-like sales growth, recurring operating income and recurring operating margin) along four adjusted operating segments:</p><p>Europe, which will include Ukraine (was previously part of Rest of the World zone);China, North Asia, Oceania (unchanged);Americas, which will include the United States, Canada and Latin America;Rest of the World, which will include AMEA (Asia, Middle East including Turkey, Africa) and CIS.</p><p>The global category reporting remains unchanged, and Danone will continue to report performance, on both net sales and recurring operating income and margin, for EDP, Specialized Nutrition and Waters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Like-For-Like Definition</emphasis></p><p>Until Q4 2022, the definition of our like-for-like changes has been excluding, for both previous and current years, entities in countries that fall under hyperinflation according to IAS 29 during the previous year. As since January 1st, 2022 Turkey has been an hyperinflationary economy, as for Argentinian entities since January 1, 2019, we believe the total of Net sales and Operating margin in hyperinflationary economies has become material and as a result, we are announcing that we are adopting a new definition of the like-for-like changes regarding countries in hyperinflation according to IAS 29.</p><p>From Q1 2023 onwards, all countries with hyperinflationary economies will be included in our like-for-like changes. In order to limit the distorting effect of hyperinflation, net sales growth in excess of around 26% per year (a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger hyperinflation as defined by IFRS rules) will be excluded from our like-for-like net sales growth calculation in hyperinflationary economies.</p><p>We believe this new definition better reflects our performance while excluding from our like-for-like performance distortion of hyperinflationary economies beyond the abovementioned cap. This also allows our definition of like-for-like changes to be more in line with peer group companies.</p><p>Illustrative breakdown by quarter and full year of 2022 like-for-like net sales change with the new LFL methodology:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">VII. IFRS STANDARDS AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IAS 29: impact on reported data</emphasis></p><p>All necessary conditions have been reached (including 3-year cumulative rate of inflation for consumer prices exceeding the 100% threshold reached during the first half 2022) to now consider Turkey as \"hyperinflationary\" as defined by IFRS rules and therefore that IAS 29 rule related to Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies becomes applicable to the country. Consequently, Danone applies IAS 29 in Turkey with an effective date of January 1st, 2022.</p><p>Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency, leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover, its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.</p><p>Breakdown by quarter of 2022 sales after application of IAS 29FY 2022 sales correspond to the addition of:</p><p>Q4 2022 reported sales;Q1, Q2 and Q3 2022 sales resulting from the application of IAS 29 until December 31, 2022, to sales of entities in hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until December 31, 2022, and translation into euros using the December 31, 2022, closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data).</p><p><sup>1</sup>Results from the application of IAS 29 until December 31, 2022, to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.<sup>2</sup>Results from the application of IAS 29 until December 31, 2022, to Q2 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.<sup>3</sup>Results from the application of IAS 29 until December 31, 2022, to Q3 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial indicators not defined in IFRS</emphasis></p><p>Due to rounding, the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported.

Other operating income and expenses comprise items that, because of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone's recurring activity and have limited predictive value, thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include:</p><p>capital gains and losses on disposals of fully consolidated companies;impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructurings or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to major crisis and major litigations;in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised) and IAS 27 (Revised) relating to business combinations, (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations, (ii) revaluation profit or loss accounted for following a loss of control, and (iii) changes in earn-outs relating to business combinations and subsequent to acquisition date.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring operating margin</emphasis>is defined as Recurring operating income over Sales ratio.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other non-recurring financial income and expense</emphasis>corresponds to financial income and expense items that, in view of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be considered as inherent to Danone's recurring financial management.

The Recurring net income excludes items that, because of their significant or unusual nature, cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone's recurring activity and have limited predictive value, thus distorting the assessment of its recurring performance and its evolution. Such non-recurring income and expenses correspond to Other operating income and expenses, Other non-recurring financial income and expenses, Non-recurring income tax, and Non-recurring income from associates.

Here's the dirt.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fashion, like politics, loves a buzzword - especially when it comes to the environment. Sustainability! Circularity! They just tripped off the tongue. And now there's a new favorite in town: regenerative.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In January, the luxury group Kering, owner of Gucci and Saint Laurent (among other brands), was a co-founder of the Regenerative Fund for Nature, aimed at converting one million hectares (2.47 million acres) of land producing raw materials for fashion from regular farmland to regenerative agriculture in five years.       </p><p>In February, the New Zealand Merino Company announced that it has joined with Allbirds, Icebreaker and Smartwool to create the first platform dedicated to regenerative wool.       </p><p>The North Face and Patagonia now tout clothing made of regenerative cotton. And Secteur 6, a new Indian-American brand that uses only regenerative-grown materials like rose-petal silk, is teaming up with the streetwear brand Freak City L.A. to produce a capsule collection that includes regenerative cotton graffiti T-shirts that read: \"Regenerate or Die.\"       </p><p>But what in the world does that even mean?       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Start at the beginning: What is regenerative farming?</emphasis></p><p>It's like yoga, but for farmland. Advocates describe it as a holistic approach, working with nature, rather than trying to control it. That means foregoing various industrial agriculture practices, which could include pesticides, store-bought fertilizers, tilling or neat little rows of a single crop. Also, no weed-pulling.       </p><p>Regenerative farmers love \"cover crops,\" weedy-looking plants like clover and hairy vetch - hairy vetch! - that help limit the real weeds and are eventually mowed and left to rot as mulch. (Ripping out cover crops or weeds by their roots disturbs micro-organisms under the surface, and the roots serve as food for the soil, anyway.)       </p><p>The idea is to mix different types of plants in the same field, allowing the nourishing cover crops to spread wildly, co-mingling with, say, corn or cotton. It looks messy, but chickens, sheep and cattle get to graze on the edibles, and in return they fertilize the fields with their droppings. Bingo: healthy soil.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, I thought organic farming was supposed to be the best kind of farming. What's the difference?</emphasis></p><p>Organic is about \"what you are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> spraying,\" said Rebecca Burgess, the director of Fibershed, a nonprofit in California that supports the regenerative farming movement. You can be an organic farmer and not be regenerative - you can skip the animals, skip the cover crops, and instead haul in compost each season.       </p><p>And you can be regenerative and not be organic. Bambi Semroc, the acting head for sustainable lands and waters at Conversation International, said that \"organic is one way of doing this, but there are others, too,\" like reducing the use of agrochemicals. Sometimes, she said, \"there aren't great alternatives.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what does this have to do with fashion?</emphasis></p><p>As James Carville might say: It's the origin materials, stupid. T-shirts and jeans are made of cotton grown in a field. Sweaters from wool sheared from sheep grazing on a field. Handbags crafted from the hides of cows raised on a farm. But what sort of farm?       </p><p>Industrial farming is a big contributor to climate change. Nitrogen fertilizers, which conventional farmers spread liberally on their fields, \"put out significant greenhouse gasses,\" such as carbon dioxide, Ms. Burgess said. To reach the goals set by the Paris Climate agreement - most notably that of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - farming must stop such pollution and reduce the carbon already in the air.       </p><p>The most effective approach is a process we all learned in elementary school: photosynthesis. Cover crops naturally capture, or \"sequester,\" the carbon in our atmosphere and store it, via their roots, in the earth. The carbon feeds the soil, as well as helps it retain water; in turn, plants grow better, and there is less soil erosion and drought (though scientists are still unsure about exactly how much carbon can be stored in the soil).       </p><p>Fashion is extremely late to the carbon sequestering party - the food industry was way ahead - but with multiple brands publicly promising to become carbon neutral, it is now firmly committed. Better late than never.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OK, I understand why brands might want the bragging rights, but what's in it for the farmers?</emphasis></p><p>It's true that transitioning from conventional to regenerative farming is expensive and time-consuming. Some brands, like Patagonia, prefer farmers to go organic first. Land is eligible for organic certification from a variety of official bodies three years after the last application of a prohibited material like chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Then the farmers can construct their new, regenerative system.       </p><p>The other crops they grow along with their main crop - perhaps pigeon peas, marigolds or turmeric - can provide an additional income source, but brands have realized it may not be enough incentive. That is partly why Kering established the Regenerative Fund for Nature, in conjunction with Conservation International, an environmental NGO in Arlington, Va. The fund, which is valued at 5 million euros ($6.1 million), will disperse grants to farmers and NGOs, and targets 17 countries and four raw materials regularly used in luxury fashion: cotton, wool, cashmere and leather.       </p><p>Patagonia is also supporting regenerative cotton farmers with a pilot program in India.

In 2016 only 11% of farm managers in the EU were young farmers under the age of 40 years, according to Eurostat.</p><p>One such pioneering female farmer is Cosmina Dinu, who has launched a sustainable poultry farm in Romania, thanks to one such virtual training programme.</p><p>The family farm, which Dinu runs with her husband, works to bring sustainable poultry to the market, while also accelerating the transition towards sustainable, regenerative agriculture in the country.</p><p>After participating in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eitfood.eu/projects/women-entrepreneurs-in-agrifood\">'Empowering Women in Agrifood'</url> (EWA), an educational programme offered by EIT Food tailored for female-specific challenges regarding entrepreneurship, Dinu has seen her project go from strength to strength.</p><p>\"The EWA programme has been extremely helpful in establishing our project,\" she said, highlighting the mentorship opportunities as the most valuable part of the programme.</p><p>\"It is extremely helpful for a fledgeling farmer to have direct, fast access to people with established businesses,\" she said. Notably, this link helped Dinu to appropriately set the prices of her products, having initially considerably underestimated their value.</p><p>As well as innovating at the farm level, Dinu has also harnessed the power of virtual sales platforms, which has enabled her to sell 85% of her products directly to the consumer.</p><p>\"These were made possible by establishing a modern sales platform, based on Facebook, which brings together consumers with several small producers and which has had a spectacular increase in the last three months, both in terms of membership number and the number of orders and their value.\"</p><p>\"I believe our biggest accomplishment so far has been to lead by example and show that it's not only possible to transition successfully to farming without having any practical experience, but that it can also be financially and professionally rewarding,\" she said.</p><p>She urged policymakers to support family farms as \"the only ones capable of producing good quality food, biodiversity and economic well being\".</p><p>Eva Mar\u00edn, president of the Spanish young farmers association (ASAJA), added that rural women, especially young rural women, need the support of institutions and society to encourage them to pursue careers in farming.</p><p>\"We need programs dedicated to us, as it is very useful to know the work that other women do on a daily basis and to be able to have spaces and meeting points to debate\".</p><p>However, for this to happen, the EU must work to ensure access to broadband in rural areas, she warned.</p><p>\"Giving women the opportunity to develop their agricultural activity is an act of equality,\" she stressed and added it is especially important in the context of the depopulation of rural areas.</p><p><emphasis

Ratios and variances are calculated based on underlying amounts, not rounded off amounts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Antoine Fievet, Chairman and Chief Executive Office of the Bel Group, said, \"I want to thank all of Bel's employees, who mobilized once again this quarter to fight the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences on our activities and their personal lives. The unprecedented growth that we reported in Q1 2020, buoyed by increased food purchases and stockpiling by consumers around the world, automatically led to a sales decline at the beginning of this year. While our business environment remains marked by uncertainty and significant disparities, we enter the second quarter with confidence in the strong economic rebound expected in key markets, such as North America and China, and the favorable impact on consumer spending from the Easter and Ramadan holidays.\"\u00a0</p><p>In Q1 2021, Bel generated consolidated sales of (EURO)840.2 million, down 7.5% on a published basis versus (EURO)908.8 million in the prior-year period. Unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations stemming primarily from the euro's rise against the U.S. dollar, adversely impacted sales by 4.3%, or (EURO)39.5 million. Organically, sales declined 3.6%, after adjusting for negative 0.4% impact from hyperinflation in Iran. Excluding the positive impact on Q1 2020 sales related to the Covid-19 pandemic, sales were up organically a slight 0.2% in Q1 2021.</p><p>The performance arose notably from an unfavorable comparison base with Q1 2020, when sales atypically spiked due to the global Covid-19 health crisis. At the beginning of 2020, sales advanced a hefty 11% organically, as lockdown measures spurred consumer spending on home food consumption around the world. Accordingly, sales automatically declined 3.6% organically year-on-year in Q1 2021. That decrease was partially offset by the excellent performance of the Boursin brand, which reported a 12.9% sales increase overall, buoyed by higher sales in France, Belgium and the United States.</p><p>The sales breakdown by market segment is as follows:</p><p>* New Territories encompass the business activities of MOM (Mont-Blanc, Materne), as well as markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and China.** Including adjustments for hyperinflation in Iran and excluding AIF (All in Foods).</p><p>Global Markets</p><p>The performance of global (mature) markets was marked by a slowdown in the global economy. Curfew and lockdown measures, once again mandated in many European countries, such as the U.K., Germany, Portugal, and France, negatively impacted consumer spending. In some markets like Germany, a strong competitive environment put downward pressure on prices. The sales volumes of snack products in North America and Japan similarly declined from recommended lockdown measures in those markets. Nevertheless, the underlying trend in consumer spending for all brands in the United States remains favorable. Lastly, the geopolitical and economic situation in Near and Middle East countries remains particularly volatile.</p><p>New Territories</p><p>The slight decline in sales from new territories stems from the unfavorable comparison base with an exceptionally strong Q1 2020.</p><p>** Including adjustments for hyperinflation in Iran and excluding AIF (All in Foods).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook for 2021</emphasis></p><p>Currency volatility and unfavorable raw material price trends were confirmed in Q1 2021, calling for renewed caution going forward. While the Covid-19 pandemic and the geopolitical and economic situation in the Near and Middle East still make for a lot of uncertainty, accelerated vaccination campaigns around the world and the progressive stabilization of the situation in certain Levant countries are positive signs. Lastly, Bel expects its Q2 2020 growth to be buoyed by a more favorable comparison base, accelerated promotional campaigns with several product innovation launches in the offing, the Easter and Ramadan holidays, and the particularly strong economic recoveries expected in key markets, such as the United States and China.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Bel reiterates its trust in the company's ability to strengthen its presence in the healthy snack market, while continuing to innovate and increase the appeal of its product offering in the three complementary markets of dairy, fruit and plant-based foods. In line with its model for engaged and responsible growth, Bel plans to continue lessening its environmental footprint and to contribute to promoting a new positive business model for the food industry, in sync with its company mission to champion healthier and responsible food for all.</p><p>In Q1 2021, Bel beefed up its policy for procuring renewable electricity at its plants to meet the company's Scope 1 and 2<sup>3</sup>carbon reduction goals by end 2021. At this writing, the supply of electricity to all dairy North American sites comes from renewable sources. Bel also launched a partnership between Bel Brands USA and Land O'Lakes to jointly lead a regenerative agriculture program key to contributing to the development of sustainable dairy industry. In addition, Bel successfully deployed a campaign to raise awareness about food waste alongside Too Good To Go in the U.K. and Spain, after rolling out similar campaigns in France in March 2020 and Portugal in December 2020. Bel intends to pursue these significant actions in the coming quarter, as part of its ambitious Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy.</p><p>On March 18, 2021, Bel Group and Lactalis Group entered into a Unilateral Promise to Purchase a business, including Royal Bel Leerdammer NL, Bel Italia, Bel Deutschland, the Leerdammer brand and all related rights plus Bel Shostka Ukraine, in exchange for 1,591,472 Bel shares held by Lactalis (23.16% equity stake). This transaction is in line with Bel's strategy to expand its activities beyond cheese products to strengthen its position as a major player in the healthy snack market.</p><p>The final agreements relating to the exchange transaction may be concluded after consultation with the employee representative bodies of some of the entities concerned. Completion of the transaction will be conditional on obtaining the required merger control approvals and is expected to take place before the end of summer 2021, in accordance with the indicative timetable announced.</p><p>Following said transaction completion, Bel plans to file a public share buyback tender offer (\"OPRA\")<sup>4</sup>at (EURO)440 per share<sup>5</sup>(cum dividend).</p><p>Furthermore, Bel has been notified of Unibel's intention to file a planned public share squeeze-out offer (\"OPR-RO\") with the AMF on any remaining Bel shares as soon as possible following the OPRA settlement-delivery date and at the same price per share as for the OPRA, that is to say (EURO)440 per share<sup>5</sup>(cum dividend). Completion of the OPR-RO is expected to take place before the end of 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Bel</emphasis></p><p>The Bel Group is a world leader in branded cheese and a major player in the healthy snack market.

The virus is also causing massive disruptions in the global economy and financial markets, amplified by a trade war on oil, which is already starting to cause economic hardship for people around the globe.</p><p>While we fully commend the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/coronavirus/news/meps-step-up-pressure-to-adopt-bolder-measures-against-coronavirus/\">European Institutions</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/the-brief-this-time-no-bazooka-is-too-big/\">ECB</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/coronavirus-european-investment-bank-to-mobilise-40bn-in-financing-1.4204968\">EIB</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/spain-unveils-unprecedented-e200-billion-coronavirus-package/\">member states</url> for their swift efforts to confront the immediate threat of the virus and direct well-needed capital to economic recovery, we call on EU heads of state to ensure that recovery plans do not undermine climate neutrality pathways and European Green deal objectives due to clear feedback loops that will impact future public health.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the planet is facing a deeper and longer-term crisis, rooted in a number of interconnected global challenges.</p><p>Recent research on the ecology of diseases suggests that climate change, biodiversity loss and deforestation are contributing drivers behind pandemics, interacting with high levels of global travel, trade and high-density living.</p><p>Outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, SARS, bird flu and now COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise and this is only the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-iceberg-is-our-destruction-of-nature-responsible-for-covid-19-aoe\">tip of the iceberg</url>.</p><p>Like COVID-19, climate change, biodiversity loss, and financial collapse do not observe national or even physical borders. These problems can be managed only through collective action that starts long before they become full-blown crises.</p><p>They must be acted upon not as singular threats but as a potential series of shocks and long-term risks to human health and livelihoods, economic prosperity and planetary stability as targeted by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/its-time-to-emerge-from-our-planetary-emergency/\">World Economic Forum</url> this year.</p><p>No one is underestimating the incredible disruption to the global economy and across society from COVID-19 nor the gravity of the situation for those who have lost or will lose loved ones, but what this pandemic has revealed is that overnight transformational change is possible. A different world, a different economy is suddenly dawning.</p><p>This is an unprecedented opportunity to move away from unmitigated growth at all costs and the old fossil fuel economy, and deliver a lasting balance between people, prosperity and our planetary boundaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green Deal should be Europe's new Marshall Plan</emphasis></p><p>In the midst of a global health emergency and imminent economic recession, the importance of the European Green Deal has become even greater. It <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">must</emphasis> be the framework for responding to the current crisis and the broader planetary emergency, of which it is a part.</p><p>As drafted, the European Green Deal already aspires to protect the health and well-being of citizens from environment-related risks and impacts and establish a toxic-free environment, deliver healthy and sustainable diets, and protect biodiversity.</p><p>The previous Commission's Juncker Plan was an effective tool to focus investment and minds on clear priorities for Europe.</p><p>The European Green Deal should do the same with a greater link between the converging tipping points of public health, climate change and biodiversity and ensure we re-direct perverse subsidies and private and public capital towards solutions that promote a just transition for resilient societies and economies.</p><p>This should be Europe's new Marshall Plan. A plan that fosters an integrated approach between the European Green Deal and an economy that works for people as prescribed by President Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>A plan that also addresses digital optimisation as a tool to enhance the long-term quality of life for all citizens not only when they are in a pandemic lockdown.</p><p>Rather than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/green-deal-facing-delays-due-to-coronavirus-eu-admits/\">delaying critical initiatives</url> such as the \"Farm to Fork\" and Biodiversity strategies, the EU institutions and its member states should address these strategies as future-proofing mechanisms.</p><p>For example, shifting from industrial to regenerative agriculture is feasible today and generates immediate economic and health benefits. Redirecting capital and subsidies to catalyse regenerative practices would allow us to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/can-regenerative-agriculture-reverse-climate-change-big-food-banking-it-n1072941\">sequester carbon</url> in the soil at a rate that is sufficient to reverse the climate crisis.</p><p>Moreover, doing so would turn a profit, enhance economic and environmental resilience, create jobs, protect biodiversity and improve wellbeing in both rural and urban communities.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/green-deal-facing-delays-due-to-coronavirus-eu-admits/\">Green Deal facing delays due to coronavirus, EU admits</url></h><p>The European Commission is having to re-order its priorities in the face of the coronavirus crisis, with \"non-essential\" initiatives like the biodiversity strategy and the farm-to-fork strategy likely to be delayed by several weeks, EURACTIV understands.</p><p>Luckily, there is a very strong business case for dealing systemically with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://clubofrome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PlanetaryEmergencyPlan_CoR-4.pdf\">planetary emergency</url> - the convergence of crises referred to above - and the health pandemic simultaneously.</p><p>For example, there is no good reason not to be phasing out fossil fuels and deploying renewable energy technologies, most of which are now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.energy-storage.news/news/lcoe-for-solar-plus-storage-already-below-2018-spot-prices-in-europe-study\">globally available</url> and already cheaper than fossil fuels in many cases.</p><p>With the recent oil-price plunge, perverse fossil-fuel subsidies can and should be eliminated, as the G7 and many European countries have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/g7-nations-pledge-to-end-fossil-fuel-subsidies-by-2025\">pledged</url> to do by 2025. These subsidies should be redirected to proper green and social infrastructure including well-needed health system upgrades.</p><p>At a time when we need to make sure we can guarantee a stable economy and create new jobs post COVID-19, the economic case for Green Deal solutions is also clear.</p><p>According to the New Climate Economy, more ambitious action to address climate change could deliver more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://newclimateeconomy.report/\">$26 trillion in net global economic benefits</url> between now and 2030 compared with business-as-usual, including the creation of more than 65 million new low-carbon jobs.</p><p>As humans we're resilient. We're entrepreneurial. We begin again. The future can be positive and we can learn from our failings. The European project is itself an inspiring example of that.</p><p>We therefore call upon European leaders to embrace this moment of reflection and upheaval to adopt economic recovery plans that create more resilient communities, greater health and wellbeing, and shared prosperity on a healthy planet so that we can truly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/its-time-to-emerge-from-our-planetary-emergency/\">emerge from this emergency</url> stronger and more resilient.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1444377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH1-H691-DYXB-V35M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1125\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 24, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>economic recovery plan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X0S</classCode><className>ECONOMIC RECOVERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

This number will increase to 2500 farms after two years.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Viable and replicable solutions will then be shared and scaled up within the full network of the alliance partners.\u00a0</p><p>The collaboration, launched last year, comes on the back of a growing recognition that dairy farmers need to change their production practices in order to meet consumer expectations and demands for sustainable production and address a range of environmental and health challenges associated with agriculture.</p><p>For instance, a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fairr.org/index/\">study</url> by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fairr.org/article/coller-fairr-protein-producer-index-2019/\">FAIRR Initiative</url>, a global investor network which aims to raise awareness about the risks and opportunities caused by intensive livestock production, concluded that the conditions under which meat, eggs and dairy products are produced for the global market are still \"catastrophic for the most part\", and contradict the United Nations' sustainable development goals.</p><h/><p>A group of concerned investors has examined the sustainability of the world's largest fattening farms and dairy factories that supply the global food industry. And the results aren't mouth-watering, EURACTIV Germany reports.</p><p>The EU's dairy sector is the second biggest agricultural sector in the bloc, representing more than 12% of total agricultural output.\u00a0</p><p>According to the European Commission's <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/eu-agricultural-outlook-2019-2030-societal-demands-driving-food-market-developments-combining-affordability-sustainability-and-convenience-2019-dec-10_en#moreinformation\">agricultural outlook for 2019-30</url>, published on 10 December 2019, demand for dairy products, especially for cheese, is expected to continue to rise, leading to even higher EU milk production for 2019-30.</p><p>Furthermore, a '<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nzo.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Factbook-Sustainable-dairy-in-Europe.pdf\">Fact Book</url>' produced as part of the three-year campaign 'sustainable dairy in Europe', launched by the European Milk Forum and co-financed by the Commission, found that current production of milk and production of meat linked with milk accounts for 4% of the global emissions and that, from this, the production of milk emits 2.9%.</p><p>In a recent interview with EURACTIV, Henri Moore, vice president of global responsibility at Corteva Agriscience, concurred, saying that milk production is a \"big issue\" in terms of its greenhouse gas footprint.</p><p>A recent European Parliamentary Research Service <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2018/630345/EPRS_BRI(2018)630345_EN.pdf\">report</url> therefore concluded that \"resilience and sustainability are keywords for the future of the sector\". It said this will be achieved with innovation as a way to reconcile the need for farmers to earn a decent living, consumer demand for affordable and quality dairy products, and environmental and animal health requirements.</p><p>However, this is a complex challenge which requires the support of the whole food chain.</p><p>With that in mind, Farming for Generations, spearheaded by global food industry leader Danone, draws on the expertise of leaders from the whole agricultural value chain.\u00a0</p><p>This includes animal health and welfare companies MSD Animal Health, Neogen and FutureCow; animal nutrition and health company DSM; crop nutrition leader Yara; crop science company Corteva Agriscience; and artificial intelligence agri-food start-up Connecterra. </p><p>Netherlands-based Wageningen University and Research, renowned for its food and food production research, will also be a research and advisory partner.\u00a0</p><p>Furthermore, farmers will be involved in each step of the way, ensuring that practices are viable and suited to local customs and geographic specificities.</p><h/><p>Together, the five largest meat and dairy corporations (JBS, Tyson, Cargill, Dairy Farmers of America and Fonterra) are already responsible for more annual greenhouse gas emissions than ExxonMobil, Shell or BP, a new study released on Wednesday (18 July) warns.</p><p>Commenting on this initiative, Yann Gael Rio, vice president of milk and farming at Danone, said that \"regenerative agriculture is a solution to many of the environmental and health challenges we face today\".\u00a0</p><p>He added that Farming for Generations \"brings together expertise along the whole agricultural value chain with the collective know-how of farmers to ensure any solutions and innovations are tried and tested on the ground, capable of delivering real impact at scale, and helping to build the sustainable food systems of tomorrow.\"\u00a0</p><p>During the interview with EURACTIV, Moore said this partnership is a good example of how agricultural companies from across the sector can work together to \"improve sustainability while also looking at ways to create value across the food chain\".</p><p>She said that all members of the consortium are offering up their most innovative solutions towards improving the sustainability of the dairy sector, including crop breeding and protection techniques and digital solutions to allow for closer monitoring.</p><p>For Corteva, this includes innovative products which fixes nitrogen in the soil and crop breeding techniques which improve the quality of silage for the cows. This silage is more easily digestible by the cows which not only improves their health but also means they produce less methane emissions, thus contributing less to climate change.</p><p>Moore added that this is a \"unique and interesting initiative\" and that she expects to see more of such collaborations in the future.</p><p>She also said this kind of collaboration can help farmers comply with the Green Deal and new sustainability requirements, and ultimately help to reward farmers for applying sustainable practices.</p><p>Asked about Corteva's expectations for the new Commission, Moore said Corteva wants an \"enabling policy environment for the things that we think we can bring to agriculture that help to meet sustainability goals.\"</p><p>She said this included an open approach which embraces new technologies and voiced hope there would be a \"more practical, reasonable and science-based approach to new technologies and innovation\", which will help to reduce the footprint of agriculture and enable farmers and consumers to reduce their environmental footprint through innovation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran

Its strategic priorities are straightforward. The Group and its Houses seek to achieve same-store revenue growth while ensuring the targeted and selective expansion of their retail networks. Kering aims to grow its Houses in a sustainable manner, enhance the exclusivity of their distribution and secure their profitable growth trajectories. The Group is also investing proactively to develop cross-business growth platforms in the areas of e-commerce, omnichannel distribution, logistics and technological infrastructure, digital expertise and innovative tools.</p><p>The 2020 public health crisis and subsequent economic disruption have had major consequences on consumption trends, tourism flows and global economic growth. Together with the whole luxury sector, the Group was profoundly impacted by the effects of the pandemic in the first six months of 2020. More favorable trends, which emerged in the second half of 2020, were confirmed in 2021. Although these trends remain conditioned by developments in the health situation and associated restrictions across countries, the luxury market witnesses a significant rebound, driven by consumer appetite for premium goods.</p><p>Kering is perfectly positioned to fully benefit from this upturn. The Group pursues the implementation of its strategy with determination and will continue to manage and allocate its resources to best support its operating performance, continue generating significant cash flow, and optimize its return on capital employed.</p><p>Thanks to its strong business and organizational model, along with its robust financial position, Kering is confident in its growth potential for the medium and long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">***</emphasis></p><p>At its February 16, 2022 meeting, Kering's Board of Directors, chaired by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, approved the consolidated financial statements for 2021.

The Group also uses \"comparable\" data to measure organic growth. \"Comparable\" revenue refers to 2020 revenue adjusted as follows by:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0neutralizing the portion of revenue corresponding to entities divested in 2020;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0including the portion of revenue corresponding to entities acquired in 2021;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0remeasuring 2020 revenue at 2021 exchange rates.These adjustments give rise to comparative data at constant scope and exchange rates, which serve to measure organic growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring operating income</emphasis>The Group's operating income includes all revenues and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating performance as reflected in its recurring operating income. They include changes in Group structure, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\"Recurring operating income\" is therefore a major indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EBITDA</emphasis>The Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This financial indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free cash from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow</emphasis>The Group uses an intermediate line item, \"Free cash flow from operations\", to monitor its financial performance. This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).The Group has also defined a new indicator, \"Available cash flow from operations\", in order to take into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest) pursuant to IFRS 16, and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.\"Available cash flow\" therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received, less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net debt</emphasis>Net debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items, including the impact of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effective tax rate on recurring income</emphasis>The effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to the effective tax rate excluding tax effects relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/6470c887-1850-4fbd-a224-96d011594567\">Press release - 2021 annual results 17 02 2022</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000605387en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64T6-NPB1-F15W-N1GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3431\"/><timeReceived>07:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 17, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's red, for one thing. Sunny days, sweaty nights and poolside tables are the regular haunts of ros\u00e9s and whites.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've always resisted the notion that seasons alone dictate what's best to drink. It's the food at least as much as the weather.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The weather influences the weight and heft of what we cook and the sorts of ingredients that are available. The heavy stews and casseroles of winter give way to glorious salads and food cooked outdoors over coals. Even in the summer, certain dishes call out for reds, and the one I often want now is Chianti Classico.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Partly this is because I have a crush on the sangiovese grape, the crucial constituent of the wine. Sangiovese in its Chianti Classico form is a great match for steak, burgers, sausages and even grilled chicken. It has the depth to match their flavors, with enough acidity to refresh. And it takes nicely to a light chill - say, 20 minutes in the fridge or an ice bucket.       </p><p>Other Italian wines are based on sangiovese, including Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, which, like Chianti, are from Tuscany. It's a popular grape in Emilia-Romagna to the north and in the Marche to the east.       </p><p>But as much as I like these other wines, right now I'm obsessed with Chianti Classico. I find a lightness, purity and eloquence to the wines that in my mind sets them apart from other sangiovese wines.       </p><p>Recently, shopping online in New York City, I picked out a dozen Chianti Classicos that will be great this summer, or for the next few years at least. Let me be more precise: I found 10 Chianti Classicos and two bottles that are Chianti Classicos in every way but name, their producers having chosen not to use the appellation for personal or historical reasons.       </p><p>Chianti Classico is the historic heart of a larger Chianti region in the hilly area between Florence and Siena. Outside of the Chianti Classico area other wines can be labeled plain Chianti or, if they come from within seven subzones they can append a local designation. Those include: Chianti R\u00f9fina, Chianti Colline Pisane, Chianti Colli Senesi, Chianti Colli Aretini, Chianti Colli Fiorentini, Chianti Montespertoli and Chianti Montalbano.       </p><p>Those wines can be good, but in my experience few have the finesse or beauty of Chianti Classicos.       </p><p>Even within the Chianti Classico category, different wines can offer very different expressions. Some can be almost achingly ethereal while others are richer and more substantial.       </p><p>Some may be structured and tannic enough to wait a few years before drinking. Others are easygoing and ready to drink upon release. The best are fine and transparently express their origins, often with sweet, earthy and bitter flavors of cherries and flowers.       </p><p>Long gone are the days in the 1960s when the local wine authorities mandated a maximum of 70 percent sangiovese in Chiantis and required that white grapes be blended in. Nowadays, Chianti Classico must be 80 percent to 100 percent sangiovese, with the rest made up of local grapes like canaiolo, colorino or malvasia nera; international grapes like merlot, cabernet sauvignon and syrah; or a combination.       </p><p>With rare exceptions, sangiovese works best with the local grapes. Too often, the international grapes insert a discordant note - the chocolate of merlot, for example, that can seem out of tune. Yet one of my recommended bottles does have some merlot in its blend, and I was not able to notice it.       </p><p>What accounts for the differences in the wines? The region is a complicated jumble of soils, vineyards, elevations and microclimates, which can make wines grown in neighboring towns remarkably dissimilar. The differing intentions of the farmers and winemakers is also a crucial factor.       </p><p>Chianti Classico is divided into eight subzones (it used to be nine, but in 2019 Barberino Val d'Elsa and Tavarnelle Val di Pesa merged and is now referred to as Barberino Tavarnelle), and a debate has long raged whether to permit producers to use these subzones on their labels. Proponents argue it will help consumers gain a sense of the character of a wine, while opponents say the variables are too many and that geographical divisions are too simple.       </p><p>It's possible both sides are correct. But I believe more information is better, and I have certainly noticed some correlation between subzones and styles. The wines from Radda in Chianti, for example, seem to be elegant, with great finesse, while those from Castelnuovo Berardenga are often richer and weightier.       </p><p>The other five subzones are Greve in Chianti, San Casciano in Val di Pesa, Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti and Poggibonsi.       </p><p>Chianti Classico comes in three levels: Chianti Classico, which requires 12 months of aging before release, Chianti Classico Riserva, which requires 24 months of aging and Gran Selezione, which can only be made from estate-owned grapes and requires 30 months of aging.       </p><p>I have focused on the straightforward Chianti Classicos, often referred to informally as \"normales\" to distinguish them from the riservas and gran seleziones. I find that the normales are the least likely to be burdened with the aromas and tannins of new oak barrels and offer an immediate, unmediated purity. Wines in the other categories can be wonderful, but may require a lot more aging before realizing their potential. They are also a lot more expensive.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Dozen Bottles From Tuscany</emphasis></p><p>Here are my 12 suggestions, in order of price. Many more excellent Chianti Classicos are out there, which for one reason or another I did not find. They include Caparsa, Castellinuzza e Piuca, Monte Bernardi, Isole e Olena, Lecci e Brocchi and Castell'in Villa.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Candialle</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Chianti Classico La Misse di Candialle 2017 $24</emphasis></p><p>Josephin and Jarkko Peranen, a German-Finnish couple who own Candialle, practice regenerative agriculture at their small estate near Greve. La Misse di Candialle is 90 percent sangiovese, with 5 percent each of canaiolo and malvasia nera, fermented and aged in concrete vats. This lovely wine has spicy, peppery flavors of red cherries and flowers, with firm tannins that will soften with a few years aging.

Yet it is bigger and rounder than the Istine, with firmer tannins and earthy, stony flavors of ripe red fruits. Many variables could account for the differences, but significantly, the F\u00e8lsina vineyards are at a lower altitude in the Castelnuovo Berardenga area.

While her wines qualify as Chianti Classicos, she stopped using the appellation a decade ago, rejecting the bureaucratic details required. Regardless, her wines are pure, bright, fresh and juicy, with bracing acidity and lingering flavors of red fruit and flowers. They are almost entirely sangiovese, with tiny amounts of mammolo and foglia tonda, a rarely seen local grape, in the mix.

Its reasons are more historical, though. In the 1970s, Montevertine decided it could make better wines without following the blending rules that then governed the region. In rebellion, it stopped using the appellation. Chianti Classico has come a long way since, changing its rules to accommodate wines like Montevertine. But Montevertine persists in its independence. This superb wine, 90 percent sangiovese and 5 percent each of canaiolo and colorino, is rich yet tapered and precise, beautifully balanced and elegant, with stony flavors of red fruit and flowers. It will gain complexity and nuance with aging.

The Group's strategy is focused on achieving same-store revenue growth while ensuring the targeted and selective expansion of the store network in order to sustainably grow its Houses, strengthen the exclusivity of their distribution and consolidate their profitability profiles. The Group is also proactively investing to develop cross-business growth platforms in the areas of e-commerce, omni-channel distribution, logistics and technological infrastructure, expertise, and innovative digital tools.</p><p>The health and subsequent economic crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have had major consequences on consumption trends, tourism flows and global economic growth. Along with the luxury sector, the Group was deeply impacted by the effects of the pandemic on its customers and its business operations, primarily in the first six months of the year. More favorable trends emerged in the second half, although these remain closely linked to developments in the health situation and associated restrictions across countries and regions.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Kering has taken all necessary measures to adapt its cost base, limit the decline in its profitability and preserve its cash flow generation, while maintaining the expenditure and investments required to protect its Houses' market positions and ensure their potential to bounce back. Kering also continues to resolutely pursue its strategy and will continue to manage and allocate its resources in order to support its operating performance, maintain high cash flow generation and optimize return on capital employed.</p><p>Thanks to its strong business model and structure, along with its robust financial position, Kering remains confident in its growth potential for the medium and long term. \u00a0While the current environment remains subject to a number of uncertainties, the crisis has not called into question the structural growth drivers of the worldwide luxury market, fully validating the pertinence of Kering's strategy and enabling the Group to emerge stronger from the crisis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">***</emphasis></p><p>At its meeting on February 16, 2021, the Board of Directors, under the chairmanship of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault, approved the consolidated financial statements for 2020.

The Group also uses \"comparable\" data to measure organic growth. \"Comparable\" revenue refers to 2019 revenue adjusted as follows by:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 neutralizing the portion of revenue corresponding to entities divested in 2019;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 including the portion of revenue corresponding to entities acquired in 2020;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 remeasuring 2019 revenue at 2020 exchange rates.These adjustments give rise to comparative data at constant scope and exchange rates, which serve to measure organic growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring operating income</emphasis>The Group's operating income includes all revenues and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating performance as reflected in its recurring operating income. They include changes in Group structure, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\"Recurring operating income\" is therefore a major indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EBITDA</emphasis>The Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This financial indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free cash from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow</emphasis>The Group uses an intermediate line item, \"Free cash flow from operations\", to monitor its financial performance. This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net operating investments (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).The Group has also defined a new indicator, \"Available cash flow from operations\", in order to take into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest) pursuant to IFRS 16, and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.\"Available cash flow\" therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received, less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net debt</emphasis>Net debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

As a New Yorker who has spent most of my life living in Manhattan, wine had provided me a connection to nature that I most likely would never have experienced otherwise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've thought about this a lot over the last few weeks, as the pandemic has now been with us for more than four months. Most of that time, I've been in my apartment, far away from vineyards, much less anything that might reasonably be construed as wild and natural, like a forest or ocean. I feel the difference, physically and emotionally.</p><p>My friend professed surprise at my answer. He'd assumed that I would cite the wonderful, otherwise inaccessible wines I had been able to drink, or maybe the many intriguing personalities in the wine world with whom I've spent time.</p><p>These, of course, have been wonderful benefits as well. If I were not representing readers of The New York Times, I would never have had an opportunity, to drink, say, great old wine made from grapes harvested in 1846, or to try 16 vintages of Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild going all the way back to 1868.</p><p>I also know that my understanding of wine would not be nearly as rich without having had the opportunity to spend time with people as diverse as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fillastre, a little-known Bordeaux vigneron; Paul Draper, the longtime guiding force of Ridge Vineyards; Bartolo Mascarello, a tireless defender of ancestral Barolo practices; Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Heredia, an equally stalwart proponent of traditional Rioja, and so many others.</p><p>But nothing in wine has affected me so profoundly as observing the intimate relationship that enlightened farmers have with the land that they tend. What I've learned from them has shaped my outlook in many important facets of my life, from the foods and wines I buy to the clothes I wear to how I think about climate change and political issues.</p><p>It's also made clear to me how little we know about the natural world, particularly the complex and intricate links that govern the well-being of a healthy ecosystem, from the network of microbial life in the soil to the diversity of plant life to the importance of animal life all the way up to the apex predator.</p><p>Taking away any one link in this complicated chain can have devastating consequences - to the soil, the air or even the flavor of the wine in your glass. Even something as seemingly mundane as putting up a fence, which might impede animal pathways or divert the natural flow of water, can have ripple effects far beyond anything intended.</p><p>I would not have grasped any of these connections had I not spent time walking the land with people like Deirdre Heekin of La Garagista in Vermont; Mimi Casteel of Hope Well in Oregon; Andy Brennan, who makes ciders in the Catskills; Steve Matthiasson in Napa Valley or Arianna Occhipinti in the Vittoria region of Sicily.</p><p>I come to none of this naturally. I was born in the suburbs to city people. My father, who grew up in Brooklyn, never left the city until a classmate at New York University one summer invited him to visit his family's house upstate.</p><p>There, the classmate showed him their property, including a vegetable garden. As my father liked to tell it, his friend reached down and pulled up a carrot and proudly displayed it.</p><p>\"From the dirt?\" exclaimed my father, whose sidewalk-and-streets upbringing had not prepared him for such a sight.</p><p>I, at least, had the opportunity as a child to go to a camp, to hike and swim and learn how to gather wood and build a fire. But as an adult, I have never hunted or fished. I love to hike, but not overnight. I prefer running water and clean sheets to tents and sleeping bags.</p><p>Still, nature has touched me through wine. Perhaps it's an example of biophilia, a notion popularized by the biologist Edward O. Wilson, who posited that humans possess an innate love of nature.</p><p>I can't say if it is true, but I am desperate to smell the earth and air in a naturally farmed vineyard, to walk in a forest or stumble barefoot through a stream.</p><p>I owe my consciousness of this yearning to wine. If it had not been for wine, I would not have been able to distinguish between the dirt my father perceived and living soil, which teems with unseen life, playing a crucial, symbiotic role in ensuring the healthiness and well-being of plants, including grapevines.</p><p>I would not have known that you cannot assess the healthiness of a vineyard without looking at the ecosystem, of which the vineyard is a small part.</p><p>\"An object seen in isolation from the whole is not the real thing,\" the Japanese farmer Masanobu Fukuoka wrote in his seminal 1978 book \"The One-Straw Revolution,\" and I've come to see the simple truth in that insight.</p><p>Throughout the 20th century, the trend in agriculture - what we now call conventional agriculture - was isolation. Vast tracts of corn, soybeans, wheat and even grapes replaced the subsistence farms where a mixture of vegetables, fruits, grains and animals coexisted.</p><p>Such polycultures were threaded through with wild areas, where beneficial insects, birds and other animals lived. This, theoretically at least, fostered a healthy biological diversity in which pests and diseases were kept in check naturally rather than through artificial means.</p><p>The isolated monocultures that have come to dominate modern agriculture lack the sort of symbiotic relationships between species that keep ecosystems healthy. These man-made constructs have disrupted the natural order, which must be replaced with insecticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers and other modern crutches. A sturdy environment becomes fragile and must be continually propped up.</p><p>The effect of modern agriculture is felt throughout the food chain. Millions of animals grow in an unhealthy industrial environment and must be pre-emptively plied with antibiotics and other drugs to replace natural defenses.</p><p>Contemporary orchards are another example, as Mr. Brennan, the cider maker, detailed in his 2019 book, \"Uncultivated: Wild Apples, Real Cider and the Complicated Art of Making a Living.\" In an effort to maximize yields and minimize labor, humans have turned to dwarf trees and clonal rootstocks that cannot even stand up on their own, and survive only with intensive chemical spraying.</p><p>When you begin to examine the sources of your foods and wines, and you become aware of the compromises made almost entirely for commercial purposes, you begin to analyze more closely what exactly is in your glass and on your plate.</p><p>Many people understand with one bite the difference between a commercial tomato and one grown locally and sold at a farmers' market. We can easily taste the depth of flavor in a farm egg that is absent from commercial supermarket eggs. Why would anybody doubt that a wine produced carefully from conscientiously grown grapes would be superior to bottles of processed wine made from industrially farmed grapes?</p><p>If you've walked a chemically farmed vineyard, no matter how neatly it's manicured or how pretty the bordering roses might be, you cannot help but be horrified by the gray, lifeless soil underfoot. Contrast that with the bountiful vineyards of Ms. Casteel or Ms. Heekin, which are part of healthy ecosystems. They appeal to all the senses, from the sounds and sights of birds and insects to the smell of life to the soft give of the soil beneath your feet. You can certainly taste that sort of vineyard in the wine.</p><p>This is not to say that traditional practices are always best in agriculture. Advocates for regenerative agriculture, a way of farming that emphasizes building and supporting the organic matter that composes healthy soils, are dead set against age-old practices like plowing and tilling. These techniques not only disrupt the life of the soil, they say, but also release carbon to the atmosphere that otherwise could have been stored safely in the earth, mitigating climate change.</p><p>The aroma on a fall or winter day of old, discarded vines being burned, another traditional practice, can be pleasant, until you realize it's another disastrous release of carbon into the atmosphere.</p><p>It's easy to write about wine without any sort of awareness of nature. You can sit at a table tasting hundreds of wines, without a thought to where they came from, beyond a bottle.</p><p>Many people have argued that lots of great wines have been made from chemically farmed grapes, and that is true. But at what cost? And how much better might those wines have been if the source material had more depth, purity and complexity?</p><p>A connection with nature fosters idealism, romance and hope. It puts many people in touch with God, if your mind goes that way. In the interconnectedness of all things including a glass of wine, one can see either the astounding beauty of nature or the hand of the creator.</p><p>When you lose that connection to nature, all you see is a glass.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Food on Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007233823</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-CT21-DYR7-C014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000068</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N111332MM</classCode><className>GRAPE VINEYARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001843</classCode><className>WINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Growth was supported by continued momentum in retail sales, steady recovery of out-of-home channels, increased pricing and market share gains.Total reported sales increased by 2.2% to CHF 63.3 billion (9M-2020: CHF 61.9 billion). Foreign exchange reduced sales by 2.0%. Net divestitures reduced sales by 3.3%.Continued progress in portfolio management. On August 9, 2021, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Full-year guidance for 2021 updated:</emphasis>we expect full-year organic sales growth between 6% and 7%. The underlying trading operating profit margin is expected around 17.5%, reflecting initial time delays between input cost inflation and pricing, as well as the one-off integration costs related to the acquisition of The Bountiful Company's core brands. Beyond 2021, our mid-term outlook for continued moderate margin improvement remains unchanged. Underlying earnings per share in constant currency and capital efficiency are expected to increase this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Schneider, Nestl\u00e9 CEO, commented:</emphasis>\"We are pleased with Nestl\u00e9's strong organic growth in the nine months, driven by broad-based contributions from most geographies and categories. The relentless focus of our teams on local execution and agility enabled us to navigate input cost inflation and supply chain constraints. In the third quarter, we increased pricing in a responsible manner, while maintaining strong real internal growth. Investments in innovation, digitalization and sustainability further supported growth by enhancing the relevance and differentiation of our offerings.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 continues to take actions on sustainability. We recently laid out our plans to support a just transition to regenerative food systems, which will help achieve our climate targets as we work closely with farming communities around the world to improve soil health, restore water cycles and increase biodiversity for the long-term.\"</p><p>* 2020 figures restated following the disclosure of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nespresso as standalone segments from 2021 onwards (previously combined and presented in Other Businesses).</p><p>Group Sales</p><p>Organic growth reached 7.6%, with RIG of 6.0%. Pricing increased to 1.6%, accelerating to 2.1% in the third quarter.</p><p>Growth was broad-based across most geographies and categories. Organic growth reached 7.1% in developed markets, based mostly on RIG with positive pricing. Organic growth in emerging markets was 8.3%, with robust RIG and positive pricing.</p><p>By product category, the largest contributor to organic growth was coffee, fueled by strong momentum for the three main brands Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and Starbucks. Starbucks products posted 15.5% growth, with sales reaching CHF 2.2 billion across 79 markets. Purina PetCare saw double-digit growth, led by science-based and premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and Purina ONE, as well as veterinary products. Prepared dishes and cooking aids posted high single-digit growth, based on strong sales developments for Maggi, Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine. Vegetarian and plant-based food offerings saw double-digit growth, with continued expansion of the product range, led by Garden Gourmet. Dairy reported mid single-digit growth, based on sustained demand for fortified milks, coffee creamers and ice cream. Confectionery recorded high single-digit growth, supported by a strong sales development for KitKat. Sales in Nestl\u00e9 Health Science grew at a double-digit rate, reflecting strong demand for consumer care products particularly vitamins, minerals and supplements. Infant Nutrition posted negative growth, impacted by lower birth rates globally in the context of the pandemic and a sales decline in China. In the third quarter, growth in Infant Nutrition was positive outside of China. Water reported mid single-digit growth, with strong demand in North America and emerging markets in the third quarter.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 6.6%. E-commerce sales grew by 17.2%, reaching 14.1% of total Group sales, with strong momentum in most categories, particularly coffee, Purina PetCare and culinary. Organic growth in out-of-home channels was 22.8%, helped by the further easing of movement restrictions in some geographies.</p><p>Net divestitures decreased sales by 3.3%, largely related to the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Yinlu and Herta transactions. Divestitures were partially offset by acquisitions, including Freshly and the core brands of The Bountiful Company. The negative impact on sales from foreign exchange moderated to 2.0%. Total reported sales increased by 2.2% to CHF 63.3 billion.</p><p>Portfolio Management</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is transforming its global water business, sharpening its focus on international premium and mineral water brands and healthy hydration products. In March, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of Essentia Water, a premium functional water brand in the U.S., and the sale of its regional spring water brands, purified water business and beverage delivery service in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science continues to focus on building a nutrition and health powerhouse. On August 9, 2021, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company for USD 5.75 billion.

The company is taking action to halve its emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. Agriculture plays a critical role in achieving these climate targets as two thirds of Nestl\u00e9's greenhouse gas emissions stem from the production of food ingredients. In September 2021, Nestl\u00e9 announced that it will support and accelerate the transition to regenerative food systems - one that aims to protect and restore the environment, improve the livelihoods of farmers and enhance the well-being of farming communities.</p><p>Together with external partners, from farming communities, academia, civil societies and government, Nestl\u00e9 is piloting trials with more than 50 reference farms globally. The learnings from these trials will be adapted locally and scaled up.</p><p>Regeneration is fundamental to creating more resilient food systems. Regenerative farming practices aim to restore soil health, renew water cycles, increase biodiversity, and integrate livestock. These practices can also sequester carbon, which will contribute to achieving Nestl\u00e9's ambitious climate targets.</p><p>The transition to regenerative food systems will only succeed if it is socially and economically viable for all, which is why Nestl\u00e9 is putting farmers at the center of its efforts. The company will offer investment support to mitigate initial risks and pay premiums for raw materials produced using regenerative agriculture. This will reward farmers not only for the quantity and quality of ingredients, but also for the environmental benefits.</p><p>For technical assistance, Nestl\u00e9's vast network of experts and agronomists will deploy state-of-the art science to help farmers adopt regenerative practices. The company will also offer agricultural training and help farmers exchange information and best practices that can be adapted locally.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 expects to invest CHF 1.2 billion over the next five years to support the adoption of regenerative farming practices by its network of more than 500\u00a0000 farmers and 150\u00a0000 suppliers.</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Full-year guidance for 2021 updated:</emphasis>we expect full-year organic sales growth between 6% and 7%. The underlying trading operating profit margin is expected around 17.5%, reflecting initial time delays between input cost inflation and pricing, as well as the one-off integration costs related to the acquisition of The Bountiful Company's core brands. Beyond 2021, our mid-term outlook for continued moderate margin improvement remains unchanged. Underlying earnings per share in constant currency and capital efficiency are expected to increase this year.</p><p>Annex</p><p>Nine-month sales overview by operating segment</p><p>Nine-month sales overview by product</p><p>* 2020 figures restated following the disclosure of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nespresso as standalone segments from 2021 onwards (previously combined and presented in Other Businesses).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contacts:</emphasis>Media:Christoph Meier\u00a0\u00a0Tel.: +41 21 924 2200<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rELwCH9jw3HlcZb3xS0IQd15z6JurZ-UGdPPq990tDwPcqyN0mkZe-DjocOXnS3Zp_AYd6Qhdrg4EpA1NvHopeWekfPf5cdg-pYGjIKf4Axf4NSeusjLF5_zymfTrn5q\">mediarelations@nestle.com</url>Investors:Luca Borlini\u00a0\u00a0Tel.: +41 21 924 3509<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JDBkPyJxVQtZSv0YDZ9eKcRUmcPNUt7y3-hXh4-UFnFutWScdzOunK5ZogJhsTxI7KXTGuarkDgS1ynK1CBFMw==\">ir@nestle.com</url></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000553223en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63WM-1141-F15W-N3R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3474\"/><timeReceived>07:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 20, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Now officially embedding in its articles of association a purpose and social, societal and environmental objectives that reflect its conviction that the health of people and the preservation of the planet are interdependent, Danone is taking a new step in the pursuit of a model of sustainable value creation for all its stakeholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Progress towards these objectives will be overseen by an independent Mission Committee of ten members, whose names were announced at the Annual General Meeting; it is comprised of eight highly qualified experts mainly from international organizations (Sharan Burrow, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Pascal Lamy, Rose Marcario, Hiromichi Mizuno, David Nabarro, Gabriela Ilian Ramos, Rajiv Shah) as well as one independent Director (Guido Barilla) and one employee (Emna Lahmer). Their respective biographies are available in the appendix to this press release.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emmanuel Faber, Chairman and CEO, said</emphasis>:</p><p>\"At a time where companies are undisputably showing every day their contribution to society as a whole, and with the imperative of collective action, I am thrilled that all our shareholders decided that Danone would become today the first listed Entreprise \u00e0 Mission. I am convinced that the more our business demonstrates that it is working for all its stakeholders, the more it will create value and be recognized for that.</p><p>My sincere personal gratefulness goes to each of the members of the newly appointed Mission Committee for having accepted to bring their expertise to oversee and guide our company's progress towards its social, societal and environmental agenda. Never before has this been attempted at the scale at which we are going to do this together.</p><p>And finally and foremost a huge thank you to all our shareholders, including the dozens of thousands of my Danone colleagues, who are all also shareholders and voted today, as much as our individual shareholders and our largest institutional shareholders, together, for their unanimous support. You broke a taboo today. And your decision is already a precedent. We are humbled by your trust over the long term in our ambition to build the most attractive food and beverage platform of the space, as we strive to be ahead of our times to meet the expectations of our brands communities and users, civil society at large and the business challenges of this century\".</p><p>The shareholders' meeting, which was held exceptionnally in closed session given the current health context and to which 63.5% of Danone's total outstanding share capital was represented, has approved all other resolutions submitted to a vote.</p><p>Shareholders set the dividend for the 2019 fiscal year at (EURO)2.10 per share. The shares will go ex-dividend on July 14<sup>th</sup>and the dividend will be paid with effect from July 16<sup>th</sup>. \u00a0They also approved all proposed renewals of terms of office of the members of the Board of Directors for a three-year period: Gregg Engles, Ga\u00eblle Olivier, Isabelle Seillier, Jean-Michel Severino, and Lionel Zinsou-Derlin.</p><p>On this occasion, an update on the operational and financial situation of Danone to date was shared. After China at the beginning of the year followed by Europe and North America in March, some other countries have seen since April a deterioration in their health and economic situations, notably in Latin America, Indonesia and Africa, impacted by the closure of proximity stores and the lockdown of consumers. \u00a0In Europe and North America, sales are slowing down given the combined impact of the destocking of the pantry loading made at the end of the first quarter, notably in Specialized Nutrition, and the full effect on the second quarter of the closure of out-of-home channels where sales are down by around -50% and to which is particularly exposed the Waters business. Waters sales at company level are therefore expected to decline by around -30% in the second quarter.</p><p>The direct extra-costs incurred to ensure business continuity, estimated at around (EURO)100 million in the first semester (sanitary, industrial and logistics extra-costs directly linked with COVID-19 pandemic), will impact the recurring operating margin of the first semester. Actions to preserve cash continue and the two (EURO)800 million bonds issued in the semester at attractive rates have allowed to further strengthen the balance sheet and the liquidity position of the company. More information will be provided when first-half year results are published on July 30<sup>th</sup>, 2020.</p><p>Danone's medium and long-term outlook remains robust and the COVID-19 pandemic enhances the relevance of its health-focused categories, localized food supply chain and regenerative agriculture strategies. \u00a0</p><p>The presentation made during the AGM is available on Danone's corporate website (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pI4LyXHsqTq2gHA6GhgxG8L6yG5JIqH8tWD9hTu-vCBMnzub2DPKFbKy6R-phELWN43ueRQmOpBCS6WNh9Z1sQ==\">www.danone.com</url>) where an overview of the voting results and a video webcast of the full meeting will be available from tonight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Members of the Mission Committee</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guido BARILLA</emphasis>Mr. Guido Barilla is currently Chairman of the Board of Directors of Barilla where he had overseen the international expansion for several years.

The Group also uses \"comparable\" data to measure organic growth. \"Comparable\" revenue refers to 2020 revenue adjusted as follows by:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0neutralizing the portion of revenue corresponding to entities divested in 2020;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0including the portion of revenue corresponding to entities acquired in 2021;-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0remeasuring 2020 revenue at 2021 exchange rates.These adjustments give rise to comparative data at constant scope and exchange rates, which serve to measure organic growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring operating income</emphasis>The Group's operating income includes all revenues and expenses directly related to its activities, whether these revenues and expenses are recurring or arise from non-recurring decisions or transactions.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses consist of items that, by their nature, amount or frequency, could distort the assessment of the Group's operating performance as reflected in its recurring operating income. They include changes in Group structure, the impairment of goodwill and brands and, where material, of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, capital gains and losses on disposals of non-current assets, restructuring costs and disputes.\"Recurring operating income\" is therefore a major indicator for the Group, defined as the difference between operating income and other non-recurring operating income and expenses. This intermediate line item is intended to facilitate the understanding of the operating performance of the Group and its Houses and can therefore be used as a way to estimate recurring performance. This indicator is presented in a manner that is consistent and stable over the long term in order to ensure the continuity and relevance of financial information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EBITDA</emphasis>The Group uses EBITDA to monitor its operating performance. This financial indicator corresponds to recurring operating income plus net charges to depreciation, amortization and provisions on non-current operating assets recognized in recurring operating income.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free cash flow from operations, available cash flow from operations and available cash flow</emphasis>The Group uses an intermediate line item, \"Free cash flow from operations\", to monitor its financial performance. This financial indicator measures net operating cash flow less net Capex (defined as acquisitions and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets).The Group has also defined a new indicator, \"Available cash flow from operations\", in order to take into account capitalized fixed lease payments (repayments of principal and interest) pursuant to IFRS 16, and thereby reflect all of its operating cash flows.\"Available cash flow\" therefore corresponds to available cash flow from operations plus interest and dividends received, less interest paid and equivalent (excluding leases).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net debt</emphasis>Net debt is one of the Group's main financial indicators, and is defined as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, the cost of net debt corresponds to all financial income and expenses associated with these items, including the impact of derivative instruments used to hedge the fair value of borrowings. Borrowings include put options granted to minority interests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effective tax rate on recurring income</emphasis>The effective tax rate on recurring income corresponds to the effective tax rate excluding tax effects relating to other non-recurring operating income and expenses.</p><p>4 Recurring net income attributable to the Group: net income from continuing operations attributable to the Group, excluding non-recurring items.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/775985f5-9d48-4a6a-8219-eeefff419390\">Kering_Press release_First-half 2021 results_27 07 2021</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000518396en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637H-T211-F15W-N51K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3111\"/><timeReceived>05:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 27, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001943</classCode><className>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE &amp; REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000718</classCode><className>FINANCIAL RESULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001925</classCode><className>BUSINESS OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2YB</classCode><className>CASH FLOW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000656</classCode><className>EURO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000663</classCode><className>EXCHANGE RATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000656</classCode><className>EURO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000663</classCode><className>EXCHANGE RATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>PE000DS99</classCode><className>FRANCOIS-HENRI PINAULT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GR120</classCode><className>NORTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The sequential acceleration of our business quarter after quarter is evidence that we are in the right direction on sustainable profitable growth, while navigating multiple headwinds.</p><p>I am also excited that our 100,000 employees became shareholders at our AGM last year, and that our \u00ab One Person. One Voice. One share \u00bb program has entered into its second year resulting in 90,000 of our team members voicing their opinions for the company local and global strategy, and in 26 volunteers having a direct and structured dialogue with non executive Board members.</p><p>We end this five-year period of our Danone 2020 plan with a recurring EPS cumulative increase of 50% , a financial deleverage one year ahead of our plan, and a business that embraced the food revolution, leading on flexitarian proteins, organic food and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Yet we read the last 12 months as a shifting point in civil society, consumer, government, financial institutions attitudes and expectations towards the daunting climate and nature issues we are collectively facing. For Danone, as a company that has adopted One Planet. One Health. as a vision and as a business model, this is a strategic topic.</p><p>On that front, we are proud that we were able to reach the peak of our full scope carbon emissions last year, literally five years ahead of our 2015 plan, and that our efforts on regenerative agriculture have already resulted in a 9% carbon productivity in our farmers' fields over the last 2 years. This is critical to ensure the resilience of farms, sinking carbon in the soil, therefore reintroducing organic matter and fertility, and saving costs, pesticides, chemical intrants, and water at a critical climate juncture for agriculture.</p><p>Yet, we are convinced that there is an urgent and significant opportunity to put climate actions even more at the core of our business model, truly joining people's fight for climate and nature with the power of our brands.</p><p>To this effect, we announce a (EURO)2 billion climate acceleration plan today, which in the next three years will further transform our agriculture, energy and operations, packaging, and digital capabilities so that we will leverage fully our climate action to generate resilient growth models for our brands.</p><p>This is backing my confidence in the relevance of our investment plan in the next three years and in both our short term guidance and mid term objectives as we are setting the company on a unique path of deep alignment between its vision and execution.</p><p>We start this year under the uncertain clouds of the coronavirus. Our priority is on the health and safety of our employees, business partners, customers and the communities in which we operate, hand in hand with the work of authorities. I would like in particular to commend and deeply thank our teams in China for their incredible commitment to their mission serving relentlessly families, parents, babies and elderlies despite the difficult conditions. Let me express my support and empathy for the difficulties and challenges they face and my confidence that life will return to normal in China and beyond.\u575a\u5f3a, \u4e2d\u56fd\u00a0 Stay strong China.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I.

Danone further strengthened in 2019 its commitments through the signature of \"Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C\" pledge, a significant further step towards climate urgency.</p><p>Danone estimates that the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">peak of its carbon emissions on its full scope was reached by the end of December 2019</emphasis>(with a total of 27 million tons of GHG), five years ahead of its original plans and commitments (2025) and one year prior the 1.5\u00b0C Science-Based Targets commitment. Overall the company has reduced its GHG emission intensity by 24.8%<sup>(1</sup><sup>)</sup>on its full scope since 2015. \u00a0Danone was recognized on February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2020 as a global environmental leader, becoming one of only 6 companies, among 8,400 organizations assessed, with a 'triple A' score by CDP in recognition of its leading environmental efforts, namely in tackling climate change, fighting deforestation and protecting water cycles.</p><p><sup>(1</sup><sup>)</sup>The data is based on a constant consolidation scope and a constant methodology. The GreenHouse Gas protocol defines three scopes for carbon footprint assessment: Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions are all indirect emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Providing visibility into the cost of carbon emissions to earnings</emphasis></p><p>Danone has been a pioneer in discussing and setting carbon emission targets on its entire value chain more than ten years ago, and in including environmental targets in its management incentives. In light of the urgency for climate action and in line with its ambition to lead the way to create and share sustainable value, Danone is taking further steps, with the support of its Board of Directors, to better connect Environmental, Social, and Governance metrics and financial performance, starting with carbon.</p><p>Danone shows for the first time a 'carbon-adjusted' recurring EPS evolution that takes into account an estimated financial cost for the absolute GHG emissions on its entire value chain<sup>(1)</sup>. This 'carbon-adjusted' recurring EPS grew in 2019 at +12%, faster than the +8.3% recurring EPS growth reported by the company given the +9% carbon productivity delivered in 2019.</p><p>Going forward, as full scope carbon emissions peak was reached in 2019 and GHG emissions in absolute levels are set to decrease, Danone's 'carbon-adjusted' recurring EPS is set to grow faster than recurring EPS.</p><p>Taking into account positive and negative carbon externalities on the entire value chain in financial disclosure will help investors to make better investment decisions for the long-term and drive corporate to accelerate their transformation.</p><p>\u00a0<sup>(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</sup><sup>Carbon-adjusted recurring EPS is equal to the recurring EPS less an estimate financial cost for carbon / number of shares after dilution. The estimated financial cost for carbon is based on Danone's full scope (1, 2 and 3) carbon emissions of 27.2 mT for 2019 (26.3 mT for 2018) x a constant carbon cost estimate of 35(EURO)/ton, aligned with CDP disclosure. Scopes 1 and 2 emissions result from activities under the operational control of Danone assets (production, sites, warehouses, etc.) while Scope 3 emissions refer to Danone's indirect emissions resulting from its value chain, upstream and downstream.</sup></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investment to accelerate climate action of our brands and strengthen our growth model</emphasis></p><p>In a context of shifting point in attitudes and expectations towards climate and nature issues and growing industry disruption, Danone is stepping up the speed and increase the depth of its transformation actions to put climate further at the core of its growth model, building truly recognized activist brands, moving from purpose to bold actions.</p><p>This will translate into an accelerated investment plan of around (EURO)2bn cumulative over the 2020-2022 period on brands, climate and agriculture, packaging and digitalization with the objective to build the most attractive business platform in the food industry, with greater recognition from consumers for climate-proofing actions, and create a virtuous cycle that fuels a superior growth model and unlocks value further and faster.</p><p>The accelerated investment will support new bold commitments to advance some of the Company's Goals for 2030, including:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sustaining current high level of innovation</emphasis>, with increased resources to enable more powerful activations and scaled distribution, building on the portfolio progress made to date;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Accelerating B Corp<sup>TM</sup>journey</emphasis>with Waters business expected to be certified as a B Corp<sup>TM</sup>by 2022.

To serve this ambition, evian and Volvic brands will act to offer, starting from April 2020, 100% rPET bottles: Volvic full range in Germany, all evian and Volvic small and XXL formats in France, and all evian on the go formats in the UK. In order to accelerate the elimination of single-use plastics, Danone will pursue its investments to innovate other packaging alternative to plastics (such as glass, cans, and paper) and rethink business models for hydration. Danone will also act to enhance the recyclability of Essential Dairy and Plant-Based cups, targeting zero polystyrene worldwide by 2025, and zero polystyrene in Europe by 2024, starting with Alpro brand by 2021. Those initiatives will be supported by the launch a dedicated fund to explore next generations of packaging materials and models.Climate, diets and agriculture: Danone will accelerate the carbon neutrality trajectory of its flagship Waters brands in Europe evian and Volvic to become fully carbon neutral in 2020 on all their ranges (full scope), by cutting emissions throughout the product life cycle as well as protecting, restoring and funding projects to sequester carbon in natural ecosystems. The company will also further invest to support regenerative agriculture and pivot large brands for preferred and climate-efficient sourcing.</p><p>Digital, end-to-end connected value chain: Danone will also invest in a 'data, tech and agile' enabled transformation, leveraging data and technology to strengthen execution, better serve people needs in a cost and climate-efficient way, to ultimately seize growth and efficiency opportunities.</p><p>This accelerated investment plan for 2020-2022 will include around (EURO)600 million of accelerated recurring costs behind brands, technology and capabilities (c. (EURO)200 million in 2020) as well as an accelerated capital expenditure plan of around (EURO)1bn. It will include on top material 'other income and expenses' dedicated to the transformation of our operations, notably in EDP. These 'other operating income and expenses' will, as usual, be determined and communicated in the course of the investment plan. We consider today they could amount to around (EURO)500 million costs in 2020. \u00a0</p><p>Danone is confident that those advanced commitments and accelerated investments behind its growth model will allow it to<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">deliver in the mid-term a consistent mid-to-high single digit recurring EPS growth</emphasis>with like-for-like sales growth to be in the 3% to 5% range. The accelerated transformation of the company will continue to be supported by very disciplined capital strategy, with a leverage Net Debt/EBITDA ratio that the company expects to maintain in the 2.5x-3.0x range.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">III. 2020 OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE</emphasis></p><p>Danone assumes that economic conditions in 2020 will remain particularly volatile and uncertain overall, including specific contextual difficulties in a few major markets including the CIS and Argentina, with an additional pressure on the world economy since the beginning of the year related to the COVID-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan in China last December.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For the year 2020, Danone is targeting a mid-single-digit growth of recurring EPS.</emphasis>This assumes a like-for-like sales growth between +2% and +4% (vs. +4% to +5% previously) and a recurring operating margin above 15% (vs. above 16% previously), reflecting both the strategic steps the company is taking from 2020 to transform the business for the long-term and unlock value further and faster, and the impact of external environment factors.</p><p>Full-year guidance factors include:- an assessment to date of the COVID-19 impact on(1) the company's sales and margin in the first quarter, which the company currently estimates at around (EURO)100 million lost sales, mostly in Waters China business, expecting to bring Q1 like-for-like sales growth broadly flat;(2) timing of Mizone's repositioning plan initially planned in March, putting at risk its summer season;(3) time to market of Early Life Nutrition innovations in China \u00a0</p><p>- a year-on-year mid-single digit rise in the cost of its strategic raw materials, although the impact of COVID-19 on commodities price in 2020 remains uncertain at this stage.\u00a0While we cannot currently predict the duration and extent of the impact of COVID-19, we remain extremely vigilant and are closely monitoring the situation every day, working hand in hand with the local authorities.</p><p>Danone is strong and resilient, and, confident in its strategy, will continue in this context to promote in 2020 strategic growth investments over short-term tactical allocations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IV.

JOSEPH, Minn. - Krewe, a restaurant in this small central-Minnesota city, is a tribute to Mary Mackbee, a former high school principal who raised four children in a Twin Cities suburb on the cooking of her native New Orleans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"More than anything, gumbo is the smell I remember,\" said Mateo Mackbee, one of those children and the chef and co-owner of Krewe. \"That's one you would get outside the front door.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Mackbee was in the dining room of Krewe, a window-lined restaurant in a new low-rise building in downtown St. Joseph, a community of 7,000 about 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis. His mother was there, too, sharing stories about her life and overseeing the jambalaya that Mr. Mackbee's 21-year-old son, Makel, was cooking for takeout service later that day.</p><p>Krewe's sign reads \"est. 1944,\" Ms. Mackbee's birth year, even though it opened in late May, four days after George Floyd was killed while in the custody of the Minneapolis police.</p><p>Mr. Mackbee, 47, and Erin Lucas, 27, his girlfriend and business partner, moved to central Minnesota from Minneapolis two years ago. They were driven by a shared desire to bring awareness of racial inequities to rural communities, and to find an alternative to the limited career options available to them in Minneapolis and St. Paul.</p><p>\"I had grown kind of weary of the restaurant scene in the Twin Cities, where it was hard for someone like myself,\" Mr. Mackbee said. \"I'm a little bit older and a little bit darker than most of the people on the line.\"</p><p>The partners began with a successful pop-up restaurant in New London, a small city in a neighboring county. They sank deeper roots this spring, when they also opened Flour &amp;amp; Flower, a bakery in a cottage-style building behind Krewe. Ms. Lucas is the bakery's chef.</p><p>On a sunny morning in mid-June, the line of customers waiting to buy her croissants, baguettes and pastries ran outside the bakery nearly to Krewe's back door. Both businesses are a short bicycle ride from the Lake Wobegon Trail.</p><p>St. Joseph, though home to the small liberal-arts College of Saint Benedict, is not a cradle of racial diversity. It's more than 90 percent white. Locals whose families have lived here for generations say Krewe is the city's first brick-and-mortar business owned by an African-American. And the community is in a part of Minnesota known for its divisive politics around immigration and race.</p><p>But St. Joseph offered Mr. Mackbee an opportunity for ownership that he hadn't received in the cities, despite his culinary degree and nearly a decade of experience in some of the area's most respected restaurants. He proudly points out that three members of Krewe's four-person kitchen staff are people of color.</p><p>\"We've flipped the scenario that I'm normally used to,\" he said.</p><p>Jon C. Petters, who owns the properties where Krewe and Flour &amp;amp; Flower are located, sold the couple hard on the potential of opening their businesses in St. Joseph. Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas were first wooed to central Minnesota by Mark Kopka, whom Mr. Mackbee met in 2015 in a bar in a Twin Cities suburb. Mr. Kopka is the pastor of Nordland Lutheran Church in Paynesville, which, like St. Joseph, is in Stearns County.</p><p>The men bonded over Mr. Mackbee's dream of starting a farm where he could bring students of color who didn't otherwise have access to nature - a goal the couple plan to realize in September through Model Citizen, the nonprofit group they created.</p><p>\"We talked about this larger vision to get kids connected to the land and to food,\" Mr. Kopka recalled. \"I said, 'Dude, come check out Paynesville.'\"</p><p>Mr. Kopka introduced Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas to locals who were hungry for an alternative to the chain restaurants that proliferate in this region of farmland, rolling prairie and lakes. But the chefs were welcomed for reasons that went beyond their culinary talent.</p><p>\"A lot of people who grew up here, they've never known a person of color,\" said Steve Peterson, 62, a retired General Mills executive from Paynesville who attends Mr. Kopka's church. \"There's something about these guys being here that helps.\"</p><p>Stearns County, while still about 85 percent white, is home to some of the largest immigrant communities in Minnesota. Agriculture and food-processing jobs in central Minnesota towns like Willmar (home to Jennie-O Turkey, in neighboring Kandiyohi County), and St. Cloud, the Stearns County seat, have drawn workers, particularly from East Africa and Latin America, for three decades.</p><p>The demographic changes have touched off a rise in nativist politics and xenophobia in Stearns and bordering counties. In 2017, a St. Cloud City Council member proposed a moratorium on new immigrants. The motion failed, but it attested to the open white resentment over immigration. The same year, a Willmar man was arrested after placing a pig's foot on the table of a farmers' market booth operated by young Somali Muslims.</p><p>Growing up in Stearns County, Emma Ditlevson, a 21-year-old Krewe line cook, overheard friends' parents as they criticized immigrants for failing to assimilate.</p><p>\"I don't think people here realize that it's a beautiful thing to represent a different culture in a community that doesn't have that much diversity,\" said Ms. Ditlevson, who was born in South Korea and adopted by a white couple. \"Instead of seeing the culture as something beautiful and something to embrace and something to understand more, they see it as something people should just give up.\"</p><p>Mr. Mackbee said St. Joseph doesn't feel far removed from the unrest and anger unleashed by Mr. Floyd's killing. The St. Cloud police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters three weeks after Mr. Floyd's death.</p><p>He and Ms. Lucas were drawn to the region in part for the opportunity to confront issues of racial injustice with Model Citizen, just on prairie land instead of pavement - an impulse that is as much a tribute to his mother's influence as Krewe's menu.</p><p>\"We're probably worse here, as far as racial tension,\" Mr. Mackbee said. \"I feel like my mom prepared me for coming out here and facing whatever comes my way.\"</p><p>Mr. Mackbee is soft-spoken, though blunt. Two years ago, he ran for City Council in New London. \"I came in third,\" he said.</p><p>Small-town life is not new to him. He attended college in rural Wisconsin on a soccer scholarship. While there, he recalled, he was asked to speak to a white student who had hung a noose over a Black student's dorm-room door.</p><p>\"They wanted me to be the one to tell this guy this was a bad thing,\" he said. \"I've been a token my entire life.\"</p><p>Krewe's opening would be notable even if it were in New Orleans, a majority-Black city where restaurants owned by African-Americans are still relatively rare. Equally unusual are restaurant chefs of Mr. Mackbee's training who learned to cook New Orleans cuisine at home - through recipes that descend directly from African-American home cooks of the Jim Crow era.</p><p>Mr. Mackbee has never worked in a New Orleans-style restaurant. And the food Ms. Mackbee cooked for her children in the 1980s and '90s was virtually untouched by the vagaries of contemporary restaurant trends. The first time she ate at a white-owned restaurant, she said, was on a visit to Commander's Palace, in New Orleans, in the mid-60s. She moved to the Twin Cities a few years later.</p><p>\"I never had a steak until I came up here,\" she said. \"I always thought steak was cooked with gravy.\"</p><p>Mr. Mackbee talks about his mother's 51-year career as an educator as much as he does about her cooking. Ms. Mackbee served 26 years as principal of Central High School, the state's oldest high school and the largest in its capital, St. Paul.</p><p>She retired in 2019, two years after one of her former students, Melvin Carter III, was elected St. Paul's first African-American mayor. Ms. Mackbee spoke at his inauguration, which was held at Central High.</p><p>\"She was one of those principals who never sat in her office,\" Mr. Mackbee said. \"She's broken her wrist and all that kind of stuff, breaking up fights at school.\"</p><p>Ms. Mackbee, 76, leaned into adversity while growing up in segregated New Orleans. Her civil-rights activism occasionally drew her away from Louisiana as a young adult.</p><p>She recalled knocking on the door of a Roman Catholic bishop in Mobile, Ala., in 1965. She was there to voice her displeasure with the bishop's removal of a priest who had provided shelter for her and other Black activists when they traveled to Selma to protest that summer.</p><p>Ms. Mackbee ended up taking her grievance to a higher authority. \"We wrote a letter to the pope,\" she said. \"Never heard from him.\"</p><p>She married Earsell Mackbee, a cornerback for the Minnesota Vikings, after moving to St. Paul in the late '60s to become the only Black teacher at a nearly all-white public school. After the couple divorced, Ms. Mackbee raised their four children alone in suburban Bloomington.</p><p>She cooked her family large pots of the dishes she had grown up eating in New Orleans, except that she used sausage where her mother, struggling to make ends meet, used hot dogs.</p><p>\"That was the economical way,\" Ms. Mackbee said. \"But I had a job, so I could afford some real sausage.\"</p><p>Mr. Mackbee cooked dinner for a group of friends at Krewe in mid-June, when the restaurant was open only for takeout. (It will begin dine-in service on Thursday.)</p><p>The gumbo, inspired by Ms. Mackbee's, is reminiscent of a style found in older, Creole restaurants in New Orleans: The broth is thin, stained by a light brown roux and loaded with shrimp and sausage.</p><p>A Midwestern twist came from the andouille sausage made by Johnsonville, a Wisconsin company famous for its bratwurst, and shrimp raised in aboveground pools by Paul Damhof on a former cattle farm outside Willmar. (\"Our Willmar water is some of the best water for raising shrimp,\" Mr. Damhof said.)</p><p>Similar ingredients enriched a spicy jambalaya Mr. Mackbee also learned from his mother. Instead of mixing the ingredients together as in a paella, the traditional method in southern Louisiana, the Mackbees' jambalaya is a savory sauce spooned over plain rice. \"The way I make it, you don't have to fish out the shrimp,\" Ms. Mackbee said of the idiosyncratic technique.</p><p>Matt Lindstrom, a friend of the chefs, sampled these dishes, along with red beans, barbecue shrimp and bread pudding, as New Orleans music played in Krewe's dining room. Mr. Lindstrom, 50, is a political-science professor at Saint John's University, a small liberal-arts college for men just outside St. Joseph that is closely affiliated with the all-woman College of Saint Benedict.</p><p>He struggled to explain his excitement over finding a place like Krewe in St. Joseph.</p><p>\"When I was a kid, it was a big deal to go to Applebee's,\" said Mr. Lindstrom, who grew up in Willmar. \"And you had to drive to St. Cloud for that.\"</p><p>In September, Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas hope to bring the first group of local students to the one-acre farm they are building with Mr. Kopka and other collaborators in Paynesville. It's based on a project the chefs tried out in New London.</p><p>\"One of the things we noticed is that all of these kids are literally surrounded by farmland,\" Mr. Mackbee said, \"but they literally don't have the opportunity to step onto it.\"</p><p>Ms. Lucas remembers how thrilled some young Somali students were by the sight of rhubarb, assuming it was tamarind. \"They were like, 'We haven't seen this since we were home,'\" Ms. Lucas said.</p><p>The new farm is near the north fork of the Crow River, on land donated to Model Citizen by the retired executive Mr. Peterson and his wife, Mary, through a partnership with Nordland church. Mr. Peterson spent his later years at General Mills trying to educate farmers on the virtues of regenerative agriculture, a sustainable farming practice that aims to improve the soil.</p><p>\"We see this farm as a model for the area,\" said Mr. Peterson, \"to encourage other young people to be entrepreneurs, and to do what's right for the land.\"</p><p>By year's end, Mr. Mackbee and Ms. Lucas plan to have a chicken coop, sheep and a wood-fired oven to cook for outdoor parties on the property. The ingredients will show up on their menus. And, ideally, the farm will enrich the community in other ways.</p><p>Standing outdoors on a windy afternoon last month, Mr. Mackbee looked toward a patch of forest at the edge of the still-unplowed farmland. \"I need to get the kids out here to see it and to smell it,\" he said.</p><p>His thoughts drifted toward a future when he can host children of color from the Twin Cities, like those his mother taught for so many years.</p><p>\"If we can just get them out here for a while, away from the stress,\" he said, \"maybe we can help give them what they need, to be what they want to be, and not what society says they are.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Food on Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007215746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609M-V1H1-JC85-N00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2182\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

This context brings with it increased expectations on companies to demonstrate their use to society, and for trusted brands to go beyond their normal ways of engaging with consumers. The Board reaffirmed under these circumstances the strong commitment of Danone to the sustainable shared value creation model that has driven its vision of business since it established its dual economic and social project for the first time in 1972. At the heart of this business model \u00a0lies the conviction that commitment to all stakeholders creates further value for all of them, including shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Board will therefore recommend at the AGM that:</p><p>-<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Danone becomes the first listed company to adopt the 'Entreprise \u00e0 Mission' model created by French law in 2019.</emphasis>\u00a0 This will embed the legal \"entreprise \u00e0 mission\" framework within its articles of association (including a purpose) and apply a new governance arrangement to oversee the progress of its environmental, social and societal goals. By doing so, Danone adds to the trajectory that inspired its largest subsidiary, Danone North America, to become the world's largest Public Benefit Corporation. It also propels Danone further down the path of achieving its ambition to become B Corp certified at global level.</p><p>-<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The proposed 2019 dividend is paid in line with the original recommendation</emphasis>((EURO)2.10 per share in cash), in light of Danone's business resilience, access to liquidity and balance sheet strength that also enabled the support given to the entire ecosystem of the company (employees, suppliers, farmers, and other business partners) since the start of COVID-19 pandemic. This amount is consistent with the Board's policy to remunerate shareholders with a reasonable and consistent dividend payout ratio. Assuming this proposal is approved at the General Meeting, the ex-dividend date will be July 14, 2020 and dividends will be payable on July 16, 2020. The company confirms that no share buyback operations will take place in 2020.</p><p>The Board of Directors also<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">accepted Mr Emmanuel Faber's proposal, in a spirit of solidarity, to reduce by 30% his fixed remuneration for the rest of year 2020 with effect from July 1st 2020</emphasis>and the Members of the Board of Directors decided to give up their entire compensation for the second half of 2020, in order to allocate the corresponding amounts to the financing of Dan'Cares<sup>1</sup>program in favor of the expansion of Danone employees' health coverage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emmanuel Faber, Chairman and CEO, said</emphasis>:</p><p>\"We are on the threshold of a time when what we mean by \"in the ordinary course of business\" will change forever. This is an extraordinary moment. Putting the DNA of Danone at the heart of our articles of association by becoming an Entreprise \u00e0 Mission may be a natural step for us. But it could not be timelier and more meaningful, as employees, consumers, customers, partners, governments and shareholders now see the critical importance of a balanced multi-stakeholder approach to value creation and sharing.</p><p>We made an unequivocal choice to protect our whole business ecosystem during the current entry phase into what will be a radically new operating environment, while we are witnessing sanitary scenarii unfolding, gradually assessing how they will impact the way people live and work, and before we then start our own preparation for long-term adaptation.</p><p>Our people have been our number one priority. We moved quickly to ensure their safety and took unprecedented measures to protect their incomes. We've also used our scale and our brands beyond the norm in how we have supported our ecosystem in radically new ways.</p><p>Obviously, we would not have been able to do this without the support of our shareholders; the people whose savings were invested in Danone with the confidence that our ambition is to lead the way to create and share value for all. So, similarly, their interests need also to be recognized. This is why our Board made the decision to maintain the initial recommendation for the 2019 dividend.</p><p>I am convinced that becoming an Entreprise \u00e0 Mission will meet our objective to serve, in a fair and transparent manner, everyone in our business ecosystem, and therefore create for Danone a consistent and efficient framework for how we will create resilient, and therefore sustainable, value in this new world.</p><p>It will obviously support our objective to be the first very large company to achieve, in five years, global B Corp status. Namely that all our businesses and brands are seen in the eyes of consumers, and of all Danone stakeholders, as serving society's and people's interests.</p><p>This too is an energizing opportunity to engage further with our shareholders about the fit between our integrated goals for 2030 and their more than ever increasing ESG agendas.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Update on Danone's key actions to protect its ecosystem in COVID-19 context</emphasis></p><p>Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, Danone's priority has been to maintain the availability of its daily food supply to consumers and protect the interests of its entire ecosystem through key actions on the ground. For its<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">employees</emphasis>, employment contracts have been secured and wages guaranteed for all Danone employees worldwide until June 30; extensive health and childcare coverage has been provided for all employees worldwide; and specific bonus have been paid to all employees working on site during the pandemic lockdowns. For its<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">trading partners</emphasis>, a financial support of c. (EURO)300 million has been made available. This includes (EURO)250 million of available cash flow for extended payment terms and credit to farmers, suppliers and smaller customers in its global ecosystem; a $10 million relief fund, dedicated to supporting the entrepreneurs of Danone Manifesto Ventures' portfolio; and a (EURO)20 million extra-fund in Danone Ecosystem Fund, supporting since 2009 the partners of Danone's ecosystems notably around employment, skills and employability and micro-entrepreneurship, with total donated funds now reaching more than (EURO)125 million. For the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">most vulnerable people</emphasis>, a total of (EURO)6m of funds and 32 million of products have been donated since the beginning of the crisis. These actions, were entirely funded with the company's cash flow and in order to ensure the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">authorities</emphasis>could first help the companies that needed it the most, the company ensured there was no delay in the payment of any social charges or taxes during this period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Danone to become the first listed 'Entreprise \u00e0 Mission' in France</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Framework for \"Entreprise \u00e0 Mission\" model in France</emphasis></p><p>Introduced in France in 2019 with the \"Pacte\" law, an \"entreprise \u00e0 mission\" company is defined as a company whose purpose, and whose objectives in the social, societal and environmental fields aligned with this purpose, are set out in its Articles of Association. It is not a new legal form. The aim is to ensure that the purpose of the company is fixed on long-term objectives which are described in the company's Articles (the Mission). The Articles specify the means by which the execution of the Mission will be monitored, under the control of a Mission Committee, which is distinct from the Board Committees and which must include at least one employee. An independent third party verifies the execution of the Mission, and establishes a written opinion which is annexed to the report of the Mission Committee to shareholders and made available on the internet site of the company for a period of 5 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A pioneer and natural step in Danone's 50-year journey of dual economic and social project</emphasis></p><p>The adoption of the \"entreprise \u00e0 mission\" status is a logical and natural step for Danone, which has had a mission for several years and for which the pursuit of a long-term vision enabling sustained, sustainable and resource-conscious value creation with and for all its stakeholders is anchored in the company's values.</p><p>The relevance of this new status reaches far beyond the confines of France because it legally enshrines, at the heart of the company, Danone's purpose which is applied globally.</p><p>Its purpose is consistent with Danone's mission defined in 2005 to \"bring health through food to as many people as possible\". Its social, societal and environmental objectives are consistent with the \"OnePlanet.

The progress towards the social, societal and environmental goals set for the Mission will be verified by an independent third party and overseen by a newly created Mission Committee, which will regroup about ten eminent and qualified global experts, including from non-governmental and international organizations, appointed by the Board of Directors. The Mission Committee will review and challenge the company's roadmap and progress particularly on subjects such as health &amp; nutrition, water, agriculture, biodiversity, packaging, social innovation, people and social matters.</p><p>This step is independent from but consistent with Danone's ambition to become certified B Corporation\u00ae, where a certification is provided by B Lab that goes beyond product certification as it measures a company's entire social and environmental performance and evaluates how operations, business model and governance impact workers, community, environment, and customers. To date, 20 subsidiaries of Danone have become B Corp Certified and more than one third of Danone's global business is already covered by B Corp<sup>TM</sup>certification, and an additional 15 subsidiaries are in the process of certification for 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Purpose in articles of association</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Purpose</emphasis>The purpose (raison d'\u00eatre) of the Company is to bring health through food to as many people as possible.

FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL-YEAR RESULTS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fourth quarter and full-year sales</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In 2020</emphasis>, consolidated sales stood at (EURO)23.6 bn, down -1.5% on a like-for-like basis, with stable volumes (-0.1%) anda -1.5% decrease in value reflecting negative category and country mix, especially in Waters and Specialized Nutrition. On a reported basis, sales were down -6.6%, mainly driven by the negative impact of exchange rates (-5.0%) that resulted from currencies devaluation against the Euro in the United States, Latin America, Indonesia and Russia. Reported sales were also impacted by a negative scope effect (-0.4%), resulting from the deconsolidation from April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019 of Earthbound Farm, and by a +0.3% organic contribution of Argentina to growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the fourth quarter,</emphasis>sales declined -1.4% on a like-for-like basis, showing a sequential improvement from the two previous quarters, with flat volumes. Reported sales were down -9.8%, mainly driven by a continued strong negative effect of -8.8% from exchange rates.</p><p><sup>1</sup>North America (Noram): United States and Canada</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q4 was still marked by a contrasted performance across channels</emphasis>After a sequential improvement in Q3, out-of-home channels sales declined by approximately -25% in Q4, penalized by new waves of restrictions and lockdown measures related to COVID-19, especially in Europe. Infant Formula sales in China from cross-border channels continued to contract sharply (c. -45%) given the ongoing Hong-Kong border closure and travel limitations with mainland China, but showed a sequential improvement compared to the previous quarter. On the other hand, Domestic sales of Infant Formula in China were back to growth in the quarter, at low-single-digit rate. The eCommerce channel continued to grow significantly, at approximately +45% in the quarter, with all categories contributing to growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In terms of regional dynamics, sequential improvement vs. Q3 was led by Rest of the World</emphasis>Like-for-like sales growth in Europe and North America was broadly in line with the previous quarter, moving from -1.1% to -1.0% in Q4. In Europe, good EDP performance and Specialized Nutrition sequential improvement offset the deterioration in Waters, while North America continued to see solid momentum. Like-for-like sales growth in the Rest of the World improved in Q4 from -4.1% to -1.9%, notably led by a better performance in China and another quarter of growth in CIS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring Operating Margin</emphasis></p><p>Danone's recurring operating income reached (EURO)3.3bn in 2020. Recurring operating margin stood at<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">14.0%</emphasis>, down -117 basis points (bps) on a reported basis and -150bps on a like-for-like basis. This includes a negative -62 bps effect from (EURO)150m incremental costs directly related to COVID-19 incurred during the year to keep employees safe and ensure business continuity. It also includes around -100bps of negative mix, mostly driven by negative category mix, with lower sales from Specialized Nutrition, Danone's most profitable business, and negative country mix, reflecting the slowdown of China. To mitigate these headwinds, Danone stepped-up its efforts on efficiency and cost discipline, especially in the second half of the year, allowing the company to deliver over 280bps of productivity in 2020 and unlock close to (EURO)850m of savings. In 2020, the Protein program delivered more than (EURO)300 million of incremental savings, bringing its total savings to (EURO)1.3 billion since 2017. Reported margin also reflects a positive effect from change in scope (+7bps) and currencies (+38bps), and a negative effect of -11bps reflecting Argentina's impact on margin.</p><p><sup>2</sup>North America (Noram): United States and Canada<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Performance by reporting entity</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0\u00a7<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESSENTIAL DAIRY AND PLANT-BASED (EDP)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Essential Dairy &amp; Plant-based</emphasis>posted net sales growth of +3.4% in 2020 on a like-for-like basis, sustained by both Essential Dairy, up low-single digit, and Plant-based that grew at +15% and reached (EURO)2.2bn of sales in 2020, up from (EURO)1.9bn in 2019. Recurring operating margin remained broadly stable above 10%, despite COVID-related costs.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the fourth quarter</emphasis>, net sales were up +3.6% on a like-for-like basis, reflecting a +3.7% increase in volume and -0.1 % in value. This growth was led by<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe</emphasis>and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">North America</emphasis>, that sustained their mid-single-digit performance. In North America growth was supported by Premium Dairy and Plant-based continued momentum. Yogurt and Coffee Creamers both grew in Retail channels, low-single digit and double-digit respectively, but continued to be penalized by their exposure to away-from-home channels. In Europe, Essential Dairy was back to low-single-digit growth in the quarter (+2%), with a broad-based contribution from all key brands, and Plant-based registered high-teens growth, with all geographies contributing. In the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rest of the World</emphasis>, CIS delivered another quarter of positive growth, with a balanced contribution from traditional and modern dairy brands, while Latin America and Africa continued to experience pressure from COVID-related restrictions.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a7<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SPECIALIZED NUTRITION</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Specialized Nutrition</emphasis>posted net sales growth of -0.9% in 2020 on a like-for-like basis and recurring operating margin decreased by -74bps to 24.5%, notably reflecting the negative country mix from Infant Nutrition in China, as well as COVID-related costs incurred this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the fourth quarter</emphasis>, sales declined -3.1% on a like-for-like basis, with a decrease of -1.7% in volume and -1.3% in value, sequentially improving from the third quarter (-5.7%) thanks to better trends across geographies.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In China</emphasis>, sales declined at mid-teens rate, after decreasing double-digit in Q3. While cross-border channels sequentially improved from last quarter, they were still severely penalized by ongoing Hong-Kong border closure and travel limitations with mainland China, declining by -45% in the fourth quarter compared to last year. On the other hand, Domestic channels were back to growth in the quarter, driven by the excellent performance of Aptamil that gained market shares and ranked leading brand of 11:11 during the quarter.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In Europe</emphasis>, infant milk and first diet performance slowly recovered but remained negative, penalized by continued soft category dynamics, while adult nutrition accelerated, notably driven by the first signs of normalization in hospital and prescription activity.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other regions</emphasis>delivered strong growth, sustained by market share gains in South East Asia and Latin America.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a7<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WATERS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Waters</emphasis>sales declined by -16.8% in 2020 on a like-for-like basis and recurring operating margin decreased to 7.0%. The performance of Waters was severely impacted by COVID-related restrictions to mobility that disrupted Danone's ability to serve consumers in out-of-home and impulse channels and ultimately translated in negative volume, product and format mix.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the fourth quarter</emphasis>, net sales were down -15.6% on a like-for-like basis, with a decrease in volume of -9.3% and -6.3% in value. The period was very volatile, marked by stop and go in restrictions across geographies.After a sequential improvement in the third quarter,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe</emphasis>performance was penalized by new waves of lockdowns and restrictions to mobility, notably in France, Germany and the UK. These channel-related headwinds were partially offset by market shares gains in these countries. In the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rest of the World</emphasis>, while Latin America and Indonesia kept declining at steep double-digit rate, in China, Mizone posted positive growth in the fourth quarter, an encouraging performance given mobility indices in China are still below pre-COVID levels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net income and Earnings per share</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other operating income and expense</emphasis>stood at -(EURO)519 million from -(EURO)609 million in the prior year, which included an exceptional loss from the sale of Earthbound Farm. They mostly include expenses related to some reorganization costs in the Essential Dairy and Plant-Based and Specialized Nutrition businesses. As a result, the reported operating margin was down -96 bps from 12.8% to 11.8%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net financial costs</emphasis>were down by (EURO)60 million to -(EURO)310 million, notably given the successful bond issues realized in the first semester at attractive rates and favorable currency effects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring income tax rate</emphasis>remained at 27.5%, in line with the prior year.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring net income from associates</emphasis>decreased from (EURO)98 million to (EURO)85 million, reflecting the deteriorated performance of Mengniu and Yashili in China, especially in the first semester.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recurring minority interests</emphasis>were down by (EURO)28 million, reflecting a deterioration of performance across minorities.</p><p>As a result,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ecurring EPS</emphasis>was (EURO)3.34, down -13% vs. last year, but Reported EPS increased by 1.2% to (EURO)2.99.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cash flow and Debt</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free cash flow</emphasis>reached (EURO)2,052 million in 2020, down from (EURO)2,510 million in 2019, implying a cash conversion rate of 8.7%. The decrease from last year has been driven by a deterioration of working capital due to negative channel mix as Danone's exposure to traditional channels in emerging markets is highly cash generative. Capex stood at (EURO)962 million in 2020, broadly stable compared to last year ((EURO)951 million in 2019).</p><p>As of December 31<sup>th</sup>2020,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Danone's net debt stood at (EURO)11.9bn</emphasis>, down (EURO)0.9bn. Net debt/EBITDA ratio remained stable at 2.8x.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dividend</emphasis></p><p>At the Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2021, Danone's Board of Directors will propose a dividend of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(EURO)1.94 per share,</emphasis>in cash, in respect of the 2020 fiscal year. In line with the Company's continued measured and balanced dividend policy, the dividend is down 8% from last year. This reflects on the one hand the impact of the deteriorated environment on 2020 results, and demonstrates on the other Danone's confidence in rapidly reconnecting with profitable growth, as reflected by the increased pay-out ratio to 58%. Assuming this proposal is approved, the ex-dividend data will be May 10, 2021 and the dividends will be payable on May 12, 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">II.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 SUSTAINABILITY FOOTPRINT</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Environmental footprint</emphasis></p><p>As part of its pledge towards carbon neutrality on its full value chain by 2050, Danone set intermediate greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for 2030 which were officially approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative in 2017.</p><p>On December 8<sup>th</sup>2020, for the second time in a row, Danone is one of the only 10 companies and the only food company out of the 5,800+ companies scored in 2020 that achieved a place on the A List for the three environmental areas covered by CDP of climate change, forests preservation and water security. The Company confirms that the peak of its carbon emissions on its full scope was reached in 2019, with 2020 GHG emissions totaling 26.1 million tons CO2 eq., down 1mT CO2 eq. as compared to 2019. Half of carbon reduction is linked to the implementation of regenerative agriculture initiatives within Danone supply-chain. The company also increased its share of electricity sourced from renewable sources, reaching 54.3% of total electricity purchased, above Danone's commitment of 50% at the end of 2020. Overall, Danone has reduced on a like-for-like basis its GHG emission intensity<sup>1</sup>by 24.5%<sup>2</sup>on its full scope since 2015.</p><p>Since last year, Danone has disclosed a 'carbon-adjusted' recurring EPS evolution that takes into account an estimated financial cost for the absolute GHG emissions on its entire value chain<sup>3</sup>. Given the business context and despite the emissions reduction achieved that contributed to the -4.1% decrease of the cost of carbon per share, the 'carbon-adjusted' recurring EPS decreased in 2020 by -19%, penalized by the decrease of -13% in recurring EPS.</p><p>Danone signed the \"Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C\" pledge in 2019 and is now partnering with the Science-Based Targets initiative to define pathways for the food &amp; beverages sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inclusive diversity and B Corp performance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inclusive Diversity:</emphasis>Danone is committed to promote greater diversity, with the following objectives that were to be reached by the end of 2020: to have 42% of female directors and 30% of female executives and to have 50% of our directors and 30% of our executives from under-represented nationalities<sup>4</sup>. These objectives have been achieved at the end of 2020 and even exceeded for one of them, as 32% of our executives are from under-represented nationalities.

Founded to meet the growing demand for plant-based products, Follow Your Heart holds leading positions in the plant-based cheese and mayonnaise categories, in addition to several other delicious plant-based products.</p><p>As part of the Danone family, Follow Your Heart will be able to accelerate growth nationally and internationally alongside some of Danone's best-known plant-based brands, including Alpro, Silk and So Delicious Dairy Free. This partnership will enable Danone to enhance and expand its plant-based offering, including cheese, while contributing to its goal of increasing plant-based sales worldwide from more than (EURO)2 billion in 2020 to (EURO)5 billion by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IV. 2021 OUTLOOK AND GUIDANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Danone expects a tough Q1</emphasis>driven by the tough base of comparison of Q1 last year and continued channel-related headwinds.</p><p>The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company anticipates to be back to growth in Q2, and to return to profitable growth in H2.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FY recurring operating margin is expected to be broadly in line with 2020</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">V. ADAPTATION PLAN UPDATE</emphasis></p><p>With its Q3 sales in October, Danone announced a new plan to restore shareholder value creation. This included a focus on investing for portfolio superiority and differentiation, as well as optimizing value across the value chain. The company also announced a move to reshape its organization onto a geographic structure which will create efficiencies, whilst adopting a \"Local First\" approach which should provide a lever for growth acceleration. The company is also conducting a full strategic review of the portfolio of SKUs, brands and assets, starting with a review of its strategic options for Argentina and its Vega brand.</p><p>On<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">November 23, 2020,</emphasis>Danone hosted an Investor update focused on providing additional details on how shifting to a local-first organization would unlock future growth and drive margin expansion in a post-COVID world. While reconfirming its mid-term ambition of achieving 3% to 5% profitable like-for-like revenue growth, Danone updated its mid-term recurring operating margin target to mid-to-high teen levels, with the first milestone to be above 15% in 2022, taking into account a new (EURO)1bn cost savings plan.</p><p>A second investor update is planned for 25 March 2021.

In this edition: A radical change of the food system, climate adaptation, dozing commerce secretary and World Heritage.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Monday was all about climate at the UN headquarter in New York, Tuesday (25 September) saw the opening of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit that will last until tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change is part of the SDGs while they are meant to address major humanitarian challenges such as reducing poverty, hunger, disease, or improve access to education. They define 17 priorities for socially equitable, environmentally secure, economically prosperous, inclusive and predictable development by 2030. They were adopted in September 2015 by the UN as part of the Agenda 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just like the fight against global warming, the implementation of the SDGs is lagging behind. In mid-2019, the various data collected at national level show that countries are still far from achieving this objective, including in the 20 richest countries in the world, the G20. The OECD stated in a report that \"advanced economies still have a lot of work to do to meet the SDGs,\" particularly on gender equality issues and reducing inequalities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not only national governments are expected to contribute to the SDGs - corporations, NGOs, investors, cities, and citizens are also expected to play a part.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Private sector.</emphasis> As it is, one of the major announcements made this Tuesday came from the corporate sector. French food giant Danone Chairman and CEO Emmanuel Faber called for a radical change of the food system as we know it and announced the launch of a new business coalition to do just that.</p><p>\"The food system that we built over the last century is at a dead-end. In essence, we thought that science could change the cycle of life and its rules. The resulting monocropping consequences are standing right in front of us now. We depend for 2/3 of our food on this planet on only nine plants today. And 40% of our lands are already degraded. In a nutshell, we have broken the cycle of life,\" he said.</p><p>In order to reinstore the lost biodiversity, Danone along with 20 of the largest food and other agri-based companies in the world, launched the One Planet Business for Biodiversity that will commit to put nature-based solutions \"at the heart\" of their strategies, processes and supplies.</p><p>The corporations have set out three priorities: shifting their practices towards regenerative agriculture in order to restore soil health, using the thousands or so brands they have in their portfolio to create a demand for a variety of crops, species and traditional seeds. The latter are \"forgotten today\" and are dying, Emmanuel Faber said. The third priority will address fighting deforestation and protecting wildlife and wild biodiversity. \"The total sales of this coalition today is about $500 billion, in 100 countries where we operate. It looks big, but it is not. It's only a start, we need many more partners,\" Danone's CEO said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate adaptation.</emphasis> Building on the momentum of the UN Climate Action Summit, the Global Commission on Adaptation is launching a Year of Action to accelerate and scale climate adaptation solutions. The Commission is led by Ban Ki-moon, 8th Secretary General of the United Nations, Bill Gates, Co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Kristalina Georgieva, CEO of the World Bank.</p><p>At an event at the UN headquarters, Commission leaders and partners launched eight\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://gca.org/global-commission-on-adaptation/action-tracks\">Action Tracks</url> that focus on the following areas: Finance and Investment, Food Security and Agriculture, Nature-Based Solutions, Water, Cities, Locally-Led Action, Infrastructure, and Preventing Disasters. More than 75 national governments, multilateral banks, civil society organisations and private sector actors have signed on to support and deliver on these initiatives. The Commission will champion this package at the Climate Adaptation Summit hosted by the Netherlands in October 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">European Commission.</emphasis> Neven Mimica, the EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, announced that the European Commission will mobilise (EURO)30 million to the UN joint fund for the 2030 agenda to help partner countries implement the SDGs. \"Last May, EU and ACP countries agreed to step up their cooperation. The future agreement that we are currently negotiating will set a new paradigm for development and the SDGs will be an integral part of it,\" he said.</p><p>Tackling US President Donald Trump, the EU Commissioner stressed that \"multilateralism is the only way forward to implement the Paris Agreement and SDGs such as inequality, climate change, peace security, and migration to name but a few. The summit is there to get back on track.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heads of states.</emphasis> Tuesday saw US president Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart Jair Bolsonaro address the UNAssembly, which they did not do the day before.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Trump.</emphasis> The US president has long defended the sovereignty of states against \"globalists\" and all forces that intend to exercise \"control\" over the sovereignty of peoples.\u00a0 For Trump, the main division in the world is between those who aspire to control, who believe they are destined to govern others, and those individuals and peoples who aspire only to govern themselves. He thus presented himself as the \"elected leader of a nation that aspires to freedom and self-government\".</p><p>Recalling that US Armed Forces are \"by far the most powerful in the world,\" Trump said he hoped his country would never have to use that power. But the US is fiercely defending the traditions and customs that have made Americans \"what we are,\" the President said, stressing that each country has \"a history that is dear to it, a culture, a heritage to defend and honour. \"Be proud of your country. If you want peace, love your nation,\" he said, making this theme a recurring part of his speech. For Mr. Trump, these foundations must be respected and should not be replaced. In his view, \"the future does not belong to globalists, it belongs to patriots, to sovereign, independent nations that protect their citizens and respect their neighbours\".</p><p>During Trump's speech, the Venezuelan delegation chose to read a book....</p><p>... while US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross seems to have taken a quick nap.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jair Messias Bolsonaro. </emphasis>The Brazilian President first \"thanked God for being alive\" before indicating that he represents a new Brazil that is being reborn from socialism and rebuilt on the basis of the aspirations of its people. \"Socialism has plunged my country into widespread corruption, a severe recession and criminalisation that has undermined the very foundations of the family,\" he said.</p><p>The Brazilian President announced that his government was ready to launch the process of accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"We are on track and have adopted best practices in all areas, including the environment,\" he said.</p><p>Commenting on the Amazon, which has been devastated by wildfires this year, Bolsonaro said his government was firmly committed to forest conservation. \"Brazil is one of the richest countries in the world in terms of biodiversity and mineral resources. Our forest is larger than Western Europe and remains almost intact because we are one of the most environmentally friendly countries in the world,\" he said.</p><p>\"We cannot say that Amazonia is a World Heritage Site,\" he warned, accusing some countries of simply reporting media lies and making disrespectful statements in a \"colonialist\" spirit that questioned Brazil's sovereignty. \"Thank you to the countries that refused to support the absurd proposal made at the G7 Summit in France. Thank you to Mr. Donald Trump, who reaffirmed the importance of respecting everyone's freedom,\" he said. Today 14% of Brazil's territory is dedicated to agriculture and indigenous peoples, he underlined. \"Let me be clear, Brazil is not going to increase this share.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emmanuel Macron</emphasis>. The French president said the international community had failed to meet the demands of the UN Secretary General at the Climate Action summit the day before. This is despite the clear science (\"never before has science been so advanced to help us formulate the answers\"), the extraordinary means at humanity's disposal (the world has an \"unparalleled\" capacity for innovation and an \"unprecedented awareness of contemporary ills\") and a multilateral framework in the form of the Paris Agreement, he said. \"So, what are we missing?\" asked the French leader. \"On reflection, I remembered a text that often accompanied me, the one Alexandre Solzhenitsyn wrote in 1978 at Harvard University: we lack the courage,\" he replied. \"The return of courage, the courage to know how to build peace and the courage of responsibility,\" he said. During his speech, he touched on the eradication of feminicide and called for effective action and a legal status while also insisting on the eradication of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria that \"is within reach\", he said. \"We can save 16 million lives in the next 3 years. We have three weeks to raise $14 billion.

A new climate narrative is emerging among farmers in the American heartland that transcends a lot of the old story lines of denial and cynicism, and offers an updated tale of climate hope.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recent polls show that 60 percent of Iowans, now facing flooding and erosion, believe global warming is happening. From Winneshiek County to Washington County, you can count more solar panels on barns than on urban roofs or in suburban parking lots. The state's first major solar farm is not in an urban area like Des Moines or Iowa City, but in rural Frytown, initiated by the Farmers Electric Cooperative.</p><p>In the meantime, any lingering traces of cynicism will vanish in the town of Crawfordsville, where children in the Waco school district will eventually turn on computers and study under lights powered 90 percent by solar energy. Inspired by local farmers, who now use solar energy to help power some of their operations, the district's move to solar energy will not only cut carbon emissions but also result in enough savings to keep open the town's once financially threatened school doors.</p><p>Wind turbines now line cornfields across the state, providing nearly 30 percent of Iowa's electricity production. With some $10 billion invested in wind energy and manufacturing in Iowa, Republicans and Democrats alike recognize the benefits of green jobs.</p><p>This is only a beginning, of course. Dirty coal still accounts for 60 percent of Iowa's electricity needs. But such centralization of electricity will falter, as other towns and cities follow the lead of Bloomfield, which recently announced plans to ramp up energy-efficiency efforts and shift its municipally owned utility - one of 136 in Iowa - to 100 percent energy independence, significantly through renewable sources by 2030.</p><p>But here's the catch: Even if every coal-fired plant shuts down, land misuse still accounts for an estimated 30 percent of the world's carbon emissions. The soils in the United States, like those of nations around the world, have lost calamitous amounts of carbon.</p><p>This is where Iowa's new climate narrative has emerged as a great story for the nation and other countries heading to Paris. Despite the fact that the United Nations General Assembly declared 2015 to be ''the international year of soils,'' a global soil carbon sequestration campaign - one that recognizes direct links between climate mitigation, regenerative agriculture and food security - rarely ranks at the top of any high level accords, or even conversations.</p><p>Far too few climate change negotiators took notice of an important proposal called the Four Per Thousand Initiative, which France's Ministry of Agriculture, Agrifood and Forestry introduced earlier this year. This proposal simply calls for a voluntary action plan to improve organic matter content and promote carbon sequestration in soil through a transition to agro-ecology, agro-forestry, conservation agriculture and landscape management. According to France's estimates, a ''.4 percent annual growth rate of the soil carbon stock would make it possible to stop the present increase in atmospheric CO2.''</p><p>To see the wisdom of such a proposal, you can visit the Versaland agroforestry farm in Johnson County, Iowa. In less than three years, a young farmer named Grant Schultz has planted more than 30,000 trees, introduced cover crops, composting and multispecies grazing, and transformed a once degraded industrial corn farm into a vibrant carbon capturing and storing ecosystem. Mr. Schultz is not alone; other farmers in Johnson County have joined a University of Iowa initiative to plant fields with perennial miscanthus grass, as part of a soil carbon sequestration and biomass program aimed at achieving 40 percent renewable energy consumption on campus by 2020.</p><p>In effect, Mr. Schultz and Versaland have completely shifted the climate change narrative in the heartland. Today's farmers can play a key role in climate solutions.</p><p>Iowa has arguably the most altered landscape in the United States, with its native prairies having been reduced by more than 99 percent over the decades. As in other industrialized farming regions, volatile cycles of flooding, drought and erosion increasingly threaten farm and food security.</p><p>According to a white paper released last spring by the pioneering Rodale Institute, which studies and promotes organic farming, if management of all current cropland worldwide shifted to a regenerative model similar to that of Versaland and other organic farming sites, more than 40 percent of annual carbon emissions could potentially be captured. What Mr. Schultz and other Iowan farmers are doing is not only groundbreaking; it's also giving the heartland a new future.</p><p>But such efforts are only a first step in what should be a global campaign. That begins by international negotiators' committing to binding measures that increase soil organic carbon stocks as a key part of any climate solution and deal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2070122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HF7-XVV1-DYR7-C39R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 23, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002MNV</classCode><className>FARMERS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE INC OF NEW MEXICO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001PMF</classCode><className>FARMERS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE INC (CHILLICOTHE MO)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00083A9</classCode><className>FARMERS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Initiative &amp;

I often echo the point made by the climate scientist James Hansen: The accumulation of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases - some of which will envelop the planet for hundreds and possibly thousands of years - is now trapping as much extra energy daily as 500,000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs would release every 24 hours.</p><p>This is the crisis we face.</p><p>Now we need to ask ourselves: Are we really helpless and unwilling to respond to the gravest threat faced by civilization? Is it time, as some have begun to counsel, to despair, surrender and focus on \"adapting\" to the progressive loss of the conditions that have supported the flourishing of humanity? Are we really moral cowards, easily manipulated into lethargic complacency by the huge continuing effort to deceive us into ignoring what we see with our own eyes?</p><p>More damage and losses are inevitable, no matter what we do, because carbon dioxide remains for so long in the atmosphere. So we will have to do our best to adapt to unwelcome changes. But we still retain the ability to avoid truly catastrophic, civilization-ending consequences if we act quickly.</p><p>This is our generation's life-or-death challenge. It is Thermopylae, Agincourt, Trafalgar, Lexington and Concord, Dunkirk, Pearl Harbor, the Battle of the Bulge, Midway and Sept. 11. At moments of such crisis, the United States and the world have to be mobilized, and before we can be mobilized, we have to be inspired to believe the battle can be won. Is it really too much to ask now that politicians summon the courage to do what most all of them already know is necessary? </p><p>We have the technology we need. That economic maxim about slow-fast phenomena, first articulated by the M.I.T. economist Rudiger Dornbusch and known as Dornbusch's Law, also explains the tsunami of technological and economic change that has given us tools to sharply reduce global warming pollution much faster than we thought was possible only a short time ago. For example, according to the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance, as recently as 2014 - a year before the Paris climate agreement was reached - electricity from solar and wind was cheaper than new coal and gas plants in probably 1 percent of the world. Today, only five years later, solar and wind provide the cheapest sources of new electricity in two-thirds of the world. Within five more years, these sources are expected to provide the cheapest new electricity in the entire world. And in 10 years, solar and wind electricity will be cheaper nearly everywhere than the electricity that existing fossil fuel plants will be able to provide.</p><p>This transition is already unfolding in the largest economies. Consider the progress made by the world's top four emitters of greenhouse gases. Last year, solar and wind represented 88 percent of the new electricity capacity installed in the 28 nations of the European Union, 65 percent in India, 53 percent in China and 49 percent in the United States. </p><p>This year, several American utilities have announced plans to close existing natural gas and coal generating plants - some with decades of useful life remaining - to replace their output with cheaper electricity from wind and solar farms connected to ever-cheaper battery storage. As the chief executive  of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company said recently, \"The surprise was how dramatically the renewables and storage proposals beat natural gas.\" He added, \"I couldn't have predicted this five years ago.\" </p><p>Today, the fastest-growing occupation in the United States is solar installer, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it has exceeded average job growth sixfold in the last five years. The second-fastest growing job: wind turbine service technician.</p><p>In Australia, a high-tech entrepreneur, Mike Cannon-Brookes, is reportedly planning to sell renewable electricity generated in the Northern Territories to South Asian cities over a long-distance undersea cable. Globally, close to 200 of the world's largest companies have announced commitments to use 100 percent renewable energy, and several have already reached that goal. A growing number of cities, states and provinces have pledged to do the same. </p><p> The number of electric vehicles on the road has increased by 450 percent in the past four years, and several automobile manufacturers are shifting research and development spending away from internal combustion vehicles, because the cost-reduction curve for E.V.s is expected to soon drop the cost of the vehicle well below comparable gasoline and diesel models'. Over half of all buses in the world will be electric within the next five years, a majority in China, according to some market experts. At least 16 nations have set targets to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles.</p><p>More broadly, the evidence now indicates that we are in the early stages of a sustainability revolution that will achieve the magnitude of the Industrial Revolution and the speed of the digital revolution, made possible by new digital tools. To pick one example, Google has reduced the amount of electricity required to cool its enormous server farms by 40 percent using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. No new hardware was required. Sustainable alternatives to existing methods of industrial production are being pursued by more and more companies.</p><p> A farmer-led regenerative agriculture revolution that is also underway avoids plowing and focuses on building soil health by sequestering carbon dioxide in the ground, making the land more fertile. The farmers are using rotational grazing and planting trees and diverse cover crops to enrich soil and protect against erosion. </p><p>And so far, the best available technology for pulling carbon dioxide from the air is something called a tree. That's why many nations are starting ambitious tree planting efforts. Ethiopia recently reported planting 353 million trees in 12 hours, nearly double the goal of 200 million. Scientists calculate that we have enough available land worldwide to plant between one trillion and one and a half trillion trees. To protect our vast but dwindling forests, new satellites and digital tools can now monitor deforestation virtually tree by tree, so corporations will know if the products they buy were grown on razed or burned forestland.</p><p>Yet for all this promise, here is another hard truth: All of these efforts together will not be enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently without significant policy changes. And right now, we don't have the right policies because the wrong policymakers are in charge. We need to end the mammoth taxpayer-funded subsidies that encourage the continued burning of fossil fuels. We need to place a direct or indirect price on carbon pollution to encourage the use of cheaper, sustainable alternatives that are already out there. New laws and regulations may be needed as well to encourage innovation and force more rapid reductions in emissions.</p><p>The political reconfiguration we have desperately needed has been excruciatingly slow in coming, but we now seem to be at an inflection point, when political change begins to unroll more rapidly than we thought was possible. It's Dornbusch's Law, brought to politics.</p><p>The people, in their true function as the sovereign power, are quickly understanding the truth of this crisis, and they are the ones who must act, especially because the president is not on speaking terms with the truth and seems well beyond the reach of reason. </p><p>This will require a ferocious attack on the complacency, complicity, duplicity and mendacity of those in Congress who have paid for their careers by surrendering their votes and judgment to powerful special interests that are sacrificing the planet for their greed. To address the climate crisis, we must address the democracy crisis so that the people themselves can reclaim control of their destiny.</p><p>As has often been the case in successful political revolutions, young people have taken up the gauntlet with inspiring passion. Greta Thunberg has stirred millions as the school strike movement she began in Sweden spreads to many countries. The Sunrise Movement, the Extinction Rebellion, Zero Hour and other youth-led movements are gathering momentum daily. On Friday, hundreds of thousands of people around the world were marching and gathering to call for action on climate change. Employees of many corporations are aggressively demanding that their employers take action to help save the climate balance.</p><p>The \"blue wave\" that gave Democrats control of the House in last year's midterm elections was fueled in part by concern about climate. The Green New Deal, introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, ties solutions to the climate crisis to environmental justice and a \"just transition\" that will create millions of well-paying jobs. This effort has won support from many Americans, just as the nuclear freeze movement of the early 1980s attracted wide approval and helped pave the way for an arms control agreement between President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of the Soviet Union. </p><p>Virtually all of this year's Democratic presidential candidates are making the climate a top priority. Many have released impressive and detailed plans that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. A CNN poll in April found that the climate crisis was the No. 1 concern of Democrats who are registered to vote. Another recent poll showed that a record 79 percent of American adults and 86 percent of teenagers believe, finally, that the climate crisis is caused by human activity, and, even more significantly, so do 60 percent of Republicans. Americans' disapproval of President Trump's approach to the climate was higher, at 67 percent, than on any other issue.</p><p>College Republicans at dozens of schools have called on the Republican National Committee to support a carbon tax and have loudly warned the party that it will forfeit support from younger voters if it does not. Another recent poll shows that 67 percent of millennial Republican voters say their party needs to do more on climate.</p><p>Next year's election is the crucial test of the nation's commitment to addressing this crisis, and it is worth remembering that on the day after the 2020 election, the terms of the Paris climate accord will permit the United States to withdraw from it. We cannot allow that to happen. Political will is a renewable resource and must be summoned in this fight. The American people are sovereign, and I am hopeful that they are preparing to issue a command on the climate to those who purport to represent them: \"Lead, follow, or get out of the way.\"</p><p>Al Gore shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for his work to slow global warming.

Nestl\u00e9 Pure Life in Egypt, Erikli in Turkey and La Vie in Vietnam grew at double-digit rates, supported by expansion in the sparkling and flavored segments.</p><p>Other Businesses</p><p>7.1% organic growth: 6.4% RIG; 0.7% pricing.Nespresso reported mid single-digit organic growth, with strong RIG and positive pricing.Nestl\u00e9 Health Science reached high single-digit organic growth based entirely on strong RIG.Nestl\u00e9 Skin Health posted high single-digit organic growth, with strong RIG and slightly positive pricing.</p><p>Organic growth of 7.1% was driven by strong RIG of 6.4% and pricing of 0.7%. Net acquisitions reduced sales by 7.3%, mainly due to the disposal of Gerber Life Insurance, which more than offset the consolidation of Atrium Innovations. Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.6%. Reported sales in Other Businesses decreased by 1.8% to CHF 8.7 billion.</p><p>Nespresso maintained solid mid single-digit organic growth. North America and emerging markets grew at strong double-digit rates. Europe maintained positive growth. The Vertuo system, now available in 21 markets, continued to generate strong consumer demand. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science grew at a mid single-digit pace with an acceleration to high single-digit in the third quarter. Medical nutrition and Atrium Innovations were the largest contributors. Nestl\u00e9 Skin Health grew at a high single-digit rate, with mid single-digit growth in the third quarter.</p><p>Distribution of cash to Nestl\u00e9 shareholders</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's Board of Directors has decided to distribute an amount of up to CHF 20 billion to Nestl\u00e9 shareholders over the period 2020 to 2022, while maintaining the company's longstanding sustainable dividend practice. The distribution reflects Nestl\u00e9's continued strong cash generation as well as significant cash inflows from disposals.</p><p>The distribution is expected to be primarily in the form of a share buyback program commencing in January 2020. The Board may consider distributing part of the total amount as one or more special dividends over the period 2020 to 2022. The volume of monthly share buybacks and the amount of potential special dividend payments will depend on market conditions.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's Board of Directors and executive management reiterate their preference for value-creating investments to expand the company's core food, beverage and nutritional health products business. Should any sizable acquisitions take place during this period, the amount of cash to be distributed to shareholders will be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Our business as a force for good: Working together to end deforestation</p><p>Forests are essential for the health of our planet: they help stabilize the climate, regulate ecosystems and host significant biodiversity. Nestl\u00e9 is dependent on healthy forests to ensure a sustainable supply of resources. The ongoing loss of forests, particularly in the biodiversity-rich tropical zone, demands urgent action.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Committed to having deforestation-free products.</emphasis>Over the past 10 years, Nestl\u00e9 has been leading the way in its efforts to end deforestation across its supply chain. The company has developed an integrated approach with a combination of certification, supply chain mapping, on-the-ground verification and satellite surveillance. As of April 2019, 77% of the key agricultural commodities Nestl\u00e9 buys, including soy and palm oil, were verified deforestation-free. That figure will surpass 90% by the end of 2020. Nestl\u00e9's efforts will not stop there. The company will continue to work with smallholder farmers and large suppliers alike to be close to 100% deforestation-free within the next three years. To this end, Nestl\u00e9 continues to act on three fronts:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Utilizing technology.</emphasis>Transparency builds trust and ensures accountability. Nestl\u00e9 has pioneered the deployment of technologies that make this possible. The company was the first in the food industry to utilize Starling, Airbus's satellite-based imagery system. This enables the real-time detection of deforestation. Nestl\u00e9 was also the first to make its supply chain transparent. The company discloses a list of direct suppliers, upstream locations and country of origins, as well as total volume sourced for key agricultural commodities.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting smallholder farmers.</emphasis>Experience shows that preventing deforestation requires engaging with smallholder farmers. In the case of palm oil, these farmers account for 40% of global production and frequently operate in areas near forests without conservation measures. Actions need to support livelihoods and sustain communities. To do this, Nestl\u00e9 provides technical assistance to almost 50\u00a0000 smallholder farmers. The company is scaling up initiatives to help them increase crop productivity and diversify incomes. The aim is to make forest conservation economically attractive, restore forestry stocks and promote regenerative agriculture, which help capture carbon from the atmosphere. This will be a key aspect in fulfilling Nestl\u00e9's ambition of zero net greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2050.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocating for disclosure.</emphasis>Nestl\u00e9 works to create sector-wide approaches, share know-how and bring solutions to scale. The company is an advocate for increased transparency, and harmonized disclosure and reporting at industry level. Addressing deforestation requires that all parties step up, be accountable and assume responsibility for forest stewardship.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 confirms its full-year guidance for 2019. We expect organic sales growth around 3.5% and the full-year underlying trading operating profit margin at or above 17.5%. Underlying earnings per share in constant currency and capital efficiency are expected to increase.</p><p>Annex</p><p>Nine-month sales overview by operating segment</p><p>Nine-month sales overview by product</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contacts:</emphasis>Media: Christoph Meier Tel.: +41 21 924 2200Investors: Luca Borlini Tel.: +41 21 924 3820</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000288399en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-2R01-F15W-N0X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2622\"/><timeReceived>07:29 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But these shifts demand more than strategic tweaks; they require visionary leadership capable of steering organisations through systemic change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At its core, regenerative leadership blends ecological, social, and economic value creation. For instance, a CEO might power operations with renewable energy (ecological), invest in green job training for local communities (social), and achieve profitability through reduced costs (economic). These leaders see beyond profits, acting as stewards of a better future.</p><h>Understanding a regenerative integrated approach</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The RIFT (<url normalizedValue=\"https://zenodo.org/records/11395759\">Regenerative Integrated Framework for Transformation</url> model is a strategic approach designed to guide businesses and leaders in transitioning from traditional, often unsustainable practices, to regenerative ones - practices that actively improve social, environmental, and economic systems. For example, instead of simply reducing waste, a business might adopt circular economy principles to repurpose waste into new products (environmental benefit), create jobs in local recycling facilities (social benefit), and cut material costs (economic benefit).</p><p>The model identifies systemic barriers such as organisational resistance, lack of collaboration across value chains, and limited stakeholder engagement that hinder the shift to regeneration. It addresses these by fostering regenerative business capabilities like innovation, closed-loop value systems, and proactive partnerships, while strengthening leadership to champion these changes. This practical framework equips businesses with the tools and processes needed to make regeneration actionable and impactful.</p><p>There are five leadership dimensions required for regeneration</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Consciousness: CEOs must understand their business's impact on interconnected ecological, social, and economic systems.

They don't just react; they lead, ensuring their organisations thrive amid shifting landscapes.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>A CEO-led regenerative transition</h><p>Consider the example of a mid-sized manufacturing company facing pressure to decarbonise. The CEO embraced the RIFT model, initiating an external audit to identify barriers to regenerative practices. Through visionary communication and engagement with employees and external stakeholders, the company shifted its value chain toward circularity and social inclusiveness. By proactively addressing environmental and social challenges, the CEO not only ensured compliance but also achieved competitive differentiation, increased employee satisfaction, and strengthened partnerships.</p><p>This success highlights the CEO's pivotal role as a key change agent, navigating complexity with resilience and a long-term focus. The result was a thriving organisation contributing positively to societal and ecological systems - a testament to the transformative power of regenerative leadership.</p><h>The call to action</h><p>Leadership plays a critical role in the successful transition toward regenerative business. By addressing the systemic barriers and fostering a culture of regeneration through specific leadership aspects, CEOs can guide their organisations toward a sustainable and thriving future. The journey to regeneration requires visionary leaders who are committed to making a positive impact on society and the environment, ensuring long-term business success and resilience.</p><p>The future needs leaders who do not merely respond to change but actively shape it. CEOs must evolve into regenerative leaders who balance profit with purpose and short-term targets with long-term resilience.</p><p>Through the five dimensions of CEO leadership - consciousness, hallmarks, engagement, morality, and preemptiveness - leaders can cultivate an organisational culture that aligns economic success with ecological and social regeneration. This journey requires courage, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to societal well-being.</p><p>As business ecosystems evolve, the CEOs who embrace regeneration will not only redefine success but also lead the charge toward a more equitable and sustainable world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was based on \"A practice-based approach for businesses and their CEOs to become regenerative,\" E.

La Banque europ\u00e9enne d'investissement (BEI) a ainsi investi 10,6 milliards d'euros en France en 2023, sous forme de financement de long terme accord\u00e9s directement ou non aux entreprises et aux collectivit\u00e9s territoriales. Sa filiale, le Fonds europ\u00e9en d'investissement (FEI), d\u00e9di\u00e9 aux petites et moyennes entreprises, a pour sa part investi 1,4 milliard d'euros dans l'Hexagone en 2023.

Using on chain e-money, Agreena and Ztlment are taking a first-ever position in the market, bullying out unregulated stablecoins or volatile cryptocurrency. Agreena says its Web3 solution has been developed to meet farmers' needs for instantaneous payments while retaining the credibility and security of a regulated payment system.<br/><br/>\"We see our new ability to use blockchain for issuing payments as a key to unlock the market for farmers to transition from conventional agriculture to carbon farming,\" says Simon Haldrup, CEO of Agreena. \"With agriculture responsible for approximately one-third of the global carbon footprint, the switch to regenerative farming practices creates one of the greatest opportunities for climate action in the world - we are here to enable that.\"<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions - but actually turns soils into carbon sinks, naturally removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it. But the most significant hurdle for thin-margin farmers to take up climate-friendly practices are the upfront costs associated with the transition. With virtually no incentives aside from the private sector to subsidize the change, Haldrup co-founded Agreena in 2019 to support farmers' entrance into the green economy by connecting them to the voluntary carbon market.<br/><br/>To deliver seamless and instant payments for farmers, Agreena partnered with the first regulated European payments institute built on blockchain, Ztlment. The two Danish fintech players have just successfully tokenized carbon credits on the world's most powerful and sustainable blockchain, Algorand, and have connected the payment for those tokens to real euros with smart contract software.<br/><br/>\"We set out to do away the complexity of blockchain and open banking regulation,\" says Mads Stolberg-Larsen, co-founder and CEO of Ztlment, who offer automated payment solutions that can move euros instantly and automatically on blockchain in full regulatory compliance. \"With Agreena, we have built one of the first examples where real-life assets on blockchain can be traded for real-life money.\"<br/><br/>The money gets on- and off chain via Ztlment's e-money partner, Monerium. Under existing open banking regulation e-money is just as much money as bank deposits and cash is. All three things are simply called \"funds.\"<br/><br/>\"Farmers don't need to know a thing about tokens or on-chain payments to see the reward we are bringing,\" says Haldrup, \"But nonetheless, this is a hallmark moment, not only for carbon farming but also for the blockchain community and people driving real-world use cases of Web3.\"<br/><br/>About Agreena<br/>Agreena is scaling regenerative agriculture through finance and technology. Founders Simon Haldrup, Ida Boesen, and Julie Koch Fahler developed one of the world's first internationally accredited soil carbon payment programmes, AgreenaCarbon, in 2021. The AgTech platform quantifies farmers' greenhouse gas emission baselines aligned to the latest United Nations IPCC guidelines, and monitors and reports GHG reductions and carbon removals. The company then mints third-party verified soil carbon certificates for farmers which can be sold on the voluntary carbon market. Since launching, Agreena has spanned its offering to farmers in 13 countries throughout Europe and recently acquired world-leading regenerative agriculture remote sensing company Hummingbird Technologies.
