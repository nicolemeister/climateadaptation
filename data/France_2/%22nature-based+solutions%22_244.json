The British consulting firm estimates that Auckland is the major city most able to effectively absorb torrential rainfall today, thanks to its numerous parks and water bodies.</p><p>One of the major threats of climate change is the increase in intense rainfall. But are large cities prepared for this? To answer this question, Arup set out to analyze the soil quality and terrain of seven major cities around the world: Auckland (New Zealand), London (England), Mumbai (India), Nairobi (Kenya), New York (USA), Shanghai (China) and Singapore.</p><p>As things stand, the New Zealand city appears to be the most capable of absorbing such heavy rainfall. Conversely, London is the least prepared in this line-up. Beyond this study, Arup hopes to make cities aware of the means that can be used to fight against these natural phenomena, which are more and more recurrent.</p><p>In each of these cities, a sample of 150 square km of terrain was studied in order to judge each one's capacity to adequately absorb heavy rainfall. In Auckland, half of the area studied was made up of green space (parks, gardens, etc.) and blue space (waterways, ponds, etc.), which allowed it to obtain the highest \"sponginess\" score. Note that Nairobi has even more green-blue areas, but the city's soil is less permeable than in Auckland. In comparison, Shanghai and London are much more \"concrete\" cities, especially in their centers. New York comes just ahead with the most permeable soil type of the cities studied, and also with many green spaces (other than Central Park). Overall, Auckland's urban center is rated as 35% \"spongy,\" ahead of Nairobi (34%), Singapore, Mumbai and New York (30%). Next are Shanghai (28%) and London (22%).</p><p>In the future, large cities will have to learn to deploy nature-based solutions rather than continue to focus on concrete urban centers. Even the most \"spongy\" cities must seek to improve and work with nature to provide maximum resilience.</p><p>Note that the term \"sponge city\" was coined in 2013 by Peking University professor, Kongjian Yu, to describe cities that work with nature to properly absorb rainwater, instead of using concrete to channel it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:652X-3X51-F19C-X2W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

To support a decarbonised electricity supply, the group plans to invest (EURO)210bn between 2021 and 2030 (up from a (EURO)190bn investment plan over the 2021-2030 period announced in November 2021), of which (EURO)170bn will be directly invested by the Enel group and (EURO)40bn through third parties. Around (EURO)160bn will be invested through the Ownership business model, mainly in countries with an integrated presence (Italy, Spain, Romania, the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru): (EURO)70bn will be invested in renewables to add 75\u00a0GW of new renewable capacity and 9\u00a0GW of storage capacity, to reach 129\u00a0GW of renewable capacity by 2030. Enel will also invest around (EURO)70bn in its infrastructure and networks)\u00a0and (EURO)10bn in equity injections and minority stakes acquisitions under its Stewardship business model. </p><p>Enel has also brought forward its net-zero commitment for both direct and indirect emissions by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, without resorting to any offsetting measures such as carbon removal technologies or nature-based solutions. The group plans to stop coal-fired power generation by 2027 and gas-fired power generation by 2040 thanks to new renewable and storage capacity. By 2040, all of its electricity sales should come from renewables. Moreover, Enel will exit its gas retail business by 2040.</p><p>In the short term, Enel plans to invest around (EURO)45bn over the 2022-2024 period (2022-2024 Strategic Plan), including (EURO)19bn into renewables to add 23\u00a0GW of renewable capacity between 2021 and 2024, raise the share of emission-free production to 77% in 2024 and cut CO2 emissions by more than 35% over the 3-year period.

There are similar situations across the continent, with the extreme and erratic weather patterns greatly impacting agricultural production, the economic mainstay.</p><p>All this in a region that contributes only about four per cent of global emissions that cause climate change.</p><p>Thus, the continent expects that COP27 will be an opportunity to re-energise efforts against the climate change crisis. The global community has to begin with action on commitments made at the last conference in Glasgow that is yet to be delivered.</p><p>Clear roadmap</p><p>At COP26, world leaders made a strong commitment to limit the increase in temperatures to not more than 1.5C. However, there has been no commensurate translation of this ambition into action.</p><p>Only a few countries have revised their Nationally Determined Contributions to reflect the commitment they made in Glasgow.</p><p>In the face of economic challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, several countries are rolling back on their climate commitments. A recent UN report indicates that the goal of staying below 1.5C is fragile.</p><p>This calls for more action, which speaks louder than the commitments that the continent has been getting. Ambitious commitments must be matched with clear roadmaps to deliver clear, tangible, and transformative solutions at scale with an emphasis on action to accelerate urgent climate plans.</p><p>Coordinated global action</p><p>The world also needs to commit to following through on past missed targets, such as the Paris Agreement. Coordinated global action to keep the climate within safe boundaries is important. It requires attention dedicated to adaptation, as it is to mitigation.</p><p>A collective response is key, through investments in technology transfer, capacity building, and financial resources.</p><p>One of the biggest opportunities to tackle the effects of climate change lies in going back to basics - letting nature do its work.</p><p>Natural habitats have the ability to absorb and store vast amounts of carbon. It is projected that protection, restoration and better management of our lands and wetlands could cut up to a third of the emission needed to limit global warming and keep the climate within safe boundaries.</p><p>From our work across the continent, we have seen natural solutions at work, not only in restoring and protecting vulnerable ecosystems but also in positively impacting the livelihoods of communities.</p><p>We have piloted innovative models for protecting and restoring forests to enable them to thrive and continue reducing emissions while providing economic opportunity through strategic grants and technical assistance.</p><p>Working with donors and major water consumers, we have created funds to help secure the source of water in Nairobi and Cape Town through upstream water and soil conservation in conjunction with sustaining improved quality and supply to homes and industries.</p><p>In Lamu on the Kenyan coast, we are restoring and improving the management of threatened mangroves to enable them to prevent erosion and absorb carbon and provide a home to a variety of animals.</p><p>Seizing the day</p><p>Unfortunately, nature-based solutions remain neglected, receiving less than 10% of climate funding globally, only a fraction of which goes to the continent.</p><p>Africa cannot achieve a low-carbon or climate-resilient future without quality financing at scale, targeted at areas like energy transition and the restoration of natural capital - through food systems and land use practices, alongside biodiversity.</p><p>The continent is best placed to take advantage of the opportunity that nature presents to slow down the effects of climate change. This is because it remains with huge landscapes that are still functioning as nature intended and not yet unsustainably exploited.</p><p>We do not need to restore nature for it to help tackle climate change; we just need to protect what is there. Protection is, in fact, far cheaper than restoration.</p><p>Coping with the change</p><p>Africa needs to take the path to use nature sustainably so that the continent can develop in a way that enables it to cope with the changing climate and contribute its share to global mitigation.</p><p>This needs to be the focus of the world and Africa as it convenes in Egypt. These solutions must also include increased climate finance, especially for adaptation; a financing mechanism for loss and damage; an ambitious global goal on adaptation; and recognition of the special needs and circumstances of Africa.</p><p>More importantly, the voices of indigenous and local communities must be heard on mission-critical platforms like COP27. After all, they know best how to work with nature in their communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT1011202200006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66V4-3Y81-JCH9-G3D8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 10, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Without a significant additional supply of these materials, climate goals will remain out of reach for the world.</p><p>While important variations in extant energy systems and resource endowments exist among African nations, the collective assets of the continent make it a natural resource and natural capital superpower.</p><p>The world cannot decarbonise without Africa. Recognising the critical role that African nations play in delivering global climate solutions, and radically reshaping international engagement with Africa to reflect this reality, is an urgent imperative that many political leaders have yet to grasp.</p><p>Gabon shows the way</p><p>In October 2022, Gabon became the first African nation to receive results-based payments for preserving its pristine rainforests, which absorb a total of 140 million tonnes of CO2 every year, the equivalent of removing 30 million cars from the road globally.</p><p>This central African nation was able to access the voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) and monetise the value of its standing forests to the tune of $150m over 10 years. It was a painstaking exercise, conducted over more than a decade to map, monitor and secure accreditation for its forest cover.</p><p>This month, in Sharm-El Sheikh, the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI) will announce plans to scale African VCMs. Success would mean rapidly reducing the time it takes to generate credits, increasing the underlying quality and price of African carbon credits, and significantly increasing the volume of credits produced.</p><p>The sum of money that could be generated from the VCMs for nature-based CO2 removal alone could be worth up to $86bn per year for Africa, Climate Action Platform-Africa (CAP-A) estimates.</p><p>Biodiversity loss</p><p>We need more economic incentives like this to slow the rate of biodiversity loss on the continent as Africa's population grows. Wood charcoal consumption was estimated by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to be 34.9 million tonnes in Africa in 2020.</p><p>Data from the FAO also shows that Africa lost 3.9m hectares of forest per year between 1990 and 2020.</p><p>Preserving African carbon sinks is essential for keeping global temperatures from rising above two degrees Celsius.</p><p>The UN's scientific climate body, the IPCC, states that Nature-based Solutions are some of the most promising near-term climate mitigation and adaptation actions, providing 30% of the climate solution needed to meet Paris targets over the coming decade.</p><p>The surest way to stave off climate catastrophe is to create jobs and livelihoods for the 12-15 million young Africans joining the labour market each year.</p><p>Clean electricity</p><p>With careful land management planning, and on the back of the expanded use of clean electricity produced from renewables, Africa can become the first region to achieve green industrialisation, creating employment in zero-emissions industries without damaging the environment.</p><p>Few other regions of the world have as much quality sunlight or reliable wind as the deserts and coastlines of Africa. Mauritania has set aside 8,000 sq km for a wind and solar park bordering Western Sahara.</p><p>It's unimaginable that a park this size could be developed in Europe. There's simply not enough available.</p><p>The framework agreement which the Government of Mauritania has signed with CPW Global should create sufficient jobs to reduce unemployment in the nation by one-third by 2035, according to CPW Global estimates.</p><p>In South Africa, the Hydrogen SocietyRoadmap has calculated the development of a Green Hydrogen Valley that would run from Mpumalanga to Natal and could create three million jobs by 2050.</p><p>There are few other regions in the world where monumental projects of this scale could be developed with as much socio-economic impact and as little environmental impact.</p><p>When Africa wins, we all win</p><p>The global north has dominated African energy conversations for decades, and recent debates about Africa's energy future have been heated, often shaped by geopolitical interests, but detached from the context-specific climate and development realities that African nations face on the ground.</p><p>Africa's diverse energy pathways require both more and more tailor-made finance. It's unacceptable that the average financing costs of a solar project in Africa are still several times higher than in European countries when the quality of radiation is superior. A carbon credit from Gabon sells for a fraction of the price of one from Indonesia.</p><p>As an outcome of COP27, we need to see much larger sums of concessional long-term financing for African projects made available by OECD nations and their development finance institutions.</p><p>As custodians of the most promising solutions for a secure climate-resilient future, African nations should have a leading role in the climate debate.</p><p>It's time to recognise that African nations are not just victims of the climate crisis; they hold the mineral sourcing, carbon sequestration and renewable energy, keys to addressing the greatest existential challenge of our time. We need them at the table actively contributing to the design of sustainable and equitable mechanisms for climate finance to scale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT071120220007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66TX-BM11-JCH9-G1HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 7, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Annual Review highlights examples in some of the company's fastest-growing categories. In Health Science, Nestl\u00e9 developed new nutritional solutions for diabetes, cardiovascular and other medical conditions. For example, Nutren GlucoSmart was launched in Malaysia and helps support healthy glucose levels. Nestl\u00e9 uses that same know-how to develop solutions for pets too. Pro Plan Cardio Care was launched in 2021 to slow the progression of heart disease in dogs. In coffee, the company discovered two new varieties that produce up to 50% higher yields per tree versus standard varieties and enable an up to 30% reduction in the carbon footprint on the farm. One of those varieties is now being grown by farmers in Latin America for use in Nescaf\u00e9.</p><p>Strong digital capabilities are an important growth driver, and Nestl\u00e9 focuses on providing consumers with holistic online brand experiences. The company grew its e-commerce sales by another 15.1%, increasing e-commerce's share of total Group sales to 14.3% in 2021. Nestl\u00e9 further deployed its connected operations technology last year, with more than 100 sites now benefitting from a more connected workforce, better visibility across the entire production process and local flexibility. In a year that saw supply chain constraints, Nestl\u00e9 was able to identify changes in demand and supply in real time and deal with issues much faster.</p><p>In the Creating Shared Value (CSV) section of the Annual Review and in the full CSV and Sustainability Report, Nestl\u00e9 explains how it is supporting the just transition towards climate-friendly and nature-positive food systems. The company is delivering on its climate roadmap and reports that it has passed peak carbon levels. For the last two consecutive years, Nestl\u00e9 has reduced its absolute greenhouse gas emissions, even while its business volume has grown significantly. Specifically, it has achieved a reduction of 4.0 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, for instance, by switching to renewable electricity, or encouraging the use of natural fertilizers in farming. And it has initiated removals of 9.7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents through nature-based solutions within its value chain.</p><p>The full Annual Report contains Nestl\u00e9's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WgBlbXRNRezp5LdVnziLVmqC5g0uNtVht3H-ga7TbQhCj9tC9VPrhRRgrhq1Atx32TzorUcCFRhRRN5aD8STeeJmXTQg6U-woJC1uKgekVZwa02vJxFZE1zbwfzfOoM4aff8dPpqZOwuHICpRcXceoKrdbFUL7al5jVB7q7TuBA=\">Annual Review (pdf, 17 Mb)</url>as well as the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=S6GUASzSf9u7jRMIFxJF1VJAXSUca76FT15jvU4B40qYaYjFIMmJYNcMXz8wXcFZqTCjzVcMON6Zzza5hW5C9MNkSLsTmMyhH96dIwuLpUugC30DaT86i6Yu5XqkaCf6O6gnv9HAcnAV_QPM68yqCK802s7LLNwIxe0JN07R6zqb14gDMumh9n9ge0KBMbs7QFpphMBcz7o-gdMNVhFgUCBtyMUTok0hqF0FvqlxTog=\">Corporate Governance &amp;

The Group's net result was penalized by the negative effect of short-term hedges on net interest income in French retail, the impact of which peaked in Q3 23. It also includes, as announced during our Capital Markets Day, exceptional accounting items, with no impact on the capital ratio, or on shareholder distribution.

So we need to use every opportunity to take carbon out of the atmosphere.\"</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/interview/fri-ready-scientist-im-pretty-sure-we-will-need-carbon-removal-technologies/\">Scientist: 'I'm pretty sure we will need carbon removal technologies'</url></h><p>Sucking CO2 from the air to mitigate global warming may sound silly at first, but it's likely to be necessary nonetheless, says Nils R\u00f8kke. And the more we delay it, the higher will be the demand for carbon removal technologies in the future, he warns.</p><p>To reach net zero emissions by 2050, the Commission estimates that EU greenhouse gas emissions would need to drop by 85-95% compared to 1990. And carbon removals, it argues, can fill the gap to reach 100%.</p><p>The amounts are not negligible. According to a Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/swd_2021_450_en_0.pdf\">paper on sustainable carbon cycles</url> published last year, those will need to represent several hundred million tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year.</p><p>In the mid-term, carbon removals would be achieved via \"the enhancement of the natural sink\" such as with afforestation and reforestation initiatives, carbon farming, restoration of peatlands and long-lasting bio-based products like wood used in construction.</p><p>In the long term, nature-based removals will be supported by \"the deployment of industrial solutions able to capture and store CO2 permanently\".</p><p>Technology-based solutions - what the Commission calls 'industrial solutions' - include capturing carbon from the air (direct air capture) and capturing carbon from emissions. Both methods then store the captured CO2 permanently underground.</p><p>Other options could even create net negative emissions, like Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) where biomass is burnt for energy and the resulting emissions are permanently stored.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Planning for net zero</emphasis></p><p>The European Commission is approaching carbon removals in two stages. In the 2020s, it is focused on setting up a framework for certifying carbon removals and gathering information about them.</p><p>Up to 2030, the European Commission sees nature-based removals doing the heavy lifting. In proposals put forward last year, the EU executive aims for 310 million tonnes of CO2 to be captured by nature in 2030 - an increase from the projected 225 million tonnes under a business-as-usual scenario - and 5 million tonnes to be removed by technical solutions.</p><p>Beyond 2030, a lot is still to be decided. By 2050, the European Commission foresees the need to sequester several hundred million tonnes of carbon, both through natural sinks and technical solutions. This will include removals of at least 300 or 500 million tonnes of CO2 from technology-based solutions, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13066-Climate-change-restoring-sustainable-carbon-cycles_en\">according to the EU's scenario planning</url>.</p><p>But it's not clear yet what balance will be achieved between technical- and nature-based solutions.</p><p>\"We still need to understand much better all the solutions that are out there, their robustness, their credibility,\" a Commission official told EURACTIV.</p><p>\"Today, it's almost impossible. Nobody could give you the exact specific balance between net removals from nature-based solutions and from technology-based solutions. Because it's so dependent on many different variables,\" the official explained.</p><p>One of the problems that makes legislating on carbon removals so complex is that there are still many unanswered questions. For instance, it is not yet clear how many emissions will be left after 2050 and from which sectors they will come.\u00a0The assumption for now is that the agriculture sector and parts of industry will continue to contribute to those residual emissions.</p><p>The elephant in the room is how to determine which sectors will be allowed to continue producing residual emissions, according to Eve Tamme, managing director at the policy group Climate Principles.</p><p>\"Ideally, it would have been better to start with a carbon dioxide removals strategy on the European level that establishes all these different principles or rules: that we have the separate targets, what it actually means in practice, what kind of residual emissions we are aiming for and who should be doing the heavy lifting on removals,\" she told EURACTIV.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Funding removals</emphasis></p><p>How to pay for such carbon removal projects - both technology-based and nature-based - is another question that is only just beginning to be answered.</p><p>For technical solutions, the European Commission sees the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/funding-climate-action/innovation-fund_en\">Innovation Fund</url> appended to the EU carbon market as the prime source of funding.</p><p>For nature-based removals, there are ideas to use money from the common agricultural policy to incentivise landowners to store carbon. Alongside this, the European Parliament's negotiator for the land use regulation, Ville Niinist\u00f6, wants to use revenues from the EU's emissions trading scheme to incentivise carbon sequestration.</p><p>Markets are another potential source of revenue and they are already beginning to spring up. Sweden, for instance, is planning a reverse auction of two million tonnes of negative emissions and the Dutch Rabobank has created one of several voluntary markets for carbon removals.</p><p>But this patchwork of carbon removal purchasing lacks one vital thing: certification at the EU level.</p><p>The European Commission is looking to bring in a certification scheme for carbon removals at the end of the year.\u00a0This is widely seen as the cornerstone of creating credible and reliable proof of removals.</p><p>\"Whatever model [of funding] you choose, what you need first is a credible certification,\" said a Commission official.</p><p>\"You need to know for how long, how many tonnes of CO2 are stored and what are also the possible negative effects, like on biodiversity, so you need to put in safeguards,\" the official explained.</p><p>The EU executive needs to bring forward a robust certification that tackles the issue of permanence, said Mark Preston Aragon\u00e8s, a policy officer at the NGO Bellona Europa. The Commission should focus on certifying \"properly, not quickly\" and use the time up to 2030 as a learning curve where mistakes can be easily fixed, he told EURACTIV.</p><p>Ultimately, this could lead to a carbon removal market, similar to the EU's emissions trading scheme. But this is something far down the road for the European Commission, which is focusing on first creating its certification system to build transparency and credibility.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-plans-certification-scheme-for-carbon-dioxide-removals/\">EU plans certification scheme for carbon dioxide removals</url></h><p>The European Commission will publish a policy paper by the end of the year on \"the sustainable management of the carbon cycle\" - the first step towards an EU-wide certification scheme for negative emissions coming from agriculture, forestry and other sources, that will be tabled in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barriers to certification</emphasis></p><p>Despite the clear importance of certification, there are still hurdles that the European Commission needs to overcome.</p><p>Firstly, nature-based solutions are not permanent and will require some sort of monitoring.</p><p>\"For instance, what happens if a certified forest sink goes up in flames?\" asked Artur Runge-Metzger, director at the European Commission's climate department. \"The legislation will have to be able to deal with such a situation in order to make sure that, at the end of the day, there is a physical removal for each certificate - or currency - that has been issued,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/interview/official-eu-taking-first-steps-to-bring-forestry-into-carbon-market/\">he told EURACTIV in an interview back in October 2020</url>.</p><p>This issue of permanence is at the centre of concern for policymakers. \"There is always a risk of reversal and that the CO2 is going back to the atmosphere,\" said a Commission official. \"We have to minimise this risk and to also establish liabilities in case of reversal. You need to be very careful on the measurement and on the uncertainties that you have with the carbon removal that you want to certify,\" he explained.</p><p>Despite those difficulties, Timmermans believes a calculation method can be developed in order to deal with the issue of permanence. \"If we can come to a method, a robust method of certifying carbon removals, then I think the issue of permanence will also be dealt with,\" he said.</p><p>Another key issue is to come up with an accounting system that prevents carbon removals from being counted twice.</p><p>\"We should have a rigid accounting system that shows that carbon sinks are increasing in the natural world and then that creates a mechanism of social acceptance and support for the bioeconomy solutions that come within that frame,\" said Ville Niinist\u00f6, the Parliament's negotiator for the land use regulation.</p><p>\"If that frame is solid, then whatever happens within it can be with good conscience sold as being environmentally friendly,\" he told EURACTIV.</p><p>It is yet to be seen how such a certification scheme would be designed. One thing that seems certain, however, is that this would be an EU-level system.</p><p>\"We would definitely be looking into creating a level playing field across Europe. So I think we should have all the same principles, and the recognition of certain methodologies across the EU,\" a Commission official told EURACTIV.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reductions versus removals</emphasis></p><p>While most believe that removals and reductions will both be needed if Europe wants to reach net zero emissions, there are concerns that focusing too much on carbon removals could give polluters an out.</p><p>Using technological fixes and neglecting to tackle the overconsumption and overuse of natural resources that are driving the climate crisis will not be enough, Niinist\u00f6 told EURACTIV.</p><p>The European Commission is well aware of this issue and says that emissions reductions are its \"first priority\". Ideally, reductions and removals need to go hand in hand, it argues.</p><p>\"We need to start by not putting [carbon] into the atmosphere. But even if we stopped putting it into the atmosphere, there's still so much carbon there, it will need to be taken out as well,\" said Timmermans.</p><p>\"You can never say well, technology will solve everything and, you know, we can sit on our hands, waiting for technology to solve everything - that is completely irresponsible,\" he added.\u00a0\"But at the same time, we've also seen investing in new technologies does bring huge positive results,\" he continued.</p><p>To prevent this kind of \"moral hazard\", some suggest reserving access to the market for carbon removals only to those who can prove they've done their share in reducing emissions.</p><p>\"There could be rules in place that you really have to qualify to be able to use removals. So you have to reduce your emissions to a certain level before you can start using removals,\" said Tamme.</p><p>According to her, this is why it is crucial to have separate targets for carbon removals and reductions. When the European Commission first suggested its more ambitious 2030 emissions reduction target, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/commission-under-fire-for-including-carbon-sinks-into-eu-climate-goals/\">it faced criticism for creating a 'net' target</url> that blurred the line between reductions and removals.</p><p>However, it later clarified that the role of carbon removals would be limited to 225 million tonnes of CO2, capping the reliance on removals.</p><p>The narrative around carbon removals also needs to shift from being driven by demand to being driven by the realistic amount of removals that can be supplied, according to Preston Aragon\u00e8s.</p><p>\"We need to be really wary of the hype,\" he told EURACTIV.</p><p>\"Buying an offset shouldn't be seen as 'check me out - I'm carbon neutral. I bought offsets'. It should be seen as shame in the sense that 'I'm still emitting. So I have to offset',\" he explained.</p><p>The European Commission is also guilty of this overreliance, according to Preston Aragon\u00e8s. He warned that the idea that negative emissions could just \"fill the gap\" without considering the barriers preventing this can lead to numbers which are \"quite heavily inflated\".</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/commission-under-fire-for-including-carbon-sinks-into-eu-climate-goals/\">Commission under fire for including 'carbon sinks' into EU climate goals</url></h><p>The European Commission on Thursday (17 September) defended its plan to bring carbon removals from agriculture, land use and forestry into the EU's updated climate target for 2030, saying this was in line with UNFCCC standards.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1712558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64V1-Y571-JCF9-41JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2175\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 21, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>carbon capture and storage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon farming</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon removals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon removals certification scheme</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>direct air capture</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>LULUCF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>net zero emissions</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Business &amp;

Their study shows that the Amazon is less resilient than the Congo Basin forest.</p><p>From Siberia and Australia to Greece, Brazil, Turkey, Sardinia, Canada and California... this summer, the list of areas of the world facing devastating and deadly fires is sadly long. But tropical forests such as the Amazon, the Congo Basin or those of Southeast Asia (especially Borneo, in Indonesia) are facing two major threats: global warming and deforestation due to human activity.\u00a0</p><p>In order to assess the precise impact on every rainforest on the planet, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (in Southern California, USA) have developed the \"tropical forest vulnerability index (TFVI).\" This tool, accessible to scientists as well as the general public, makes it possible to evaluate the possible tipping points, which could see tropical forests turn into savannas.</p><p>\"The hope is that the larger global community of scientists and policy makers, particularly in tropical countries, will now make use of the index to systematically assess the vulnerability of rainforest resources and to develop nature-based solutions to meet their commitments to the Paris Agreement,\" notes Sassan Saatchi of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a news release.</p><p>The\u00a0study, published in mid-July in the One Earth journal, shows that the three main rainforest areas of the world cited above have different degrees of sensitivity to deforestation and climate change. Since the 1990s, 15-20% of tropical forests have been cut down and another 10% have been damaged by fire.</p><p>The Amazon is the most threatened forest in the world, both by drought and by exploitation. The Congo Basin, however, is more resilient, partly because it has been facing drought for a longer period of time, even though it is subject to extreme climatic conditions similar to those in the Amazon. Meanwhile, \"in Asia, tropical forests appear more vulnerable to land use and fragmentation,\" the study notes.\u00a0</p><p>The index was designed using data combining satellite and soil recordings from 1982 to 2018, as well as global precipitation measurements. Researchers then correlated stressors (temperature, water availability, extent of degradation) with data on the amount of living forest biomass, the ability of plants to absorb carbon dioxide, and the amount of water released by trees into the atmosphere.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6396-RKK1-F19C-X2PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"414\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>TOURISM</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 4, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Simon Zadek is Chair of the Finance For Biodiversity initiative.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The opportunity of the century\" is how President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has described the EU Recovery Plans this week - in terms of rebuilding our economies in a way that protects the environment and the climate, and creates sustainable jobs. These plans are a defining moment for reset, and they should completely overhaul Europe's economic systems and set the region onto a new pathway that delivers the ambitions of the European Green Deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In reviewing the plans, which were due for final submission to the European Commission on 30 April, it is clear that the story emerging so far is one of some progress to support the green transition, yet a complete failure to apply a smart or systemic approach to addressing Europe's environmental sustainability challenges.</p><p>The devil will be in the detail of the numerous climate measures included in the plans, yet the role of nature in the green transition is glaringly absent - whether it's in tackling climate change and the dramatic loss of biodiversity in Europe or strengthening Europe's long-term growth potential.</p><p>The National Resilience and Recovery Plans (NRRPs) are the vehicles that EU Member States are using to access money from the (EURO)670 billion Resilience and Recovery Facility (RRF) - the centrepiece of the Next Generation EU recovery instrument. In emerging analysis that will be released in full by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vivideconomics.com/\">Vivid Economics</url> at the end of May, findings show that for every single euro being invested through the NRRPs, less than 2 cents benefit nature - a massive missed opportunity for jobs, economic stimulus, emission reductions and biodiversity gains.</p><p>Why? It may not be well known, but direct investments in agroforestry, reforestation, wetland restoration and urban greening deliver impressive economic yields and employment gains, and in some cases even outperform traditional and other low-carbon investments.</p><p>For example, the emerging Vivid analysis of five countries - France, Italy, Germany, Bulgaria and Poland - shows that agroforestry creates an average of 56 jobs per (EURO)1 million invested compared to 45 jobs for electric vehicles and 31 jobs for road-building. In terms of economic return, every (EURO)1 of spending on agroforestry produces on average (EURO)3 of gross-valued added (GVA) to the economy compared with (EURO)1.8 for electric vehicles and (EURO)1.2 for upgrading roads.</p><p>There is a clear opportunity to improve the performance of the Member State plans - and indeed all future EU spending - to invest in more nature-specific interventions, which would not only deliver a job-rich recovery with strong economic multipliers, but also reduce emissions and strengthen resilience and biodiversity.</p><p>The scientific understanding of nature's role in restoring balance to the climate has deepened in the last few years and is now well-established - nature can deliver <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/44/11645\">a third of the climate solution by 2030</url>.</p><p>So too has our understanding of the full range of benefits that nature-based solutions deliver for people: alongside jobs, the benefits include filtering water, reducing air pollution, regulating local climate and providing resilience to extreme weather events. There doesn't have to be a trade-off between choosing to spend on climate, biodiversity and economic well-being; they go hand-in-hand and reinforce each other.</p><p>It is important to remember that when EU leaders agreed to the recovery facility, as COVID-19 was decimating economies, they embedded green principles at the outset. The aim was to advance the green transition, and mainstream climate action and environmental sustainability, while ensuring that all measures 'do no significant harm' (DNSH).</p><p>If applied rigorously, the DNSH principle should ensure that all spending under these plans is compatible with a nature-positive recovery - in other words, that no recovery measure should put undue pressure on ecosystems. And it is very clear that Member States need to do much more to meet these goals - on both <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.e3g.org/news/a-recovery-with-green-elements-but-not-a-green-recovery/\">climate</url> and nature.</p><p>As governments struggle with the historic challenges posed by COVID-19, there are measures that can be taken that provide a 'triple win' - for jobs, climate and nature. What is needed is a comprehensive and transparent assessment of the NRRPs by the European Commission that takes a smart and systemic approach to environmental sustainability - placing both climate and nature at the heart of the EU's review process.</p><p>There is much work to be done to help decision-makers understand the significant benefits and opportunities that both climate-positive and nature-based solutions can offer as part of their recovery plans.</p><p>Our hope is that the emerging analysis from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vivideconomics.com/casestudy/greenness-for-stimulus-index/\">Vivid Economics</url> and many other initiatives, such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenrecoverytracker.org/\">Green Recovery Tracker</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://bankwatch.org/blog/last-chance-for-member-states-to-include-biodiversity-in-recovery-plans\">Bankwatch</url>, EuroNatur, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iisd.org/sustainable-recovery/geography/europe/\">IISD</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://zoe-institut.de/en/publication/systemic-change-for-a-resilient-europe/\">ZOE-Institute</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://zoe-institut.de/en/project/a-green-economic-recovery-in-europe/\">and New Economics Foundation</url>, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.f4b-initiative.net/greenstimulus\">Finance for Biodiversity</url> to name a few, will contribute to this process of increasing knowledge and transparency in these areas - and will provide Member States with the tools they need to further increase ambition for future spending on both climate and nature.</p><p>The recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is not simply a question of putting the 'old' economy back on its feet but building forward better - solidly embedding nature in the economic rebuild to deliver a truly green and just transition and ensuring Europe becomes more resilient over the long-term.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1600760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62KT-GF41-JCF9-42HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 5, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Biodiversity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU recovery fund</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU recovery plan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>national recovery plan</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

During two days, debates, conferences and demonstrations will serve up a radical, decolonial approach that focuses on the importance of indigenous peoples in the conservation of biodiversity.\u00a0</p><p>Ahead of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) World Conservation Congress in Marseille, international indigenous peoples' movement Survival International is organizing a counter-congress called \"Our Land, Our Nature\" on Thursday and Friday, September 2-3, 2021. It's a congress that takes a critical look at the world leaders, NGOs and business leaders who will gather from Friday, September 3 for the World Congress of Nature.</p><p>The organizers of the alternative event castigate the plans evoked by the various actors of the IUCN Congress. According to them, the plans are \"false solutions,\" and \"if left unchecked, their schemes will make things worse.\" In particular the objective, set by governments to reach 30% of protected areas on the planet by 2030 (known as 30x30), which will \"devastate the best guardians of the natural world: the Indigenous Peoples who safeguard 80% of biodiversity.\" \"\"The target] makes no provision of guarantees for the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and therefore risks reinforcing this fortress-conservation model and leading to more human rights violations,\" Marie Ndenga Hagbe of Survival International told ETX Studio.</p><p>During the conferences and debates organized on Thursday, September 2, activists, researchers and leading NGO leaders from around the world will also address the issue of \"Nature-based Solutions,\" which are \"actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits,\" according to the definition of the IUCN.</p><p>According to Survival International, these solutions are a distraction. \"They distract from the real causes of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss -- increasing and profit-oriented exploitation of resources -- and lead to a land grab at the expense of Indigenous Peoples,\" says Marie Ndenga Hagbe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Decolonize conservation\"</emphasis></p><p>In this alternative congress, the organizers are putting Indigenous Peoples' protection of nature at the heart of conservation, as they have the knowledge and skills necessary to safeguard biodiversity. According to United Nations figures, nearly 80% of the planet's biodiversity is found on the territories of Indigenous Peoples and therefore, they are more concerned and able to respond and be actors in the resolution of climate and biodiversity crises.\u00a0</p><p>The alternative congress approach promotes a radical decolonial vision of nature conservation. The movement emphasizes that the real solutions, which respect diversity and are decolonial -- and which work, can be found through listening to Indigenous Peoples, but that governments must respect and protect their rights for a fair and effective way to safeguard biodiversity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63HC-WVJ1-F19C-X1BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

We are working hard to ensure the safety of our staff and contractors, and to support relief efforts. We have also announced our intention to withdraw from Russian oil and gas.</p><p>As well as being a human tragedy, the war has led to rising energy prices and uncertainty about supplies.</p><p>This extreme disruption in global energy markets has shown that affordable, secure, and reliable energy cannot be taken as a given. It must be protected and managed, through international co-operation: companies, governments and wider society working together. This co-operation includes working with our shareholders and maintaining their support.</p><p>Shell will play a leading role as the world's energy systems change. We will continue to supply the oil and gas that people need today. As one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we can ship natural gas to where it is needed most. At the same time, we are accelerating the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy, which is at the heart of our strategy.</p><p>Essentially, an accelerated transition is the best way to ensure security of energy supplies. It is also the best way to help people in some parts of the world who do not yet have access to energy, which is essential for a better quality of life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>We firmly believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The actions Shell takes over the coming years, and our progress against our short- and medium-term targets, will be crucial steps to ensure that we become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>In the first year of our Powering Progress strategy, we have laid the foundations for success. We have taken critical investment decisions in the production of low-carbon fuels, solar and wind power, and hydrogen. We have made significant changes to our Upstream and refinery portfolios, we reshaped the organisation and we simplified the company and its share structure. We have formed partnerships with some of the world's biggest companies in sectors from aviation to road transport and technology.</p><p>In 2021, we added an ambitious new target to halve absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2), compared with 2016 levels and on a net basis. We are well on our way with an 18% reduction by the end of 2021.</p><p>For comparison, we estimate that global energy- and fossil-related CO2emissions actually rose by 2.4% in the period between the end of 2016 and the end of 2021, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) and other data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Change in demand</emphasis>We believe that for the world to decarbonise, a dramatic change in demand for energy is just as critical as changes to supply. That is why an essential part of Shell's strategy is working with our customers across different sectors to reduce emissions.</p><p>We are helping our customers to identify and use low- and zero-carbon alternatives to the energy products they have used for many decades: renewable electricity and hydrogen to power homes, cars, trucks, businesses, and industry; biofuels for cars, trucks and planes; LNG for power, trucks and ships; and carbon capture and storage and nature-based carbon offsets to deal with any remaining emissions.</p><p>This is not only the right approach for the world. It also makes good business sense. We see great business opportunities for Shell in the fast-growing low- and zero-carbon markets where we are well positioned to provide the different products and solutions our customers need.</p><p>We are leading the way in new technologies that will help to decarbonise our operations, and to reduce emissions for our customers. Our scientists are developing new ways to store hydrogen safely, including underground, for example, which will be critical to ensure secure, large-scale supplies of hydrogen to our industrial customers in the future. And our engineers are designing LNG projects which are powered by renewable electricity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Remuneration</emphasis>We included progress in the energy transition in the calculation of the annual bonus for almost all Shell's employees in 2021. Now we are going further. From 2022, we have extended how we measure progress to cover three key themes; reducing emissions from our operations, sales of low- and zero-carbon products and partnering with others to decarbonise road transport.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stronger and more profitable</emphasis>Last year, 89% of Shell's shareholders voted in favour of our energy transition strategy. We are implementing that strategy, and this year we are asking shareholders to vote on our progress, as we will do every year until 2050. The next energy transition strategy update for an advisory vote is in 2024 and we will give another update on our progress next year.</p><p>Securing shareholder support as we implement our Powering Progress strategy is good governance. The vote on our progress towards our targets and plans is purely advisory and will not be binding on our shareholders. The legal responsibility for Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>When I look at what we have achieved in 2021, and our plans for the years ahead, I believe that Shell will become stronger and more profitable by providing the low- and zero-carbon energy products and services that our customers need. That is good for our shareholders. It is good for our customers. It is also good for the world's climate goals and the planet.</p><p>The continued support of our shareholders is critical for us to become a net-zero emissions energy business and a leader in the energy transition. We believe that Shell's energy transition strategy is in the best interests of our shareholders as a whole and wider society.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 20 in support of the progress that Shell has made in its energy transition strategy over the past year as described in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTION</emphasis></p><p>Ben van Beurden, CEO, Shell plc</p><p>In a time of great uncertainty, it is vital that our long-term energy transition strategy remains on track. This report shows the strong progress we have made towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>It will take bold moves for Shell to achieve net zero. In 2021, we took some significant steps. We completed one of the biggest restructurings in our history, making us a more agile company. We decided to simplify our share structure, and moved Shell's headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets</emphasis>In this Energy Transition Progress Report, we show our progress against our climate targets in the year since our shareholders overwhelmingly supported our energy transition strategy.</p><p>We are making significant progress in a long-term plan. Crucially, we set a new target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2021, we had achieved a reduction of 18%. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2-3% by the end of 2021, also compared with 2016.</p><p>Now our targets start to get more ambitious. We are working towards a 9-12% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2024, and a 20% reduction by 2030. To put our targets into context, the International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 scenario suggests that the transport sector, which accounts for most of Shell's emissions, needs to see a reduction in net carbon intensity of 18% by 2030.</p><p>From today, our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is no longer conditional on society's progress, marking a further step forwards. This reflects the leading role we will play in the energy transition. We must find ways to be ahead of society where we can, while remaining a successful and profitable company.</p><p>As we have seen from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to take urgent action to meet its climate goals. While countries, companies and individuals are making significant changes, there is still a risk that the world will not achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. This could mean that Shell would find it hard to meet its 2050 target as well. We are rising to that challenge and will demonstrate over time how we will reach our goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working sector by sector</emphasis>We are investing in low- and zero-carbon products such as renewable electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and chemicals. We are building a leading hydrogen business, and now operate 10% of total electrolyser capacity in the world. We are already one of the world's largest producers of biofuels through our joint venture in Brazil. And last year we started building one of Europe's biggest biofuels facilities.</p><p>Crucially, we are working sector by sector to identify the low- and zero-carbon products and services that our customers need. And we are laying the foundations for future expansion by building capacity and expertise. At the beginning of 2022, for example, with our joint-venture partners, we won bids to develop 5 gigawatts of floating wind power in the UK, enough to power 6 million homes. That is more than double the number of homes in Scotland.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in net zero</emphasis>Our Upstream business continues to provide the oil and gas the world needs today, and generates the returns to fund distributions to shareholders and our investments in the energy transition. Our production and sales of oil and gas will decrease in the coming years as we transform our business.</p><p>At the same time, our investments in the energy system of the future will increase significantly. By 2025, we expect around half of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services including biofuels, hydrogen, power, charging for electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, chemicals and lubricants. In 2022, we expect that around one third of our total expenditure will be on these low- and zero- carbon products and services.</p><p>Our planned investments in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK put us among the leading investors in the energy transition there. In the UK, for example, we plan to invest \u00a320-25 billion ($26-33 billion) over the next ten years, mostly in low- and zero-carbon projects including offshore wind, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, subject to Board approval.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholder engagement</emphasis>A central part of our Powering Progress strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. We have made good progress here too. In 2021, we produced a strong financial performance and announced an $8.5 billion share buyback programme in the first half of 2022.</p><p>We will continue our dialogue with shareholders as Shell transforms and evolves. It is important that we are transparent about our progress in the energy transition. From the first quarter of 2022, we intend to publish more information about the profitability of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, something that investors have asked for.</p><p>We believe that our strategy delivers secure and reliable energy that will accelerate the energy transition and deliver strong profits and returns to shareholders. I ask our shareholders to vote for Resolution 20 in support of our progress towards our targets and milestones as we accelerate towards net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS SUMMARY</emphasis></p><p>We are transforming into a net-zero emissions energy business. In 2021 and the beginning of 2022 we:</p><p>Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 18%, and reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2.5%, both by the end of 2021 compared with 2016.Formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Continued to build a material power business. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. We have 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.Expanded our hydrogen business. We have started production from 30 megawatts (MW) of electrolysers that can produce around 4,300 tonnes a year of decarbonised hydrogen. We are looking to take final investment decisions on 10 times this capacity in 2022. We own and operate 10% of global electrolyser capacity today.Took a final investment decision on a facility in the Netherlands to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024.Continued to build the infrastructure that our customers will need as they move to low- and zero-carbon energy.Expanded our electric vehicle charging network to almost 90,000 charge points at the end of 2021, from around 60,000 in 2020.Increased the number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) refuelling sites in Europe and increased the number of sites for hydrogen refuelling in Europe, North America and China.Announced our ambition for SAF to make up at least 10% of our aviation fuel sales by 2030.Expanded our LNG bunkering operations, including the world's first bio-LNG bunkering, to help to reduce emissions from the marine sector. We also worked with others on programmes to develop hydrogen fuel cell propulsion for ships.Worked with customers across sectors such as commercial, light industry and technology to decarbonise their energy use by providing renewable electricity.Developed partnerships in the heavy industry sector to explore how hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used to reduce global carbon emissions.Invested in CCS. We have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development. Retired around 6 million tonnes of nature-based credits, excluding trading activities, in 2021.Supported climate-related government policies that advance the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OUR PERFORMANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read in more detail about our performance against our climate targets and how we are working to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NET CARBON INTENSITY</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING OUR ABSOLUTE SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS</emphasis>To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we are transforming how we produce energy as we continue to meet growing demand.</p><p>In October 2021, we set a new target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.</p><p>We have identified six main ways to decarbonise our operations:</p><p>making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining five refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks; using more renewable electricity to power our operations;developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities; and, if required, using nature-based solutions to offset any remaining emissions from our operations.</p><p>The chart below illustrates our current plans to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS IN 2021</emphasis>By the end of 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control to 68 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, an 18% reduction compared with 2016, our base year. This shows significant progress towards achieving our target of a 50% reduction by 2030.</p><p>In 2021, we improved energy efficiency across our assets. For example, we implemented a project to reduce power requirements for gas compression at our QGC natural gas project in Australia. Most of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions came from our Downstream business, in particular from our refining activities. Portfolio changes, such as the sale of the Martinez and Puget Sound refineries in the USA, and the transformation of our Bukom refinery in Singapore into a low-carbon energy and chemicals park, also helped to reduce emissions from our operations. Shell's Annual Report and Accounts provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p>Methane emissions are included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting. In 2021, we reduced total methane emissions from our operations by 18% to 55,000 tonnes, compared with 67,000 tonnes in 2020. In 2021, our methane emissions intensity averaged 0.06% for assets with gas available for sale, well within our target to maintain less than 0.2% by 2025.</p><p>In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine gas flaring from our Upstream operations to 2025 from 2030. In 2021, routine flaring from our Upstream operations fell to 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.3 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Despite this, our overall flaring increased from 0.8 million tonnes of hydrocarbons to 1.0 million tonnes because of non-routine flaring, mainly as a result of operational issues in Nigeria. Shell's Sustainability Report provides more information about flaring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NET</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTENSITY</emphasis></p><p>We are working with our customers to provide the energy they need today, and to accelerate the energy transition. This means changing our portfolio of products as we provide low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>If our customers are not able to use these products, we will help them to store and offset remaining emissions through carbon capture and storage and by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions. By 2050, we will no longer serve customers who have unmitigated carbon emissions.</p><p>To achieve net zero, we must reduce emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, to zero. We must also cut emissions from the use of energy products sold by Shell (Scope 3), by reducing sales of oil and gas products and growing sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress, which measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. Crucially, it reflects both a reduction in sales of oil and gas products, and growth in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>Reducing net carbon intensity encourages us to work with our customers in sectors such as aviation and shipping to decarbonise their use of energy, while still providing the oil and gas they need today. And, as an intensity metric, it measures the true transformation that is happening in the company as we implement our energy transition strategy.</p><p>Other metrics, such as a simple total carbon emissions metric, would reflect how our sales of oil and gas products are shrinking, but would not provide information on how we are changing our mix of products.</p><p>We believe that our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes, and our total absolute emissions were 1.4 gigatonnes in 2021. We are working to reduce them to net zero by 2050. This is the same as a 100% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALIGNED WITH PARIS</emphasis>We believe our targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00c5\u00e3C above pre-industrial levels. There is no standard methodology to determine how to align companies' plans and targets with the goal of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>We studied a subset of IPCC scenarios that achieve that goal and were focused on earlier action and placed less reliance on the use of carbon sinks. From this subset, we calculated the range of carbon intensity pathways over time. We set our targets to fall within these pathways.</p><p>Our calculations show that the net carbon intensity of the energy mix will need to fall by around 15-35% by 2030. Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 20% by 2030.</p><p>[A] We measure net carbon intensity using our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING CARBON INTENSITY</emphasis>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing our sales of low-carbon products and services. The chart below illustrates how this change in our product mix could help us to achieve our target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030.</p><p>Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products.</p><p>Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products.</p><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Nature-based solutions offset carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON INTENSITY PROGRESS</emphasis>We achieved our short-term target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 2-3% compared with 2016, the base year, with a 2.5% reduction in 2021. We achieved this reduction by shifting our portfolio to lower-carbon energy products such as natural gas, power and biofuels, which now make up 55% of our total energy sales, compared with 46% in 2016.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's net carbon intensity was 77 gCO\u2082e/MJ, a 2.7% increase from the previous year. This increase was largely because we made a change in our methodology to better calculate the carbon intensity of our electricity sales. This approach distinguishes between the certified renewable electricity we purchase, electricity from our own generation, or purchased through a power purchase agreement, and electricity purchased from the grid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SECTORAL DECARBONISATION</emphasis></p><p>Read how Shell is working with customers, sector by sector, to help to transform the energy system.</p><p>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINS19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM</emphasis></p><p>To help to transform the energy system, Shell is working with customers, sector by sector.

This is more than twice the electricity we sell today.</p><p>We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, commercial and industrial customers through direct electricity sales, and services such as electricity storage. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. This increase is largely because we added more than 500,000 retail customers in the UK in 2021, and around 185,000 retail customers In Australia following our acquisition of PowerShop in 2022. Our largest markets for commercial and industrial customers are in Australia and the USA.</p><p>In addition to the investments we have made in building our customer base, we are also investing in building our generation capacity. We have 4.7 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.</p><p>We have added to our renewable generation capabilities by acquiring Savion, a US-based solar and energy storage specialist; Solar-Konzept Italia, an Italian solar specialist; and WestWind, a wind specialist based in Australia.</p><p>Shell is one of the leading developers of floating wind farms in the world with prototypes, pilot farms and commercial-scale projects in development in France, Ireland, Norway, Scotland and South Korea.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDROGEN</emphasis>We are expanding our hydrogen projects to serve sectors such as road freight, steel and cement. These projects include the production, storage and shipping of hydrogen.</p><p>As we grow, we are using Shell's integrated businesses to connect the different parts of the hydrogen system, from offshore wind to power the electrolysers that produce hydrogen, to using hydrogen in our energy and chemicals parks and eventually, supplying it through our retail network.</p><p>We are increasing our capacity, investing in infrastructure and helping to increase the scale and the adoption of hydrogen across different sectors. We have increased our total electrolyser capacity from 2 MW to 30 MW, 10% of the global capacity of installed electrolysers in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p><p>We have added a 20 MW electrolyser in China, which at the time was the largest in the world, and a 10 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser in Germany, the biggest of its kind in Europe. The electrolysers can produce 3,000 tonnes and 1,300 tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen a year respectively.</p><p>In 2022, with our partners, we plan to take final investment decisions on electrolysers with a total capacity of 300 MW. In the Netherlands, we plan to build a 200 MW electrolyser, which is expected to start operations by 2024 and to produce around 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. In Germany, we plan to take a final investment decision on a 100 MW electrolyser in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIOFUELS</emphasis>The transport sector accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the IEA. Biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodiesel, bioethanol and renewable natural gas are low-carbon fuels which can be used by customers to reduce their emissions without having to change their airplanes, cars, trucks, or ships.</p><p>In 2021, around 9.1 billion litres of biofuels were blended into Shell's fuels worldwide, around 5.8% of global biofuels consumption, according to figures from the IEA.</p><p>Shell and our Brazilian joint venture Ra\u00edzen, in which Shell has a 44% share, are together among the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels for the mobility sector. Ra\u00edzen produced 2.5 billion litres of first-generation ethanol in 2021, which is around 2.5% of global ethanol production, according to the IEA. It also acquired Biosev, adding a further 50% to its production capacity. And it took a final investment decision on its second-generation cellulosic ethanol facility, which will have a capacity of 80 million litres and is expected to start operations in 2023.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell took a final investment decision on a facility to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce SAF and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024. We are considering further investments to produce SAF at our energy and chemicals parks in Germany and Singapore.</p><p>As well as liquid biofuels, we are developing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG). Our newly operational Junction City RNG plant in Oregon is the largest plant in the USA to produce natural gas from agricultural residues, with an annual capacity of 736,000 million British thermal units.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONVENTIONAL</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FUELS</emphasis>The world will need less oil and gas as it moves to a low- and zero-carbon energy system. This transition is reflected in Shell's changing portfolio. In 2021, our oil production was 3.9% lower than in the previous year, as a result of divestments and natural decline. It was 7.6% lower than in 2019, when our oil production peaked. We expect our oil production to decline by an average of 1-2% a year to 2030.</p><p>We plan to reduce annual spending on exploration to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025.</p><p>We are transforming our refineries into five energy and chemicals parks which will produce low-carbon and synthetic fuels, as well as bitumen, lubricants and chemicals. The transformation of our refineries will help us to reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 91 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 2020 to 45 mtpa by 2030. In 2021, we reduced our production of traditional fuels to 71 mtpa.</p><p>Liquified natural gas (LNG) plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower- carbon alternative. We are adding around 7 mtpa of new LNG capacity, which is under construction and expected to be on stream around the middle of the decade. This includes our LNG Canada joint venture and our interest in a new LNG processing unit in Nigeria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</emphasis></p><p>A critical part of our success in the energy transition will be our ability to work sector by sector with customers and stakeholders. By listening to our customers, learning from them and working with them, we can understand what they value and need as the world moves towards a lower-carbon future. We aim to use such insights to profitably provide the low-carbon products and services they will want to buy.</p><p>We are also working with those operating in each sector, and with policymakers, to increase ambition around reducing emissions, better enable changes to infrastructure, and provide favourable conditions for investing in lower-carbon options. We are joining coalitions focused on decarbonising sectors and working with others to produce reports that identify and show pathways to reduce emissions in some of the sectors that are hardest to abate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERSONAL MOBILITY</emphasis>Shell is the world's largest mobility retailer, with more than 46,000 service stations operating in more than 80 markets. We believe the biggest opportunity to decarbonise our portfolio is by offering more low-carbon alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles.</p><p>In 2021, Shell operated almost 90,000 electric vehicle charge points, up from around 60,000 in the previous year. We aim to increase this to more than 500,000 by 2025, and to 2.5 million by 2030. That is around 7% of the expected number of charge points in the world by 2030, according to the IEA. In January 2021, we acquired ubitricity, a European provider of on-street charging for electric vehicles through lamp posts.</p><p>We are also expanding our network of hydrogen refuelling stations. By the end of 2021, there were around 50 hydrogen refuelling stations at Shell-branded outlets in Europe and North America where drivers can fill up their vehicles with hydrogen fuel.</p><p>In Germany, we are a member of the H2 Mobility joint venture to develop a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations for passenger cars. The venture operates more than 90 stations across Germany.</p><p>We offer carbon credits to passenger car drivers who want to offset the life-cycle emissions of the fuel they buy from Shell. We have made this offer available to passenger car drivers at more than 3,100 retail sites in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. In 2021, around 49 million litres of fuel sales were offset, accounting for 1% of our total volumes sold in markets where we have an offset programme.</p><p>Shell supports the European Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport by 13% by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROAD FREIGHT</emphasis>The road freight sector will be able to use battery electric power and hydrogen to get to net zero, as well as biogas, biofuels and liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in trucks and buses. In 2021, we added 18 LNG refuelling stations to our network, which now consists of 44 sites across Europe.</p><p>In 2022, we started construction of our bio-LNG liquefaction plant in Rheinland, Germany, which will provide bio-LNG to 4,000-5,000 LNG trucks by 2023. We also started offering bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all our customers in the Netherlands.</p><p>We are working with partners to increase the adoption of hydrogen and electric trucks. We signed an agreement with Daimler Truck AG, for example, to encourage the adoption of hydrogen trucks in Europe. Shell aims to build 150 hydrogen refuelling stations and supply around 5,000 Mercedes-Benz heavy-duty trucks with hydrogen by 2030.</p><p>In the USA, through our subsidiary Shell Recharge Solutions, we started providing electric charging infrastructure for trucks as part of a project led by Volvo Group and South Coast Air Quality Management District.</p><p>We offer nature-based carbon credits to fleet customers in 17 countries. This enables them to offset the emissions generated by the extraction, refining, distribution and use of the Shell fuel they buy.</p><p>We support policies and incentives in the European Union (EU) that would enable all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2040, to help the EU to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AVIATION</emphasis>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the aviation sector's most viable option for reducing its emissions in the short to medium term.</p><p>SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of the world's consumption of aviation fuel. Currently, Shell supplies SAF made by others. From 2024, we will start supplying customers with SAF produced at our Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In September 2021, we announced our ambition to produce around 2 million tonnes of SAF a year by 2025 and to have at least 10% of our global aviation fuel sales as SAF by 2030.</p><p>We are working with Rolls-Royce to test 100% SAF in airplane engines for the first time. In 2022, Shell was the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore where we have established the supply chain, from blending to distribution, for the Asian market.</p><p>We support tax incentives to help to drive down the cost of SAF around the world. We are advocating that the EU's 2030 target for the use of SAF doubles from 5% to 10%, and for governments and policymakers to encourage the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a net-zero emissions target for 2050.</p><p>The aviation sector needs verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions (NBS) to offset emissions, and we are offering these to airline customers such as Etihad Airways. Shell also sees a potential opportunity for hydrogen in aviation and we have taken a stake in ZeroAvia, a developer of hydrogen-electric aircraft.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINE</emphasis>The marine sector, like aviation, is hard to decarbonise because of the long life cycle of vessels and high upfront investment costs. Low-carbon solutions include hydrogen and ammonia in the long term, and LNG, biofuels and methanol in the short term. We are developing an initial portfolio of biofuels for shipping, and in 2021, we performed the first bio-LNG bunkering trial in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>We have completed more than 400 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations in seven countries and eight ports. In 2021, we carried out the first LNG bunkering operations in Gibraltar and Singapore. We are aiming to double the size of our LNG bunkering network by the mid-2020s, to around 15 major ports on key international trading routes. Shell is a member of a coalition that is calling for at least 5% zero-emissions fuel in international shipping by 2030, and for commercially viable zero- emissions vessels on deep-sea trade routes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIGHT INDUSTRY AND COMMERCIAL</emphasis>We serve customers across the industrial and commercial sectors where there is growing demand for decarbonisation products and services. More than 2,000 companies and organisations have made commitments to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. We are now forming strategic alliances with big multinational companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, helping them and us to achieve our net-zero aims.</p><p>For example, we are supplying Microsoft with renewable energy as part of our strategic alliance launched in 2020. In 2021, we advanced this partnership by signing several agreements to supply more than 500 MW of renewable energy, helping Microsoft to meet its goal of using 100% renewable energy by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEAVY INDUSTRY</emphasis>The heavy industrial sector includes utilities, process industries, such as chemicals, refining and industrial gases, and heavy manufacturing industries such as steel, cement, glass, and paper and pulp.</p><p>It is challenging to decarbonise these sectors rapidly because they involve complex processes and the required technologies are not available at scale. They also tend to involve processes that require high temperatures, dense energy storage and, in many cases, chemical reactions that produce CO2as part of the production process.</p><p>In 2021, we entered into several agreements with leading businesses to reduce emissions from heavy industry. We are exploring how hydrogen can help to reduce emissions from the steel sector, for example, in partnership with steel producers Baosteel in</p><p>China and Bluescope in Australia. Together with companies such as Pan-United Corporation in Singapore, we are developing opportunities to produce low-carbon concrete products.</p><p>In industrial hubs where we have low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, including in the Netherlands and Singapore, we are working with other companies to build the infrastructure required to support the decarbonisation of several facilities at one time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE</emphasis>Shell's ambition is to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce emissions where there are no currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. We seek to have access to an additional 25 million tonnes a year of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest site in Canada.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's operating costs for and investment in CCS opportunities amounted to around $146 million. Shell's share of captured and stored CO2was 0.4 million tonnes in 2021. By the end of 2021, our Quest CCS operations in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 6.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron), which started operating in August 2019, had stored more than 5 million tonnes of CO2by the end of 2021. Gorgon is the largest CCS operation in the world.</p><p>We have taken a final investment decision on the Northern Lights project in Norway which includes the transport and permanent storage of CO2in a reservoir beneath the sea. The first phase of this project will provide more than 0.25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CCS capacity by 2025. In total, we have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development.</p><p>Shell's CANSOLV CO2system is one of the leading large-scale, post-combustion, carbon capture technologies in commercial operation. After capture, the CO2is released as a pure stream that can be stored or used in other processes. In 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Shell's CANSOLV technology was selected for six projects with the potential to capture a combined 12 million tonnes of CO2a year [A]. These projects are in the UK and the USA and span the refining, chemicals and power sectors.</p><p>Read more about our CCS projects at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ccs\">www.shell.com/ccs</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS</emphasis>Carbon credits generated by high-quality nature-based projects may be used by Shell and our customers to offset emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and offset.</p><p>Shell is investing in the development of high-quality nature-based projects, which are independently audited for the quality and quantity of credits. In 2021, we invested $26 million in nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and the prevention of landscape degradation and destruction. We also invested $11 million in cookstove projects, which reduce the emissions from households traditionally using open fires for cooking.</p><p>In 2021, we expanded our offer of carbon credits to drivers and business customers who wish to compensate for the life-cycle CO2-equivalent emissions generated by their use of the Shell fuel they buy. We have made this offer available to our fleet customers in 17 countries and to retail customers at more than 3,100 service stations in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p>We retired around 6 million credits in 2021, which we estimate is the equivalent to 2.9 million cars being taken off the road for one year. Of these, 5.1 million credits were retired in association with the use of our energy products by our customers, with the remainder associated with the production of synthetic lubricants and emissions from Shell's business travel.</p><p>It is important that nature-based carbon credits are of high quality. In November 2021, Shell published a report 'Ensuring high- quality nature-based carbon credits' that sets out our expectations and approach to quality across our portfolio of nature-based solutions.</p><p>We expect the market for high-quality credits to grow sharply during the next decade. We expect to retire around 120 million credits in 2030.</p><p>[A] This is shared as an example of how Shell is developing and using technology to capture CO2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK</emphasis></p><p>Read about our planned total expenditure and expected returns across our businesses.</p><p>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTING IN NET ZERO</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS</emphasis></p><p>Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability to provide significant shareholder returns and to profitably transform our portfolio to meet our target of achieving net-zero emissions. They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets and to continue to provide the energy the world needs.</p><p>We are stepping up our investments in low- and zero-carbon energy where we see good opportunities for growth and strong returns. From the first quarter of 2022, we will report separately on the performance of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, which includes our integrated power, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and nature-based solutions businesses. We will also report separately on the performance of our Marketing business, which includes charging for electric vehicles and biofuels. We expect to provide more details on the performance of these activities as they grow.</p><p>We set out our planned total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) [A], and expected returns, across our businesses. Our strategy is to:</p><p>Increase our investments in Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions, with expected returns of 15-25% and more than 10% respectively.These businesses include our service stations, sales of gasoline and diesel, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. They focus on working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and are the foundations for the future businesses in Shell.Maintain our investments in our Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products businesses, with expected returns of 10-15% and 14-18% respectively.These businesses make and sell the products needed to enable the energy transition. They produce sustainable cash flows and give us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our low-carbon businesses. Limit our investments in our Upstream oil and gas business, with expected returns of 20-25%. Our Upstream business helps to provide the vital supply of oil and natural gas that the world needs today, and generates the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our portfolio.</p><p>Our targeted returns consider risks and uncertainties associated with our investments, and the scale of spending that is required to develop opportunities. For example, our expected returns in our Upstream business reflect the costs of exploration, feasibility studies and construction, as well as risks linked to commodity prices.</p><p>In 2021, our cash capital expenditure was $20 billion and our operating expenses were $36 billion. The table below shows how we expect several key metrics, including total expenditure, to evolve over time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021 delivery and outlook</emphasis></p><p>[A]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Including exploration expenses.[B]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excluding 2% CFFO from the Corporate segment.[C]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assumes Brent price of $60 per barrel.</p><p>[A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 for the definitions of cash capital expenditure and operating expenses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTING IN NET ZERO</emphasis></p><p>We are significantly increasing our expenditure on low- and zero-carbon energy, helping both Shell and its customers to meet their climate targets.</p><p>In 2025, we expect around 50% of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services across all our businesses. Most of that 50% is on low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels and hydrogen, power, nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage and convenience retail, including charging for electric vehicles. The remainder is on our chemicals and lubricants businesses, which do not produce energy products and do not create carbon emissions when used by our customers.</p><p>When measuring total expenditure, we focus on both cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure so that we can capture the total costs associated with accelerating the transition by working with our customers and in coalitions, key parts of our strategy.</p><p>Capital expenditure also relates to spending on acquiring and maintaining assets and equipment. It does not reflect the fact that some of our Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses are less capital intensive compared with our Upstream activities, and have higher operating costs.</p><p>We believe that the only true way to measure our progress in the energy transition is not just to look at changing spending patterns, but also to look at our progress against our net carbon intensity targets. In the short term, by the end of 2024, we are aiming for a reduction in our net carbon intensity of 9-12% compared with 2016, which is a significant step up on our 2-3% target for 2021. We have achieved this target with a 2.5% reduction compared with our 2016 base year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POLICIES AND GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read about our climate-related governance and policy engagement, and our disclosures linked to climate standards and benchmarks.</p><p>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE GOVERNANCE28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A JUST TRANSITION29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT</emphasis></p><p>We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy positions, examples of our advocacy, and reviews of our memberships of industry associations on our website (see <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>).</p><p>In October 2021, we published our updated global climate and energy transition policy positions to reflect our Powering Progress strategy and our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. We believe that by advocating these positions as we transform our business, we support the energy transition and the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Our detailed policy positions serve as a global framework for Shell's advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, coalitions, and other stakeholders globally, regionally and within countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS</emphasis>We have continued to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate-related policy positions. We have seen positive signs such as wider support for the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing and the regulation of methane emissions. We are clear that our memberships should strengthen and not undermine our support of the goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>We published our latest Industry Associations Climate Review in 2021, and a progress update in April 2022. This provides an update on industry associations where we found some misalignment and material misalignment, details of our climate lobbying in the European Union and the USA, and information on our payments to 36 associations. We will publish our next Industry Associations Climate Review in 2023 and plan to use our updated climate and energy transition policy positions as the basis of our assessments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Our climate governance begins with the Board's approval of our energy transition strategy and oversight of its implementation and delivery. In 2021, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding our energy transition strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets, including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. In 2021, the Board convened on 12 occasions and continued to regularly oversee the Powering Progress strategy and net-zero initiatives, including at the Board Strategy Day in June 2021.</p><p>An important part of Shell's governance is to help manage our transition to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We have further aligned remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees including Executive Committee members.</p><p>The progress in the energy transition measure, which makes up 15% of the annual bonus scorecard, had previously focused entirely on managing and reducing Shell's operational emissions. We decided to widen this to take account of our success at selling lower-carbon products and working with our customers to advance decarbonisation.</p><p>As a result, from 2022, the energy transition measure will be split into three components, each accounting for 5% of the scorecard:</p><p>selling low- and zero-carbon products;reducing Shell's operational emissions (our Scope 1 and 2 emissions); andpartnering to decarbonise (to be measured in terms of our progress in rolling out our electric vehicle charging network).</p><p>We also decided to introduce a customer excellence component in the operational excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard. This is because our Powering Progress strategy places great emphasis on building strong customer relationships to help transform Shell in the energy transition.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, based on performance between 2019 and the end of 2021, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p>For further details of Shell's governance structure, see the Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A JUST TRANSITION</emphasis></p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy has four main goals in support of our purpose. These goals include Powering Lives, which Shell does through its products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society.</p><p>Shell supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, which recognises the importance of a just transition. A just transition means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>We aim to publish our just transition guiding principles in the next year. We have joined two collaborations to help to inform our approach. In 2021, we became a member of IPIECA's Just Transition Task Force, which aims to help companies to develop their approaches to a just transition and share good practice. In January 2022, we joined Energy for a Just Transition, a coalition created by the non-governmental organisations Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and The B Team.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting staff</emphasis>In 2021, around 1,700 Shell employees completed about 2,300 courses related to new skills needed for the energy transition. These included courses on hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fair pay</emphasis>In 2022, Shell published its Fair Pay principles to increase transparency of our pay policies for staff.

It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology.</p><p>We were disappointed with this outcome as we had engaged with CA100+ and TPI to understand the differences in the methodologies used. We had clarified our 2035 and 2050 targets on that basis. However, we will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets are reflected in the next Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. We believe that this could result in a change to the Shell assessment to 'meets all criteria' for at least five indicators, 'partial, meets some criteria' for three indicators and one 'does not meet any criteria' rating for capital allocation.</p><p>As described in this report, we continue to believe that total expenditure, as measured by cash capital expenditure and operating expenses, rather than capital expenditure alone, is the best way to measure the scale of our financial investment in the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Read about our position on climate litigation and activism.</p><p>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Shell's energy transition strategy to accelerate our transformation into a low- and zero-carbon energy business is strongly supported by our shareholders. We have set climate targets that we believe are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Still, a ruling by the District Court of The Hague, in the Netherlands, and some activists, say that Shell's strategy should shift away from oil and gas even faster.</p><p>We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system, and that coordinated changes in energy supply are necessary. But achieving a net-zero emissions energy system requires changes in both energy supply and demand. If, for example, Shell decided to stop selling petrol to accelerate the energy transition, it would not mean that people would buy less petrol. Customers would buy it from other companies and total demand for fossil fuels would not change - it would only shrink Shell's customer base.</p><p>This would prevent us from delivering the energy the world needs today. It would also harm our work with customers to decarbonise different sectors, limit our effectiveness in playing a leading role in the energy transition in the years to come, and affect our financial strength and ability to generate value for shareholders today and in the future.</p><p>Shell is also being asked to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most aggressive energy scenarios and policy pathways for the sectors in which we operate. Shell alone cannot directly influence the energy choices made by our customers. It is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy, for example by mandating the sale of cars that run on low-carbon energy.</p><p>Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy. And we believe this strategy is the best for society, our customers and our shareholders.</p><p>Read more about why Shell has appealed the District Court ruling (in Dutch and English): Waarom Shell in hoger beroep gaat | Shell Nederland</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILESTONES</emphasis></p><p>[A] Cash capital expenditure.[B] Shell interest 44%, non-Shell-operated Ra.zen joint venture.[C] Excluding trading activities.[D] Excluding the impact of the Permian divestment.n/a = not applicable</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEPS ON THE PATH TO NET-ZERO EMISSIONS</emphasis>In 2021, our shareholders supported Shell's energy transition strategy.

We expect this to grow to around 50% in 2025.The first energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan vested at 180%, based on performance between 2019 and the end of 2021, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future. Offered an advisory vote on our progress in our energy transition strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021</emphasis></p><p>Launched our Powering Progress strategy setting out how we will transform into a net-zero emissions energy business. Offered an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy to shareholders. They overwhelmingly supported the strategy that we are now implementing.Took critical investment decisions in the production and sales of low-carbon fuels, solar and wind power, and hydrogen. At the same time, we made significant changes to our Upstream and refinery portfolios.Reshaped the organisation and formed new energy transition partnerships with some of the world's biggest companies. Set a new target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2021, we had achieved a reduction of 18%.Increased the weighting of the energy transition performance metric in the Long-term Incentive Plan from 10% to 20%. Moved Shell's headquarters to the UK.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020</emphasis></p><p>Announced target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.Extended the energy transition performance metric to around 16,500 employees through the Performance Share Plan (PSP).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2019</emphasis></p><p>Published our first Industry Associations Climate Review, which reviewed the alignment between our climate-related policy positions and those of 19 key industry associations of which we are a member.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2018</emphasis></p><p>Signed a joint statement with institutional investors on behalf of Climate Action 100+ announcing steps that Shell has taken to demonstrate alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2017</emphasis></p><p>Announced ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by around half by 2050, including the full life-cycle emissions from the use of our energy products by customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAUTIONARY NOTE</emphasis>The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\" are collectively referred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</emphasis>This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.</p><p>Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021 (available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/investor\">www.shell.com/investor</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be</p><p>considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, April 20, 2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHELL'S NET CARBON FOOTPRINT</emphasis>Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\" or \"Net Carbon Intensity\", which include Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\" or \"Net Carbon Intensity\" are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHELL'S NET-ZERO EMISSIONS TARGET</emphasis>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORWARD LOOKING NON-GAAP MEASURES</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</emphasis>As used in this Report, \"Accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"Carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e (CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>Linda M.

unlike carbon captured from forest growth, which can be reversed when trees are cut and burned.</p><p>By 2030, 5 million tonnes of CO2 should be removed every year from the atmosphere and permanently stored using technological solutions like DAC, the strategy says.</p><p>\"Another promising route is to turn the CO2 from a waste to a resource and use it as feedstock for the production of chemicals, plastics or fuels,\" the EU executives adds, saying the production of methanol from CO2 could pave the way for the production of green plastics, coolants, and resins.</p><p>By 2030, \"at least 20% of the carbon used in the chemical and plastic industry should be from non-fossil sources,\" the strategy says.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eu-draft-puts-spotlight-on-improving-carbon-sinks-to-tackle-climate-change/\">EU plan puts spotlight on carbon sinks to tackle climate change</url></h><p>Europe will need to increase the amount of carbon stored by its forests and wetlands to meet a new, more ambitious target for carbon removals in Europe, according to a leaked policy draft seen by EURACTIV.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and certification</emphasis></p><p>All these solutions will be underpinned by \"strong requirements on monitoring, reporting and verification\" to ensure the carbon is permanently stored.</p><p>This will be based on a certification system, which the European Commission plans to table in 2022 and could later serve as a basis for an international standard.</p><p>\"All carbon removals need to be accounted for in full transparency and by considering criteria such as the duration of the storage, the risk of reversal, the uncertainty of the measurement or the risk of carbon leakages increasing GHG emissions elsewhere,\" the communication says.</p><p>These will form the basis for creating a new EU market for carbon removals, working alongside the EU's existing Emissions Trading Scheme, which covers emissions from large industrial plants.</p><p>Carbon removal credits - or \"offsets\" in climate jargon - are already being traded on voluntary markets, and demand is already outweighing supply, the Commission notes, saying it is considering options \"for creating an EU regulated market for the period after 2030\".</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-plans-certification-scheme-for-carbon-dioxide-removals/\">EU plans certification scheme for carbon dioxide removals</url></h><p>The European Commission will publish a policy paper by the end of the year on \"the sustainable management of the carbon cycle\" - the first step towards an EU-wide certification scheme for negative emissions coming from agriculture, forestry and other sources, that will be tabled in 2022.</p><p>Offsetting schemes like tree-planting are controversial, however. Environmental groups have criticised them as a greenwashing tool that allows fossil fuel companies to continue polluting because their emissions would be compensated by withdrawals elsewhere.</p><p>Mary S. Booth, an ecological scientist at the Partnership for Policy Integrity (PFPI), a US-based campaign group, also warned about the \"astronomical\" cost of deploying technologies like Direct Air Capture (DAC) at scale, which involves transporting carbon across borders to available storage sites.</p><p>Booth also raised doubts about the Commission's target of storing 5 million tonnes of CO2 annually using carbon capture technologies, saying the amount vastly exceeds the scale of existing carbon storage facilities currently available.</p><p>\"For example, the Silverstone project mentioned on page 16 currently captures 12,000 tonnes annually at a cost of millions - about a quarter of 1% of the 5 million tonne goal.\"</p><p>Geden, the German scientist, agrees that the 2030 target \"might be a bit overambitious in terms of the timelines involved,\" especially since setting up a monitoring and verification system for a diverse set of CO2 removal methods won't be an easy task.</p><p>Yet, he says the 5 Mt technological removals \"are an important signal\" for the market. \"The signal that these removals should be delivered domestically is very important, so that stakeholders and member states do not prematurely combine this unfounded expectations about international offsets under UNFCCC Art. 6,\" he said.</p><p>Similarly, Booth said replacing 20% of chemical and plastic production in Europe would require \"tens of millions\" more tonnes of biomass, or a massive ramp-up of DAC - a solution she said was \"an extraordinarily expensive and resource-intensive approach to replace a small proportion of fossil fuel use.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pfpi.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PFPI-EU-Land-Sink-Target-report-Nov-23-2021.pdf\">A new study by PFPI</url>, published on Tuesday (23 November), concluded that EU plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 was based on \"unrealistic assumptions\" regarding carbon removals.</p><p>Under EU climate policy proposals for 2030, new forest growth would absorb 310 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 while another 250 Mt would be sequestered from biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), a technology that Booth says \"effectively does not exist\".</p><p>If those plans are approved, \"use of forest wood for fuel will increase 50%, contributing to the weak land sink target and making the EU reliant on BECCS,\" Booth warned.</p><p>She argues that a cheaper and more immediate solution to capture carbon is to halt deforestation and stop burning biomass to produce electricity.</p><p>EU member states currently pay out (EURO)10-(EURO)17 billion per year to subsidise biomass burning that contributes to pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, according to calculations by PFPI.</p><p>Instead, those subsidies \"should be reallocated to zero-emissions energy and restoring the declining forest carbon sink,\" she suggests.</p><p>\"To restore ecosystems and the forest carbon sink, the EU needs to harvest and burn less wood,\" the study concludes.</p><h><url

At the UN, Elena was the focal point on taxation and climate, advising senior government officials from low-income countries on the development of policies that generate revenues while protecting the environment. She also focused on carbon pricing and on the role of taxation in attaining environmentally-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). Prior to the UN, she was an economist for Palantir Economic Solutions and an advisor at Eni.</p><p>Head of Carbon is a newly expanded role at Wood Mackenzie, a trusted source of commercial intelligence for the world's natural resources sector. Elena will lead a team of five, responding to clients' demands for tools and intelligence to help them through the energy transition. This includes the assessment and mitigation of their carbon emissions and an understanding of the fast-changing landscape around carbon mechanisms.</p><p>Jonny Sultoon, Head of Markets &amp; Transitions, Energy Transition at Wood Mackenzie said: \"Carbon and wider greenhouse gas emissions are a strategic focus for a growing number of clients in all industries. Elena's appointment is particularly timely post-COP26, as governments have renewed or announced pledges to reduce both carbon and methane emissions to mitigate climate change, and industry and government will have to work collaboratively to align with these national commitments. Elena brings a cross-cutting understanding of the issues and governmental dynamics as well as stakeholder management experience. She is ideally suited to lead our carbon team.\"</p><p>Elena Belletti added: \"It is an exciting time to join Wood Mackenzie's growing Energy Transition Practice. There is increasing demand from clients for data and support on all aspects of carbon, from emissions, price markets and mechanisms and voluntary markets to nature-based solutions, mechanical carbon removal and more. I look forward to working with such a talented team as we help clients achieve a fair energy transition.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENDS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For further information, please contact Wood Mackenzie's media relations team:</emphasis></p><p>The Big Partnership+44 7711 281915<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2lfni9iYEjZQh6b8vP6iq1Kksca2nKQXlBoddCqWFv0aVbxa5h72EXQMMp75Zu2eU0hMWIWJthqLae1kLoVwtkQDwed9wXw1h6UYxesJg7TdESl1WkZDoT4TH5Q2iQm4\">woodmac@bigpartnership.co.uk</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Note to editors:</emphasis>Read Elena Belletti's thoughts on<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jowZTgb9a7dEEKBdliPoXWpezpKPf0q9yBSikELeVhx4snSZbYx0bi-bE5lXFIIzaBLhywfPttO5DqHHCS8eNDhFZYMbnwUHr76ATJDR7yM2O5vtnK8yhs3N7DRPG5oIXE9TeHfJHFojOwT0yZhVBtp8QbLpYD7_CdAGAV5F8TfcTvB32qXKJkxumrm9KQSw\">Carbon markets' COP26 breakthrough</url>in the latest edition of The Edge - weekly insight from Wood Mackenzie's Chairman and Chief Analyst Simon Flowers on the natural resources industry's biggest stories.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Wood Mackenzie</emphasis>Wood Mackenzie, a Verisk Analytics business, is a trusted source of commercial intelligence for the world's natural resources sector.

We are working hard to ensure the safety of our staff and contractors, and to support relief efforts. We have also announced our intention to withdraw from Russian oil and gas.</p><p>As well as being a human tragedy, the war has led to rising energy prices and uncertainty about supplies.</p><p>This extreme disruption in global energy markets has shown that affordable, secure, and reliable energy cannot be taken as a given. It must be protected and managed, through international co-operation: companies, governments and wider society working together. This co-operation includes working with our shareholders and maintaining their support.</p><p>Shell will play a leading role as the world's energy systems change. We will continue to supply the oil and gas that people need today. As one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we can ship natural gas to where it is needed most. At the same time, we are accelerating the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy, which is at the heart of our strategy.</p><p>Essentially, an accelerated transition is the best way to ensure security of energy supplies. It is also the best way to help people in some parts of the world who do not yet have access to energy, which is essential for a better quality of life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>We firmly believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The actions Shell takes over the coming years, and our progress against our short- and medium-term targets, will be crucial steps to ensure that we become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>In the first year of our Powering Progress strategy, we have laid the foundations for success. We have taken critical investment decisions in the production of low-carbon fuels, solar and wind power, and hydrogen. We have made significant changes to our Upstream and refinery portfolios, we reshaped the organisation and we simplified the company and its share structure. We have formed partnerships with some of the world's biggest companies in sectors from aviation to road transport and technology.</p><p>In 2021, we added an ambitious new target to halve absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2), compared with 2016 levels and on a net basis. We are well on our way with an 18% reduction by the end of 2021.</p><p>For comparison, we estimate that global energy- and fossil-related CO2emissions actually rose by 2.4% in the period between the end of 2016 and the end of 2021, based on International Energy Agency (IEA) and other data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Change in demand</emphasis>We believe that for the world to decarbonise, a dramatic change in demand for energy is just as critical as changes to supply. That is why an essential part of Shell's strategy is working with our customers across different sectors to reduce emissions.</p><p>We are helping our customers to identify and use low- and zero-carbon alternatives to the energy products they have used for many decades: renewable electricity and hydrogen to power homes, cars, trucks, businesses, and industry; biofuels for cars, trucks and planes; LNG for power, trucks and ships; and carbon capture and storage and nature-based carbon offsets to deal with any remaining emissions.</p><p>This is not only the right approach for the world. It also makes good business sense. We see great business opportunities for Shell in the fast-growing low- and zero-carbon markets where we are well positioned to provide the different products and solutions our customers need.</p><p>We are leading the way in new technologies that will help to decarbonise our operations, and to reduce emissions for our customers. Our scientists are developing new ways to store hydrogen safely, including underground, for example, which will be critical to ensure secure, large-scale supplies of hydrogen to our industrial customers in the future. And our engineers are designing LNG projects which are powered by renewable electricity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Remuneration</emphasis>We included progress in the energy transition in the calculation of the annual bonus for almost all Shell's employees in 2021. Now we are going further. From 2022, we have extended how we measure progress to cover three key themes; reducing emissions from our operations, sales of low- and zero-carbon products and partnering with others to decarbonise road transport.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stronger and more profitable</emphasis>Last year, 89% of Shell's shareholders voted in favour of our energy transition strategy. We are implementing that strategy, and this year we are asking shareholders to vote on our progress, as we will do every year until 2050. The next energy transition strategy update for an advisory vote is in 2024 and we will give another update on our progress next year.</p><p>Securing shareholder support as we implement our Powering Progress strategy is good governance. The vote on our progress towards our targets and plans is purely advisory and will not be binding on our shareholders. The legal responsibility for Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>When I look at what we have achieved in 2021, and our plans for the years ahead, I believe that Shell will become stronger and more profitable by providing the low- and zero-carbon energy products and services that our customers need. That is good for our shareholders. It is good for our customers. It is also good for the world's climate goals and the planet.</p><p>The continued support of our shareholders is critical for us to become a net-zero emissions energy business and a leader in the energy transition. We believe that Shell's energy transition strategy is in the best interests of our shareholders as a whole and wider society.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 20 in support of the progress that Shell has made in its energy transition strategy over the past year as described in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTION</emphasis></p><p>Ben van Beurden, CEO, Shell plc</p><p>In a time of great uncertainty, it is vital that our long-term energy transition strategy remains on track. This report shows the strong progress we have made towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>It will take bold moves for Shell to achieve net zero. In 2021, we took some significant steps. We completed one of the biggest restructurings in our history, making us a more agile company. We decided to simplify our share structure, and moved Shell's headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets</emphasis>In this Energy Transition Progress Report, we show our progress against our climate targets in the year since our shareholders overwhelmingly supported our energy transition strategy.</p><p>We are making significant progress in a long-term plan. Crucially, we set a new target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2021, we had achieved a reduction of 18%. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2-3% by the end of 2021, also compared with 2016.</p><p>Now our targets start to get more ambitious. We are working towards a 9-12% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2024, and a 20% reduction by 2030. To put our targets into context, the International Energy Agency Net Zero by 2050 scenario suggests that the transport sector, which accounts for most of Shell's emissions, needs to see a reduction in net carbon intensity of 18% by 2030.</p><p>From today, our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 is no longer conditional on society's progress, marking a further step forwards. This reflects the leading role we will play in the energy transition. We must find ways to be ahead of society where we can, while remaining a successful and profitable company.</p><p>As we have seen from the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world needs to take urgent action to meet its climate goals. While countries, companies and individuals are making significant changes, there is still a risk that the world will not achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. This could mean that Shell would find it hard to meet its 2050 target as well. We are rising to that challenge and will demonstrate over time how we will reach our goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working sector by sector</emphasis>We are investing in low- and zero-carbon products such as renewable electricity, hydrogen, biofuels and chemicals. We are building a leading hydrogen business, and now operate 10% of total electrolyser capacity in the world. We are already one of the world's largest producers of biofuels through our joint venture in Brazil. And last year we started building one of Europe's biggest biofuels facilities.</p><p>Crucially, we are working sector by sector to identify the low- and zero-carbon products and services that our customers need. And we are laying the foundations for future expansion by building capacity and expertise. At the beginning of 2022, for example, with our joint-venture partners, we won bids to develop 5 gigawatts of floating wind power in the UK, enough to power 6 million homes. That is more than double the number of homes in Scotland.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in net zero</emphasis>Our Upstream business continues to provide the oil and gas the world needs today, and generates the returns to fund distributions to shareholders and our investments in the energy transition. Our production and sales of oil and gas will decrease in the coming years as we transform our business.</p><p>At the same time, our investments in the energy system of the future will increase significantly. By 2025, we expect around half of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services including biofuels, hydrogen, power, charging for electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, nature-based solutions, chemicals and lubricants. In 2022, we expect that around one third of our total expenditure will be on these low- and zero- carbon products and services.</p><p>Our planned investments in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and the UK put us among the leading investors in the energy transition there. In the UK, for example, we plan to invest \u00a320-25 billion ($26-33 billion) over the next ten years, mostly in low- and zero-carbon projects including offshore wind, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, subject to Board approval.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholder engagement</emphasis>A central part of our Powering Progress strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. We have made good progress here too. In 2021, we produced a strong financial performance and announced an $8.5 billion share buyback programme in the first half of 2022.</p><p>We will continue our dialogue with shareholders as Shell transforms and evolves. It is important that we are transparent about our progress in the energy transition. From the first quarter of 2022, we intend to publish more information about the profitability of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, something that investors have asked for.</p><p>We believe that our strategy delivers secure and reliable energy that will accelerate the energy transition and deliver strong profits and returns to shareholders. I ask our shareholders to vote for Resolution 20 in support of our progress towards our targets and milestones as we accelerate towards net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON PERFORMANCE AT A GLANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS SUMMARY</emphasis></p><p>We are transforming into a net-zero emissions energy business. In 2021 and the beginning of 2022 we:</p><p>Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 18%, and reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2.5%, both by the end of 2021 compared with 2016.Formed more than 50 collaborations with other leading companies aiming to be at the forefront of the energy transition. Continued to build a material power business. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. We have 4.7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.Expanded our hydrogen business. We have started production from 30 megawatts (MW) of electrolysers that can produce around 4,300 tonnes a year of decarbonised hydrogen. We are looking to take final investment decisions on 10 times this capacity in 2022. We own and operate 10% of global electrolyser capacity today.Took a final investment decision on a facility in the Netherlands to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024.Continued to build the infrastructure that our customers will need as they move to low- and zero-carbon energy.Expanded our electric vehicle charging network to almost 90,000 charge points at the end of 2021, from around 60,000 in 2020.Increased the number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) refuelling sites in Europe and increased the number of sites for hydrogen refuelling in Europe, North America and China.Announced our ambition for SAF to make up at least 10% of our aviation fuel sales by 2030.Expanded our LNG bunkering operations, including the world's first bio-LNG bunkering, to help to reduce emissions from the marine sector. We also worked with others on programmes to develop hydrogen fuel cell propulsion for ships.Worked with customers across sectors such as commercial, light industry and technology to decarbonise their energy use by providing renewable electricity.Developed partnerships in the heavy industry sector to explore how hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be used to reduce global carbon emissions.Invested in CCS. We have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development. Retired around 6 million tonnes of nature-based credits, excluding trading activities, in 2021.Supported climate-related government policies that advance the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OUR PERFORMANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read in more detail about our performance against our climate targets and how we are working to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>09\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS11\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NET CARBON INTENSITY</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING OUR ABSOLUTE SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS</emphasis>To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we are transforming how we produce energy as we continue to meet growing demand.</p><p>In October 2021, we set a new target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.</p><p>We have identified six main ways to decarbonise our operations:</p><p>making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon projects. We are also divesting assets and reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining five refineries into low-carbon energy and chemicals parks; using more renewable electricity to power our operations;developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities; and, if required, using nature-based solutions to offset any remaining emissions from our operations.</p><p>The chart below illustrates our current plans to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PROGRESS IN 2021</emphasis>By the end of 2021, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control to 68 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent, an 18% reduction compared with 2016, our base year. This shows significant progress towards achieving our target of a 50% reduction by 2030.</p><p>In 2021, we improved energy efficiency across our assets. For example, we implemented a project to reduce power requirements for gas compression at our QGC natural gas project in Australia. Most of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions came from our Downstream business, in particular from our refining activities. Portfolio changes, such as the sale of the Martinez and Puget Sound refineries in the USA, and the transformation of our Bukom refinery in Singapore into a low-carbon energy and chemicals park, also helped to reduce emissions from our operations. Shell's Annual Report and Accounts provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p>Methane emissions are included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting. In 2021, we reduced total methane emissions from our operations by 18% to 55,000 tonnes, compared with 67,000 tonnes in 2020. In 2021, our methane emissions intensity averaged 0.06% for assets with gas available for sale, well within our target to maintain less than 0.2% by 2025.</p><p>In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine gas flaring from our Upstream operations to 2025 from 2030. In 2021, routine flaring from our Upstream operations fell to 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.3 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Despite this, our overall flaring increased from 0.8 million tonnes of hydrocarbons to 1.0 million tonnes because of non-routine flaring, mainly as a result of operational issues in Nigeria. Shell's Sustainability Report provides more information about flaring.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NET</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INTENSITY</emphasis></p><p>We are working with our customers to provide the energy they need today, and to accelerate the energy transition. This means changing our portfolio of products as we provide low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>If our customers are not able to use these products, we will help them to store and offset remaining emissions through carbon capture and storage and by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions. By 2050, we will no longer serve customers who have unmitigated carbon emissions.</p><p>To achieve net zero, we must reduce emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, to zero. We must also cut emissions from the use of energy products sold by Shell (Scope 3), by reducing sales of oil and gas products and growing sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress, which measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. Crucially, it reflects both a reduction in sales of oil and gas products, and growth in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services.</p><p>Reducing net carbon intensity encourages us to work with our customers in sectors such as aviation and shipping to decarbonise their use of energy, while still providing the oil and gas they need today. And, as an intensity metric, it measures the true transformation that is happening in the company as we implement our energy transition strategy.</p><p>Other metrics, such as a simple total carbon emissions metric, would reflect how our sales of oil and gas products are shrinking, but would not provide information on how we are changing our mix of products.</p><p>We believe that our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes, and our total absolute emissions were 1.4 gigatonnes in 2021. We are working to reduce them to net zero by 2050. This is the same as a 100% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALIGNED WITH PARIS</emphasis>We believe our targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00c5\u00e3C above pre-industrial levels. There is no standard methodology to determine how to align companies' plans and targets with the goal of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>We studied a subset of IPCC scenarios that achieve that goal and were focused on earlier action and placed less reliance on the use of carbon sinks. From this subset, we calculated the range of carbon intensity pathways over time. We set our targets to fall within these pathways.</p><p>Our calculations show that the net carbon intensity of the energy mix will need to fall by around 15-35% by 2030. Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 20% by 2030.</p><p>[A] We measure net carbon intensity using our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REDUCING CARBON INTENSITY</emphasis>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing our sales of low-carbon products and services. The chart below illustrates how this change in our product mix could help us to achieve our target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 20% by 2030.</p><p>Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products.</p><p>Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products.</p><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Nature-based solutions offset carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and steel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON INTENSITY PROGRESS</emphasis>We achieved our short-term target to reduce our net carbon intensity by 2-3% compared with 2016, the base year, with a 2.5% reduction in 2021. We achieved this reduction by shifting our portfolio to lower-carbon energy products such as natural gas, power and biofuels, which now make up 55% of our total energy sales, compared with 46% in 2016.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's net carbon intensity was 77 gCO\u2082e/MJ, a 2.7% increase from the previous year. This increase was largely because we made a change in our methodology to better calculate the carbon intensity of our electricity sales. This approach distinguishes between the certified renewable electricity we purchase, electricity from our own generation, or purchased through a power purchase agreement, and electricity purchased from the grid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SECTORAL DECARBONISATION</emphasis></p><p>Read how Shell is working with customers, sector by sector, to help to transform the energy system.</p><p>15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BUILDING NEW SUPPLY CHAINS19\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY SYSTEM</emphasis></p><p>To help to transform the energy system, Shell is working with customers, sector by sector.

This is more than twice the electricity we sell today.</p><p>We provide electricity and smart energy solutions to residential, commercial and industrial customers through direct electricity sales, and services such as electricity storage. We had 1.6 million retail customers worldwide by the end of February 2022, compared with 900,000 at the end of 2020. This increase is largely because we added more than 500,000 retail customers in the UK in 2021, and around 185,000 retail customers In Australia following our acquisition of PowerShop in 2022. Our largest markets for commercial and industrial customers are in Australia and the USA.</p><p>In addition to the investments we have made in building our customer base, we are also investing in building our generation capacity. We have 4.7 GW of renewable generation capacity in operation, under construction and/or committed for sale. We have a further 38 GW of renewable generation capacity in our pipeline of future projects.</p><p>We have added to our renewable generation capabilities by acquiring Savion, a US-based solar and energy storage specialist; Solar-Konzept Italia, an Italian solar specialist; and WestWind, a wind specialist based in Australia.</p><p>Shell is one of the leading developers of floating wind farms in the world with prototypes, pilot farms and commercial-scale projects in development in France, Ireland, Norway, Scotland and South Korea.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HYDROGEN</emphasis>We are expanding our hydrogen projects to serve sectors such as road freight, steel and cement. These projects include the production, storage and shipping of hydrogen.</p><p>As we grow, we are using Shell's integrated businesses to connect the different parts of the hydrogen system, from offshore wind to power the electrolysers that produce hydrogen, to using hydrogen in our energy and chemicals parks and eventually, supplying it through our retail network.</p><p>We are increasing our capacity, investing in infrastructure and helping to increase the scale and the adoption of hydrogen across different sectors. We have increased our total electrolyser capacity from 2 MW to 30 MW, 10% of the global capacity of installed electrolysers in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p><p>We have added a 20 MW electrolyser in China, which at the time was the largest in the world, and a 10 MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser in Germany, the biggest of its kind in Europe. The electrolysers can produce 3,000 tonnes and 1,300 tonnes of decarbonised hydrogen a year respectively.</p><p>In 2022, with our partners, we plan to take final investment decisions on electrolysers with a total capacity of 300 MW. In the Netherlands, we plan to build a 200 MW electrolyser, which is expected to start operations by 2024 and to produce around 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year. In Germany, we plan to take a final investment decision on a 100 MW electrolyser in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIOFUELS</emphasis>The transport sector accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the IEA. Biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodiesel, bioethanol and renewable natural gas are low-carbon fuels which can be used by customers to reduce their emissions without having to change their airplanes, cars, trucks, or ships.</p><p>In 2021, around 9.1 billion litres of biofuels were blended into Shell's fuels worldwide, around 5.8% of global biofuels consumption, according to figures from the IEA.</p><p>Shell and our Brazilian joint venture Ra\u00edzen, in which Shell has a 44% share, are together among the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels for the mobility sector. Ra\u00edzen produced 2.5 billion litres of first-generation ethanol in 2021, which is around 2.5% of global ethanol production, according to the IEA. It also acquired Biosev, adding a further 50% to its production capacity. And it took a final investment decision on its second-generation cellulosic ethanol facility, which will have a capacity of 80 million litres and is expected to start operations in 2023.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell took a final investment decision on a facility to produce 820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year. This facility will be one of the largest in Europe to produce SAF and renewable diesel made from waste, and is expected to start production in 2024. We are considering further investments to produce SAF at our energy and chemicals parks in Germany and Singapore.</p><p>As well as liquid biofuels, we are developing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG). Our newly operational Junction City RNG plant in Oregon is the largest plant in the USA to produce natural gas from agricultural residues, with an annual capacity of 736,000 million British thermal units.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONVENTIONAL</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FUELS</emphasis>The world will need less oil and gas as it moves to a low- and zero-carbon energy system. This transition is reflected in Shell's changing portfolio. In 2021, our oil production was 3.9% lower than in the previous year, as a result of divestments and natural decline. It was 7.6% lower than in 2019, when our oil production peaked. We expect our oil production to decline by an average of 1-2% a year to 2030.</p><p>We plan to reduce annual spending on exploration to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025.</p><p>We are transforming our refineries into five energy and chemicals parks which will produce low-carbon and synthetic fuels, as well as bitumen, lubricants and chemicals. The transformation of our refineries will help us to reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 91 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 2020 to 45 mtpa by 2030. In 2021, we reduced our production of traditional fuels to 71 mtpa.</p><p>Liquified natural gas (LNG) plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower- carbon alternative. We are adding around 7 mtpa of new LNG capacity, which is under construction and expected to be on stream around the middle of the decade. This includes our LNG Canada joint venture and our interest in a new LNG processing unit in Nigeria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANGING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS</emphasis></p><p>A critical part of our success in the energy transition will be our ability to work sector by sector with customers and stakeholders. By listening to our customers, learning from them and working with them, we can understand what they value and need as the world moves towards a lower-carbon future. We aim to use such insights to profitably provide the low-carbon products and services they will want to buy.</p><p>We are also working with those operating in each sector, and with policymakers, to increase ambition around reducing emissions, better enable changes to infrastructure, and provide favourable conditions for investing in lower-carbon options. We are joining coalitions focused on decarbonising sectors and working with others to produce reports that identify and show pathways to reduce emissions in some of the sectors that are hardest to abate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PERSONAL MOBILITY</emphasis>Shell is the world's largest mobility retailer, with more than 46,000 service stations operating in more than 80 markets. We believe the biggest opportunity to decarbonise our portfolio is by offering more low-carbon alternatives such as biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles.</p><p>In 2021, Shell operated almost 90,000 electric vehicle charge points, up from around 60,000 in the previous year. We aim to increase this to more than 500,000 by 2025, and to 2.5 million by 2030. That is around 7% of the expected number of charge points in the world by 2030, according to the IEA. In January 2021, we acquired ubitricity, a European provider of on-street charging for electric vehicles through lamp posts.</p><p>We are also expanding our network of hydrogen refuelling stations. By the end of 2021, there were around 50 hydrogen refuelling stations at Shell-branded outlets in Europe and North America where drivers can fill up their vehicles with hydrogen fuel.</p><p>In Germany, we are a member of the H2 Mobility joint venture to develop a nationwide network of hydrogen refuelling stations for passenger cars. The venture operates more than 90 stations across Germany.</p><p>We offer carbon credits to passenger car drivers who want to offset the life-cycle emissions of the fuel they buy from Shell. We have made this offer available to passenger car drivers at more than 3,100 retail sites in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK. In 2021, around 49 million litres of fuel sales were offset, accounting for 1% of our total volumes sold in markets where we have an offset programme.</p><p>Shell supports the European Commission's proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport by 13% by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROAD FREIGHT</emphasis>The road freight sector will be able to use battery electric power and hydrogen to get to net zero, as well as biogas, biofuels and liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in trucks and buses. In 2021, we added 18 LNG refuelling stations to our network, which now consists of 44 sites across Europe.</p><p>In 2022, we started construction of our bio-LNG liquefaction plant in Rheinland, Germany, which will provide bio-LNG to 4,000-5,000 LNG trucks by 2023. We also started offering bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all our customers in the Netherlands.</p><p>We are working with partners to increase the adoption of hydrogen and electric trucks. We signed an agreement with Daimler Truck AG, for example, to encourage the adoption of hydrogen trucks in Europe. Shell aims to build 150 hydrogen refuelling stations and supply around 5,000 Mercedes-Benz heavy-duty trucks with hydrogen by 2030.</p><p>In the USA, through our subsidiary Shell Recharge Solutions, we started providing electric charging infrastructure for trucks as part of a project led by Volvo Group and South Coast Air Quality Management District.</p><p>We offer nature-based carbon credits to fleet customers in 17 countries. This enables them to offset the emissions generated by the extraction, refining, distribution and use of the Shell fuel they buy.</p><p>We support policies and incentives in the European Union (EU) that would enable all new medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2040, to help the EU to meet its 2050 carbon neutrality goal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AVIATION</emphasis>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the aviation sector's most viable option for reducing its emissions in the short to medium term.</p><p>SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of the world's consumption of aviation fuel. Currently, Shell supplies SAF made by others. From 2024, we will start supplying customers with SAF produced at our Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In September 2021, we announced our ambition to produce around 2 million tonnes of SAF a year by 2025 and to have at least 10% of our global aviation fuel sales as SAF by 2030.</p><p>We are working with Rolls-Royce to test 100% SAF in airplane engines for the first time. In 2022, Shell was the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore where we have established the supply chain, from blending to distribution, for the Asian market.</p><p>We support tax incentives to help to drive down the cost of SAF around the world. We are advocating that the EU's 2030 target for the use of SAF doubles from 5% to 10%, and for governments and policymakers to encourage the International Civil Aviation Organization to adopt a net-zero emissions target for 2050.</p><p>The aviation sector needs verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions (NBS) to offset emissions, and we are offering these to airline customers such as Etihad Airways. Shell also sees a potential opportunity for hydrogen in aviation and we have taken a stake in ZeroAvia, a developer of hydrogen-electric aircraft.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MARINE</emphasis>The marine sector, like aviation, is hard to decarbonise because of the long life cycle of vessels and high upfront investment costs. Low-carbon solutions include hydrogen and ammonia in the long term, and LNG, biofuels and methanol in the short term. We are developing an initial portfolio of biofuels for shipping, and in 2021, we performed the first bio-LNG bunkering trial in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p><p>We have completed more than 400 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations in seven countries and eight ports. In 2021, we carried out the first LNG bunkering operations in Gibraltar and Singapore. We are aiming to double the size of our LNG bunkering network by the mid-2020s, to around 15 major ports on key international trading routes. Shell is a member of a coalition that is calling for at least 5% zero-emissions fuel in international shipping by 2030, and for commercially viable zero- emissions vessels on deep-sea trade routes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LIGHT INDUSTRY AND COMMERCIAL</emphasis>We serve customers across the industrial and commercial sectors where there is growing demand for decarbonisation products and services. More than 2,000 companies and organisations have made commitments to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. We are now forming strategic alliances with big multinational companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, helping them and us to achieve our net-zero aims.</p><p>For example, we are supplying Microsoft with renewable energy as part of our strategic alliance launched in 2020. In 2021, we advanced this partnership by signing several agreements to supply more than 500 MW of renewable energy, helping Microsoft to meet its goal of using 100% renewable energy by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEAVY INDUSTRY</emphasis>The heavy industrial sector includes utilities, process industries, such as chemicals, refining and industrial gases, and heavy manufacturing industries such as steel, cement, glass, and paper and pulp.</p><p>It is challenging to decarbonise these sectors rapidly because they involve complex processes and the required technologies are not available at scale. They also tend to involve processes that require high temperatures, dense energy storage and, in many cases, chemical reactions that produce CO2as part of the production process.</p><p>In 2021, we entered into several agreements with leading businesses to reduce emissions from heavy industry. We are exploring how hydrogen can help to reduce emissions from the steel sector, for example, in partnership with steel producers Baosteel in</p><p>China and Bluescope in Australia. Together with companies such as Pan-United Corporation in Singapore, we are developing opportunities to produce low-carbon concrete products.</p><p>In industrial hubs where we have low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, including in the Netherlands and Singapore, we are working with other companies to build the infrastructure required to support the decarbonisation of several facilities at one time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE</emphasis>Shell's ambition is to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce emissions where there are no currently scalable low-carbon alternatives. We seek to have access to an additional 25 million tonnes a year of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest site in Canada.</p><p>In 2021, Shell's operating costs for and investment in CCS opportunities amounted to around $146 million. Shell's share of captured and stored CO2was 0.4 million tonnes in 2021. By the end of 2021, our Quest CCS operations in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 6.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron), which started operating in August 2019, had stored more than 5 million tonnes of CO2by the end of 2021. Gorgon is the largest CCS operation in the world.</p><p>We have taken a final investment decision on the Northern Lights project in Norway which includes the transport and permanent storage of CO2in a reservoir beneath the sea. The first phase of this project will provide more than 0.25 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CCS capacity by 2025. In total, we have two CCS projects in operation and more than 10 under development.</p><p>Shell's CANSOLV CO2system is one of the leading large-scale, post-combustion, carbon capture technologies in commercial operation. After capture, the CO2is released as a pure stream that can be stored or used in other processes. In 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Shell's CANSOLV technology was selected for six projects with the potential to capture a combined 12 million tonnes of CO2a year [A]. These projects are in the UK and the USA and span the refining, chemicals and power sectors.</p><p>Read more about our CCS projects at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ccs\">www.shell.com/ccs</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS</emphasis>Carbon credits generated by high-quality nature-based projects may be used by Shell and our customers to offset emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and offset.</p><p>Shell is investing in the development of high-quality nature-based projects, which are independently audited for the quality and quantity of credits. In 2021, we invested $26 million in nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and the prevention of landscape degradation and destruction. We also invested $11 million in cookstove projects, which reduce the emissions from households traditionally using open fires for cooking.</p><p>In 2021, we expanded our offer of carbon credits to drivers and business customers who wish to compensate for the life-cycle CO2-equivalent emissions generated by their use of the Shell fuel they buy. We have made this offer available to our fleet customers in 17 countries and to retail customers at more than 3,100 service stations in Austria, Canada, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK.</p><p>We retired around 6 million credits in 2021, which we estimate is the equivalent to 2.9 million cars being taken off the road for one year. Of these, 5.1 million credits were retired in association with the use of our energy products by our customers, with the remainder associated with the production of synthetic lubricants and emissions from Shell's business travel.</p><p>It is important that nature-based carbon credits are of high quality. In November 2021, Shell published a report 'Ensuring high- quality nature-based carbon credits' that sets out our expectations and approach to quality across our portfolio of nature-based solutions.</p><p>We expect the market for high-quality credits to grow sharply during the next decade. We expect to retire around 120 million credits in 2030.</p><p>[A] This is shared as an example of how Shell is developing and using technology to capture CO2.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK</emphasis></p><p>Read about our planned total expenditure and expected returns across our businesses.</p><p>24\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INVESTING IN NET ZERO</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENTS AND RETURNS</emphasis></p><p>Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability to provide significant shareholder returns and to profitably transform our portfolio to meet our target of achieving net-zero emissions. They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets and to continue to provide the energy the world needs.</p><p>We are stepping up our investments in low- and zero-carbon energy where we see good opportunities for growth and strong returns. From the first quarter of 2022, we will report separately on the performance of our Renewables and Energy Solutions business, which includes our integrated power, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and nature-based solutions businesses. We will also report separately on the performance of our Marketing business, which includes charging for electric vehicles and biofuels. We expect to provide more details on the performance of these activities as they grow.</p><p>We set out our planned total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) [A], and expected returns, across our businesses. Our strategy is to:</p><p>Increase our investments in Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions, with expected returns of 15-25% and more than 10% respectively.[B]These businesses include our service stations, sales of gasoline and diesel, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. They focus on working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and are the foundations for the future businesses in Shell.Maintain our investments in our Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products businesses, with expected returns of 14-18% and 10-15% respectively. [C]These businesses make and sell the products needed to enable the energy transition. They produce sustainable cash flows and give us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our low-carbon businesses. Limit our investments in our Upstream oil and gas business, with expected returns of 20-25%. Our Upstream business helps to provide the vital supply of oil and natural gas that the world needs today, and generates the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our portfolio.</p><p>Our targeted returns consider risks and uncertainties associated with our investments, and the scale of spending that is required to develop opportunities. For example, our expected returns in our Upstream business reflect the costs of exploration, feasibility studies and construction, as well as risks linked to commodity prices.</p><p>In 2021, our cash capital expenditure was $20 billion and our operating expenses were $36 billion. The table below shows how we expect several key metrics, including total expenditure, to evolve over time.</p><p>[A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 for the definitions of cash capital expenditure and operating expenses.[B] The IRR target for Renewables and Energy Solutions covers Integrated Power only - note added on April 22, 2022 for additional clarification.[C] Corrected because of typographical error.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021 delivery and outlook</emphasis></p><p>[A]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Including exploration expenses.[B]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Excluding 2% CFFO from the Corporate segment.[C]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assumes Brent price of $60 per barrel.[D]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IRR target for Renewables and Energy Solutions covers Integrated Power only (note added on April 22, 2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 for additional clarification).[E] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corrected because of typographical error.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTING IN NET ZERO</emphasis></p><p>We are significantly increasing our expenditure on low- and zero-carbon energy, helping both Shell and its customers to meet their climate targets.</p><p>In 2025, we expect around 50% of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure) to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services across all our businesses. Most of that 50% is on low- and zero-carbon energy products and services such as biofuels and hydrogen, power, nature-based solutions, carbon capture and storage and convenience retail, including charging for electric vehicles. The remainder is on our chemicals and lubricants businesses, which do not produce energy products and do not create carbon emissions when used by our customers.</p><p>When measuring total expenditure, we focus on both cash capital expenditure and operating expenditure so that we can capture the total costs associated with accelerating the transition by working with our customers and in coalitions, key parts of our strategy.</p><p>Capital expenditure also relates to spending on acquiring and maintaining assets and equipment. It does not reflect the fact that some of our Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses are less capital intensive compared with our Upstream activities, and have higher operating costs.</p><p>We believe that the only true way to measure our progress in the energy transition is not just to look at changing spending patterns, but also to look at our progress against our net carbon intensity targets. In the short term, by the end of 2024, we are aiming for a reduction in our net carbon intensity of 9-12% compared with 2016, which is a significant step up on our 2-3% target for 2021. We have achieved this target with a 2.5% reduction compared with our 2016 base year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POLICIES AND GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Read about our climate-related governance and policy engagement, and our disclosures linked to climate standards and benchmarks.</p><p>27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE GOVERNANCE28\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A JUST TRANSITION29\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENT</emphasis></p><p>We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy positions, examples of our advocacy, and reviews of our memberships of industry associations on our website (see <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>).</p><p>In October 2021, we published our updated global climate and energy transition policy positions to reflect our Powering Progress strategy and our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. We believe that by advocating these positions as we transform our business, we support the energy transition and the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Our detailed policy positions serve as a global framework for Shell's advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, coalitions, and other stakeholders globally, regionally and within countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS</emphasis>We have continued to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate-related policy positions. We have seen positive signs such as wider support for the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing and the regulation of methane emissions. We are clear that our memberships should strengthen and not undermine our support of the goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>We published our latest Industry Associations Climate Review in 2021, and a progress update in April 2022. This provides an update on industry associations where we found some misalignment and material misalignment, details of our climate lobbying in the European Union and the USA, and information on our payments to 36 associations. We will publish our next Industry Associations Climate Review in 2023 and plan to use our updated climate and energy transition policy positions as the basis of our assessments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE GOVERNANCE</emphasis></p><p>Our climate governance begins with the Board's approval of our energy transition strategy and oversight of its implementation and delivery. In 2021, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding our energy transition strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets, including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. In 2021, the Board convened on 12 occasions and continued to regularly oversee the Powering Progress strategy and net-zero initiatives, including at the Board Strategy Day in June 2021.</p><p>An important part of Shell's governance is to help manage our transition to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We have further aligned remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees including Executive Committee members.</p><p>The progress in the energy transition measure, which makes up 15% of the annual bonus scorecard, had previously focused entirely on managing and reducing Shell's operational emissions. We decided to widen this to take account of our success at selling lower-carbon products and working with our customers to advance decarbonisation.</p><p>As a result, from 2022, the energy transition measure will be split into three components, each accounting for 5% of the scorecard:</p><p>selling low- and zero-carbon products;reducing Shell's operational emissions (our Scope 1 and 2 emissions); andpartnering to decarbonise (to be measured in terms of our progress in rolling out our electric vehicle charging network).</p><p>We also decided to introduce a customer excellence component in the operational excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard. This is because our Powering Progress strategy places great emphasis on building strong customer relationships to help transform Shell in the energy transition.</p><p>In 2019, we were the first major energy company to include an energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan for senior executives. This has vested for the first time at 180%, based on performance between 2019 and the end of 2021, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future.</p><p>For further details of Shell's governance structure, see the Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A JUST TRANSITION</emphasis></p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy has four main goals in support of our purpose. These goals include Powering Lives, which Shell does through its products and activities, and by supporting an inclusive society.</p><p>Shell supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, which recognises the importance of a just transition. A just transition means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>We aim to publish our just transition guiding principles in the next year. We have joined two collaborations to help to inform our approach. In 2021, we became a member of IPIECA's Just Transition Task Force, which aims to help companies to develop their approaches to a just transition and share good practice. In January 2022, we joined Energy for a Just Transition, a coalition created by the non-governmental organisations Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and The B Team.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting staff</emphasis>In 2021, around 1,700 Shell employees completed about 2,300 courses related to new skills needed for the energy transition. These included courses on hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fair pay</emphasis>In 2022, Shell published its Fair Pay principles to increase transparency of our pay policies for staff. We also expect our suppliers to provide their employees with wages and benefits that meet or exceed the national legal standards.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKS</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES</emphasis>Shell welcomes the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends that companies disclose information in four areas: governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets. This table shows where to find Shell disclosures that are related to recommendations by the TCFD in Shell's Annual Report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE ACTION 100+ NET</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ZERO</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COMPANY BENCHMARK</emphasis>Since the publication of Shell's Energy Transition Strategy in 2021, Shell has continued to engage with the Climate Action 100+ investor group. The table below shows how Shell was assessed in the March 2022 Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark.</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climateaction100.org/whos-involved/companies/\">https://www.climateaction100.org/whos-involved/companies/</url> n/a = not applicable</p><p>The Climate Action 100+ benchmark uses assessments by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). In its assessment, TPI highlights that it has recalculated Shell's net carbon intensity according to its own methodology. It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology.</p><p>We were disappointed with this outcome as we had engaged with CA100+ and TPI to understand the differences in the methodologies used. We had clarified our 2035 and 2050 targets on that basis. However, we will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets are reflected in the next Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. We believe that this could result in a change to the Shell assessment to 'meets all criteria' for at least five indicators, 'partial, meets some criteria' for three indicators and one 'does not meet any criteria' rating for capital allocation.</p><p>As described in this report, we continue to believe that total expenditure, as measured by cash capital expenditure and operating expenses, rather than capital expenditure alone, is the best way to measure the scale of our financial investment in the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Read about our position on climate litigation and activism.</p><p>32\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIMATE LITIGATION AND ACTIVISM</emphasis></p><p>Shell's energy transition strategy to accelerate our transformation into a low- and zero-carbon energy business is strongly supported by our shareholders. We have set climate targets that we believe are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Still, a ruling by the District Court of The Hague, in the Netherlands, and some activists, say that Shell's strategy should shift away from oil and gas even faster.</p><p>We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system, and that coordinated changes in energy supply are necessary. But achieving a net-zero emissions energy system requires changes in both energy supply and demand. If, for example, Shell decided to stop selling petrol to accelerate the energy transition, it would not mean that people would buy less petrol. Customers would buy it from other companies and total demand for fossil fuels would not change - it would only shrink Shell's customer base.</p><p>This would prevent us from delivering the energy the world needs today. It would also harm our work with customers to decarbonise different sectors, limit our effectiveness in playing a leading role in the energy transition in the years to come, and affect our financial strength and ability to generate value for shareholders today and in the future.</p><p>Shell is also being asked to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most aggressive energy scenarios and policy pathways for the sectors in which we operate. Shell alone cannot directly influence the energy choices made by our customers. It is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy, for example by mandating the sale of cars that run on low-carbon energy.</p><p>Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy. And we believe this strategy is the best for society, our customers and our shareholders.</p><p>Read more about why Shell has appealed the District Court ruling (in Dutch and English): Waarom Shell in hoger beroep gaat | Shell Nederland</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MILESTONES</emphasis></p><p>[A] Cash capital expenditure.[B] Shell interest 44%, non-Shell-operated Ra.zen joint venture.[C] Excluding trading activities.[D] Excluding the impact of the Permian divestment.n/a = not applicable</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEPS ON THE PATH TO NET-ZERO EMISSIONS</emphasis>In 2021, our shareholders supported Shell's energy transition strategy. In 2022, we are offering them an advisory vote on our progress. This vote is part of our continuing dialogue with investors as we work to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis></p><p>Completed the simplified share structure.Disclosed that we expected one third of our total expenditure (cash capital expenditure and operating expenses) in 2022 to be on low- and zero-carbon products and services. We expect this to grow to around 50% in 2025.The first energy transition performance metric in our Long-term Incentive Plan vested at 180%, based on performance between 2019 and the end of 2021, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future. Offered an advisory vote on our progress in our energy transition strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021</emphasis></p><p>Launched our Powering Progress strategy setting out how we will transform into a net-zero emissions energy business. Offered an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy to shareholders. They overwhelmingly supported the strategy that we are now implementing.Took critical investment decisions in the production and sales of low-carbon fuels, solar and wind power, and hydrogen. At the same time, we made significant changes to our Upstream and refinery portfolios.Reshaped the organisation and formed new energy transition partnerships with some of the world's biggest companies. Set a new target to reduce absolute emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2021, we had achieved a reduction of 18%.Increased the weighting of the energy transition performance metric in the Long-term Incentive Plan from 10% to 20%. Moved Shell's headquarters to the UK.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020</emphasis></p><p>Announced target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.Extended the energy transition performance metric to around 16,500 employees through the Performance Share Plan (PSP).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2019</emphasis></p><p>Published our first Industry Associations Climate Review, which reviewed the alignment between our climate-related policy positions and those of 19 key industry associations of which we are a member.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2018</emphasis></p><p>Signed a joint statement with institutional investors on behalf of Climate Action 100+ announcing steps that Shell has taken to demonstrate alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2017</emphasis></p><p>Announced ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by around half by 2050, including the full life-cycle emissions from the use of our energy products by customers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAUTIONARY NOTE</emphasis>The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\" are collectively referred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS</emphasis>This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.</p><p>Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021 (available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/investor\">www.shell.com/investor</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be</p><p>considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, April 20, 2022. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHELL'S NET CARBON FOOTPRINT</emphasis>Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\" or \"Net Carbon Intensity\", which include Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\" or \"Net Carbon Intensity\" are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SHELL'S NET-ZERO EMISSIONS TARGET</emphasis>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FORWARD LOOKING NON-GAAP MEASURES</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</emphasis>As used in this Report, \"Accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"Carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e (CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>Linda M.

Last year in Iceland, a Swiss start-up called Climeworks AG <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/worlds-largest-plant-capturing-carbon-from-air-starts-in-iceland/\">opened the world's largest plant that sucks carbon dioxide directly from the air</url>.\u00a0Meanwhile, Norway<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/carbon-capture-europes-trump-card-for-waste-treatment/\">has a pilot project for a full-scale carbon capture and storage project</url> fitted to a waste-to-energy plant.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/worlds-largest-plant-capturing-carbon-from-air-starts-in-iceland/\">World's largest plant capturing carbon from air starts in Iceland</url></h><p>The world's largest plant that sucks carbon dioxide directly from the air and deposits it underground is due to start operating on Wednesday (8 September), the company behind the nascent green technology said.</p><p>However, these projects are small compared to the capacity the world will need.</p><p>By 2030, the EU executive has set an aspirational target for technology-based solutions to remove 5 million tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere, far more than the 4,000 tons of CO2 that Climeworks AG is able to capture every year.</p><p>This is tiny compared to the binding target of 310 million tonnes of carbon that the European Commission wants to capture from nature-based solutions by 2030. But the EU executive sees this as a signal to the market that technology-based removals are something it wants to grow.</p><p>\"Targets themselves are just targets. What [matters] now is how we implement those targets,\" said Eve Tamme, a senior advisor at the policy group Climate Principles.</p><p>Europe now faces the question of how to scale up carbon capturing technology and how to put the right incentives and policies in place, Tamme told EURACTIV.</p><p>To allow this scaling up, the EU needs to bring in rules to quantify carbon removals, says Tamme.\u00a0This is challenging, however, because while policymakers have been working on emissions reductions for a long time, there has been a lot less work on removals.</p><p>\"Europe is literally the first in the world who is trying to figure it out. And if they do figure it out, this will hopefully become a gold standard that is going to be used more broadly,\" Tamme told EURACTIV.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New infrastructure for CO2 transport</emphasis></p><p>One challenge in scaling up technology-based carbon capture is having the correct infrastructure in place.</p><p>While nature-based solutions require very little additional infrastructure, technical solutions require CO2 to be transported via pipeline, water, rail or road from where it is captured to where it can be utilised or permanently stored.</p><p>But, at the moment, there is very little infrastructure designed to transport CO2 to permanent removal sites or recycling processes.</p><p>\"We need to build out the transport network,\" a Commission official told EURACTIV.</p><p>\"The challenges of CO2 transport don't stem from the envisioned means for transport. The challenges for a successful deployment are of economic and regulatory nature and often referred to as the chicken-and-egg problem,\" according to a Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13066-Climate-change-restoring-sustainable-carbon-cycles_en\">document attached to its communication on sustainable carbon cycles</url>.</p><p>One area that could crack this chicken-and-egg problem is the region around the North Sea. There are already several carbon removal projects in this area, including one in the Port of Antwerp, where carbon would be captured and stored underground using Norway's Northern Lights programme.</p><p>Northern Lights, also based around the North Sea, aims to ship carbon to a storage facility and then pipe it to permanent storage in a reservoir 2,600 metres under the seabed.</p><p>Other projects include carbon capture, usage and storage at a cement factory in France and a biomass district heating system in Stockholm that aims to use carbon capture and storage to reach negative emissions.</p><p>\"It's a very specific European model that we are developing for carbon capture and storage or carbon capture and usage - that you have capture facilities, facilities that use the CO2 and facilities that store final CO2,\" a Commission official told EURACTIV.</p><p>\"To have a liquid, well-functioning market, we need a sufficient number of market participants, both to provide the CO2, to capture the CO2, [and] to transport the CO2,\" he added.</p><p>\"We have both pipelines and ships. And then we also need a sufficient number of storage sites so that we have competitive pressure on all sides, but also enough trust from all market participants that there will be enough storage, that there will be enough CO2 that's captured,\" the official continued.</p><p>There are still arrangements that need to be put in place for such a market. For instance, EU countries will need to allow CO2 to be shipped between countries. Storage facilities, meanwhile, will need non-discrimination policies to allow carbon to come from different countries.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-clarifies-funding-scope-for-co2-capture-technology/\">EU clarifies funding scope for CO2 capture technology</url></h><p>The European Commission has clarified how it intends to support carbon capture and storage (CCS), a key technology in the fight against global warming, which supporters say will enable deep emission cuts in heavy industries such as cement, steel and petrochemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Funding innovation</emphasis></p><p>Investments from EU pots of money, like the Innovation Fund, are already helping carbon capture projects grow. Other funding comes from the private sector, like Microsoft's $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund.</p><p>According to Casper Klynge, Vice-President of European Government Affairs at Microsoft, the challenges surrounding carbon removals are immense and there is a lot of work needed in both nature-based and technology-based solutions.</p><p>\"Technology-based solutions are still in their infancy and need scaling,\" Klynge said at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news-your-voice/events/conference-sustainable-carbon-cycles_en\">European Commission's conference on carbon removals last month</url>.</p><p>\"In short, today there is no real existing scalable carbon removal ecosystem and the world must build a new market on an unprecedented timeline. And let's be honest, starting from almost scratch,\" he added.</p><p>Microsoft plans to be carbon negative by 2030 and, by 2050, aims to have removed all of the emissions it put into the atmosphere since its founding in 1975. It has already purchased 1.4 million metric tonnes of carbon removals from 15 suppliers to help achieve this.</p><p>However, Mark Preston Aragon\u00e8s, warned against what he called the \"hype\" around carbon removals, saying that the conversation around these is heading in the wrong direction, with companies looking at how much they can offset rather than how many emissions they can reduce.</p><p>\"Buying an offset shouldn't be seen as 'check me out - I'm carbon neutral, I bought offsets'. It should be seen as shame in the sense that 'I'm still emitting, so I have to offset',\" he told EURACTIV.</p><p>Instead of being driven by demand, the conversation should be driven by the capacity of carbon removals that can be supplied and focus on unavoidable emissions, he added.</p><p>\"When it comes to reducing emissions, the role of carbon capture and storage is quite important for those sectors where there might not be any near term viable alternatives and where the actual process is where the CO2 comes from, not necessarily the combustion of a fuel, so cement and steel, for example, where it's actually the processing, which contribute as well to global warming,\" he explained.</p><p>He also advocated for a focus on carbon capture and storage, rather than direct air capture because CCS takes the carbon directly out of the chimneys of polluting factories rather than from the air, where the carbon is highly diluted.</p><p>\"When it comes to direct air capture, that is a bit harder in the sense that it's much harder to capture the CO2 from the atmosphere than it is from flue gas. On balance, we should be deploying CCS first,\" said Preston Aragon\u00e8s.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A circular economy for carbon</emphasis></p><p>Another potential revenue stream for carbon removals is through a circular economy for carbon. Much of 21st century life is dependent on products and materials made from carbon, from fuel and food to plastic and clothes. These cannot be decarbonised, so producers need to source carbon from non-fossil sources.</p><p>However, this could put pressure on land use, so the European Commission is exploring the idea of a circular economy for carbon to provide a non-fossil source for carbon products.</p><p>\"We need to deploy technologies that recycle carbon from waste, from sustainable biomass or directly from the atmosphere to provide the industry with circular carbon because carbon will remain necessary for our industry,\" said EU Green Deal chief Frans Timmermans last month.</p><p>This would require a huge shift away from current carbon sources. In 2018, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13066-Climate-change-restoring-sustainable-carbon-cycles_en\">the EU economy consumed approximately one billion tonnes of carbon</url>, just over half of which was from fossil sources. Only a fraction of that carbon is from recycled origin.</p><p>If we fail to make this change, \"we are simply adding more fossil carbon in the technosphere creating a gigantic carbon dept that is just waiting to be emitted, either through biodegradation, natural degradation or through incineration,\" warned Florian Vernay, Head of Communications, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability at Unilever.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/carbon-capture-europes-trump-card-for-waste-treatment/\">Carbon capture: Europe's trump card for waste treatment?</url></h><p>Europe has a waste problem. In 2018, over two million tonnes of rubbish was treated in the EU, with just under half of this going to landfills, where it releases climate-damaging methane emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1712681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64V7-XG81-JCF9-43GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 22, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>carbon capture and storage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon capture and usage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon removals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon removals certification scheme</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>direct air capture</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>net zero emissions</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Business &amp;

We need to do it immediately,\" said Timmermans, adding that the EU has to \"avoid the worst and prepare for the unavoidable\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Atlantic Coast is eroding, our outermost regions are ravaged by hurricanes, there are forest fires in the Arctic Circle, and crippling droughts in large parts of Central and Southern Europe.

Global temperature increasing above 3\u00b0C could cost (EURO)170 billion every year, according to the Commission.</p><p>\"Climate change is happening today, so we have to build a more resilient tomorrow,\" says the strategy. \"The world has just concluded the hottest decade on record during which the title for the hottest year was beaten eight times. People, planet and prosperity are vulnerable to climate change, so we need to prevent the un-adaptable and adapt to the un-preventable.\"</p><p>However, the strategy warns there are currently \"wide gaps\" in knowledge, which need to be closed in order to prevent \"climate-blind\" decision making and allow choices that understand changing ecosystems and biodiversity.</p><p>Data sharing and modelling need to be improved, according to the strategy, which also addresses the health impacts of climate change and plans to set up a new climate health observatory.</p><p>Nature-based solutions, like restoring wetlands and peatlands, and green spaces in urban areas, are also mentioned to support adaptation and promote biodiversity.</p><p>\"We need to make sure that we adapt and that we strengthen our nature so that it can be a good basis for carbon sinks.

The lack of mandatory targets conveys the wrong signal and does not guarantee the delivery of the desired results,\" said Petros Kokkalis, shadow rapporteur on the resolution for the Left group in the European Parliament.</p><p>Ensuring the EU's preparedness against hazardous climate change should at least require the development of mandatory adaptation plans, climate vulnerability assessments and climate stress tests at local, regional, and national levels, according to Climate Action Network Europe, an NGO.</p><p>\"It is truly disappointing that the new adaptation strategy offers no measurable and binding targets, no concrete steps forward nor a clear timeline,\" said Sergiy Moroz, policy manager for biodiversity and water at the European Environmental Bureau.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data-sharing across governments</emphasis></p><p>One of the challenges of climate adaptation is that it spans authorities, from local to EU-level.

The conflict has also highlighted the need for a global supply of secure and affordable energy. Amid this period of heightened uncertainty, we have worked hard to keep energy flowing to households and businesses around the world.</p><p>In 2022, I witnessed first-hand how our staff diverted energy supplies to where they were most needed. In total, we delivered 194 cargoes of liquefied natural gas to Europe - almost five times our usual average. This work helped to avert the threat of blackouts and to build up energy supplies ahead of next winter.</p><p>Against this backdrop, we made good progress in putting our energy transition strategy into action. As we delivered the oil and gas the world needs today, we reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 30% by the end of 2022, compared with 2016 on a net basis. This is more than halfway towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030. Global energy-related carbon emissions increased by around 4% over the same period. [A]</p><p>We continued to work towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 by making significant investments in solar and wind power, biofuels and hydrogen. For example, we made our biggest acquisition in the energy transition yet with the purchase of Denmark's Nature Energy for around $2 billion. This acquisition makes us Europe's largest producer of renewable natural gas, which is made from agricultural, industrial and household waste.</p><p>Renewable natural gas can be used by customers in sectors such as commercial road transport and shipping. This is part of the work we are undertaking, sector by sector, to identify the low- and zero-carbon products that our customers need to reduce their emissions.</p><p>We continued to build infrastructure to help our customers switch to low- and zero-carbon energy. In 2022, for example, we increased the number of electric vehicle chargers we owned or operated by 62% to around 139,000, compared with the previous year.</p><p>The development of new technologies is vital to decarbonising our own operations, as well as reducing the emissions for our customers. In 2022, we launched the Energy Transition Campus Amsterdam in the Netherlands, which creates an opportunity for Shell and other companies to research new technologies for the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Engaging with shareholders</emphasis></p><p>The continued support of our shareholders is critical to Shell's success as a company. In 2021, shareholders supported our energy transition strategy with 89% of the votes. In contrast, a resolution by shareholder group Follow This calling for a different energy transition strategy received 30% of the votes. Shareholders will get the opportunity to vote again on our strategy in 2024.</p><p>In 2022, 80% of our shareholders voted in support of the progress we had made in 2021 in implementing our energy transition strategy. Along with other Board members, I met many of our largest investors following that vote, including during investor engagements in September. I am grateful for their time and feedback, and look forward to our next engagements in April 2023.</p><p>The publication of annual progress reports, along with the advisory votes, have resulted in a more informed dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard, for example, that some large investors did not follow the Board's recommendation to vote in support of Shell's progress in 2022, because they mainly focused on Shell's energy transition strategy overall, and not on our progress. Some shareholders also indicated that societal pressure, potential media coverage, and expectations from investors in their funds were reasons for not following the Board's recommendation.</p><p>Other investors told us they would like Shell to introduce medium-term targets to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions produced by customers when they use our products. The Board has considered setting a Scope 3 absolute emissions target but has found it would be against the financial interests of our shareholders and would not help to mitigate global warming.</p><p>This year, we are again asking shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on the progress we have made in 2022 as we implement our energy transition strategy. As in previous years, this vote on our progress measured against our targets and plans is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe the progress we have made in line with our energy transition strategy has been to the benefit of our customers, our shareholders and wider society. The Board recommends that you vote in favour of Resolution 25 in support of the energy transition progress that Shell made in 2022, as described in this report and in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022.</p><p>[A] According to our analysis and data from the International Energy Agency.</p><p>Chief Executive Officer's introduction</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has had significant effects on the global energy system, with many countries needing to replace the supplies of natural gas that previously came from Russia.</p><p>Governments acted swiftly. The European Union's REPowerEU plan and the Inflation Reduction Act in the USA gave strong support to renewable energy. In Germany, two floating storage and regasification terminals were up and running by the end of the year, allowing the country to import more of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) it needs.</p><p>But the energy system still faces huge challenges as high energy prices continue to contribute to a cost-of-living crisis for many people. These challenges have highlighted the need for a balanced energy transition: one in which the world achieves net-zero emissions, while still providing a secure and affordable supply of energy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supplying vital energy</emphasis></p><p>In this report, we show the progress we have made towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, as we continue to supply the vital energy the world needs during a time of great volatility.</p><p>I am especially proud of the progress we have made in reducing carbon emissions from our operations, with a 30% reduction by the end of 2022, compared with 2016 on a net basis. That puts us more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030.</p><p>We also continued to change the energy mix of our portfolio. By the end of 2022, the net carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell had fallen by 3.8%, compared with 2016. Our analysis, using data from the International Energy Agency, shows the net carbon intensity of the global energy system fell by around 2% over that time [A].</p><p>Beyond our immediate performance against our targets, we have taken other important steps to advance our strategy. In LNG, for example, we expanded what is already a world-leading business. We expect that LNG will play a key role in a balanced energy transition. It produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, and fewer emissions than petrol or diesel when used as a fuel for transport.</p><p>In 2022, we joined two exciting projects in Qatar, including what will be the largest LNG project in the world. These projects will use carbon capture and storage, helping to reduce emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in low-carbon projects</emphasis></p><p>At the same time, we made significant moves to increase our supply of low- and zero-carbon energy, in line with our strategy. In 2022, we invested $1.6 billion in Indian renewable power developer Sprng Energy. We also announced the acquisition of Denmark's Nature Energy, which produces renewable natural gas from agricultural, industrial and household waste, for around $2 billion.</p><p>Our Powering Progress strategy is designed to transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, while generating strong returns for our shareholders. We will use the strength of our brand, customer relationships and balance sheet to add value to these acquisitions.</p><p>With Nature Energy, for example, we expect to make strong returns from our investment because we already have customers for biofuels in commercial road transport and shipping, and the trading expertise to connect opportunities in supply and demand.</p><p>[A] For more details see shell.com/energytransitionfaq</p><p>Similarly, the strength of our integrated portfolio gives us confidence in our investment in Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be Europe's largest renewable hydrogen plant. The power for the electrolyser will come from an offshore wind farm that is partly owned by Shell. The renewable hydrogen will be used at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to help decarbonise the production of products like petrol, diesel and aviation fuel. Renewable hydrogen can also be used for commercial road transport, a sector where we already have a leading position in Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building on our strengths</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, we invested $8.2 billion in low-carbon energy and non-energy products, around a third of our total cash capital expenditure. Of that, we invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, including biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles and renewable power generation. The remaining $3.9 billion was spent on non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our customers.</p><p>As we invest in the energy transition, we will continue to build on our competitive strengths. We will earn the trust of investors and the right to grow these emerging businesses by demonstrating that we can deliver strong returns.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shareholder support</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, 89% of shareholders at our Annual General Meeting voted in favour of Shell's energy transition strategy, which centres on our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. As you will read in this report, we have made good progress in the first two years of that strategy by reducing emissions from our operations, and by making more low- and zero-carbon products available to our customers. Today, I ask our shareholders for their continued support, by voting in favour of the progress we are making on our journey to net-zero emissions.</p><p>Steps on the path to net-zero emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In 2023, for the second time, we are offering shareholders an advisory vote on our progress in implementing our energy transition strategy.

The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies which reduce carbon emissions. Following divestment activity in 2022, we expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2023 and 2030 and that they will exceed reductions associated with planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell.

Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) decreased from 60 million tonnes of\u00a0carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 to 51 million tonnes CO2e\u00a0in\u00a02022. This reduction was achieved through divestments in 2021 and 2022 (such as the Deer Park and Puget Sound refineries in the USA) and the handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; shutdowns or conversion of existing assets, including the shutdown of\u00a0some units at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore; GHG abatement projects and purchase of renewable electricity.

Our target to keep methane emissions intensity below 0.2% was met in\u00a02022 with Shell's overall methane emissions intensity at 0.05% for facilities with marketing gas and 0.01% for facilities without marketing gas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Routine flaring</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, routine flaring from our upstream operations fell to 0.1 million tonnes of hydrocarbons from 0.2 million tonnes of hydrocarbons in the previous year. Our aim is to eliminate routine gas flaring from our upstream operations by 2025.</p><p>Net carbon intensity</p><p>We use net carbon intensity [A] to show our progress in changing the mix of energy products we sell to customers. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products and services -- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Net carbon intensity measures the transformation that is happening in our portfolio as we implement our energy transition strategy. Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is the same as achieving 100% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>[A] Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aligning our targets with Paris</emphasis></p><p>Shell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway derived from the scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we have developed our own approach for demonstrating Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets within a pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. This pathway is aligned with the more ambitious temperature goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.</p><p>When constructing the pathway, we started by filtering out certain scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions. Next, we calculated the carbon intensity (grammes of CO2/MJ of energy) for each of the remaining scenarios by dividing net emissions by total final energy consumption, with electricity represented as a fossil fuel equivalent.</p><p>To set a starting point, we then indexed the resulting carbon intensities to a common value of 100 in 2016 to remove the impact of differences between Shell's historical net carbon intensity and the intensities calculated from the IPCC scenarios. Finally, the pathway was constructed using the range of carbon intensity reductions over time. Outlying values at the top and bottom of the range were removed, which had the effect of narrowing the final pathway.</p><p>By using the 1.5\u00b0C pathway produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. This is illustrated in the table, which shows that our targets are positioned within the range of the 1.5\u00b0C pathway. The upper and lower limits represent the upper and lower boundaries of the 1.5\u00b0C pathway derived using the approach described above.</p><p>Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell, such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks. Any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers is also part of our calculation. After that date, we include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers. This is because we expect that customers will need to take action to mitigate their emissions from the use of our products if society is to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build new protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Currently, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those products. However, when users of energy products mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by the use of carbon capture and storage or offsets there is no protocol for reflecting a corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reported by the energy supplier. We will continue to engage stakeholders on these carbon protocols and will seek to align with new frameworks as they evolve.</p><p>As an energy provider, Shell has set a target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 20% by 2030. We believe that this target is aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway derived from the IPCC SR 1.5 scenarios. We also believe that the pace of change will vary around the world by region and by sector, taking into consideration the time needed for energy users to invest in large-scale equipment, and the energy infrastructure changes needed for Shell to deliver more low- and zero-carbon energy.</p><p>Reducing carbon intensity</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart below illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>Net carbon intensity in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Electricity sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable electricity. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source.

The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2022 was primarily due to an increased proportion of renewable power and corresponding reduction in the carbon intensity of our power sales. Shell's 2022 NCI includes 4.1 million tonnes of carbon credits, compared with 5.1 million tonnes\u00a0which were included in Shell's 2021 NCI.

Once operational, the plant will produce 100,000 tonnes of bio-LNG each year. In the Netherlands, Shell became the first fuel retailer to offer bio-LNG blended with regular LNG to all its customers. Trucks using this blend emit around 30% less CO2.</p><p>In the aviation sector, we became the first company to supply SAF to customers in Singapore in February 2022. By the end of the year we were supplying SAF to airlines at seven airports around the world. We also acquired Malaysian waste oil recycling firm EcoOils, securing long-term access to advanced biofuels feedstock that will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers.</p><p>Biofuels is part of our Marketing business segment.</p><p>Read more about our biofuels business at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/new-energies/low-carbon-fuels\">www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/new-energies/low-carbon-fuels</url></p><p>Conventional fuels</p><p>Oil and gas currently meet more than half of the world's energy needs, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The volatility caused by Russia's war in Ukraine has highlighted the need for a global supply of secure and affordable energy. We continue to supply the conventional fuels needed to help meet this demand, including natural gas and traditional fuels (such as fuel oil, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel), while lowering emissions from our own operations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natural gas</emphasis></p><p>In 2022, as one of the world's largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we shipped natural gas to where it was needed most. We delivered 194 cargoes of LNG to Europe - almost five times our usual average. In total, we sold 66.0 million tonnes of LNG in 2022 compared with 64.2 million tonnes in 2021.</p><p>LNG plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a lower-carbon alternative. For example, combined-cycle gas turbines emit about 50% less CO2per unit of electricity generated than an average coal-fired power plant, according to the IEA. LNG also helps to decarbonise shipping operations and commercial road transport. In 2022, we completed more than 250 ship-to-ship LNG bunkering operations. We provide LNG to ships at 15 ports in 10 countries. We also expanded our LNG refuelling network to more than 60 operated sites, bringing the number of sites where Shell customers can access LNG in Europe to more than 160.</p><p>Shell was selected as a partner in two projects in Qatar: the expansion of the North Field East, which is the largest LNG project in the world, and the North Field South project [A]. By using carbon capture and storage, these landmark projects will help provide LNG with a lower carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these two projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later in the decade.</p><p>In 2022, we also took final investment decisions to develop offshore gas projects in Malaysia, the UK and Australia. One of them, the Rosmari-Marjoram project, situated 220 kilometres off the coast of Malaysia, will mainly be powered by renewable energy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Traditional fuels</emphasis></p><p>From exploration to refining and distribution, traditional fuels continue to play a key role in the energy system. We estimate that our oil production peaked in 2019. In 2022, our crude oil and natural gas liquids production available for sale was 13% lower than in the previous year. This larger than usual decline was mainly driven by portfolio changes, including the sale of our Permian business in late 2021 and the derecognition of volumes related to Sakhalin in Russia.</p><p>In 2022, we continued the transformation of our integrated refineries into Energy and Chemicals Parks. This involves developing new facilities and converting or dismantling existing units. We plan to process less crude oil and use more renewable and recycled feedstocks such as hydrogen, biofuels and plastic waste. In the USA, we completed the sale of our Mobile refinery in Alabama and of our interest in the Deer Park refinery in Texas.</p><p>We have implemented a variety of measures to reduce the energy use and increase the energy efficiency of our operations, with estimated total savings of around 1,155\u00a0million kilowatt hours (kWh). Please refer to the \"Our journey to net zero\" section in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for examples of the measures we took in 2022.</p><p>Our conventional fuels activities are part of our Upstream, Marketing, Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products business segments.</p><p>[A] Shell participation in the North Field South project remains subject to clearance of remaining customary conditions precedent.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy transition in Action: a selection of 2022 developments (map)</emphasis></p><p>Investments and returns</p><p>Since the first quarter of 2022, we have reported separately on the performance of our five business segments [A]:</p><p>Our Marketing business has targeted returns of 15-25%. It comprises Mobility, Lubricants, and Sectors and Decarbonisation. Mobility operates Shell's retail network, including electric vehicle charging services. Lubricants produces, markets and sells lubricants for road transport, and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, power generation, agriculture and construction. Sectors and Decarbonisation sells fuels, speciality products and services, including energy solutions that help customers reduce emissions in the aviation, marine, commercial road transport and agricultural sectors, among others.Our Renewables and Energy Solutions business has targeted returns of more than 10% [B]. It includes renewable power generation, the marketing and trading of power and pipeline gas, as well as carbon credits, and digitally enabled customer solutions. Renewables and Energy Solutions also includes the production and marketing of hydrogen, development of commercial carbon capture and storage hubs, investment in nature-based projects that avoid or reduce carbon emissions (Nature-based solutions), and Shell Ventures, which invests in companies that work to accelerate the energy and mobility transformation.Our Integrated Gas business has targeted returns of 14-18%. It includes liquefied natural gas (LNG), conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other products. It includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver these to market. Integrated Gas also includes the marketing, trading and optimisation of LNG, including LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles. Our Chemicals and Products business has targeted returns of 10-15%. It includes chemicals manufacturing plants with their own marketing network, and refineries which turn crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products. These are moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use. The business also includes pipelines, trading of crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals, and oil sands activities, which involves the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into synthetic oil.Our Upstream business has targeted returns of 20-25%. It explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to the market. Shell's Upstream business delivers reliable energy from conventional oil and gas operations, as well as deep-water exploration and production activities. We are focusing our Upstream portfolio to become more resilient, prioritising value over volume to provide the energy the world needs today whilst funding the energy system of tomorrow.</p><p>For all these businesses, our target returns consider the risks and uncertainties associated with our investments, and the scale of spending that is required to develop opportunities. For example, in our Upstream business, they reflect the costs of exploration, feasibility studies and construction, as well as risks linked to commodity prices.</p><p>In 2022, our cash capital expenditure [C] was around $25 billion and our operating expenses were around $39 billion. The table below shows how much we spent and the cash flow from operations in 2021 and 2022 across our businesses.</p><p>[A] On January 31, 2023, we announced that our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses will be combined to form a new Integrated Gas and Upstream Directorate. The Downstream business will be combined with Renewables and Energy Solutions to form a new Downstream and Renewables Directorate. These changes are expected to take effect on July 1, 2023 and will not affect Shell's financial reporting segments in 2023.

Of that, we invested $4.3 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, an increase of 89% compared with the previous year. This includes capital spending on biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, as well as wind and solar power [B]. The remaining $3.9 billion was invested in non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our customers. Our investment in non-energy products decreased by 9% compared with 2021.</p><p>These investments advance a central part of our strategy which is to sell more products with low-carbon emissions to help both Shell and our customers meet their climate targets.</p><p>Two-thirds of our capital spending in 2022 was on maintaining supplies of the vital energy the world needs today. We invested $4.2 billion in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as well as gas and power marketing and trading, an increase of 17% compared with the previous year. We expect LNG will remain an important part of the energy mix for many years to come because of its role in reducing emissions from power generation and transport.</p><p>We also increased our investments in oil production and oil products by 30% to $12.5 billion. This includes investments of $8.1 billion in our Upstream business, helping maintain our assets and make up for the natural decline in oil and gas production. It also includes investments in refining and trading, as well as fuels marketing, which are important to maintain supplies of fuels for motorists, commercial road transport, aviation and industry.</p><p>[A] Please refer to the Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for the definition of cash capital expenditure.</p><p>[B] The $4.3 billion investment does not include the acquisition of Nature Energy for around $2 billion, which closed at the beginning of 2023.</p><p>Products for which usage does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions: Lubricants, Chemicals, Convenience Retailing, Agriculture &amp; Forestry, Construction &amp; Road.E-Mobility and Electric Vehicle Charging Services, Low-Carbon Fuels (Biofuels/HEFA), Renewable Power Generation (Solar/Wind), Environmental Solutions, Hydrogen, CCUS.

Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>We advocate directly to governments and policy maker<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">s</emphasis>, offering relevant information, views, and policy recommendations on new proposals. For example, Shell supports the European Union's Fit for 55 package, which aims to enable the EU's transition to climate neutrality by 2050. As part of our engagements with the EU institutions in 2022, we called for binding targets in the Renewable Energy Directive to accelerate the use of renewable hydrogen in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry and transport by 2030.</p><p>We engage governments and policymakers indirectly, for example through our participation in coalitions and industry associations. We recognise that industry associations may represent many members and sometimes we may have different views on a topic. We join coalitions where there is likely to be a common advocacy objective.</p><p>In the USA, for example, Shell supported the US Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in 2022. We advocated different clean energy provisions, such as expanded tax credits for carbon capture utilisation and storage, and the creation of a tax credit for hydrogen production. We engaged with Members of Congress and the Biden Administration directly, as well as through advocacy coalitions, including the CEO Climate Dialogue, the Clean Hydrogen Future Coalition and the Carbon Capture Coalition.</p><p>In India, we continued to engage with the government, industry partners, think tanks and academic institutions to collectively find ways to promote low-carbon energy choices. In 2022, we launched a carbon capture utilisation and storage industry coalition with our partners. It aims to encourage the creation of government policies to support the development of carbon capture and storage projects in India.</p><p>We also aim to help shape the wider debate around the energy transition in other ways, including through speeches and articles. Ahead of a meeting of the EU Parliament in June 2022, for example, Shell published an opinion piece on the European news website Euractiv. We supported the proposal to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans in the European Union from 2035, which was agreed a few months later.</p><p>We aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around climate and energy-transition-related policy engagement. We set out our approach, policy and advocacy positions, and information about our industry association memberships, on our website.</p><p>In March 2023, we plan to publish our first Climate and Energy Transition Lobbying Report. This report reviews our lobbying in 2022 and our memberships of industry associations. We continue to work to ensure our memberships of industry associations support our climate and energy transition policy positions.</p><p>Read more at<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vsW6uMDzC6Ch9PVs1IPpVxazDjmyooa1HTVMJBQRq0lJrfaAiFg7baqmz6AoZCfvDQRXY_hNMmEv_Pm-nSD9jA==\">w</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=W6HngVxsZ0IdVhHD2B1eDrtB_QcEdFW3PGpBLmrydKR3QwgxQd99Lt6zQ7ldsPYK2KnBZEgaTtvPxDjblFpg-2lETy5vU-pvCVJB4t9zjzU=\">ww.shell.com/advocacy</url></p><p>Climate governance</p><p>Our climate governance ensures our strategy, processes and incentives are aligned to drive our progress in the energy transition.</p><p>In 2022, the Board continued to consider energy transition matters throughout the year when reviewing and guiding the implementation of our Powering Progress strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets - including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>To foster the delivery of our strategy, we have further aligned staff remuneration with progress in the energy transition, by making changes to the annual bonus scorecard, which helps determine bonus outcomes for most Shell employees, including Executive Committee members.</p><p>From 2022, we introduced new metrics to the measure called Shell's Journey in the Energy Transition (15% of the annual bonus scorecard). These are:</p><p>Selling lower carbon products - we help customers to reduce their emissions by supplying low-carbon products. We measure our success by the earnings share of our Marketing activities from low-carbon energy products as well as non-energy products and convenience retail. Reducing operational emissions - our target is to achieve a 50% reduction by 2030; and this measure is based on reducing our Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions. Partnering to decarbonise - we seek to collaborate with our customers to help them reduce their emissions. In 2022, we measured success in this area in terms of our progress in rollingout our electric vehicle charging network.</p><p>We also introduced a customer excellence measure on the annual bonus scorecard, to emphasise the importance of building ever stronger customer relationships in the energy transition.</p><p>Our Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) and Performance share plan (PSP) tie pay for around 16,500 employees directly to achieving our strategic ambitions for the energy transition. From 2019 onwards, we have included an energy transition performance metric in our LTIP. This element vested for the second time in 2022, at 180% of target, based on performance between 2020 and the end of 2022, reflecting our progress in transforming Shell's business for a lower-carbon future. The weight of this metric will be increased from 20% to 25% for the most senior employees for the upcoming LTIP cycle (2023-2025).</p><p>For further details see \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0Ly4xYYYA9NUvyjXiHeVS1nD0LP-QTHhpgwswinneiotCco_A5KqKFu0_QvfmF_OxriXOZ2BhTtG1xr3O5c9ex9LmbQwbCCP4thaFzJlrUEAxkT1eYSmwoCQPq0vIYJ5fSBZeMZniieyyByKsMb3gA48tlxiWUXe973iJmC4Q32cVC-0Rz98pnSdqd5jVW38QE_-tiNTR6_AkpnhfLjAf2JHTjYKix0WOWOeHKqIdHXJPgSDIs2bBdh5Wgo8tRSIcT_0_540-xz9bRyGEZDN2Nv1JvzD7G7rAfwwSAaXJL8CEBnSSwlTpj6lkgrf7g2a\">Governance of climate-related risk and opportunities</url>\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022.</p><p>A just transition</p><p>Shell supports the Paris Agreement on climate change, which recognises the importance of a just transition. A just transition means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system.</p><p>Our aim is to contribute to a just transition by making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, our customers and our workforce. This is part of our strategic goal to power lives. In 2022, we pledged \u00a3100 million to help communities in the UK develop skills and find jobs linked to the energy transition. This includes establishing educational skill centres, part of a wider aim to help 15,000 people find employment by 2030.</p><p>Shell continues to work with governments and our partners, such as Energy for a Just Transition, facilitated by Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), and Ipieca's Just Transition Taskforce.</p><p>We are committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</p><p>We continue to help our own staff learn new skills needed for the energy transition. In 2022, around 4,000 Shell employees - up from 1,700 in 2021 - completed courses on a range of subjects, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p>You can read more about our approach at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/justtransition\">www.shell.com/justtransition</url></p><p>Climate standards and benchmarks</p><p>Climate standards and benchmarks play a key role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition.

The table below shows how Shell was assessed in the October 2022 Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark.</p><p>The Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) benchmark uses assessments by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI). In its assessment, TPI highlights that it has recalculated Shell's net carbon intensity according to its own methodology. It also highlights that Shell has set further targets to reduce its net carbon intensity, but they were not included in this assessment as it was not possible to make them consistent with TPI's methodology.</p><p>We are pleased to see that our ratings have improved in two areas in the latest assessment, but we continue to be disappointed with certain key aspects of the assessment due to differences in the methodologies used. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their Benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment.</p><p>Climate litigation and activism</p><p>During the past decade, environmental activists have increasingly used litigation to hold governments and companies accountable for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. Shell is involved in more than 20 such court cases worldwide.</p><p>In March 2022, we appealed a ruling by the District Court of The Hague in the Netherlands from May 2021, which requires Shell to reduce emissions further and faster than even the most ambitious energy scenarios published for the sectors in which we operate. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, we are taking active steps to comply with the ruling. We believe the actions we are taking to deliver our energy transition strategy are consistent with the court ruling and its end of 2030 timeline. This includes the investments we are making in low-carbon fuels, renewable power, and hydrogen; in addition to making changes to our upstream and refinery portfolios.</p><p>In February 2023, environmental law group ClientEarth filed a claim with the High Court in England against Shell plc and the current Board of Directors challenging the board's decision-making regarding Shell's climate strategy. This is a derivative action brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company. The High Court must grant permission for ClientEarth to proceed with the claim. Investors representing less than 0.2% of Shell's total shareholder base have sent letters supporting the claim. We do not accept ClientEarth's allegations. We believe our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the Company.</p><p>We agree there is an urgent need to change the world's energy system. We believe it is for governments to determine the right trade-offs for society and to put in place the policies that bring about fundamental changes in the way society consumes energy. Litigation does not enable the global cooperation required to change both supply and demand for energy, as well as the infrastructure supporting the use of energy.</p><p>Shell is determined to play its part in helping to change the world's energy system. We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious goal of the UN Paris Agreement on climate change: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5<sup>o</sup>C above pre-industrial levels. Importantly, we have already delivered results: Shell reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control in 2022 by 30% compared with 2016.</p><p>Some shareholders, such as Follow This, have also called on us to set even more ambitious targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions. This is also a focus of some of the climate litigation against us.</p><p>Shell would, among other things, have to decrease its sales of oil products and gas to reduce its Scope 3 emissions in line with the Follow This resolution. Doing so, without changing demand and the way our customers use energy, would effectively mean handing over customers to competitors. This would materially affect Shell's financial strength and limits its ability to generate value for shareholders. It would also reduce our ability to play an important role in the energy transition by working with customers to reduce their emissions.</p><p>We are making progress in implementing our energy transition strategy, which we believe is the best for society, our customers and our shareholders.

In this Report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this Report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\" are collectively referred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking statements</emphasis></p><p>This Report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 (available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/investor\">www.shell.com/investor</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this Report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Report, March 16, 2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this Report.</p><p>In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between this Report and Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, such discrepancy or inconsistency is unintended, and the information included in Shell's Form 20-F controls.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>Also, in this Report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which include Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net-zero emissions target</emphasis></p><p>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking non-GAAP measures</emphasis></p><p>This Report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of\\ which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>The contents of websites referred to in this Report do not form part of this Report.</p><p>We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this Report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sec.gov\">www.sec.gov</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additional information</emphasis></p><p>As used in this Report, \"accountable\"is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e (CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>LEI Number: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70</p><p>Published: March 16, 2023</p><p>Classification: Additional Regulated Information required to be disclosed under the laws of the United Kingdom</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000798415en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67ST-7JF1-JDPT-Y4FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12508\"/><timeReceived>10:13 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 16, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Quality reporting can accelerate decarbonisation and identify opportunities for value creation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change accelerates the depletion of natural capital all too quickly for our environment and communities to adapt. Left unchecked, these rapid environmental changes will cripple global ecosystems and the cost will be much greater than humanity can afford.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Understanding the impact of business on the natural world through structured and standardised environmental reporting is the first step in recognising the size of the challenge, prioritising areas for action and developing targeted intervention plans. Financial markets have always relied on reporting to inform asset pricing and capital allocation. We must now adapt these same reporting measures to help industries evolve and navigate the climate challenges we all face.</p><p>'Climate change does not care where you are' says UK's COP26 Ambassador Rogan</p><p>Mobilising collective action at the scale and speed required to keep the global temperature increase within 1.5 degrees of pre-industrial levels, requires a common understanding of environmental impact, in the form of a shared set of definitions and metrics.</p><p>Agreement on action, uncertainty on approach</p><p>Yet, despite emerging consensus on the need for urgent action, uncertainty on the approach still abounds. Addressing COP26, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres lamented: 'There is a deficit of credibility and a surplus of confusion over emissions reductions and net-zero targets, with different meanings and different metrics.'</p><p>A statement reflecting the fact that over 70% of some of the world's biggest corporate emitters failed to disclose the effects of climate risk in 2020 financial statements and 80% of their auditors showed no evidence of assessing climate risk when reporting.</p><p>Vaccine rollout, debt and climate change pose risks to Africa's 'fragile' recovery - World Bank</p><p>However, a systematic approach towards clear, comparable, and consistent climate reporting is emerging. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), created by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), provides a framework for more effective climate-related disclosure focussing on governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.</p><p>The TCFD has already been endorsed by more than 1500 organisations in the public and private sectors. The Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was built on the structure and foundation of the TCFD, to promote and advocate for worldwide consistency for nature-related reporting. These are evidence that momentum is building on climate-related reporting.</p><p>The prominence of biodiversity conservation in the COP26 discussions highlights the impossibility of separating natural capital and financial capital. Recognising the interdependencies between both, aided by reporting, will be critical in helping businesses map out their environmental footprint and the climate risks in markets within which they operate. Moreover, it will provide an understanding of how businesses can play a key role in the transition to net-zero, whilst creating access to affordable, quality goods and services, and greater economic opportunities such as sustainable jobs.</p><p>Looking at Africa</p><p>Balancing these apparently competing development priorities - and delivering returns - is vital to incentivising environment-conscious business operations and accelerating just transition in Africa. Putting people at the heart of this transition - and the process - is critical. The stakes couldn't be higher than in Africa, a continent that has contributed least to climate change and yet is the most vulnerable to its effects.</p><p>Our low level of historic emissions whilst a cause for pride is also an indicator of how far the continent lags in terms of access to energy - a factor that continues to inhibit productivity and economic competitiveness.</p><p>Although renewable energy is proliferating across the continent, it currently does not provide reliable baseload power capacity in most countries. Failure to address the energy deficit risks locking millions of people into poverty. Rising to this challenge calls for improved information to support the design of a just transition which will equip Africans with skills, opportunities, along with other adaptation and resilience tools, to help meet the grave climate and nature-related threats.</p><p>Reporting frameworks will offer clear guidance and new models for integrating business growth and returns, with inclusive green development that mutually benefits nature, people, and businesses.</p><p>Over the long term, climate and nature-related reporting will be instrumental in transforming how businesses in Africa operate, ensuring they actively take responsibility for their contribution to a just transition across the continent.</p><p>Reporting is needed to show companies the environmental and financial cost of 'business as usual' and inform the investment case for transitioning towards climate-resilient practices and nature-based solutions.</p><p>Bottom line</p><p>CDC Group has developed an ESG Toolkit for fund managers and financial institutions we partner with, to help them assess and reduce climate risk and integrate these assessments into their operations when identifying opportunities for innovation and value creation. Smart companies - particularly those competing for growth capital - will raise the bar on their ESG performance as an integral pillar of their sustainability strategy and may also be handsomely rewarded.</p><p>In 2020, 515 investors with $106trn in assets requested companies to disclose climate-related issues through CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) - an increase from 35 investors who signed CDP's first disclosure request in 2002. Non-financial reporting on climate change and the environment also impacts financial performance.</p><p>For example, Data from STOXX showed that the CDP's 'A List' - companies leading on environmental transparency and action, based on their annual disclosure - outperformed the global benchmark by an average of 5.3% per annum over a seven-year period.</p><p>At the 26th UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, the voices of young activists, civil society groups, and intensely vulnerable nations appealed for transparency, accountability, and immediate actions. Quality reporting can answer this call. Informed and diligent reporting will light the pathway toward creating productive, sustainable, and inclusive economies across the African continent. This is a well-utilised tool within the financial community. Now is the time to repurpose it for the preservation of our future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT25112021000507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:646V-5Y11-F00C-620P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1114\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 25, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Buildings, industry and mobility are identified as the key problem areas in terms of the EU's CO2 emissions, together comprising almost 50% of the total.</p><p>The proposals - which could enter into force as soon as 2023 - lay out four distinct areas of action: carbon pricing, sectoral targets and rules and support measures. A proposed strengthening of carbon pricing within the EU includes extending the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to include maritime transport, buildings and road transport, and the introduction of a new Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) for selected sectors, subject to the pre-existing ETS. For the time being, the CBAM would only apply to \"direct\" (scope 1) CO2 emissions, and it will later be decided whether it should extend to cover \"indirect\" (scope 2) emissions that come further down the value chain. For industries with mostly \"indirect\" emissions, such as aluminium production, the proposals will therefore likely have a limited immediate impact.</p><p>The EC also suggests increasing EU-wide targets in renewable energies, low carbon fuels, energy efficiency, and use of land and forest for carbon capture and sequestration, as well as outlining new policy frameworks to spur on decarbonisation, especially in the production and use of low-carbon fuels in the building and mobility sectors.</p><p>Perhaps mindful of the recent \"yellow vest\" crisis in France - a by-product of the French government's decision to implement climate-related policy changes without proper consideration of the associated social impacts - the \"Fit for 55\" package comes with some proposed safety nets; namely in the form of proposed creation of a Social Climate Fund (SCF). This fund is specifically aimed at tackling the risk of increased energy or mobility poverty arising from the extension of the ETS to include buildings and road transport.</p><p>Interestingly, the EC's unveiling of its decarbonisation toolkit for the EU comes just weeks after the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a widely-discussed energy scenario underpinning the achievement of a 1.5-degree scenario by the world economy - the Net Zero Emissions scenario (NZE). As such, the NZE scenario offers a valuable benchmark against which to assess the various disruptions and policy options that the EC's \"Fit for 55\" package comprises.</p><p>Obvious similarities in the overall decarbonisation pathways underly both approaches; for instance, removing the use of fossil fuels as much as possible in buildings, industry and mobility.</p><p>But when comparing the two, some interesting divergences appear. Indeed, the EC's approach focuses heavily on the development of renewable energy to support decarbonisation and, while it highlights the pivotal role of carbon pricing in incentivising technological and behavioural disruptions, also places emphasis on offsetting the negative social impacts that the transition may bring.</p><p>The NZE, on the other hand, advocates a thorough implementation of carbon pricing mechanisms across the globe, with particularly aggressive pricing modelled in developed economies, but focuses less on affordability and social implications.</p><p>Such difference can easily be accounted for: IEA's NZE has a global perspective and therefore looks into developed as well as developing regions. For the latter, due to lack of infrastructure, access to energy still takes precedence over all other affordability considerations.</p><p>Beyond this, comparison between the two strategies highlights some specificities in the EC's approach.</p><p>Firstly, the \"Fit for 55\" focuses heavily on decarbonisation within the transport and mobility sectors, instead of industry - the proposals for the latter revolving around strengthening of the ETS, which would likely not impact many of the sub-sectors until at least 2026.</p><p>Notably too, the EC takes a comparatively restrictive approach to low-carbon fuels supporting decarbonisation. For instance, while the IEA views nuclear power as a necessary low-carbon energy component, the EC does not address its potential - perhaps attributable to the fact that the EU still lacks consensus around the role of nuclear in the energy transition.</p><p>Lastly, the EC's stance on the potential role of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in industrial activities, remains unclear. There is an implied preference towards nature-based solutions, such as tree planting, rather than tech-based solutions, but the EC's plans to strenghten the ETS in hard-to-abate industrial activities (chemicals, cement and steel production) also implicitly incentivise CCUS, leaving the overall stance ambiguous.</p><p>Despite the suggested Social Climate Fund, the acceptability of certain measures within society may still prove challenging. This is perhaps most notable in the proposed ban on sale of new internal combustion engines in light-duty mobility by 2035, and the expected increase in fuel costs, especially in the aviation industry as a result of the restrictive approach towards low-carbon hydrogen - an integral component in synthetic kerosene used in sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), and a cheaper alternative to its green counterpart.</p><p>In terms of the practical efficiency and workability of many of the elements within the \"Fit for 55\", only time will tell. Key pending issues that require clarification include the emissions benchmarks used for allocation, up until 2035, of free allowances to activities benefitting from the carbon leakage mechanism, and also the inclusion of \"indirect\" emissions in the scope of the CBAM.</p><p>With the plans now to be submitted to the European Council and the European Parliament for approval, intensive debate will likely ensue. Our hope is just that the \"Fit for 55\"'s underlying climate ambition is not weakened as a result.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1673212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:642G-WKD1-JCF9-40KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 12, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009TCH</classCode><className>NATIXIS SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522220 SALES FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

Environmental groups have criticised carbon offsetting schemes like tree-planting as a potential greenwashing tool allowing fossil fuel companies to continue polluting just because their emissions would be compensated by withdrawals elsewhere.</p><p>\"No public funding should go towards projects that lead to delayed emissions, continued fossil fuel exploitation and burning, or carbon capture and storage solutions for sectors with other decarbonisation options,\" says Carbon Market Watch, a green pressure group.</p><p>\"We need a transparent and robust framework to assess which technologies perform best at removing carbon from the atmosphere. And we need to take our time to get it right and not rush into half-baked solutions,\" the group said.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/opinion/carbon-removals-must-not-become-an-expensive-greenwashing-tool/\">Carbon removals must not become an expensive greenwashing tool</url></h><p>Supporters of carbon removal technologies often confuse carbon capture and storage (CCS) with negative emissions. They also risk greenwashing industry claims of climate neutrality, and encourage massive investments in false climate 'solutions' that risk becoming stranded assets, writes Wijnand Stoefs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hierarchy</emphasis></p><p>In principle, all agree with environmentalists that a strict hierarchy needs to be implemented when it comes to climate mitigation policies, with carbon removals clearly at the bottom.</p><p>\"Avoiding carbon emissions must be at the heart of policy - there is no doubt about that,\" said Peter Frank, director at German think-tank Agora Energiewende.</p><p>\"We must implement this hierarchy, otherwise we are going to miss the climate neutrality objective,\" he warned, calling on EU regulators to adopt policies to \"avoid that this hierarchy is somehow turned upside down.\"</p><p>Still, carbon removal technologies will be needed because of remaining emissions in areas like the cement sector and the limestone industry, Frank added, calling on policymakers to start planning for them now.</p><p>Oil and gas companies have been at the forefront of calls to ramp up carbon dioxide removals, attracting criticism from green activists who say they are looking for ways to shirk their responsibility in cutting emissions.</p><p>But Norway's Equinor says this can be done responsibly. \"From Equinor's perspective we follow a strict mitigation hierarchy,\" starting with efforts to \"reduce emissions wherever possible,\" said Lisa Rebora, Equinor's senior vice-president for emerging and future business.</p><p>The next step for Equinor is to decarbonise its own products, through hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), for example. \"And then, last but not least, it's to continue to deploy capital into renewable energies like wind and solar, and new low carbon value chains,\" Rebora said.</p><p>All also agree that nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and afforestation schemes, should be prioritised because they are currently the most effective at absorbing carbon dioxide.</p><p>\"If deforestation were a country it would be the third-largest emitter in the world, meaning it can have a tremendous impact in the short term,\" Rebora said, calling for measures to halt and reverse deforestation as quickly as possible.</p><p>\"Then, in the medium to long term, are technologies like CCS with bioenergy and direct air capture\", which can provide negative emissions, she added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon removal technologies</emphasis></p><p>Those technologies are still in their infancy, however. And investors need policy signals and a regulatory framework before they can start betting money on them.</p><p>Yet, interest is growing. Last week, a Swiss start-up called Climeworks opened the world's first direct air capture plant, which sucks CO2 directly from the air and stores it underground. The plant can capture up to 4,000 tons of CO2 per year, the equivalent of the annual emissions from about 790 cars.</p><p>This is a drop in the ocean compared to the 31.5 billion tonnes of CO2 that the International Energy Agency (IEA) says were emitted last year. However, researchers believe solutions like these will need to be scaled up if world nations want to bring climate change under control.</p><p>\"I'm afraid that in the end, we will need technical solutions\" to remove carbon from the atmosphere, said Peter Frank, from Agora Energiewende.</p><p>The reason, he explained, is because of the \"high uncertainty\" surrounding nature's ability to absorb CO2 from soil, land or forests in the future. In central Europe, for instance, forests are \"almost falling apart\" because of climate change, meaning they are losing their capacity to act as an effective carbon sink, Frank said.</p><p>\"So we need to consider direct air capture, CCS, and biomass with CCS going forward because there is a high uncertainty as to how our natural sinks will develop under climate change,\" he said.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/worlds-largest-plant-capturing-carbon-from-air-starts-in-iceland/\">World's largest plant capturing carbon from air starts in Iceland</url></h><p>The world's largest plant that sucks carbon dioxide directly from the air and deposits it underground is due to start operating on Wednesday (8 September), the company behind the nascent green technology said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Next step: certification</emphasis></p><p>In fact, the European Union has already started planning for negative emissions.</p><p>Earlier this year, the EU adopted a landmark climate law, aiming for a 55% cut in emissions by 2030.

In June, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MEPs-Letter-to-the-European-Commission-CCUS-Time-to-incentivise-carbon-removals-technologies.pdf\">fifteen MEPs sent an open letter\u00a0to the European Commission</url> calling for financial and policy incentives to promote carbon dioxide removals (CDR) to help the EU reach climate neutrality.</p><p>\"Certification is extremely important,\" said Niels Fuglsang, a Danish lawmaker from the Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) group in the European Parliament.</p><p>The public, he says, needs to have confidence that the system works and doesn't lead to greenwashing. \"That requires some bureaucracy,\" he admitted, however, adding that \"hopefully, we can keep that down\".</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eu-draft-puts-spotlight-on-improving-carbon-sinks-to-tackle-climate-change/\">EU plan puts spotlight on carbon sinks to tackle climate change</url></h><p>Europe will need to increase the amount of carbon stored by its forests and wetlands to meet a new, more ambitious target for carbon removals in Europe, according to a leaked policy draft seen by EURACTIV.</p><p>To be sure, there are plenty of pitfalls when it comes to accounting for carbon removals.</p><p>First among them is the issue of \"permanence\": for example, if a forest goes up in flames, a corresponding amount of carbon would have to be deleted from the EU's carbon books. And wood products like furniture have a limited lifespan. When they are eventually dumped, they will likely end up being burned, again releasing carbon back into the atmosphere.</p><p>\"We urgently need a definition of permanence for what can actually be counted as removing carbon from the atmosphere,\" said Oliver Geden, the German climate scientist.</p><p>\"That's an issue that particularly applies to all land-based carbon removal options like afforestation or soil carbon sequestration where there's a high risk that the carbon ends up again in the atmosphere after years or decades,\" he said.</p><p>The Commission acknowledges this and is currently trying to better understand the range of carbon removal technologies available, starting with nature-based solutions such as CO2 captured in soils and forests, Holzleitner said.</p><p>Next, he said, are \"industrial solutions\" such as CCS, circular economy, sustainable fuels, and other products that store carbon such as wood construction materials.</p><p>With EU research funding, the European Commission will first aim \"to better understand the technologies and the challenges related to them, like for example how to deal with permanence and the risk of natural disturbances,\" he said.</p><p>According to Geden, \"you also need to create some kind of liability scheme for what happens in case something goes wrong and the carbon gets back into the atmosphere\".</p><p>\"I think the issue of permanence is really something that policymakers need to look at\".</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/eu-sets-the-scene-for-carbon-removal-actions-in-farming/\">EU sets the scene for carbon removal actions in farming</url></h><p>A new carbon removal approach in agriculture will contribute to stepping up Europe's climate ambition, the European Commission reiterated at the launch of its massive plan to cut carbon emissions by 55% before the end of the decade.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Split target</emphasis></p><p>In terms of policy design, a simple way forward would be to adopt a separate EU target for carbon removals that would be clearly distinct from the bloc's existing greenhouse gas reduction goal, Geden suggested.</p><p>\"Then it would be much clearer how the hierarchy looks,\" Geden said, suggesting that 5 or 10% of the EU's climate target could be met with carbon removals.</p><p>Others agreed. \"Eventually, we should not mix the market for mitigation policy with the markets for removal policies,\" said Peter Frank, adding: \"We should have two different markets going forward\".</p><p>Holzleitner concurred, saying the key question facing policymakers now is \"how can these [carbon removal] credits be used in regulated trading systems in Europe\".</p><p>\"We need to get better at understanding what is one tonne of removal, how permanent it is and how additional it is,\" Holzleitner said. For instance, a distinction must be made between \"true carbon removals\" and \"avoided emissions, like avoided deforestation,\" he explained.</p><p>For Geden, there are several key questions that policymakers need to answer: where does the carbon come from, what are the life cycle emissions of these processes, where does the carbon stay in the end and for how long.</p><p>And according to him, the discussion is now becoming urgent because EU countries have so far avoided the issue.</p><p>\"It is really high time that EU member states governments make up their minds about that because they have been largely absent from the debate.

EURACTIV's media partner, The Guardian, reports.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biden, speaking to the UN general assembly in New York, said he would ask the US Congress to double to $11 billion a year by 2024, the financial assistance the US offers to developing countries to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate finance is one of the biggest issues at the forthcoming COP 26 UN climate talks that will be held in Glasgow this November. Developing countries at the conference are anxious over a longstanding promise they would receive <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/09/rich-failing-help-fund-poor-countries-climate-fight-warns-un-chief-antonio-guterres\">$100 billion a year from 2020 which has not yet been fulfilled</url>.</p><p>Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and chair of the High Ambition Coalition at the UN climate talks said: \"Watching Biden's speech today I thought - this is the announcement we've been waiting for. Now we're looking to Congress to work with Biden to deliver, and to the rest of the G20 to follow suit on finance ambition.\"</p><p>Simon Stiell, environment minister of Grenada, said: \"The announcement from president Biden is the wind in the sails that we needed en route to COP 26. We know that this is bringing us one step closer to the delivery of the $100bn promised by donor countries - and that it will make a tangible difference in countries like mine that rely on this funding to adapt to the impacts of climate change we already feel today.\"</p><p>But the US efforts were not likely to be enough, said John Nordbo, of Care International. Given that the US is the world's biggest economy and second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, many hoped for more. \"This updated pledge from Biden of an additional $5.7 billion is definitely a positive step and it sends a strong signal. Considering where the US was this time last year [under Donald Trump], this is a leap forward in terms of climate leadership. However, the reality is that we are still a long way from closing the gap on climate finance commitments,\" he said.</p><p>Some groups have called on the US to provide more than $40 billion a year.</p><p>He added: \"The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/22/poorer-nations-raise-concerns-over-climate-aid-ahead-of-white-house-summit\">climate finance gap is not just an American problem</url>, it is a global problem. Almost all rich countries, apart from Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, need to commit more.\"</p><p>Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and chair of the High Ambition Coalition at the UN climate talks said: \"The rest of the G20 to follow suit on finance ambition.\"</p><p>Climate finance has been a key sticking point at the UN talks for more than a decade. In 2009, at the fractious COP - the conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, parent treaty to the 2015 Paris climate agreement - in Copenhagen, developed countries agreed that at least $100bn a year would flow in climate finance, from public and private sources to the poor world by 2020.</p><p>However, that totemic target has yet to be reached. On Friday, a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that climate finance in 2019, the latest year for which there is accurate data, had\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/20/rich-countries-not-providing-poor-with-pledged-climate-finance-analysis-says\">reached only about $80 billion</url>.</p><p>At COP 26, low-income countries want not only the reassurance that the $100 billion targets will be fulfilled, but also that negotiations will begin on a new finance regime from 2025, which would ensure they have access to the funds they need to shift their economies on to a low-carbon footing and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.</p><p>For the poorest developing countries, there is a further complication. The bulk of the climate finance provided to date has gone to middle-income developing countries and has been poured into projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as renewable energy. But many of these projects are profitable and could have attracted finance in any case, from private sources.</p><p>The priority for the poorest developing countries is to receive adaptation finance, which helps them\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/14/countries-adapting-too-slowly-to-climate-breakdown-un-warns\">build resilience and adapt their infrastructure</url>\u00a0to the effects of extreme weather that are already in evidence around the world. But funding adaptation projects - such as sea walls, early warning systems, or better infrastructure - is expensive and usually does not produce a tangible financial return, so has been shunned by donors in favour of easy wins elsewhere.</p><p>Some adaptation projects, such as restoring mangrove swamps or wetlands, can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect nature, so many countries have been pinning their hopes on gaining finance for \"nature-based solutions\" at COP 26, but this too has been slow to arrive.</p><p>Stege, of the High Ambition Coalition, which brings together developed and developing countries in support of the Paris agreement goals, said: \"Hearing the US recognise the importance of adaptation is heartening, given the calls we've heard from so many, including the UN secretary-general, on the need for parity between [money for emissions reduction] and adaptation financing.\"</p><p>There are also concerns that some of the climate finance provided has come in the form of loans rather than grants, which can push\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/29/uk-urged-take-lead-helping-poor-countries-fund-climate-action-cop26\">poor countries deeper into debt</url>, and some of it has come from existing development aid budgets, which means countries are losing out on funds for education, health, and other public goods.</p><p>Nordbo said rich countries should come up with further pledges and clearer plans before COP 26. \"We are inching forward on this issue, but the problem is that, meanwhile, thousands more people are being displaced or dying,\" he said. \"Considering how much money these [rich] countries have made from carbon emission-creating industries, not one of them is moving fast enough.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article originally appeared in <url

World leaders meeting online are being asked to deliver stronger, more ambitious commitments that will spark action to halt the unfolding climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Restoring degraded land part of plan to meet objective</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Land is the basis of our food, feed, and fibre systems. It is home to the biodiversity that supports these systems. It is a provider of ecosystem services such as clean water and climate regulation. Its degradation releases gigatonnes of warming gases in the atmosphere and has negatively impacted 3.2 billion people globally.</p><p>Actions to restore some of the degraded 2 billion hectares of land could yield and spread benefits, from food security to livelihoods to peace and security among rural and urban populations, across developed and developing countries.</p><p>What's possible when everyone works together</p><p>Amid a global pandemic that still has months to run, societies have shown what they can achieve if they work together, if they listen to science, if they adjust their actions. The post-pandemic era is about a resilient future for resilient societies.</p><p>This can only be done through a recovery that contributes to climate action, reverses the loss of nature and biodiversity, minimises the risk of future pandemics and spreads the benefits from recovery more equally. This is where the role of land restoration lies.</p><p>A recent report from the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency shows that huge commitments have been made to reverse this problem. More than 100 countries have made commitments that equal the restoration of almost one billion hectares of land - an area almost the size of China.</p><p>Restoring land is not just about food</p><p>Degraded land becomes unproductive and creates the need to clear new lands. This vicious downward spiral comes at the expense of ecosystems that sequester carbon and the biodiversity that lives there. More cleared land means more greenhouse gas emissions and fewer wild spaces that create a buffer against diseases that cross from animals to humans, such as COVID-19.</p><p>Of the one billion hectares covered by commitments, 250 million can be restored to produce more food. This would reduce the need for new productive land. But it isn't just about land for food.</p><p>Restoring forests, dry and wet lands, and other ecosystems will mitigate climate change and restore nature's defences against weather extremes, such as heavy rainfall and coastal surges.</p><p>The restoration of 350 million hectares of degraded ecosystems between now and 2030 could return $9trn in ecosystem services and remove up to 26 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is almost half of what the world emitted in 2019. These figures, bear in mind, cover only around one third of the agreed restoration commitments.</p><p>Some commitments are gathering pace</p><p>The Great Green Wall Initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares across the Sahel in an 8,000 km-long strip. That alone is expected to decrease 250 million tonnes of carbon. This will not only help to reduce climate change but also create ten million rural jobs along the way, help communities to be more resilient and reduce forced migration.</p><p>We have a major opportunity to move on restoration commitments.</p><p>Countries can accelerate action during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, which starts next year. They can invest in land restoration in their pandemic recovery packages. They can increase the land-based mitigation commitments under the Paris Agreement, which is estimated at about 220 million hectares.</p><p>The PBL report shows that such actions would be particularly relevant for North America, Europe, Russia, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Over half of the restoration commitments so far are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Much of the rest are in Central and South America, China and South Asia.</p><p>Bottom line</p><p>Restoring land is one of a few investments that produces immediate effects: slows climate change, protects against pandemics and boosts food security.</p><p>Nature-based solutions could provide up to one third of the climate solution by 2030, protect and restore biodiversity, increase agricultural productivity, provide jobs, boost livelihoods and reduce poverty.</p><p>This is too good an opportunity to miss.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT3112202000062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61NB-0R21-F00C-628F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 31, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Net acquisitions had a positive impact of 1.1%. Foreign exchange decreased sales by 0.9%.Organic growth reached 8.3%. Pricing was 8.2%, reflecting significant cost inflation. Real internal growth (RIG) was positive at 0.1%. Organic growth was broad-based across most geographies and categories.The underlying trading operating profit (UTOP) margin was 17.1%, decreasing by 30 basis points on a reported basis and by 40 basis points in constant currency. The trading operating profit (TOP) margin was unchanged at 14.0%.Underlying earnings per share increased by 9.4% in constant currency and by 8.4% on a reported basis to CHF 4.80. Earnings per share decreased by 43.5% to CHF 3.42 on a reported basis, mainly reflecting the 2021 gain on the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares.Free cash flow was CHF 6.6 billion, as working capital increased temporarily in the context of supply chain constraints and capital expenditure remained above historic trendlines.Board proposes a dividend of CHF 2.95 per share, an increase of 15 centimes, marking 28 consecutive years of dividend growth. In total, CHF 18.2 billion were returned to shareholders in 2022 through a combination of dividend and share buybacks.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023 outlook:</emphasis>we expect organic sales growth between 6% and 8% and underlying trading operating profit margin between 17.0% and 17.5%. Underlying earnings per share in constant currency is expected to increase between 6% and 10%.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2025 targets fully confirmed:</emphasis>we expect sustainable mid single-digit organic sales growth and a return to an underlying trading operating profit margin range of 17.5% to 18.5% by 2025. We expect annual underlying earnings per share growth to be in the range of 6% to 10% in constant currency.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Schneider, Nestl\u00e9 CEO, commented:</emphasis>\"Last year brought many challenges and tough choices for families, communities and businesses. Inflation surged to unprecedented levels, cost of living pressures intensified, and the effects of geopolitical tensions were felt around the world.</p><p>The entire Nestl\u00e9 team demonstrated dependability, as we navigated this difficult environment. Organic growth was solid, margins continued to be resilient, and our underlying earnings per share development was strong. At the same time, we ensured access to nutritious products and affordable offerings globally.</p><p>During 2022, we also confirmed our longstanding nutrition strategy, with Good for You, Good for the Planet at its heart. We took important actions to further strengthen our industry-leading responsible marketing practices and to provide transparency on the nutritional value of our global portfolio. At the same time, we also advanced the implementation of our climate roadmap.</p><p>Looking to 2023, we expect another year of robust organic growth, with a focus on restoring our gross margin, stepping up marketing investments and increasing free cash flow. Nestl\u00e9's value creation model puts us in a strong position to achieve our 2025 targets and to generate reliable, sustainable shareholder returns.\"</p><p>Group Results</p><p><sup>*</sup>2021 figures restated following the creation of Zone North America (NA) and Zone Greater China (GC) as of January 1, 2022. Zone AOA includes Middle East and North Africa (MENA) previously included in Zone EMENA<sup>**</sup>RIG, pricing and organic growth figures exclude the Russia region, with a corresponding impact on the M&amp;A and foreign exchange lines</p><p>Group sales</p><p>Organic growth was 8.3%. Pricing increased to 8.2%, reflecting significant cost inflation. RIG was positive at 0.1%, following a high base of comparison in 2021, supply constraints and portfolio optimization actions.</p><p>Organic growth was 7.1% in developed markets, driven by pricing. In emerging markets, organic growth was 10.0%, supported by both pricing and RIG.</p><p>By product category, Purina PetCare was the largest contributor to organic growth, with continued momentum for science-based and premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Purina ONE and Fancy Feast, as well as veterinary products. Sales in coffee grew at a high single-digit rate, with broad-based growth across brands and geographies, supported by a strong recovery of out-of-home channels. Sales of Starbucks products grew by 12.9% to reach CHF 3.6 billion, generating over CHF 1.5 billion of incremental sales compared with 2018. Infant Nutrition saw double-digit growth, with broad-based contributions across geographies and brands. Confectionery posted high single-digit growth, reflecting particular strength for KitKat, seasonal products and key local brands. Dairy reported mid single-digit growth, with continued momentum for coffee creamers, affordable fortified milks and home-baking products. Water recorded double-digit growth, with a sales decrease in the fourth quarter as a result of temporary capacity constraints. Prepared dishes and cooking aids posted low single-digit growth, following a high base of comparison in 2021, with continued strong demand for Maggi. Sales in vegetarian and plant-based food grew at a mid single-digit rate. Garden Gourmet in Europe continued to see double-digit growth, while sales for Sweet Earth in North America were impacted by SKU optimization. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science reported mid single-digit growth, driven by Medical Nutrition and healthy-aging products.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales remained robust at 7.2%. E-commerce sales grew by 9.2%, reaching 15.8% of total Group sales. Organic growth of out-of-home channels reached 23.5%, with sales exceeding 2019 levels. In the fourth quarter, RIG for out-of-home channels moderated to a mid single-digit rate as a result of post-pandemic normalization.</p><p>Net acquisitions increased sales by 1.1%, largely related to the acquisitions of the core brands of The Bountiful Company and Orgain. The impact on sales from foreign exchange was negative at -0.9%. Total reported sales increased by 8.4% to CHF 94.4 billion.</p><p>Underlying Trading Operating Profit</p><p>Underlying trading operating profit increased by 6.5% to CHF 16.1 billion. The underlying trading operating profit margin decreased by 30 basis points to 17.1% on a reported basis and by 40 basis points in constant currency, reflecting significant cost inflation.</p><p>Gross profit increased by 2.5% to CHF 42.7 billion. Gross profit margin decreased by 260 basis points to 45.2%, following significant broad-based inflation for commodity, packaging, freight and energy costs. The impact of cost inflation increased in the second half, reflecting higher costs for dairy, cereals and energy. Pricing, growth leverage and efficiencies helped to partly offset the impact of cost inflation.</p><p>Distribution costs as a percentage of sales benefited from the divestment of the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America brands.</p><p>Marketing and administration expenses decreased by 2.6% to CHF 16.8 billion. Consumer-facing marketing spend decreased temporarily, following a lower level of promotion and marketing activities in the context of supply constraints. Consumer-facing marketing spend increased in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Administrative expenses as a percentage of sales benefited from very disciplined cost control.</p><p>Restructuring expenses and net other trading items were CHF 2.9 billion, slightly below the prior year. As a result, trading operating profit increased by 8.5% to CHF 13.2 billion and the trading operating profit margin was unchanged versus the prior year on a reported basis at 14.0%.</p><p>Net Financial Expenses and Income Tax</p><p>Net financial expenses increased by 19.2% to CHF 1.0 billion, reflecting higher average net debt. Our average cost of net debt increased slightly to 2.2%, compared to 2.0% in 2021.</p><p>The Group reported tax rate increased by 330 basis points to 24.2% as a result of one-off items. The underlying tax rate was relatively stable at 20.9%.</p><p>Net Profit and Earnings Per Share</p><p>Net profit decreased by 45.2% to CHF 9.3 billion. Net profit margin decreased by 960 basis points to 9.8%, reflecting the gain on disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares in 2021. As a result, earnings per share decreased by 43.5% to CHF 3.42 on a reported basis.</p><p>Underlying earnings per share increased by 9.4% in constant currency and by 8.4% on a reported basis to CHF 4.80. The increase was mainly the result of strong organic growth. Nestl\u00e9's share buyback program contributed 1.8% to the underlying earnings per share increase, net of finance costs.</p><p>Cash Flow</p><p>Cash generated from operations before changes in working capital increased from CHF 16.8 billion to CHF 18.4 billion, up 20 basis points as a percentage of sales.</p><p>Free cash flow decreased from CHF 8.7 billion to CHF 6.6 billion, reflecting a deliberate and temporary increase in inventories in the context of supply chain disruptions and the energy crisis in Europe. Capital expenditure remained at an elevated level due to increased demand, particularly for PetCare.</p><p>Dividend</p><p>At the Annual General Meeting on April 20, 2023, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 2.95 per share, an increase of 15 centimes. If approved, this will be the company's 28th consecutive annual dividend increase. The company has maintained or increased its dividend in Swiss francs over the last 63 years. Nestl\u00e9 is committed to maintaining this long-held practice to increase the dividend in Swiss francs every year.</p><p>The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 21, 2023. The net dividend will be payable as from April 26, 2023.</p><p>Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on April 13, 2023, at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights.</p><p>Share Buyback Programs</p><p>In 2022, the Group repurchased CHF 10.6 billion of Nestl\u00e9 shares as part of the three-year CHF 20 billion share buyback program, which began in January 2022. At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose to reduce the share capital by 80 million shares from CHF 275 million to CHF 267 million through the cancellation of shares purchased, as part of the share buyback program.</p><p>Net Debt</p><p>Net debt was CHF 48.2 billion as at December 31, 2022, compared to CHF 32.9 billion at December 31, 2021. The higher level of debt largely reflected share buybacks of CHF 10.5 billion, mostly financed by the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares in December 2021, and a temporary increase in working capital.</p><p>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)</p><p>The Group's ROIC was unchanged versus 2021 at 12.2%. Excluding significant impairments, ROIC increased by 10 basis points to 14.3%.</p><p>Portfolio Management</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 completed acquisitions and divestments with a total value of around CHF 1.9 billion in 2022.</p><p>On April 1, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Orgain, a leader in plant-based nutrition. Orgain complements Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's existing portfolio of nutrition products that support healthier lives.</p><p>On September 1, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science completed the acquisition of Puravida, a premium Brazilian nutrition and health lifestyle brand. The acquisition will enable Nestl\u00e9 Health Science to expand its consumer health portfolio in Latin America.</p><p>On September 1, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science completed the acquisition of The Better Health Company. The acquisition includes the GO Healthy brand, New Zealand's leading supplement brand, and New Zealand Health Manufacturing, an Auckland-based manufacturing facility for vitamins, minerals and supplements. The acquisition will expand Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's portfolio of vitamins, minerals and supplements in AOA.</p><p>On October 19, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 announced the acquisition of Seattle's Best Coffee from Starbucks.

RIG was -1.3%, following pricing activities, a high base of comparison in 2021 and supply constraints. In the fourth quarter, RIG was -4.9%, largely impacted by portfolio optimization actions, a growth moderation in out-of-home channels and temporary capacity constraints for water.

Starting next month, the company will begin making the nutritional value of its global portfolio transparent, using an external, internationally recognized model for reporting. Nestl\u00e9 will also start reporting on local portfolios in 14 countries, using local external benchmarks. In addition, Nestl\u00e9 recently strengthened its responsible marketing practices, voluntarily restricting its marketing to kids under the age of 16. The company wants to be at the forefront of the industry when it comes to bringing balanced diets within reach for people around the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On 'Good for the Planet'</emphasis>, Nestl\u00e9's greenhouse gas emissions are now below the 2018 levels, based on SBTi standards, even as the company has continued to grow since then. The biggest part of Nestl\u00e9's emissions come from activities within its supply chain (Scope 3), which is why the company is heavily focused on reducing them through the sourcing of its raw materials and regenerative agriculture. It is working with farmers all over the world to help them make the transition to regenerative agriculture. It is sourcing more volumes from farmers who make that transition, while providing technical and financial support to help other farmers start. Through the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030, for example, Nestl\u00e9 is piloting a financial support scheme to encourage coffee farmers to accelerate the shift.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is also tackling the emissions it has more direct control over (Scope 1 and 2). It is using its R&amp;D expertise and innovation capabilities to adapt recipes to lower the emissions of new and established products. Nestl\u00e9 is becoming more energy efficient and ramping up its use of renewable electricity. In fact, the company is on track to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In North America, for example, Nestl\u00e9 completed a large-scale solar energy farm and invested in two more. Combined, the solar energy farms will supply approximately 80% of Nestl\u00e9's energy in the U.S. and reduce its carbon emissions by 3.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalents.</p><p>Additionally, Nestl\u00e9 is implementing nature-based solutions where it sources its raw materials to remove emissions and store them in the ground. In Nicaragua, for instance, the company reached its 2022 goal of planting one million trees, as part of a six-year reforestation project to plant 8.6 million trees on the Nescaf\u00e9 and dairy farms from which Nestl\u00e9 sources. The project is estimated to capture about 3.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalents over 20 years. It is expected to improve biodiversity and forest connectivity, to protect water sheds and to provide job opportunities.</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023 outlook:</emphasis>we expect organic sales growth between 6% and 8% and underlying trading operating profit margin between 17.0% and 17.5%.

The first is climate change. Its causes and potentially catastrophic consequences are well known. The second crisis has received much less attention and is less understood but still requires urgent attention by global policymakers. It is the collapse of biodiversity, the sum of all things living on the planet.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As species disappear and the complex relationships between living things and systems become frayed and broken, the growing damage to the world's biodiversity presents dire risks to human societies.       </p><p>The extinction of plants and animals is accelerating, moving an estimated 1,000 times faster than natural rates before humans emerged. Bugs on our windshields are no longer a summer thing as insect populations plummet. Nearly three billion birds have been lost in North America since 1970, diminishing the pollination of food crops. In India, thousands of people are dying of rabies because the population of vultures that feed on garbage is cratering, resulting in a huge increase in feral dogs that eat these food scraps in the birds' absence.       </p><p>This past week, federal wildlife officials, as if underscoring the point, recommended that 22 animals and one plant be declared extinct. They include 11 birds, eight freshwater mussels, two fish and a bat.       </p><p>This is a future where zoonotic diseases are becoming increasingly common and the world's food security is imperiled.       </p><p>Climate change and biodiversity loss are locked together in a cycle of destruction and must be dealt with in tandem. The demise of the world's coral reefs offers an example. Scientists predict that 70 to 90 percent of coral reefs will disappear over the next 20 years because of warming sea temperatures, acidic water and pollution. This will put at risk 4,000 species of fish and approximately a half billion people globally who depend on coral reef ecosystems for food, coastal protection and employment. Damage to Australia's Great Barrier Reef alone could cost $1 billion a year in income from tourism spending and 10,000 jobs.       </p><p>The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the window is closing fast to avoid the worst climate outcomes. But the biodiversity crisis is even more immediate, and at least as alarming. With climate change, we have a plausible, if imperfect, strategy to avoid the worst outcomes. The world needs to get to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050 by reducing emissions and taking carbon out of the atmosphere.       </p><p>But for the biodiversity crisis, there is no comparable framework. There are no technological fixes to restore species that go extinct. And no cost-effective, man-made replacement for natural systems like wetlands, which provide protection against floods, replenish groundwater reserves and filter the water that flows through them. Worse, some climate change solutions exacerbate biodiversity destruction. For example, the push to expand renewable energy infrastructure on federal lands would clear managed land and ultimately destroy habitats. Addressing the climate and biodiversity together could improve the outcomes of both.       </p><p>This fall, policymakers have two opportunities to act on biodiversity before it's too late at the United Nations' Climate Change Conference in Glasgow and at a virtual U.N. biodiversity conference.       </p><p>First, government and business leaders should take a Hippocratic-like oath to protect the environment. Such a commitment should encompass investment decisions, business practices and government spending, including subsidies to industry.       </p><p>Governments are now measuring carbon dioxide emissions and setting goals and policies to reduce them. Similarly, governments must develop strategies to protect the natural biosphere. Those who harm nature should be penalized; those who protect it should be rewarded.       </p><p>The range of tools includes approaches that generate funding for ecological restoration, like user fees paid by tanker ships and policies that promote market-based systems to protect wetlands and forests. And just as the Paris Agreement called for the disclosure of climate risks, leaders in Glasgow should call for mandating corporate disclosure of the impacts of their actions on biodiversity.       </p><p>In the United States, subsidies for the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries that accelerate the destruction of our natural capital must be reformed. This value of nature to humans has been estimated at more than $125 trillion. It makes no sense, for instance, to encourage practices that jeopardize our long-term food supply.       </p><p>Governments must also create incentives to drive private-sector finance to protect and restore nature because the financial resources the private sector can bring to bear far exceed those of the public sector.       </p><p>The Glasgow climate conference should encourage all governments to invest in nature-based solutions to climate change. Conserving and restoring grasslands, wetlands and forests as \"carbon sinks\" that absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere could provide up to a third of the emissions reductions needed by 2030.       </p><p>Nature's benefits are too often regarded as \"free.\" This is a dangerous path. It is much less costly to protect and conserve nature than it is to restore it or suffer the consequences of its destruction.       </p><p>There is a clear economic, health and climate case for protecting nature. But just as important, there is an overwhelming case for preserving nature for its own sake. It is a source of much that is good about life - beauty, inspiration, innovation and intellectual curiosity.       </p><p>The world is in the midst of one of the most explosive extinction episodes in history. But we are also undergoing a cultural transformation in awareness. I've seen a new sense of urgency around nature conservation issues, a rapidly growing interest in the field of green and sustainable finance, and a renewed sense that collective effort can make a difference. The combination of these forces has the potential to galvanize the world.       </p><p>Henry Paulson is the founder and chairman of the Paulson Institute, which seeks to foster a cooperative relationship between the United States and China. He was Treasury secretary from 2006 to 2009 under President George W. Bush. Before that, he was chairman and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs. He also served as board chairman for The Nature Conservancy.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

European Parliament AGRI Committee debate on enabling innovation and new technologies for sustainable farming, the head of the research and innovation at DG AGRI, Kerstin Rosenow, highlighted the importance of knowledge and innovation as \"key drivers and enablers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive agri-food systems\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They can help develop and test new solutions that we really need to address today's sustainability challenges also in relation to or much more accentuated by the Green Deal, and overcome barriers and uncover new market opportunities,\" she stressed.</p><p>Likewise, speaking before reporters at his first AGRIFISH Council of EU-27 ministers as Italy's farming minister, Stefano Patuanelli also highlighted the importance of innovation in the green transition.</p><p>\"I believe there are reasons to think that agriculture can make that leap towards greater productivity and income that could be then better distributed in the supply chain through innovation.\"</p><p>This need to innovate is addressed in the EU's flagship food policy, the Farm to Fork strategy, which highlights that research and innovation (R&amp;I) are key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems from primary production to consumption.</p><h><url

action</url></h><p>Stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers are seeking to find the right place for innovation in the EU's new flagship food policy with a view to empower consumers to make the best choices for themselves and the planet.</p><p>As part of this drive, the strategy proposes to spend (EURO)10 billion on R&amp;I in the sector, as well as on the use of digital technologies and nature-based solutions for agri-food.</p><p>Fostering innovation is also a key priority of the reform of the EU's farming subsidies programme, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p><p>\"The CAP of the future will both encourage increased investment in research and innovation and enable farmers and rural communities to benefit from it,\" according to the Commission.</p><p>The Commission has also committed to work with member states to strengthen the role of innovation in their CAP national strategic plans, with the aim to \"incentivise the structuring and organisation of the national innovation ecosystem\".</p><p>However, while the need to innovate to achieve these ambitious goals is clear, MEPs have flagged concerns that the EU is \"lagging behind\" in certain areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Bottleneck' for innovation</emphasis></p><p>Speaking during the AGRI Committee debate, right-wing MEP Mazaly Aguilar raised a concern that, by imposing new restrictions on the agricultural sector without offering new opportunities, the EU risks becoming an \"agricultural museum\".</p><p>Due to outdated and restrictive approaches, she added, there is a \"bottleneck\" for certain types of innovation, such as innovative approaches to genetic engineering.</p><p>Likewise, socialist MEP Juozas Olekas highlighted that Europe is \"really lagging behind the rest of the world\" when it comes to plant breeding innovations.</p><p>Stakeholders also raised the need for innovation in a range of other areas, including animal husbandry and innovative solutions to save on natural resources such as water and soil nutrients.</p><p>Renew Europe's Adri\u00e1n Vaquez Lazara highlighted that there is a gap between the Farm to Fork ambitions and the reality on the ground, querying whether the strategy includes sufficient tools to ensure that the primary sector can achieve the necessary technological transition.</p><h><url

While this is crucial, the scientists emphasise that rapid cuts in fossil fuel burning is also essential to ending the climate emergency.</p><p>They also warned against action on one crisis inadvertently aggravating the other, such as creating monoculture tree plantations that store carbon but are wildlife deserts and more vulnerable to extreme weather.</p><p>\"It is clear that we cannot solve [the global biodiversity and climate crises] in isolation - we either solve both or we solve neither,\" said Sveinung Rotevatn, Norway's climate and environment minister.</p><p>The\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ipbes.net/biodiversityclimatescience\">peer-reviewed report</url>\u00a0was produced by the world's leading biodiversity and climate experts, who were convened by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, both which report to the world's political leaders.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/tipping-point-biodiversity-on-a-knife-edge-in-europe-and-beyond/\">'Tipping point': biodiversity on a knife edge in Europe and beyond</url></h><p>Biodiversity is in critical decline across Europe and the world, which will have a devastating impact on ecosystems and economies.</p><p>The report identified actions to simultaneously fight the climate and nature crises, including expanding nature reserves and restoring - or halting the loss of - ecosystems rich in species and carbon, such as forests, natural grasslands and kelp forests.</p><p>\"It's very disturbing to see the impacts over recent years,\" said Prof Alex David Rogers, of conservation group REV Ocean and the University of Oxford, and a report author. \"Between 1970 and 2000, mangrove forests have lost about 40% of their cover and salt marshes an estimated 60%. We've also lost half of coral cover since Victorian times.\"</p><p>Food systems cause a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, and more sustainable farming is another important action, helped by the ending of destructive subsidies and rich nations eating less meat and cutting food waste.</p><p>\"Animal agriculture not only emits 10 to 100 times more greenhouse gases per unit product than plant-based foods, they also use 10 to 100 times more land,\" said Prof Pete Smith, of the University of Aberdeen. \"So\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth\">more plant-based diets</url>\u00a0would mean more environmentally friendly farming and then there would be more land on which to apply nature-based solutions.\"</p><p>The scientists also warned against actions that tackled one crisis but worsened the other. \"When I went for a walk in a plantation forest in England, it was sterile. It was a single, non-native species of tree,\" said Prof Camille Parmesan, of the University of Plymouth. \"There was nothing else there, no insects, no birds, no undergrowth. You might as well have built a concrete building.\"</p><p>Past tree planting on carbon-rich peatlands that had never been forested was another example, said Smith. \"That was an epic fail for the climate and for biodiversity.\"</p><p>Planting very large areas with single crops to burn for energy was also problematic, even if the CO2 was captured and buried, Smith said: \"To get the billions of tonnes of carbon removal that has been proposed in some scenarios for global stabilisation of climate, you would need thousands of millions of hectares - an area twice the size of India.\"</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/europe-renews-pledge-to-fight-deforestation-at-paris-biodiversity-summit/\">Europe renews pledge to fight deforestation at Paris biodiversity summit</url></h><p>The importance of forests for biodiversity and the need to protect them to prevent future pandemics was emphasised by Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel at the One Planet Summit on Monday (11 January).</p><p>Protecting and restoring natural ecosystems was the fastest and cheapest way to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, the scientists said. Cutting fossil fuel emissions was essential, but not enough at this point in the climate crisis, said Parmesan. \"We cannot avoid dangerous climate change without soaking up some of the carbon that we've already put into the atmosphere and the best way to suck up carbon is using the power of plants,\" she said.</p><p>\"The science of restoration of ecosystems has really blossomed over the last 40 years. We are now able to efficiently and effectively restore complex systems, tropical rainforest, coastal wetlands, kelp forests and seagrass meadows, natural American prairie, and UK meadows back to their near historical diversity.\"</p><p>Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, said the report was seminal: \"The science is very clear that climate change and biodiversity are inseparable. To stabilise climate change we need massive rewilding and reforestation.\"</p><p>The UK environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, said: \"This is an absolutely critical year for nature and climate. With the UN biodiversity [and climate summits], we have an opportunity and responsibility to put the world on a path to recovery. This hugely valuable report makes it clear that addressing biodiversity loss and climate change together offers our best chance of doing so.\"</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/biodiversity-needs-its-own-paris-agreement-von-der-leyen-says/\">Biodiversity needs its own Paris Agreement, von der Leyen says</url></h><p>The world needs a Paris-style agreement for biodiversity, the President of the European Commission said on Tuesday (26 January).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/10/climate-and-nature-crises-solve-both-or-solve-neither-say-experts\">first published in The Guardian</url> and is reproduced here with kind permission.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1615811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62WN-6V81-JCF9-4365-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 11, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Biodiversity</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

The long-term ambition is to be carbon neutral across the whole company by 2045 for combined scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p>\"Our upgraded target shows that Kemira fully supports the ambition of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement and that we recognize our contribution to the collaboration needed across sectors and stakeholders to solve climate change\", says<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jari Rosendal</emphasis>, President and CEO.</p><p>The key solutions that will enable emissions reductions include: sourcing zero-emission electricity, switching to renewables for our sites, electrification of processes at our sites, and energy efficiency. Offsetting through nature-based solutions remains a long-term option, but at the lowest level in Kemira's mitigation hierarchy.</p><p>For scope 3 emissions, Kemira is committed to working with suppliers to decrease the carbon footprint of our purchased goods and services. To that end, Kemira will also be encouraging suppliers to set their own ambitious GHG reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement. Kemira's R&amp;D function is working towards developing more products from bio-based and industrial by-products raw materials, helping to further reduce scope 3 emissions.</p><p>\"Kemira's action for the climate is also visible in our products and solutions. Our biggest sustainability impact comes from helping our customers improve end-use resource efficiency - and over half of our revenue already comes from sales of these products\", adds Jari Rosendal.</p><p>Energy efficiency improvements are a key contributor to this resource efficiency, but Kemira also helps customers in other ways like improving biogas yields at wastewater treatment plants. In 2019, Kemira also helped avoid emissions by providing 414 GWh of excess heat from our manufacturing to companies and communities around our sites.</p><p>\"Meeting the ambition of the Paris Agreement requires all parts of society and all sectors to work together. We will be dependent on the choices that the power sector makes, for instance. Similarly, at Kemira, we feel it is important to show that it is possible even for the chemical sector to make absolute emissions reductions and support our customers in their journey\", highlights<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rasmus Valanko</emphasis>, Director, Sustainability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For more information, please contact</emphasis></p><p>Kemira OyjRasmus Valanko, Director, SustainabilityTel. +358 40 658 1979</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kemira</emphasis>is a global chemicals company serving customers in water intensive industries.

Now, because of climate change, they're battling to hold on to what they have left.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rising seas are threatening to eat away at the Shinnecock lands. But the tribe is using everything at its disposal to calm the waves and restore a long, slim beach at the edge of Shinnecock Bay: dredged sand, sea grasses, beach grasses, boulders, oyster shells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a forever battle. Climate change is swelling and heating the world's oceans at an accelerating pace. Inevitably, the Shinnecock will have to bring more sand to replenish what the rising tide keeps washing away. More grass will have to be planted. This spring, Shavonne Smith, director of the tribe's environmental department, wants to expand the oyster reef designed to dissipate the energy of the waves.</p><p>\"We have an inherent responsibility to protect the homeland,\" Ms. Smith said on a recent Monday morning walk along the shore. \"It's not the type of thing where you can work against nature. You work with it.\"</p><p>The project is using wind and water to sculpt the sand into gently rising dunes. It has taken nearly four years to restore a modest 3,250-foot stretch of beach and buffer the burial grounds that lie just beyond.</p><p>What the Shinnecock are doing on their land represents what climate adaptation experts call nature-based solutions. Several such efforts are underway elsewhere. New York City's oyster reefs are being restored to protect Manhattan from storm surges. Marsh grasses have been planted to control erosion in parts of the Florida panhandle. Mangroves have been restored in Vietnam to protect coastal communities from sea level rise and storm surges.</p><p>To what extent these natural defenses will succeed in slowing down climate hazards remains uncertain. Ultimately, it depends not on nature, but on how quickly the world as a whole reduces the emission of planet-warming gases and stems the rate of sea level rise.</p><p>The global outlook for beaches is bleak. One study, published in Nature Climate Change this week, found that more than half of the world's sandy beaches could disappear by the end of this century.</p><p>For now, the Shinnecock experiment has succeeded in saving their land from being devoured by the sea, Dorothy Peteet, a paleoclimatologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, observed on a recent visit.</p><p>\"The question is how long will it work,\" Dr. Peteet said. \"It all depends on how fast the sea comes in, basically.\"</p><p>Roughly 500 members of the Shinnecock Nation, which won federal recognition a decade ago, live on their traditional land, encircled by the summer homes and yacht clubs of the Hamptons. Across the water, sea walls try to hold back the water from the shoreline homes of Southampton, but they ultimately cause the beach to be washed away, which is why, said Eric Shultz, head of Southampton's board of town trustees, officials are trying to dissuade residents from building new sea walls.</p><p>On the Shinnecock's beach, facing Shinnecock Bay and the barrier island out in front, the sands have shifted over the years, as sands naturally do. A hurricane in 1938 knocked out a small chunk of the barrier island, bringing the force of the ocean into the calmer bay.</p><p>People in their 70s and 80s remember when the beach was wide. By the time Ms. Smith, 42, came here as a child, it was mostly pebbles. The trees along the shore, saltwater licking at their roots, were beginning to die off. Several times, recalled the Rev. Mike Smith, the 71-year-old former pastor of the Shinnecock Presbyterian Church, the road that encircled the cemetery flooded.</p><p>Then came Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The water swept over the pebbles and swelled up into the cemetery. It flooded the basement of the pastor's house, jumping over the concrete berm he had built. It raced up Seneca Bowen's yard.</p><p>Gradually, the beach that was part of Mr. Bowen's yard was replaced by a marsh. The water just kept coming in.</p><p>To Chris Pickerell, marine program director of the Cornell Cooperative Extension program, Sandy was a foretaste of what is to come in the era of climate change. \"The extent and duration of flooding on the reservation showed what unabated sea level rise will look like in the future,\" he said. \"Sea level rise, combined with storms like Sandy, alter these natural rhythms and can result in catastrophic damage.\"</p><p>Across New York state, between 1880 and 2015, wetlands shielded by barrier islands have eroded by about 20 inches per year, according to the United States Geological Survey. The ocean-facing coast has eroded much faster. On the Shinnecock land, by the end of this century, sea level rise, relative to the land, is estimated to be between 2.1 and 4.4 feet, according to a climate adaptation report prepared by the tribe. In the coming decades, depending on how fast the sea rises, climate models project rising risks of chronic floods of 6 feet or more in the area.</p><p>\"Something that was just slowly happening over time has picked up speed,\" Ms. Smith said.</p><p>Hurricane Sandy also brought an opportunity: federal reconstruction money that the Shinnecock could use to save their territory.</p><p>In 2016, they poured 30,000 cubic yards of dredged sand on what they call Cuffey's Beach. They filled biodegradable bags with oyster shells and then laid them in rows to calm the waves and clean the water in the process. Mr. Pickerell and his colleagues propagated local grass seeds to plant: sea grass in the bay, cord grass for the intertidal marsh area, and a native beach grass called Ammophila breviligulata to hold down the sand. A row of rocks was planted near the high tide line to protect the cord grasses from the southwestern winds that blow across the bay in summer.</p><p>Today, the beach grass is flourishing. The dunes gently slope upward. Viola Cause, natural resources manager at the Shinnecock environment department, pointed to the trees thriving behind the dunes: sassafras, oak, elderberry. Under the trees may lie very old, unmarked graves that the Shinnecocks are keen to preserve.</p><p>But nature does what nature will. Ducks have eaten much of the cordgrass. More will have to be planted. At some point, more sand will have to be poured on the beach, too. Ms. Smith aspires to expand the oyster reef in the coming months.</p><p>At high tide, as the sun shined brightly on the bay, Ms. Cause stood on Cuffey's Beach. Before the coastal restoration project, the water would come up to her knees. \"We've been able to push back the water some, slow the water down, allow the plants and things to do what they need to do to revive themselves,\" Ms. Cause said. \"Just trying to use the natural things that were given to us.\"</p><p>The beach was dotted with signs of life: sea lettuce, oyster shells, horseshoe crab remains, a dark green seaweed known as dead man's fingers. The occasional great blue heron passed over the marsh. When the tide ebbed in midafternoon, a man dug for clams on the far end of a sand bank.</p><p>\"This is what we have left. So then what?\" Ms. Cause said. \"We would like to just have it still be preserved here for our future, our future generations. The beach. The land. The clean water.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For more climate news sign up for </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the Climate Fwd: newsletter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> or follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@NYTClimate on Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007004224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC6-KYF1-JC85-N012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 7, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000172</classCode><className>BEACHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

In Europe\u00a0sea levels could reach 37cm by 2080, causing land loss that threatens infrastructure, livelihoods and heritage sites</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As climate change causes sea levels to rise around the world, typically it is small island nations that sound the alarm at events like COP26.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley told attendees at the conference in Glasgow that a 2-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures would cause an increase in sea levels equivalent to a \"death sentence\" for the Caribbean island. Tuvalu Foreign Minister Simon Kofe stood knee-deep in the sea around the South Pacific island to illustrate the scale of the problem as he filmed a video statement to send to the summit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in Europe too, climate change is having a dramatic impact on the shoreline as rising seas mean waves hit the coast at higher levels, and increasing storms and changes in wind direction join forces to wear land away.</p><p>Part of the problem is that coastal populations and human infrastructure is increasing around the world, even though the coastline naturally fluctuates, Larissa Naylor, professor of geomorphology and environmental geography at the University of Glasgow, told FRANCE 24. \"The issue is that we've fixed the coast and we've fixed assets at the coast. Around Europe we've got hotels, roads, houses, railways along a boundary that is fluid.\"</p><p>Naylor says rising sea levels add an \"extra layer\" to factors already at play. For example, if a spring tide happens to coincide with a storm, the added complication of rising seas amplifies the overall impact. \"As climate change accelerates there's going to be much more loss and damage in these coastal contexts. Society will increasingly be impacted,\" she says.</p><p>Livelihoods and infrastructure at risk</p><p>This is happening faster in some areas than others.</p><p>On the Yorkshire coast in north-east England an annual average of four metres disappear each year, but last year figures from the local council showed that in a two-mile stretch, 10 metres disappeared in just nine months. Some 20 homes are thought to now be at risk of falling into the sea.</p><p>In Ireland, Irish Rail last month announced plans to invest millions to counter \"alarming\" rates of erosion near coastal railway lines, Irish daily The Journal reported.</p><p>Further south, livelihoods are at stake. A 2017 Greek study found that up to 88 percent\u00a0of all the country's beaches -- essential to the national tourism economy -- could be completely eroded by the end of the century, with large scale land losses also predicted in seaside resorts in France, Spain, Portugal, Italy.</p><p>Even so, data giving an overview of the situation on the continent is lacking. The last European Union study of coastal erosion dates back to 2004, when it found all countries with sea access in the EU were experiencing some form of coastal erosion and 20 thousand kilometres of coastline faced serious impacts.</p><p>Although rising seas and coastal erosion are a global problem, it poses a unique risk in Europe due to the continent's high ratio of shoreline to land. Yet there is no Europe-wide strategy for fighting coastal erosion and many nations do not have cohesive plans, instead leaving regional governments to work out -- and fund -- their own solutions.</p><p>This is partly because public awareness of the issue is lower than for issues like flooding, but also because tackling the problem means a change in approach, from fighting land loss to accepting it.</p><p>Naylor is a specialist in rocky coastlines that naturally erode more slowly than sandy beaches but are still disappearing. \"And once the rocky coastline goes, you can't glue it back on,\" she says. It is an impact that cannot be reversed or reduced, but needs to be accepted and adapted to. \"We're not necessarily ready to do that as a society,\"\u00a0Naylor says.</p><p>Accepting the inevitable</p><p>Some places have already started to do this. In Quiberville-sur-Mer in Normandy, Mayor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bloc told FRANCE 24 that in order to protect infrastructure close to the water's edge, the city used to rely on concrete fortifications at the bottom of its cliffs and a long, concrete drainage ditch separating the beach from the town, but these needed to be rebuilt and strengthened after each big storm.</p><p>\"As the water rises, and as the storms get stronger and stronger due to global warming, it's clear that this is not enough anymore,\" he said. \"We will not be able to keep going like we were\u00a0indefinitely.\"</p><p>Now the town plans to simply accept that the coast is moving,\u00a0and to let erosion happen, by relocating houses close to the coastline.</p><p>Further south on the French Atlantic coast, the town of Saint-Jean-de-Luz is trialling a similar plan to manage coastal erosion of 25cm a year. Local officials have committed \u20ac6.4 million to moving at-risk campsites, restaurants, bars and a water purification station to safer\u00a0inland locations.</p><p>&gt;&gt; See also: Normandy village takes a gamble on letting in the rising sea</p><p>This approach brings its own challenges, Naylor says. \"How do we fund the moving of communities? How accepting are the communities inland of these people coming into their space?\"</p><p>As the scale of the issue grows, the difficulties of moving communities will have a greater impact on European countries' existing infrastructure and spending. She says:\u00a0\"The committee on climate change report for England has said that in 2018 there were 8,000 properties at risk of erosion in England and by 2100 it's going to be 100,000. That will be the same in other parts of Europe with soft coasts. How do we manage that as a society?\"</p><p>Protecting against change</p><p>Another option is building to protect existing land using what Naylor describes as a \"traditional conventional hard engineering approach\" or \"greener, nature-based solutions\".</p><p>In Malta, the capital city Valletta dates back to the 16th century and is one of 42 World Heritage Sites at risk of coastal erosion in the Mediterranean. Ten kilometres away the town of Marsaxlokk has opted for the first solution. Last month officials announced a \u20ac2 million effort to limit erosion by installing 70 metres of\u00a0groynes \u2013 temporary structures made of limestone bricks.</p><p>The limestone barrier will extend out from the dock into the sea, forming a protective wall to catch sand and other sediment that would otherwise be washed away from the shore.</p><p>This is similar to a technique used in Holland, where 12 million cubic metres\u00a0of sand are used to replace what gets washed away from the coastline. While groynes last up to 25 years, the sand must be replaced every year as the problem worsens. It is expected that greater volumes of sand will be needed, meaning greater costs.</p><p>Such systems can also be built in a more eco-friendly way to make them habitable for local species. Earlier this year Portsmouth, UK, announced plans to build a two kilometre sea defence wall that is habitable for rocky shore species, making it the largest structure of its kind in the UK. The issue here is the costs involved. \"It isn't just the cost of building it, there's repair and maintenance costs as well. It's phenomenal, eye-watering amounts of money,\" says Naylor.</p><p>She adds, \"We're not necessarily costing all the economic benefits over a long enough time. Yes, you can rebuild a wall now and it might only be a metre or two higher than the wall before, but what happens in 80 years' time? Who pays then? We need some requirements to start looking at long-term climate risk.\"</p><p>Adaption, loss and damage</p><p>She is hopeful such issues may be raised at COP26 on Monday, November 8, when talks are dedicated to adaptation, loss and damage.</p><p>One example she points to as successful is a recent project in Edinburgh to build blocks of flats on the water's edge. Instead, the contractors agreed to install a coastal park as a buffer between the sea and the new buildings. This meant making space for nature\u00a0and for erosion and accepting that, \"by accommodating erosion you lose some land\".</p><p>Putting this kind of change in attitude on the agenda and introducing government frameworks promoting such measures is crucial, Naylor says. \"Adaptation really needs to come up the agenda and be on an equal pegging to mitigation. If that happened it would help things like the need to adapt to coastal erosion become more mainstream.\"</p><p>As a recent study from the World Meteorological Organisation found that the rate sea rises have doubled to 4.4 since 1993, one thing that is certain is that more thoughtful and long-term solutions will be needed.</p><p>Fundamentally, Naylor says, it comes down to \"making decisions now that don't commit future generations to huge amounts of loss and damage\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-258807548</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:641F-MWT1-JDJN-600J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The dredging sector has a large role to play in safeguarding these areas, providing innovative ways to protect coastlines and introducing adaptive measures.</p><p>Jane Madgwick, Chief Executive Officer of Wetlands International said: \"As natural coastal protection, carbon and water stores, wetlands are vital in helping communities and nature deal with the effects of climate change. Together with Boskalis, we aim to further develop our blue carbon knowledge and expertise to help nature-based approaches become best practice across the maritime and dredging sector.\"</p><p>Theo Baartmans, Board Member and Chief Operating Officer, Boskalis: \"As a leader in the industry, Boskalis is keen to further develop nature-based solutions to protect and enrich coastal ecosystems from the consequences of climate change. By collaborating with Wetlands International we can combine our respective areas of expertise to protect and further enhance coastal wetland habitats in terms of biodiversity whilst simultaneously utilizing their potential to store carbon.\"</p><p>Boskalis and Wetlands International have worked together for several years as active members of Ecoshape, a pioneering consortium developing 'building with nature' principles to support nature-based flood defenses, coastal restoration, resilient deltas and sustainable ports.

Its mission: to regreen Africa within the next decade, together with 350 million farmers. The non-profit organisation works with small local teams, an extensive network of local and international partners and multiple local volunteers.</p><p>Coinciding with the Climate Week summit, which took place in New York in September 2019, JCDecaux has restated its commitment to fighting global warming, becoming the first outdoor advertising group to join the RE100 initiative. Founded by (NGO), The Climate Group, in partnership with CDP (a not-for-profit organisation which aim is to study the implications of climate change for the world's principal publicly traded companies), this initiative brings together businesses around the world to promote 100% renewable electricity.

Inspiring farmers and urban communities with a simple solution, the restoration of our beautiful planet. As Sir David Attenborough so wisely said: \"The climate crisis is now a communications challenge.\" We know the problems and the solutions, we just need to make the coming ten years the decade of doing instead of talking. Therefore we could not be more proud of our partnership, JCDecaux is a true leader in sustainability in so many ways, and we look forward to regreening the hearts minds of people and degraded soils of Africa together.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Decaux and Jean-Charles Decaux, Co-Chief Executive Officers of JCDecaux</emphasis>, said: \"World Environment Day and the beginning of UN Decade are an opportunity for JCDecaux to reaffirm its strong commitments towards our planet. JCDecaux has always set its strategic priorities in all the countries where it operates, to constantly reduce its environmental impacts. In particular, the Group has covered its electricity consumption through renewable energies and cut its greenhouse gas emissions. These commitments have been recognised for several years, as illustrated by our main benchmarks*. JCDecaux commits to Justdiggit, a non-profit reforestation organisation in Africa, by providing advertising spaces on its digital screens and posting displays in 7 European and 13 African countries. This year's World Environment Day also marks the launch of the UN Decade, a global rallying cry for countries to unite in an effort to protect and restore ecosystems. JCDecaux is contributing to the initiative by showcasing the UN Decade launch video on its screens. The UN Decade runs from 2021 through 2030, which is also the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals and the timeline scientists have identified as the last chance to prevent catastrophic climate change. As a partner of Justdiggit, which has already accomplished remarkable work by restoring 60,000 hectares of dry and degraded land and by regenerating over 6 million trees in two and a half years, JCDecaux is proud to play its part in making as many people as possible aware of ecosystem protection and restoration. Not only will this endeavour improve people's living conditions, but it will also combat the effects of climate change, thereby halting the loss of biodiversity and concretely demonstrating the positive impact of our outdoor advertising media.

The funding will support 10 large-scale environment and climate projects in nine Member States, helping Europe's transition to a sustainable economy and climate neutrality. Theseprojects are located in Cyprus, Estonia, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, Slovakia, Czechia and Spain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Executive Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said: \"The  European Green Deal is about improving the well-being and prosperity of our citizens, while protecting nature and the climate. LIFE projects have played an important role for many years and have a big impact on the ground. With today's euros100 million investment we will help to preserve precious natural habitats, keep the air clean, and cut pollution in many lakes and rivers in Europe.\"</p><p>Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevicius said: \"LIFE integrated projects enable Member States' authorities to make a real difference to the environment and people's lives. The projects will help Member States to conserve nature, improve air and water quality, and make the economy greener. This will improve our resilience to the changing climate.\"</p><p>Integrated projects improve citizens' quality of life by helping Member States comply with EU legislation in six areas: nature, water, air, waste, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. They support implementation of environmental and climate legislation in a coordinated manner and on a large territorial scale, leveraging funding from other EU sources, national and regional actors and private investors.</p><p>The LIFE investment is set to mobilise over euros6.5 billion of complementary funds, as Member States can also make use of other EU funding sources, including agricultural, regional and structural funds, Horizon 2020, as well as national funds and private sector investment.</p><p>The large-scale projects will support the European Green Deal and the EU's ambition of becoming the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. They will help to restore and conserve ecosystems and species we all depend on, move towards a circular economy, improve air and water quality, boost sustainable finance and increase climate resilience in Europe.</p><p>Impact on the ground</p><p>Nature conservation: Integrated projects in Estonia, Ireland and Cyprus will help to conserve Europe's nature and improve the management of the EU Natura 2000 network of protected areas. Many important habitats and species will benefit, from forests, farmlands, grasslands, coastal areas and peatlands to pollinators. These habitats also serve as valuable carbon sinks.<br/>Waste management: A project in Greece will promote waste prevention and re-use, reducing the amount of municipal waste going to landfill. New waste indicators and standards will be developed to help build the circular economy.<br/>Air quality: LIFE funding will assist Slovakia in complying with EU directives on air quality, reducing the population's exposure to harmful air pollutants. Neighbouring Czechia, affected by similar air quality problems, will also benefit.<br/>Water: Integrated projects working at river basin-scale will protect and improve water quality in Ireland and Latvia's rivers and lakes, enabling the countries to meet their obligations under the EU Water Framework Directive.<br/>Climate change adaptation: LIFE funding will also support increased resilience to climate change. Projects will integrate climate change adaptation into planning and other policy areas in Spain as well as building adaptation capacity in France using nature-based solutions.<br/>Sustainable finance: Also in France, an integrated project will help bridge significant knowledge gaps in this area and bring green financial products into the mainstream.</p><p>Descriptions of all 10 projects can be found in the Q&amp;A. </p><p>Background</p><p>The LIFE programme is the EU's funding instrument for the environment and climate action. It has been running since 1992 and has co-financed more than 5,400 projects across the EU and in third countries. At any given moment some 1,100 projects are in progress. The budget for 2014-2020 is set at euros3.4 billion in current prices. LIFE integrated projects were introduced in 2014 to help Member States comply with key EU environmental, nature and climate legislation. For the next long-term EU budget for 2021-2027, the Commission is proposing to increase funding by almost 60% for LIFE.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN313001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:657S-N1H1-JDKF-6180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The African Development Bank (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.AfDB.org\">www.AfDB.org</url>) expects that the impact of climate change on the continent could rise to $50 billion each year by 2040, with a further 3% decline each year in GDP by 2050.</p><p>Speaking Tuesday, during a virtual Leaders' Dialogue convened by the African Development Bank (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.AFD.org\">www.AFD.org</url>), the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA.org) and the Africa Adaptation Initiative, more than 30 heads of state and global leaders rallied behind the bold new Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (<url normalizedValue=\"https://bit.ly/3cYoMgw\">https://bit.ly/3cYoMgw</url>). The program's objective is to mobilize $25 billion to accelerate climate change adaptation actions across Africa.</p><p>President F\u00e9lix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and African Union Chairperson, invited his fellow leaders to: \"revisit our climate ambitions and accelerate the implementation of our actions planned under our national priorities. To do this we will need to focus on actions to adapt to the impacts of climate change, these include nature-based solutions, energy transition, enhanced transparency framework, technology transfer and climate finance.\"</p><p>The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program is built to address the impacts of Covid-19, climate change, and the continent's worst recession in 25 years. This is why today's unprecedented show of support for the financing of African adaptation is so significant.</p><p>According to Ban Ki-moon, the 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation, \"The Covid-19 pandemic is eroding recent progress in building climate resilience and leaving countries and communities more vulnerable to future shocks. Africa must make up for lost ground and lost time. Climate change did not stop because of Covid-19, and neither should the urgent task of preparing humanity to live with the multiple effects of a warming planet.\"</p><p>President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, and Chair of the African Union-led Africa Adaptation Initiative, spoke of Gabon's record in emission reductions. He said that Gabon is one of the few countries in the world that is carbon positive. \"We have to insist that equal attention be paid to climate adaptation and mitigation in climate finance. Africa calls on the developed nations to shoulder the historic responsibility and to join the program to accelerate the adaptation in Africa,\" President Bongo said.</p><p>African Development Bank President Dr. Akinwumi A. Adesina said: \"With our partners, we intend to mobilize $25 billion in financing for the success of the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. It is time for developed countries to meet their promise of providing $100 billion annually for climate finance. And a greater share of this should go to climate adaptation. So far, more than 20 trillion dollars have gone into Covid-19 stimulus packages in developed countries. The International Monetary Fund's plan to issue $650 billion of new Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to boost global reserves and liquidity will be enormously helpful to support green growth and climate financing for economic recovery. I applaud the leadership of the US government and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, especially, on this big push.\"</p><p>UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said: \"African nations are showing leadership...The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, and many other ambitious African initiatives, must be empowered to fully deliver on their goals. \"</p><p>Guterres added: \"Universal access to energy in Africa, a priority in the coming years, could be provided primarily through renewable energy. I call for a comprehensive package of support to meet these dual objectives by COP 26. It is achievable, it is necessary, it is overdue, and it is smart.\"</p><p>Speaking on behalf of US President Joseph R. Biden, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: \"The United States remains a committed development partner for Africa and a huge supporter of the African Development Bank. Africa contributed the least to climate change but is suffering the worst of its effects. I congratulate the African Development Bank and the Global Center for Adaptation for developing the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program. We support the program... to help ensure that together, we can avoid the worst effects of climate change.\"</p><p>The Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program, as launched by the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation, revolves around several transformative initiatives:</p><p>Climate Smart Digital Technologies for Agriculture and Food Security aims to scale up access to climate-smart digital technologies for at least 30 million farmers in Africa. The African Infrastructure Resilience Accelerator will scale up investment for climate-resilient urban and rural infrastructure in key sectors. These include water, transport, energy, and waste management for a circular economy. Empowering Youth for Entrepreneurship and Job Creation in Climate Resilience will provide one million youths with skills for climate adaptation and support 10,000 small and medium size youth-led businesses to create green jobs.  Innovative Financial Initiatives for Africa will help close adaptation finance gaps, enhance access to existing finance and mobilize new public and private sector investment.</p><p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said: \"As well as facing the health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic, countries in Africa are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Tackling this dual challenge requires putting adaptation at the heart of Africa's recovery - so countries build resilience to climate change and spur economic activity. This pandemic has shown us the importance of investing in people. And that is so, so very valuable for Africa, which has a fast-growing young population. This begins by improving education, healthcare, and food security, and in that context, I warmly welcome the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program.\"</p><p>Speaking on behalf of French President Emmanuel Macron, the Chief Executive of the French Development Agency, Remy Rioux said: \"Africa is providing solutions to climate change, including the Great Green Wall and the Desert to Power initiative of the African Development Bank to build the world's largest solar zone in the Sahel of Africa. France fully supports the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program.\"</p><p>Moderating the Leaders' Dialogue, Dr. Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, said: \"Africa has a unique opportunity to advance its development exponentially if it invests now in a climate-smart adapted future based on a deep understanding of climate risks and solutions that put nature and people at the center.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN314195</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6581-B3W1-F12G-X0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The volume of investments hailing from the EAEU member states increased by 6%.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/kazakhstan-advocates-closer-ties-between-eu-and-eurasian-economic-union/\">Kazakhstan advocates closer ties between EU and Eurasian Economic Union</url></h><p>A senior official from Kazakhstan, one of the five members of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), has called for greater cooperation between EEAU and the EU, ultimately aiming to create a single economic space from the Atlantic to Pacific. But a Commission spokesperson made clear it could only be a long-term goal, depending on political developments.</p><p>He also suggested making more use of the region's transit potential by modernising transborder sections in transport corridors, including completing the construction and modernisation of Russia's section along the Western Europe - Western China highway.</p><p>\"Asia is truly becoming the region of the 21st century. It accounts for 28% of the global GDP and the figure will continue to grow. Currently the trend of 'turn to the East' will open new opportunities in transport and logistics. We, as Eurasian countries, must fully unlock our transit potential,\" said Tokayev.</p><p>A summit of EAEU heads of state will be held in Kazakhstan in May 2021, Mikhail Myasnikovich, head of the Eurasian Economic Commission, was quoted as saying.</p><p>The Kazakh President also addressed in a video message the Climate Ambition Summit, which marked five years since the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement. The virtual summit was convened by the UN, Great Britain, and France, in partnership with Italy and Chile.</p><p>Tokayev called the fight to tackle climate change \"urgent and existential\".</p><p>He said that as a landlocked and developing country, Kazakhstan was highly vulnerable to climate change. He acknowledged that the country was still heavily relying on fossil fuels, but was strongly determined to phase them out, decarbonise the economy and reach carbon neutrality by 2060.</p><p>He said Kazakhstan was embracing nature-based solutions\u00a0for both mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>Responding to climate change involves two possible approaches: reducing and stabilising the levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (\"mitigation\") and/or adapting to the climate change already in the pipeline (\"adaptation\").</p><p>In the next five years, Kazakhstan will plant two billion trees to increase carbon absorption and restrain looming desertification as a result of climate change, Tokayev said. He also said Kazakhstan is making climate change adaptation a legal norm in the new environmental code for sectoral and regional policy planning.</p><p>Kazakhstan signed and ratified the Paris agreement in 2016, pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2030, by mobilizing innovative solutions involving the private sector.</p><p>Last week, Kazakhstan revealed plans to extend activities aimed at reviving\u00a0what was once the world's fourth-largest lake, the Aral Sea. In the next few years, the government will plant another 177.5 million\u00a0seedlings in that part of the sea where there has been no water for a long time, in order to prevent desertification.</p><p>Described as one of the worst environmental disasters of the world, the Aral Sea began shrinking in Soviet times, after the waters of the Amu Darya River, which used to flow into the Aral, started to sink into Uzbekistan's cotton fields, never reaching the sea.</p><p>Kazakhstan's solar energy potential is quite large - about 1,500-1,600 kWh/m\u00b2 per year, and the number of sunny days is on average 2,500 hours per year. The vast steppes of Kazakhstan are open to strong winds from the West and North, which allows for the use of wind power stations as well.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/super-grids-silk-road-takes-shape-in-kazakhstan/\">'Super Grids Silk Road' takes shape in Kazakhstan</url></h><p>A series of conferences dedicated to the China-promoted One Belt One Road initiative are taking place in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana.

However, there is still no concrete plan to make it a reality.</p><p>EU policymakers hope to put it in a context in the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the bloc's main farming subsidies programme, but there are still numerous challenges to face.</p><p>\"To incentivise such innovative practices, we need a strong budget for the future CAP, at least at the same level as the current one. Investment is needed in improving farmers' digital skills, advisory services, infrastructures, which may be funded under the EAFRD,\" Kokkalis said.</p><p>Two of the EU's main priorities are digitisation and green projects that will make its economy more resilient. For Kokkalis, this perfectly matches with the mission of precision farming.</p><p>\"It is scientifically proven that precision agriculture practices, using high-tech equipment, have the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, mainly by reducing agricultural inputs which are being targeted to spatial and temporal needs of the crops, and by enhancing the soil's ability to store carbon,\" he said.</p><p>\"Furthermore, with the evolution of the digital farming that applies consistently the methods of precision farming and smart farming as well, I'm convinced that we have in place excellent tools to achieve the ambitious targets of the F2F,\" he added.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/eu-still-reflects-over-agri-innovation-as-uk-mulls-moves-forward/\">EU still reflects over agri-innovation as UK mulls moves forward</url></h><p>While the EU considers the potential role of new innovative techniques to protect harvests from pests and diseases, on the other side of the Channel, the UK is getting ready to open the door to new gene-editing technologies post-Brexit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transferring knowledge is a challenge</emphasis></p><p>The EU's Agriculture Commissioner, Janusz Wojciechowski, shares the same view, saying the F2F aims at making the entire food system more sustainable, including farming.</p><p>\"Precision farming can significantly contribute in making the agricultural sector more sustainable and help towards achieving the established targets such as the 50% reduction of the use and risk of pesticides, and the reduction by at least 20% of the use of fertilisers,\" the Commissioner told EURACTIV.</p><p>However, he emphasised that rolling out of smart farming technologies requires proper know-how, as well as financial and technical support to farmers.</p><p>\"Let's not forget that precision farming on its own will not be enough. It will need to be supported by advisory services, knowledge sharing and building capacity. In addition, other types of innovation will be needed to complement precision farming, such as more nature-based solutions,\" the Polish Commissioner said.</p><p>Likewise, Tassos Haniotis, director for strategy, simplification and policy analysis at the Commission's DG AGRI, explained that when it comes to farm advisory systems, which provide farmers with public information on how to do things better, there is a \"very uneven situation among member states\".</p><p>\"We have been trying to push in that direction since 2003,\" he complained.</p><p>The EU executive has established the so-called \"European Innovation Partnership\" groups to help transfer knowledge across Europe, but in practice, the concept is facing difficulties.</p><p>\"There are linguistic variants in the various networks. So, you might have, let's say in Portugal, a group that works on something that might be pertinent for Greece. But this transfer doesn't normally take place. And that's the knowledge that already exists.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broadband availability: a hot potato</emphasis></p><p>Another burden is the poor broadband infrastructure in Europe's rural areas.</p><p>Although the Commission has already invested (EURO)6 billion in broadband connectivity, member states are still lagging behind.</p><p>\"A serious digital gap continues to exist between rural and urban areas. While 83% of the EU population has access to fast broadband, only 53 % of homes in rural areas have such access. This is an important obstacle for the development of new businesses, jobs and prosperity in rural areas,\" Commissioner Wojciechowski said.</p><p>\"The promotion of broadband will also be one the elements of a long-term vision for rural areas scheduled for release in 2021,\" he concluded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1489126</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BX-3381-DYXB-V4F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>agriculture innovation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>common agricultural policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Farm to Fork</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Janusz Wojciechowski</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Petros Kokkalis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Precision farming</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rural development</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tassos Haniotis</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Business &amp;

A disciplined cash allocation framework and rigorous approach to driving down carbon emissions will deliver value for shareholders, customers and wider society. Shell also confirmed its expectation that total carbon emissions for the company peaked in 2018, and oil production peaked in 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our accelerated strategy will drive down carbon emissions and will deliver value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society,\" said Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We must give our customers the products and services they want and need - products that have the lowest environmental impact. At the same time, we will use our established strengths to build on our competitive portfolio as we make the transition to be a net-zero emissions business in step with society.</p><p>\"Whether our customers are motorists, households or businesses, we will use our global scale and trusted brand to grow in markets where demand for cleaner products and services is strongest, delivering more predictable cash flows and generating higher returns.\"</p><p>From today, Shell is integrating its strategy, portfolio, environmental and social ambitions under the goals of Powering Progress: generating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, powering lives and respecting nature. Shell's reshaped organisation will deliver on these goals through the three business pillars of Growth, Transition and Upstream.</p><p>FINANCIAL RESILIENCE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH DISCIPLINED CAPITAL ALLOCATION</p><p>Shell reiterated its cash priorities to deliver value for shareholders today while growing value for tomorrow, including:</p><p>Maintain the progressive dividend policy, increasing dividend per share by around 4% per year, subject to Board approval.Retain near-term annual Cash capital expenditure of $19-22 billion.Reduce net debt to $65 billion.On reducing net debt to $65 billion, target total shareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow from operations; increased shareholder distributions achieved through a combination of Shell's progressive dividends and share buybacks. Disciplined and measured capital expenditure growth balanced with additional shareholder distributions and further strengthening of our balance sheet.</p><p>In the near term we expect to maintain underlying operating expenses of no higher than $35 billion, and pursue divestments averaging $4 billion a year. Over time the balance of capital spending will shift towards the businesses in the Growth pillar, attracting around half of the additional capital spend. Cash flow will follow the same trend and in the long term will become less exposed to oil and gas prices, with a stronger link to broader economic growth.</p><p>THE ROAD TO NET-ZERO EMISSIONS: A COMPREHENSIVE CARBON MANAGEMENT APPROACH</p><p>Shell set out details of how it will achieve its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards achieving net zero. This target covers the emissions from our operations and the emissions from the use of all the energy products we sell. And crucially, it includes emissions from the oil and gas that others produce and Shell then sells as products to customers, making the target comprehensive.\u00a0</p><p>Powering Progress supports the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0 Celsius. To achieve net zero, Shell:</p><p>will continue with short-term targets that will drive down carbon emissions as we make progress towards our 2050 target, linked to the remuneration of more than 16,500 staff. This includes a new set of targets to reduce our net carbon intensity: 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050, using a baseline of 2016; expects that its total carbon emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes per annum;confirms that its total oil production peaked in 2019;will seek to have access to an additional 25 million tonnes a year of carbon, capture and storage (CCS) capacity by 2035. Currently, three key CCS projects of which Shell is a part, Quest in Canada (in operation), Northern Lights in Norway (sanctioned) and Porthos in The Netherlands (planned), will total around 4.5 million tonnes of capacity;aims to use nature-based solutions (NBS), in line with the philosophy of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate, to offset emissions of around 120 million tonnes a year by 2030, with those we use being of the highest independently verified quality; will work with the Science Based Targets Initiative, Transition Pathway Initiative and others to develop standards for the industry and align with those standards; starting at the 2021 AGM, submit an Energy Transition Plan for an advisory vote to shareholders, the first in the sector to do so. We will update that plan every three years and seek an advisory vote on the progress made each year.\u00a0</p><p>DELIVERING WITH A PORTFOLIO FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION</p><p>Shell is a customer-focused organisation, serving more than 1 million commercial and industrial customers, and 30 million customers at 46,000 retail service stations daily. Shell uses its world-leading brand, global reach and expertise to be a one-stop shop for both consumer and business customers. A presence across the entire energy system means we can optimise, scale up, and trade products in a way that develops markets, drives down costs, and will help accelerate the energy transition.</p><p>Shell's aim is to build material low-carbon businesses of significant scale by the early 2030s. Upstream will continue to deliver vital energy supplies, which will help to generate the cash and returns needed to fund shareholder distributions while accelerating investment in the growth businesses to capture new market opportunities.</p><p>In the near term, Shell's strategy will rebalance its portfolio, investing annually $5-6 billion in its Growth pillar (around $3 billion in Marketing; $2-3 billion in Renewables and Energy Solutions), $8-9 billion in its Transition pillar (around $4 billion Integrated Gas; $4-5 billion Chemicals and Products) and around $8 billion in Upstream. Plans include:</p><p>Growth:</p><p>Marketing</p><p>Target to increase Adjusted Earnings to around $6 billion by 2025 (from $4.5 billion in 2020), achieved by improving the already market-leading position of the lubricants business, an increase to 40 million customers at 55,000 retail sites (from 30 million at 46,000 sites today) and growth of global electric vehicle (EV) network from more than 60,000 charge points today to around 500,000 by 2025.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Low-carbon fuels</emphasis>- extend our leading biofuels production and distribution business, which in 2019 sold more than 10 billion litres of biofuels. Our joint venture Ra\u00edzen, which produces low-carbon fuels from sugar cane in Brazil, recently announced the acquisition of Biosev. This is set to increase Ra\u00edzen's bioethanol production capacity by 50%, to 3.75 billion litres a year, around 3% of global production.</p><p>Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated Power</emphasis>- aim to sell some 560 terawatt hours a year by 2030 which is twice as much electricity as we sell today. We expect to serve more than 15 million retail and business customers worldwide. We aim to be a leading provider of clean Power-as-a-Service. We will make our investments go further by partnering with others with the emphasis for Shell being on managing clean electrons.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nature-based solutions</emphasis>- expect to invest around $100 million a year in high-quality, independently verified projects on the ground to build a significant and profitable business to help customers meet their net-zero emissions targets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis>- build on Shell's leading position in hydrogen by developing integrated hydrogen hubs to serve industry and heavy-duty transport, aim to achieve double-digit share of global clean hydrogen sales.</p><p>Transition:</p><p>Integrated Gas</p><p>Extend leadership in liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes and markets, with selective investment in competitive LNG assets to deliver\u00a0more than 7\u00a0million tonnes per annum of new capacity on-stream by middle of the decade. Continue to support customers with their own net-zero ambitions, with leading offers such as carbon-neutral LNG.</p><p>Chemicals and Products</p><p>Transform our refinery footprint from 13 sites today to six high-value Chemicals and Energy Parks and reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030. Intention to grow volumes of the chemicals portfolio and increase cash generation from Chemicals by $1-2 billion a year by 2030 compared with the medium term. Will produce chemicals from recycled waste, known as circular chemicals, and by 2025 aim to annually process 1 million tonnes a year of plastic waste.</p><p>Upstream:</p><p>Focus on value over volume, being simpler and more resilient, continuing to provide material cash flow into the 2030s.\u00a0 An expected gradual reduction in oil production of around 1-2% each year, including divestments and natural decline.</p><p>CONTACTS</p><p>Media International: +44 (0) 207 934 5550</p><p>Media Americas: +1 832 337 4355</p><p>CAUTIONARY NOTE</p><p>The companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this announcement \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Royal Dutch Shell\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ''Subsidiaries'', \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. This announcement contains the following forward-looking Non-GAAP measures: Adjusted Earnings, Cash capital expenditure, Underlying operating expenses, and Divestment proceeds. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the above forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile the above Non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is dependent on future events some which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures consistent with the company accounting policies and the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Royal Dutch Shell plc's financial statements.</p><p>Also, in this announcement we may refer to Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"Net Carbon Footprint\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries. It is important to note that as of February 11, 2021, Shell's operating plans and budgets do not reflect Shell's Net-Zero Emissions target. Shell's aim is that, in the future, its operating plans and budgets will change to reflect this movement towards its new Net-Zero Emissions target. However, these plans and budgets need to be in step with the movement towards a Net Zero Emissions economy within society and among Shell's customers.</p><p>This announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Royal Dutch Shell.

So celebrating World Oceans Day today, 8 June, only a few weeks after World Earth Day, tells you something. Especially as 70% of Earth is, in fact, the ocean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As reflected in the ambitious phrasing above, the message behind is serious and supported by alarming scientific evidence. Last year, the IPBES - the United Nation's intergovernmental platform for biodiversity and ecosystem services - showed that marine biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates. A few weeks earlier, the IPCC - the UN's climate body - released an alarming report about the impact of climate change on our oceans and the cryosphere.</p><p>The state of the ocean is dire, and this concerns us all. What happens at sea really doesn't stay at sea. When the ocean is threatened, so are the fundamental processes and services which depend on it, from providing half of the oxygen we breathe, or storing a quarter of the CO2 produced by human activity, to governing temperature, wind and precipitation around the globe.</p><p>World Oceans Day exists to remind us of that.</p><p>In this context, the European Commission has recently published its <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/biodiversity/strategy/index_en.htm\">EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</url>, a major deliverable under the European Green Deal. It aims to put Europe's biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030 with benefits for people, the climate and the planet.</p><p>One of the best ways to do that is by taking nature-based solutions, including marine protected areas (MPAs) and other effective conservation measures. Already a decade ago, the international community agreed to protect 10% of the marine environment through MPAs by 2020. In 2018, the EU has formally reached this target, although key challenges remain. Also in the rest of the world, national and regional approaches are being developed. Nevertheless, with global coverage of only 7.5% - and an even smaller percentage that is effectively managed - and close to zero protection in the high seas, we are clearly missing our target for 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, pressure on the ocean continues to increase. Scientists tell us that the 10% we have failed to achieve is no longer even sufficient. Unless we reach critical coverage, together with proper connectivity between areas, the system of marine protected areas will simply not work and our objectives will not be achieved. Therefore, the European Commission strongly supports the global \"30\u00d730\" goal of protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030.</p><p>With the new Biodiversity Strategy, we propose to increase the EU's network of marine protected areas and other effective conservation measures by 19% points over the next ten years, leading to 30% by 2030. It is further proposed that 10% of this network, which is of very high biodiversity value or potential, is even strictly protected. Still this year, we will put forward criteria and guidance for identifying and designating additional areas, including a definition of strict protection, as well as for adequate management planning.</p><p>Achieving this target will not be easy. It will require the commitment from EU countries to implement concrete measures, not just on paper, supported by sufficient financing from public and private sources. Undershooting environmental targets must become a thing of the past.</p><p>Moreover, protecting and restoring marine ecosystems should go hand in hand with reducing our overall footprint on the marine environment, through managing land sustainably and focusing on the environmental sustainability of all blue economy sectors.</p><p>Needless to say, what we preach within our borders, should be reflected in our global ambitions. These should clearly address the drivers of marine biodiversity loss, such as changes in sea use, over-exploitation, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species. In that context, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/policy/ocean-governance_en\">EU's international ocean governance</url> policy becomes even more important.</p><p>Over the last years, the EU has strongly supported international efforts to safeguard our marine environment. Thanks to strong \"green-blue diplomacy\", we have helped establish the world's largest high seas marine protected area, in the Antarctic Ross Sea. At UN level, we are well on our way to conclude negotiations on an international legally binding instrument to conserve and sustainably use marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions. And we have recently agreed on an international moratorium on fisheries in the high seas of the Central Arctic ocean - an unparalleled application of the precautionary principle. In times of growing scepticism about the value of international cooperation, these examples stand firm in its defence.</p><p>But we still have a long way to go. For example, our efforts to expand the MPA network towards East Antarctica and the Weddell Seas must continue and be increased to overcome existing resistances as the creation of 2 new MPAS in this area would significantly contribute to achieving the 30% target.</p><p>The moment of truth will be next year, at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, when we will have the responsibility to adopt a new Global Framework for Biodiversity. We have to ensure that the oceans get the attention they deserve. Our ultimate goal should be that, by 2050 at the latest, all marine ecosystems are healthy, resilient and able to deliver the ecosystem services on which we so strongly depend.</p><p>Rest assured that the EU will put its entire political, diplomatic and economic weight behind this mission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1475554</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6037-4CX1-JCF9-40M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 8, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>seas and oceans</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQOU</classCode><className>MARINE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001074</classCode><className>MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001235</classCode><className>OCEANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001840</classCode><className>WILDLIFE CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D76Q</classCode><className>MARINE BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A093</classCode><className>EARTH DAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRNP</classCode><className>GREEN DEALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS5V</classCode><className>OCEAN HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

The field is certified as low carbon at 3.8 kg of CO2per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) for full life of field emissions, including exploration, development and production, five times less than the world average<sup>2</sup>. In order to supply a fully carbon neutral barrel to Saras, residual emissions of 2,302 tonnes CO2were compensated through a high quality, nature-based carbon capture project, certified by the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). In addition, the entire trade was independently certified as carbon neutral by Intertek under its CarbonZero<sup>TM</sup>standard. As a result, there were no net emissions released during the production of each barrel delivered to Saras.</p><p>As one of the elementary feedstocks of the global economy and energy system for decades to come, it is imperative that the provenance of every barrel of oil is accounted for, thereby beginning the decarbonisation of the entire value chain in line with the Paris Agreement goals. As the energy transition continues to accelerate, providing certified, low emission produced barrels to our customers ensures that they can continue the decarbonisation pathway, delivering a differentiated product to their end users. From 2025, every barrel produced by Lundin Energy, will be produced as carbon neutral.</p><p>Saras is a leading independent player in the Mediterranean refining industry, with a production capacity of about 15 million tons per year and represents a reference model in terms of efficiency and environmental sustainability, thanks to the know-how developed in almost 60 years in the business. With its purpose to be innovative, sustainable and a reference point among energy providers, Saras is actively seeking and developing various projects aimed at minimising its environmental footprint.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Walker, President and CEO of Lundin Energy, commented</emphasis>:\"We were the first company to have one of its field's carbon emissions independently certified as low carbon, and this certified carbon neutral transaction with Saras, is the next stage in what we believe will become a key value differentiator for Lundin Energy. The provenance of a barrel and how it is produced is increasingly important, as society and industry require lower carbon feedstocks to achieve emission reduction targets and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. This trade has been enabled by our industry leading decarbonisation strategy and offers a proof point of where the crude market is heading and the potential value that can be realised through efficient, industry leading emissions reductions.</p><p>\"I am very pleased to have been able to do this industry first with Saras in Italy; their progressive low-carbon strategy is aligned with ours and through this first certified sale of crude they will be able to clearly differentiate the refined product to their own customer base.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dario Scaffardi, CEO</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">and General Manager</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">of Saras, commented</emphasis>:\"We are very proud to be one of the first refining companies in taking this innovative opportunity. The purchase from Lundin of certified carbon neutral produced crude oil, demonstrates the continuous and increasing attention that our Group gives to the environmental sustainability of its activities and goes along with various other projects that we have implemented to support our low-carbon strategy. In particular, at this stage, most of our efforts have been aimed at reducing and offsetting the direct carbon footprint of the refinery with a number of projects, from scaling-up on biofuels production, to energy efficiency initiatives, the development of renewable power production and also green hydrogen.\"</p><p>Lundin Energy is an experienced Nordic oil and gas company that explores for, develops and produces resources economically, efficiently and responsibly. We focus on value creation for our shareholders and wider stakeholders through three strategic pillars: Resilience, Sustainability and Growth. Our high quality, low cost assets mean we are resilient to oil price volatility, and our organic growth strategy, combined with our sustainable approach and commitment to decarbonisation, firmly establishes our leadership role in a lower carbon energy future.

Fourteen years ago, the Leaders of the G20 met for the first time, facing the most severe financial crisis in our generation. We recognized, as large global economies, that collectively we carry responsibilities and that our cooperation was necessary to global economic recovery, to tackle global challenges, and lay a foundation for strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth. We designated the G20 the premier forum for global economic cooperation, and today we reaffirm our commitment to cooperate as we, once again, address serious global economic challenges.</p><p>2. We met in Bali on 15-16 November 2022, at a time of unparalleled multidimensional crises. We have experienced the devastation brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, and other challenges including climate change, which has caused economic downturn, increased poverty, slowed global recovery, and hindered the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>3. This year, we have also witnessed the war in Ukraine further adversely impact the global economy. There was a discussion on the issue. We reiterated our national positions as expressed in other fora, including the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, which, in Resolution No. ES-11/1 dated 2 March 2022, as adopted by majority vote (141 votes for, 5 against, 35 abstentions, 12 absent) deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and demands its complete and unconditional withdrawal from the territory of Ukraine. Most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy - constraining growth, increasing inflation, disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, and elevating financial stability risks. There were other views and different assessments of the situation and sanctions. Recognizing that the G20 is not the forum to resolve security issues, we acknowledge that security issues can have significant consequences for the global economy.</p><p>4. It is essential to uphold international law and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability. This includes defending all the Purposes and Principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and adhering to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians and infrastructure in armed conflicts. The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war.</p><p>5. At today's critical moment for the global economy, it is essential that the G20 undertakes tangible, precise, swift and necessary actions, using all available policy tools, to address common challenges, including through international macro policy cooperation and concrete collaborations. In doing so, we remain committed to support developing countries, particularly the least developed and small island developing states, in responding to these global challenges and achieving the SDGs. In line with the Indonesian G20 Presidency theme  Recover Together, Recover Stronger  we will take coordinated actions to advance an agenda for a strong, inclusive and resilient global recovery and sustainable development that delivers jobs and growth. With the above in mind, we will:</p><p>Stay agile and flexible in our macro-economic policy responses and cooperation. We will make public investments and structural reforms, promote private investments, and strengthen multilateral trade and resilience of global supply chains, to support long-term growth, sustainable and inclusive, green and just transitions. We will ensure long-term fiscal sustainability, with our central banks committed to achieving price stability.<br/>Protect macroeconomic and financial stability and remain committed to using all available tools to mitigate downside risks, noting the steps taken since the Global Financial Crisis to strengthen financial resilience and promote sustainable finance and capital flows.<br/>Take action to promote food and energy security and support stability of markets, providing temporary and targeted support to cushion the impact of price increases, strengthening dialogue between producers and consumers, and increasing trade and investments for long-term food and energy security needs, resilient and sustainable food, fertilizer and energy systems.<br/>Unlock further investments for low- and middle-income and other developing countries, through a greater variety of innovative financing sources and instruments, including to catalyze private investment, to support the achievement of the SDGs. We ask the Multilateral Development Banks to bring forward actions to mobilize and provide additional financing within their mandates, to support achievement of the SDGs including through sustainable development and infrastructure investments, and responding to global challenges.<br/>Recommit to accelerate achievement of the SDGs, achieving prosperity for all through sustainable development.<br/>6. We are deeply concerned by the challenges to global food security exacerbated by current conflicts and tensions. We therefore commit to taking urgent actions to save lives, prevent hunger and malnutrition, particularly to address the vulnerabilities of developing countries, and call for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains. We commit to protect the most vulnerable from hunger by using all available tools to address the global food crisis. We will take further coordinated actions to address food security challenges including price surges and shortage of food commodities and fertilizers globally. Recalling the G20 efforts such as the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, we welcome global, regional, and national initiatives in support of food security, and in particular note the progress made by the UN Secretary General's Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, as well as the World Bank Group's and IMF's food security responses. We emphasize the importance of building on the G20 Matera Declaration, working together to sustainably produce and distribute food, ensure that food systems better contribute to adaptation and mitigation to climate change, and halting and reversing biodiversity loss, diversify food sources, promote nutritious food for all, strengthen global, regional, and local food value chains, and accelerate efforts to reduce food loss and waste. We will also implement the One Health approach, intensify research on food science and technology, and improve stakeholders' capacity along the food supply chains, particularly women, youth, smallholder, and marginal farmers as well as fishers.</p><p>7. We support the international efforts to keep food supply chains functioning under challenging circumstances. We are committed to addressing food insecurity by ensuring accessibility, affordability, and sustainability of food and food products for those in needs, particularly in developing countries and least developed countries. We reiterate our support for open, transparent, inclusive, predictable, and non-discriminatory, rules-based agricultural trade based on WTO rules. We highlight the importance of enhancing market predictability, minimizing distortions, increasing business confidence, and allowing agriculture and food trade to flow smoothly. We reaffirm the need to update global agricultural food trade rules and to facilitate trade in agricultural and food products, as well as the importance of not imposing export prohibitions or restrictions on food and fertilizers in a manner inconsistent with relevant WTO provisions. We are committed to sustained supply, in part based on local food sources, as well as diversified production of food and fertilizers to support the most vulnerable from the disruptions in food trade supply chain. We will avoid adversely impacting food security deliberately. We commit to facilitate humanitarian supplies for ensuring access to food in emergency situations and call on UN Member States and all relevant stakeholders with available resources to provide in-kind donations and resources to support countries most affected by the food crisis, as required and based on assessed needs by governments of affected countries. We continue to support the carve out of humanitarian activities from sanctions and call on all nations to support this aim, including through current efforts at the UN. We will continue to closely monitor the state of global food security and nutrition.</p><p>8. We welcome the T\u00fcrkiye and UN-brokered two Istanbul Agreements signed on 22 July 2022 and consisting of the Initiative on the Safe Transportation of Grain and Foodstuffs from Ukrainian Ports (Black Sea Grain Initiative) and the Memorandum of Understanding between the Russian Federation and the Secretariat of the United Nations on Promoting Russian Food Products and Fertilizers to the World Markets, on the unimpeded deliveries of grain, foodstuffs, and fertilizers/inputs from Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to ease tension and prevent global food insecurity and hunger in developing countries. We emphasize the importance of their full, timely and continued implementation by all relevant stakeholders, as well as the UN Secretary-General's calls for continuation of these efforts by the Parties. In this context we highlight other efforts that ensure the flow of agri-food goods such as the EU Solidarity Lanes and the Russian donations of fertilizers facilitated by the World Food Programme. Moreover, we take note of various initiatives addressing food insecurity such as the Arab Coordination Group initiative.</p><p>9. We are committed to supporting the adoption of innovative practices and technologies, including digital innovation in agriculture and food systems to enhance productivity and sustainability in harmony with nature and promote farmers and fishers' livelihoods and increase income, in particular smallholders by increasing efficiency, and equal access to food supply chains. We will promote responsible investments in agricultural research and science and evidence-based approaches. We will continue to strengthen the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as an early warning tool, to enhance food and fertilizer/inputs market transparency, reduce market uncertainties, and support coordinated policy responses for food security and nutrition, through the sharing of reliable and timely data and information.</p><p>10. We ask the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Bank Group (WBG) to share with us the results of their mapping exercises on food insecurity, which will be consolidated in the future with inputs from technical experts and other relevant international organizations, and will provide a systemic analysis of responses to address food security. This will identify any major gaps in global responses; examine food and nutrition variables and funding; examine the supply and demand of fertilizers; build on the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS); and identify any medium-term issues that require further technical and systemic analysis. The FAO and WBG will report back by the 2023 Spring Meetings.</p><p>11. We meet at a time of climate and energy crises, compounded by geopolitical challenges. We are experiencing volatility in energy prices and markets and shortage/disruptions to energy supply. We underline the urgency to rapidly transform and diversify energy systems, advance energy security and resilience and markets stability, by accelerating and ensuring clean, sustainable, just, affordable, and inclusive energy transitions and flow of sustainable investments. We stress the importance of ensuring that global energy demand is matched by affordable energy supplies. We reiterate our commitment to achieve global net zero greenhouse gas emissions/carbon neutrality by or around mid-century, while taking into account the latest scientific developments and different national circumstances. We call for continued support for developing countries, especially in the most vulnerable countries, in terms of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy, capacity building, affordable latest technology within the public domain, mutually beneficial technology cooperation and financing mitigation actions in the energy sector.</p><p>12. We reaffirm our commitment to achieve SDG 7 targets and strive to close the gaps in energy access and to eradicate energy poverty. Recognising our leadership role, and guided by the Bali Compact and the Bali Energy Transition Roadmap, we are committed to finding solutions to achieve energy markets stability, transparency, and affordability. We will accelerate transitions and achieve our climate objectives by strengthening energy supply chain and energy security, and diversifying energy mixes and systems. We will rapidly scale up the deployment of zero and low emission power generation, including renewable energy resources, and measures to enhance energy efficiency, abatement technologies as well as removal technologies, taking into account national circumstances. We recognise the importance to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies, and the adoption of policies, to transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up the deployment of clean power generation, including renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency measures, including accelerating efforts towards the phasedown of unabated coal power, in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards just transitions. We will increase our efforts to implement the commitment made in 2009 in Pittsburgh to phase-out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable. We will strengthen international cooperation as well as relevant producer-consumer dialogues on securing energy affordability and accessibility by limiting volatility in energy prices and scaling up clean, safe, inclusive, and sustainable technologies, including developing regional energy interconnectivity. We are committed to promote investment in sustainable infrastructure and industry, as well as innovative technologies and a wide range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms to support clean energy transitions, including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, while providing targeted support for the poorest and the most vulnerable.</p><p>13. Mindful of our leadership role, we reaffirm our steadfast commitments, in pursuit of the objective of UNFCCC, to tackle climate change by strengthening the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and its temperature goal, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. We will play our part fully in implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact and the relevant outcomes of previous COPs and CMAs, in particular COP 26, including the call to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in our NDCs, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement. In this regard, we welcome enhanced climate actions resulting from the new or updated NDCs and invite parties to urgently scale up mitigation and adaptation ambition and means of implementation as well as make progress on loss and damage at COP 27 which is being held in Africa. Noting the IPCC assessments that the impact of climate change will be much lower at a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C compared with 2\u00b0C, we resolve to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. This will require meaningful and effective actions and commitment by all countries, taking into account different approaches, through the development of clear national pathways that align long-term ambition with short and medium-term goals, and with international cooperation and support, including finance and technology, and sustainable and responsible consumption and production as critical enablers, in the context of sustainable development.</p><p>14. We welcome the progress to date towards achieving a Post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). We urge all parties and countries to finalize and adopt the GBF with the view of realizing of 2050 Vision of \"Living in harmony with Nature\" at the second part of COP15 CBD as a strong framework of action and accountability for halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030 and, as appropriate, to update National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans accordingly. We emphasize the importance of achieving and synergizing the objectives of the three Rio Conventions. We stress the need for clear and measurable goals and targets for biodiversity and means of implementation and accountability. We commit to strengthen actions to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and call on CBD Parties to adopt an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework at COP-15 in Montreal. We urge for increased resource mobilization from all sources, including from countries and entities, to provide new and additional financial resources for the implementation of the GBF, once it is negotiated, including to help enable and support developing country parties, and for aligning private and public financial flows with biodiversity objectives. We will scale up efforts to combat biodiversity loss, deforestation, desertification, land degradation and drought, as well as restoring degraded land to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030, and in support of the G20's ambition to reduce land degradation by 50% by 2040 on a voluntary basis. We recognize the effort made by a number of countries to ensure that at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean and seas are conserved or protected by 2030 and we will help to make progress towards this objective in accordance with national circumstances. We commit to reduce environmental impacts by changing unsustainable consumption and production patterns as well as to enhance environmentally sound waste management including by preventing illegal cross-border traffic of waste.</p><p>15. We will step up efforts to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, including through Nature-based Solutions and Ecosystem-based Approaches, support climate mitigation and adaptation, enhance environmental conservation and protection, sustainable use and restoration, responding to natural disasters, reduce ecosystem degradation, enhance ecosystem services and to address issues affecting the marine and coastal environment. We will further promote sustainable development and lifestyles, resource efficiency and circular economy to increase sustainability and work together on scientific knowledge-sharing, raising awareness, and capacity building, particularly to advance on the ocean-based climate action. We are committed to ending illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We welcome the WTO multilateral Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies and encourage its rapid entry into force. In line with the UNEA Resolution 5/14, we are committed to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition of completing the work by the end of 2024. We highlight the progress made and call on participating delegations to achieve an ambitious and balanced agreement without delay on an international legally binding instrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, as called for in the UNGA Resolution 69/292. We also acknowledge that ecosystems, including forests, seagrasses, coral reefs, wetland ecosystems in all their diversity, including peatlands and mangrove, support climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.</p><p>16. We acknowledge the urgent need to strengthen policies and mobilize financing, from all sources in a predictable, adequate and timely manner to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation including significantly increasing support for developing countries. We recall and further urge developed countries to fulfil their commitments to deliver on the goal of jointly mobilizing USD 100 billion per year urgently by 2020 and through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation action and transparency on implementation. We also support continued deliberations on an ambitious new collective quantified goal of climate finance from a floor of USD 100 billion per year to support developing countries, that helps in fulfilling the objective of the UNFCCC and implementation of the Paris Agreement. We emphasize the importance of transparency in the implementation of the pledges. We also recall the Glasgow Climate Pact urging developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries, from 2019 levels, by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled up financial resource, recalling Article 9 of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>17. In the context of strengthening global efforts to reach the objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as implementing the COP26 commitments, we reiterate that our policy mix toward carbon neutrality and net zero should include a full range of fiscal, market and regulatory mechanisms including, as appropriate, the use of carbon pricing and non-pricing mechanisms and incentives, and phase out and rationalize, over the medium term, inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and commit to achieve this objective, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable, and in line with national circumstances. We acknowledge the macro-economic risks stemming from climate change and will continue discussions on the costs and benefits of different transitions.</p><p>18. We are committed to take actions in support of orderly, just and affordable transitions to achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in line with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement as well as with the convention on Biological Diversity. We welcome the progress made across the G20, international organizations, other international networks and initiatives, and the private sector in addressing the priorities of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, which is voluntary and flexible in nature, and call for further efforts to advance the Roadmap's recommended actions that will scale up sustainability financing. We welcome the establishment of the Sustainable Finance Working Group's online dashboard and repository of relevant work, to illustrate ongoing and future progress made on the Roadmap, and encourage members to contribute on a voluntary basis, taking country circumstances into consideration. We endorse the 2022 G20 Sustainable Finance Report which articulates practical and voluntary recommendations for jurisdictions and relevant stakeholders in developing transition finance frameworks, improving the credibility of financial institutions' net zero commitments and scaling up sustainable finance instruments, with a focus on improving accessibility and affordability. We also welcome the valuable discussion during the Presidency's Forum on policy levers that incentivize financing and investment to support the transition.</p><p>19. We remain committed to promoting a healthy and sustainable recovery which builds towards achieving and sustaining Universal Health Coverage under the SDGs. While the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared monkeypox as another Public Health Emergency International Concern (PHEIC), reinforcing that international health threats are ever present and that the G20 and broader global community must come together to improve our collective prevention, preparedness and response capabilities. We reaffirm the importance of strengthening of national health systems by putting people at the center of preparedness and equip them to respond effectively. We emphasize the need for equitable access to pandemic medical countermeasures, and welcome the efforts of ACT-A, and note that the results of the ACT-A external evaluations can be useful lessons for future discussions. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global health governance, with the leading and coordination role of WHO and support from other international organizations. We support the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) that will draft and negotiate a legally binding instrument that should contain both legally binding and non-legally binding elements to strengthen pandemic PPR and the working group on the International Health Regulations that will consider amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) mindful that the decision will be made by World Health Assembly.</p><p>20. The G20 High Level Independent Panel, as well as the WHO and World Bank have estimated there is an annual pandemic PPR financing gap of approximately USD 10 billion. As initiated by the Saudi Arabian G20 Presidency, the Italian G20 Presidency and continued by the Indonesian G20 Presidency, we welcome the provision of additional financial resources, to assist in financing critical gaps in implementing IHR (2005) and increase PPR capacities. In this regard, we welcome the establishment of a new Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic PPR (the \"Pandemic Fund') hosted by the World Bank. It aims to address critical pandemic PPR gaps and build capacity at national, regional and global levels, bring additionality in financial resources for pandemic PPR, catalyze complementary investments, and facilitate a coordinated and coherent approach to pandemic PPR strengthening. We welcome the Pandemic Fund's inclusive membership and representation from low- and middle-income countries, civil society organizations and donors, and acknowledge the WHO's technical expertise and central coordination role in this endeavor, which reflects its leadership role in the global health architecture. We appreciate the work of the Secretariat hosted by the World Bank, with the WHO as technical lead and as chair of the Technical Advisory Panel. We look forward to the launch of the Pandemic Fund's first call for proposals as soon as possible. We commit to increase the capacity of developing countries for pandemic PPR through the Pandemic Fund, and look forward to the stocktaking review of the Pandemic Fund at the end of its first year to draw on lessons learned and incorporate any changes needed to ensure it is operating in accordance with its governing documents and effective at filling critical PPR gaps, and that it continues to have a central coordination role for the WHO, maintains a strong connection to the G20, and is inclusive of the perspectives of low- and middle-income countries and additional non-G20 partners in its decision making. We commend the pledges by current donors, amounting to over USD 1.4 billion, and encourage additional voluntary pledges. We call on new donors to join the Pandemic Fund, as they are able to.</p><p>21. It is essential to continue collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR. We extend the mandate of the Task Force, and ask the Secretariat of the Task Force to work with the Task Force co-chairs, the incoming Indian G20 Presidency, the G20 Troika, and G20 members to agree on a Task Force workplan for 2023, taking into account a multi-year planning horizon. We thank the WHO for continuing to host the Secretariat, with support from the World Bank. In 2023 the Task Force will continue to be co-chaired by Indonesia and Italy, representing advanced and emerging economy perspectives, and will continue to draw on expertise of the WHO, International Financial Institutions and other relevant organizations, with the support of the 2023 Indian G20 Presidency. To expand the voice of lower income countries we invite key regional organizations to join the Task Force meetings, as appropriate. We will work closely with the WHO to ensure the Task Force continues to complement the global pandemic PPR architecture and there is no further duplication and fragmentation of the global health governance system. Delivering on the mandate from the G20 Rome Leaders' Declaration, in 2023 the Task Force will continue developing coordination arrangements between Finance and Health Ministries, and share best practices and experiences from past finance-health coordination in order to develop joint responses to pandemics, as appropriate. The Task Force will undertake work to better understand economic risks and vulnerabilities from pandemics, and how to mitigate them, with a focus on finance and health coordination in response to new pandemics, considering country-specific circumstances and recognizing the importance of further work on resource mobilization. We ask the Task Force to report back to Finance and Health Ministers in 2023 on its progress.</p><p>22. We recognize that the extensive COVID-19 immunization is a global public good and we will advance our effort to ensure timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs). Acknowledging the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration on the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics and the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement at the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12), we note that, no later than six months from the date of the Ministerial Decision on the TRIPS Agreement, WTO members will decide on its extension to cover the production and supply of COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics. We remain committed to embedding a multisectoral One Health approach and enhancing global surveillance, including genomic surveillance, in order to detect pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that may threaten human health. To enable global pathogen surveillance as part of our commitment to implement the IHR (2005), we encourage sharing of pathogen data in a timely manner on shared and trusted platforms in collaboration with WHO. We encourage sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of pathogens consistent with applicable national laws.</p><p>23. We recognize the need for strengthening local and regional health product manufacturing capacities and cooperation as well as sustainable global and regional research and development networks to facilitate better access to VTDs globally, especially in developing countries, and underscore the importance of public-private partnership, and technology transfer and knowledge sharing on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We support the WHO mRNA Vaccine Technology Transfer hub as well as all as the spokes in all regions of the world with the objective of sharing technology and technical know-how on voluntary and mutually agreed terms. We welcome joint research and joint production of vaccines, including enhanced cooperation among developing countries. We acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.</p><p>24. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the digital ecosystem and digital economy. We recognize the importance of digital transformation in reaching the SDGs. We acknowledge that affordable and high-quality digital connectivity is essential for digital inclusion and digital transformation, while a resilient, safe and secure online environment is necessary to enhance confidence and trust in the digital economy. We recognize the importance of policies to create an enabling, inclusive, open, fair and non-discriminatory digital economy that fosters the application of new technologies, allows businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive, and protects and empowers consumers, while addressing the challenges, related to digital divides, privacy, data protection, intellectual property rights, and online safety. We acknowledge the importance to counter disinformation campaigns, cyber threats, online abuse, and ensuring security in connectivity infrastructure. We remain committed to further enable data free flow with trust and promote cross-border data flows. We will advance a more inclusive, human-centric, empowering, and sustainable digital transformation. We also reaffirm the role of data for development, economic growth and social well-being.</p><p>25. We encourage international collaboration to further develop digital skills and digital literacy to harness the positive impacts of digital transformation, especially for women, girls, and people in vulnerable situations, and further support efforts to develop reliable skills and literacy. We note the increasing demands for a workforce adept at utilizing emerging technologies, education and training, reskilling and upskilling to meet such demands. We also seek to increase connectivity by accelerating high capacity and secure infrastructure and provide more accessible and affordable resources and tools, while also improve the digital literacy skills of learners, teachers, school leaders, and other educational professional to ensure universal access to education, accelerate learning recovery and promote lifelong learning.</p><p>26. We found digital technology becomes the key for recovery and empowerment across various sectors, including in building a resilient and sustainable food system and agriculture, creating sustainable and decent jobs and human capacity development, supporting inclusive trade, industrialization and investment, increasing productivity, as well as opening up the potential of the future economy, especially for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and start-ups. It is essential to ensure that no one is left behind in our effort to digitally transform our society, by involving all stakeholders, including the youth, women, business sector, audit institution, parliaments, scientists, and labours.</p><p>27. We support continued implementation of the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-Border Payments, including the future delivery of the initial estimates for key performance indicators and 2022 Progress Report that sets out priorities for the next stage of work. We encourage central banks, other public authorities and the payments industry to continue to work collaboratively on these important initiatives to enhance cross-border payments. We welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) on interlinking payment systems and the role of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that was presented in a joint workshop by the Indonesian G20 Presidency in coordination with the BIS CPMI and the BIS Innovation Hub (BISIH) on cross-border payments and interoperability at the Festival Ekonomi Keuangan Digital Indonesia (FEKDI) 2022. We also welcome the joint report by the BIS CPMI, BISIH, IMF, and World Bank on options for access to and interoperability of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border payments.</p><p>28. We endorse the G20 Financial Inclusion Framework on Harnessing Digitalization to Increase Productivity and Foster a Sustainable and Inclusive Economy for Women, Youth and MSMEs or Yogyakarta Financial Inclusion Framework guided by the G20 2020 Financial Inclusion Action Plan. To address digitalization and sustainable finance developments, and support financial inclusion and well-being, we endorse the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on Financial Consumer Protection and welcome the updated G20/OECD High-Level Principles on SME Financing.</p><p>29. To support our collective ambition to recover together, recover stronger, we commit to well-calibrated, well-planned, and well-communicated policies to support sustainable recovery, with due consideration to country-specific circumstances. We commit to mitigate scarring effects to support strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. We will stay agile and flexible in our fiscal policy response, standing ready to adjust to the changing circumstances as needed. Temporary and targeted measures to help sustain the purchasing power of the most vulnerable and cushion the impact of commodity price increases, including energy and food prices, should be well designed to avoid adding to high inflationary pressures. We will continue to enhance macro policy cooperation, preserve financial stability and long-term fiscal sustainability, and safeguard against downside risks and negative spillovers. Macroprudential policies need to remain vigilant to guard against rising systemic risks as financial conditions tighten. Recognizing that many currencies have moved significantly this year with increased volatility, we reaffirm the commitments made on exchange rates by our Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in April 2021. We also reiterate the importance of global cooperation and express our appreciation to the Indonesian G20 Presidency for its efforts to maintain an effective system of multilateralism through the G20.</p><p>30. G20 central banks are strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. To that end, they are closely monitoring the impact of price pressures on inflation expectations and will continue to appropriately calibrate the pace of monetary policy tightening in a data-dependent and clearly communicated manner, ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored, while being mindful to safeguard the recovery and limit cross-country spillovers. Central bank independence is crucial to achieving these goals and buttressing monetary policy credibility.</p><p>31. We are committed to the swift implementation of the OECD/G20 two-pillar international tax package. We welcome the progress on Pillar One. We also welcome progress on Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Model Rules, which pave the way for consistent implementation at a global level as a common approach, and we look forward to the completion of the GloBE Implementation Framework. We call on the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) to finalize Pillar One, including remaining issues and by signing the Multilateral Convention in the first half of 2023, and to complete the negotiations of the Subject to Tax Rule (STTR) under Pillar Two that would allow the development of a Multilateral Instrument for its implementation. We will work to strengthen the tax and development agenda in light of the July 2022 G20 Ministerial Symposium on Tax and Development, and we note the G20/OECD Roadmap on Developing Countries and International Tax. We support the progress made on implementing internationally agreed tax transparency standards, including regional efforts and welcome the signing of the Asia Initiative Bali Declaration in July 2022. We also welcome the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and the amendments to the Common Reporting Standard, both of which we consider to be integral additions to the global standards for automatic exchange of information. We call on the OECD to conclude the work on implementation packages, including possible timelines, and invite the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes to build on its commitment and monitoring processes to ensure widespread implementation of both packages by relevant jurisdictions.</p><p>32. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthening the long-term financial resilience of the international financial architecture, including by promoting sustainable capital flows, and developing local currency capital markets. We welcome the IMF's revised Institutional View on Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows and look forward to continued discussions with international organizations on the coherent implementation of international frameworks for the use of capital flow management measures, while being mindful of their original purpose. We look forward to further progress by the IMF in operationalizing the Integrated Policy Framework and welcome the report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on Macro-financial stability frameworks. We welcome continued exploration of how CBDCs could potentially be designed to facilitate cross-border payments, while preserving the stability and integrity of the international monetary and financial system. We welcome the successful completion of the G20 TechSprint 2022, a joint initiative with the BISIH, which has contributed to the debate on the most practical and feasible solutions to implement CBDCs. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining a strong and effective Global Financial Safety Net with a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at its center. We remain committed to revisiting the adequacy of quotas and will continue the process of IMF governance reform under the 16th General Review of Quotas, including a new quota formula as a guide, by 15 December 2023. We take note on the continuation of discussion of the IMF surcharge policy.</p><p>33. 1 We are committed to support all vulnerable countries to recover together, recover stronger. We welcome pledges amounting to USD 81.6 billion through the voluntary channelling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions, and call for further pledges from all willing and able countries to meet the total global ambition of USD 100 billion of voluntary contributions for countries most in need. We welcome the operationalization of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST) to help eligible low-income countries, small states and vulnerable middle-income countries address longer-term structural challenges that pose macroeconomic risks, including those stemming from pandemics and climate change. We welcome the voluntary contributions to the RST and call for additional pledges and timely contributions to it and to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), especially for subsidy resources, to ensure a broad pool of contributors to meet funding needs. We are open to explore viable options for countries to voluntarily channel SDRs through Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets status of SDRs. We will explore ways, including through balance sheet optimization measures, and other potential avenues, to maximize MDBs' development impact. We welcome early deliberations and urge MDBs to continue to discuss options for implementing the recommendations of the G20 Independent Review of MDBs' Capital Adequacy Frameworks within their own governance frameworks, and to deliver an update in Spring 2023. This will inform the ongoing development of a roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations, while safeguarding MDBs' long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. We acknowledge the concluding report on the 2020 Shareholding Review of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and look forward to the 2025 Shareholding Review. At this challenging juncture, we reiterate our commitment to step up our efforts to implement the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner. We welcome progress in this regard, including the provision of financing assurances for Zambia. We welcome the conclusion of the debt treatment to Chad and encourage the timely conclusion of the debt treatment for Zambia by early 2023. We also encourage the conclusion of the debt treatment for Ethiopia under an IMF-supported program. We are concerned about the deteriorating debt situation in some vulnerable middle income countries. This could be addressed by multilateral coordination that involves all official and private bilateral creditors to take swift action to respond to their requests for debt treatments. We stress the importance for private creditors and other official bilateral creditors to commit to providing debt treatments on terms at least as favourable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We reaffirm the importance of joint efforts by all actors, including private creditors, to continue working toward enhancing debt transparency. We welcome the efforts of private sector lenders who have already contributed data to the joint Institute of International Finance (IIF)/OECD Data Repository Portal, and continue to encourage others to also contribute on a voluntary basis.</p><p>34. In the face of a more challenging global economic and financial outlook, we underline the need to reinforce global financial system resilience and ask the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and IMF to continue their monitoring efforts. We commit to sustaining global financial stability, including through continued coordination of policy measures and implementation of international standards. We welcome the FSB's final report on financial sector exit strategies and scarring effects of COVID-19 and its conclusions regarding financial stability issues by the end of 2022. We strongly support global policy actions to increase resilience, in particular against cross-border spillovers, including by addressing the identified structural vulnerabilities in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) from a systemic perspective. To this end, we welcome the FSB's NBFI progress report with policy proposals to address systemic risk in NBFI, including in open-ended funds. We welcome the report by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) on the review of margining practices. We support taking forward the implementation of the FSB updated Roadmap for addressing climate-related financial risks which complements the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. Globally consistent data are needed in order to effectively address climate-related financial risks. We look forward to the finalization of standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) in support of globally consistent, comparable and reliable climate-related financial disclosures, and its work beyond climate, and we welcome the efforts to achieve interoperability across disclosure frameworks. We welcome the FSB progress report on achieving consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures and the final report on supervisory and regulatory approaches to climate-related risks. We welcome the report by the FSB and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) on climate-scenario analysis by jurisdictions.</p><p>35. We welcome ongoing work by the FSB and international standard setters to ensure that the crypto-assets ecosystem, including so-called stablecoins, is closely monitored and subject to robust regulation, supervision, and oversight to mitigate potential risks to financial stability. We welcome the FSB's proposed approach for establishing a comprehensive international framework for the regulation of crypto-asset activities based on the principle of \"same activity, same risk, same regulation'. We welcome the FSB consultative report on the review of its high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision and oversight of \"global stablecoin\" arrangements. We also welcome the FSB consultation report on promoting international consistency of regulatory and supervisory approaches to crypto-assets activities and markets. It is critical to build public awareness of risks, to strengthen regulatory outcomes and to support a level playing field, while harnessing the benefits of innovation. We welcome the final guidance by the BIS CPMI and IOSCO which confirms that the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures apply to systematically important stablecoin arrangements. We welcome the FSB consultative report on achieving greater convergence in cyber incidents reporting, and look forward to the final report. We welcome the results of the second phase of the Data Gaps Initiative (DGI-2) and will continue to work with partners in addressing the identified remaining challenges. We welcome the workplan on the new Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) prepared by the IMF, FSB and the Inter-Agency Group on Economic and Financial Statistics (IAG) in collaboration with participating members. We ask the IMF, the FSB and the IAG to begin work on filling these data gaps and report back on progress in the second half of 2023, noting that the targets are ambitious and delivery will need to take into account national statistical capacities, priorities, and country circumstances as well as avoiding overlap and duplication at international level. We welcome the progress of work on the review of the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, including the second report and the ongoing public consultation, and look forward to further updates on the review.</p><p>36. We reaffirm that the rules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, sustainable and transparent multilateral trading system (MTS), with the WTO at its core, is indispensable to advancing our shared objectives of inclusive growth, innovation, job creation and sustainable development in an open and interconnected world as well as to supporting the resilience and recovery of a global economy under strain due to COVID-19 and global supply chain disruption. We agree that reforming the WTO is key in strengthening trust in the MTS. We will continue to ensure a level playing field and fair competition to foster a favourable trade and investment environment for all. We note the importance of the contribution of the MTS to promote the UN 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. Commending the successful conclusion of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12), we commit to seize and advance the positive momentum by engaging in active, constructive, pragmatic, and focused discussions on WTO reform to improve all its functions, including reform of the dispute settlement mechanism, on the path leading to the MC13.</p><p>37. We are committed to reinforce international trade and investment cooperation to address supply chain issues and avoid trade disruptions. We believe that trade and climate/environmental policies should be mutually supportive and WTO consistent and contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. We also recognise the importance of inclusive international cooperation on digital trade. We recognize the need to promote value addition through sustainable and inclusive investment in highly productive sectors such as downstream manufacturing, digital trade, and services, and to foster linkages between foreign investors and local enterprises particularly MSMEs. We note the initiative from the Indonesian Presidency to hold discussions on policy coherence between trade, investment and industry, and to continue addressing industry-related issues in the broader G20 process, as appropriate.</p><p>38. We recognize the importance of revitalizing infrastructure investment in a sustainable, inclusive, accessible, and affordable way. We endorse the voluntary and non-binding G20/GI Hub Framework on How to Best Leverage Private Sector Participation to Scale Up Sustainable Infrastructure Investment which will consider country circumstances, and which will complement investment from other sources, including public investment and finance provided by MDBs. We note the Outcome Document from the 2022 G20 Infrastructure Investors Dialogue. To enhance social inclusion and address subnational disparities, we endorse the G20-OECD Policy Toolkit on Mobilizing Funding and Financing for Inclusive and Quality Infrastructure Investment in Regions and Cities, prepared with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). We note the Preliminary Findings Report on Gender Inclusive Approaches in Private Participation in Infrastructure in promoting gender considerations during the infrastructure lifecycle and look forward to the final report. We endorse the InfraTracker 2.0 which will enable both the public and private sectors towards transformative infrastructure investment post-COVID-19, by providing insights into long-term infrastructure strategies and plans. To narrow the digital divide, we endorse the G20 Compendium of Case Studies on Digital Infrastructure Finance: Issues, Practices and Innovations. We endorse the Quality Infrastructure Investment (QII) Indicators and associated guidance note, developed for the G20, which are voluntary and non-binding and consider country circumstances, and we look forward to further discussions on how the QII indicators can be applied. We welcome progress made towards developing a possible new governance model for the Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub) and ask that principles to guide the process be finalized as soon as possible.</p><p>39. The rise of automation and digital technologies are reshaping the world of work, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Adding to the situation, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated pre-existing inequalities in many countries and continues to disproportionately affect women, youth, older workers, persons with disabilities and migrant workers. We underline that it remains our utmost priority to mitigate the adverse impact of the current trends on the labour market, reduce inequalities while responding effectively to the opportunities that automation and digital technologies present and promote gender equality. We remain committed to the promotion of decent work and the elimination of child and forced labour.</p><p>40. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of migrants, including migrant workers, refugees, in our recovery efforts, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We also recognize the importance of preventing irregular migration flows and the smuggling of migrants, as part of a comprehensive approach for safe, orderly and regular migration, while responding to humanitarian needs and the root causes of displacement. We support strengthening cooperation between countries of origin, transit, and destination. We will continue the dialogue on migration and forced displacement in future Presidencies.</p><p>41. We remain committed to a human-centred, inclusive, fair, sustainable approach that leads to greater social justice, decent work, and social protection for all. We will continue our work to integrate persons with disabilities, women, and youth across sectors and levels in pursuit of an inclusive labour market. We are resolved to promote sustainable development of human capacity, labour markets, and productivity, including through community-based vocational education and training, to advance job creation through entrepreneurship, to empower MSMEs, and to accelerate our efforts to foster and adapt labour protection for all workers, including those in the informal sector. We will maximize our approach to skills development to respond effectively to the needs of the labour market, with the involvement of social partners. We will accelerate progress towards the Antalya Youth Goal, as well as universal social protection for all by 2030.</p><p>42. We are deeply concerned that multidimensional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lack of fiscal space and unequal access to finance and technology, are posing significant challenges towards realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in a timely manner. We will demonstrate leadership and take collective actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and accelerate the achievement of the SDGs by 2030 and address developmental challenges by reinvigorating a more inclusive multilateralism and reform aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>43. In this regard, we will strengthen inclusive and sustainable recovery and build resilience in all developing countries, including SIDS in the Pacific and Caribbean and LDCs, through ambitious and concrete actions. We also reiterate our continued support to Africa, including through the G20 Compact with Africa and the G20 Initiative on Supporting Industrialization in Africa and LDCs. We will focus on MSMEs, adaptive social protection, green economy and blue economy. We recognise the need for partnership to promote mutually beneficial technology cooperation and share good practice, as well as the need for inclusive and quality infrastructure investment for stronger recovery and resilience. We underscore the need to address the financing gap towards implementation of the 2030 Agenda, through enhancing innovative financing mechanisms, including blended finance, while noting the importance of transparency and mutual accountability. We take note of initiatives such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure and the Global Blended Finance Alliance, and welcome the Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction. We look forward to the success of the SDGs Summit in 2023.</p><p>44. Access to education is a human right and a pivotal tool for inclusive and sustainable economic recovery. We welcome the outcome of the Transforming Education Summit. We will act in solidarity in particular with developing countries to rebuild more resilient, tech-enabled, accessible, and effective education systems. We will empower relevant actors within and beyond G20 to remove barriers to education, improve teaching and learning environments, and support transitions within and across all stages of education, with emphasis on women and girls. We also underscore the importance of learners' well-being in their preparation for work and meaningful participation and contribution to more equitable, inclusive and sustainable society. We reaffirm the importance of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and our commitment to SDG4 to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and training. We are committed to promoting lifelong learning at all levels amidst the changing nature of work and encourage partnership in this regard.</p><p>45. We acknowledge the importance of research and innovation in sustainable resource utilization in various sectors, especially in the midst of health, climate, food and energy crises. We welcome research and innovation collaboration for the conservation of biodiversity and its use to support the sustainable development including green and blue economy. We also promote inclusive collaborations to further research and innovation, as well as promoting researchers' international mobility.</p><p>46. As women and girls continue to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and other crises, we reaffirm our commitment to put gender equality and women's empowerment at the core of our efforts for an inclusive recovery and sustainable development. We commit to implement the G20 Roadmap Towards and Beyond the Brisbane Goal foster financial inclusion and access to digital technologies, including to address the unequal distribution in paid and unpaid care and domestic work, with a focus on closing the gender pay gap. We commit to the elimination of gender-based violence, the enhancement of social, health, care and educational services, and the overcoming of gender stereotypes. We will continue to advance women's and girls' equal access to inclusive and quality education, including participations in STEM education, women entrepreneurship through MSMEs, and women's and girls' access in leadership positions. We will promote quality of life for women in rural areas and women with disabilities. We welcome the work that has been done by the EMPOWER Alliance and its engagement with the G20, and support the future convening of G20 Ministerial Conference on Women's Empowerment.</p><p>47. We reaffirm the important role of tourism for global recovery, and the community-based approach for rebuilding a more human-centred, inclusive, sustainable, and resilient tourism sector. We acknowledge the vital importance of strengthening safe international mobility and connectivity and seamless post-Covid travel to enable tourism recovery. We further recognize that creative economy, which involve knowledge-based economy, human creativity, and intellectual property rights, contributes to improving the resiliency of tourism local communities and MSMEs through human capital development, digital transformation, innovation, public-private partnerships, sustainable preservation of natural and cultural heritage, and innovative financing while retaining their significant commercial and cultural values.</p><p>48. We reaffirm the role of culture as an enabler and driver for sustainable development with intrinsic value beyond its social and economic benefits. We are committed to develop policies that draw on cultural diversity as a resource for sustainable living and promote an inclusive and equitable ecosystem at all levels that values the contribution of those working in the culture, arts and heritage sectors. We will respect, protect and preserve the cultural heritage of our peoples, including local communities and indigenous peoples, as applicable. We support public incentives and sustainable investments from the private sector to strengthen the cultural economy. We will safeguard cultural heritage as well as fighting illicit trafficking of cultural property and promoting restitution to its rightful owner/countries of origin, in accordance with the relevant UNESCO Conventions and national laws.</p><p>49. We will continue to lead by example through strengthening and implementing our obligations and commitments to anti-corruption efforts including through legally binding instruments, while renewing our commitment to zero tolerance for corruption. We emphasize the importance of transparency and accountability for both public and private sector as a crucial part of a collective recovery effort. We underscore the important role of auditing as well as public participation and anti-corruption education in preventing and tackling any form of corruption. We recall our commitments and call on all countries to criminalise bribery, including bribery of foreign public officials, and effectively prevent, combat, detect, investigate, prosecute and sanction bribery. We will further work to strengthen international cooperation and legal frameworks to combat economic crimes including corruption related to organized crime and money laundering, including, on a voluntary basis, through existing networks and initiatives such as GlobE and the G20 Denial of Entry Experts Network. We will share information on our actions towards criminalising foreign bribery and enforcing foreign bribery legislation in line with Article 16 of UNCAC, and look forward to enlarging participation to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as appropriate. We reaffirm our commitment to deny safe haven to corruption offenders and their assets, in accordance to domestic laws. We also recognize the importance of mitigating corruption risk in all sectors. We will further strengthen our engagement with and promote active participation by stakeholders such as academia, civil society, media and the private sector, including to advance a culture of integrity.</p><p>50. We recognize the need for the international community to step up their efforts to effectively combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and proliferation financing. We reaffirm our commitment to delivering the strategic priorities of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its FATF Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs) to lead global action to respond to these threats. We welcome the initiative by the FATF to promote implementation of international standards on virtual assets, in particular the \"travel rule\", and transparency of beneficial ownership, and acknowledge their role in the fight against systemic corruption and environmental crimes, which gravely impact economies and societies. We support the ongoing work of the FATF to enhance global efforts to seize criminal proceeds and return funds to victims and states in line with domestic frameworks. We encourage all G20 members to strengthen collaboration to adopt and effectively implement the FATF standards.</p><p>51. We welcome the Indonesian Presidency's efforts to compile a wide array of national submissions and international coordinated collaborations from G20 members, invited countries, and regional and international organizations. These have been presented in the \"G20 Action for Strong and Inclusive Recovery\", as annexed. We call for further concrete actions to impart greater momentum and impact to the efforts of international community to recover together and recover stronger.</p><p>52. We welcome the outcomes of various G20 working groups and Ministerial meetings. We appreciate and thank Indonesia for its Presidency and for successfully hosting the Bali G20 Leaders' Summit and for its contribution to the G20 process. We look forward to meeting again in India in 2023, in Brazil in 2024 and in South Africa in 2025.</p><p>We thank international organizations, including the UN and its Specialised Agencies, World Bank Group, IMF, OECD, Asian Development Bank, ERIA, CEPI, European Investment Bank, GGGI, ICAO, IEA, IEF, IFAD, ILO, IRENA, FAO, FSB, Gavi, Global Fund, IAEA, Islamic Development Bank, ITU, Medicine Patent Pool, Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll), OPEC, WEF, WFP, WHO, WTO, UNCCD, UNCTAD, UNDESA, UNDP, UNECE, UNESCAP, UNESCO, UNFCCC, UN Global Pulse, UN Habitat, UNICEF, UNIDO, UNOPS, UN Women, UNWTO and the G20 Engagement Groups (W20, L20, T20, S20, Y20, SAI20, P20, C20, B20, U20) for their valuable inputs and policy recommendations.</p><p>-<br/>1 Noting that one member has divergent views on debt issues in paragraph 33, and emphasized the importance of debt treatment by multilateral creditors like MDBs.</p><p><br/>Remarks by President Charles Michel before the G20 summit in Bali</p><p><br/>This G20 is one of the most difficult ones that there have ever been. And I would like first to congratulate President Widodo for his wise leadership; the fact that we have arrived at an agreement on the statement at Sherpa level is an achievement in its own right. We are here to engage and to defend the multilateral world order, and we are here to help the G20 solve challenges for the benefit of us all.</p><p>This G20 takes place in a very different world from our meeting last year in Rome. Russia, a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of G20, is attacking the free and sovereign nation of Ukraine. Russia's war impacts us all no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East. And the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the UN Charter.</p><p>We will also have the occasion to address the major challenge of food security. The number of people facing severe hunger and malnutrition is rising. The Kremlin has decided to weaponise food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability. It is also having dramatic global consequences on the developing world, including right here in Asia. And let me be clear, I repeat once again, EU sanctions adopted against Russia do not target agriculture and food products and they do not target the export of fertiliser from Russia.</p><p>On the other hand, Russia has imposed restrictions on the export of its own foodstuffs and, even before they launched the war, imposed restrictions on fertilisers. In the EU, we are working hard to address the global consequences of this war and this is why we are mobilising funds of euros8 billion to address food security, notably for the developing world. Before the war, Ukraine exported 45 million tonnes of agricultural goods to the world. We have managed to help Ukraine export 15 million tonnes via the EU solidarity lanes and an additional 10 million have been exported thanks to the Black Sea Grain Initiative. And it is important that this initiative of UN Secretary-General Guterres be continued. We must also address soaring fertiliser prices and disruption in fertiliser supplies, and I am looking forward to joining a dedicated side event on this topic tomorrow. I am still convinced that we can and we should support developing countries to produce their own sustainable fertilisers locally, like we did with COVID vaccines.</p><p>The energy crisis hurts families, increases costs for businesses and destabilises energy markets globally. As G20, we have the collective power, but also the collective responsibility, to help make sure the world has sustainable, secure and affordable energy for all. And in the EU, you know that we have in part based our transition strategy on reliable and affordable gas, and we need now to adapt that strategy. And we are grateful to those partners who have helped us to ensure urgent supplies, but prices need to be affordable and we need to implement concrete measures. In the EU, we are phasing out our dependence on Russian energy. We are diversifying our energy sources. We are speeding up renewables and bolstering our energy efficiency.</p><p>Climate neutrality by 2050 is and remains our guiding compass. The EU collectively remained the largest contributor to public climate funds of euros23 billion in 2021. As G20, we should work to steer a contribution to climate funds and we need to deliver on the 100 billion US dollar per year we have promised. It is time for the other developed partners to pay their fair share too. We are also supporting countries to decarbonise the industry. We are trying to help them to speed up their transition to green energy and technology. And our Just Energy Transition Partnership with South Africa, for instance, is a great example. We are ready for more partnerships like this.</p><p>Finally, one word on health. Two years ago, I proposed, together with Dr Tedros, a treaty on pandemics in order to learn the lessons from this COVID crisis. Negotiations on that treaty are now ongoing, and this is another concrete demonstration of great multilateralism anchored in solidarity, transparency and global coordination.</p><p>Let me conclude with a word of congratulations to President Joko Widodo. When we sat together just a few days ago in Cambodia, both of us shared the importance of this G20 being a success, and I sincerely hope it will be. Let's recover together. Let's recover stronger. Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN316345</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66WN-7Y11-F12G-X10V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12046\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 17, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It notably commits nations to supporting the target to conserve or protect at least 30% of global land and at least 30% of the global ocean by the end of the decade.</p><p>The G7 has also committed to \"strengthen their deployment and implementation\" of nature-based solutions (NbS), recognising that they can deliver \"significant multiple benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, and people and thereby contributing to the achievement of various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\".</p><p>However, the G7 states that these solutions should not replace the \"necessity for urgent decarbonisation and reduction of emissions\".</p><p>Additionally, the G7 reaffirmed a commitment to the New York Declaration on Forests to end natural forest loss and, building on the Bonn Challenge, restore 350 million hectares of forest by 2030. Reports suggest that progress against the previous 2020 deadline of the Declaration was poor, with\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edie.net/news/9/Climate-change-and-agriculture-driving-record-levels-of-deforestation--WWF-report-finds/\">\"little evidence\" that signatories to the declaration have acted in line with its commitment</url>, meaning that achieving the 2020 goals is now \"likely impossible\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$100bn in climate finance</emphasis></p><p>Climate finance was subject to key discussions prior to the G7 meeting last week, with finance ministers from the nations agreeing on a historic agreement that will\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edie.net/news/11/G7-agree-on--historic-steps--to-make-climate-reporting-mandatory/\">mandate climate reporting in line with the recommendations of the global Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</url></p><p>Some green groups were left disappointed that an ongoing agreement to provide $100bn annually in climate finance to developing nations wasn't discussed by finance ministers. In the G7 meetings, the nations \"reaffirmed\" said commitment, running through to 2025.</p><p>Research suggests that G7 governments were failing to deliver on the longstanding $100bn pledge.\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edie.net/news/9/Oxfam-G7-GDP-loss-double-that-of-covid-climate-change/\">Oxfam estimates</url>\u00a0the G7's current commitments would deliver $36bn by 2025, of which less than $10bn would be for projects and initiatives on climate adaptation.</p><p>Going into the summit, only the UK and US agreed to increase funding from current levels. France was aiming to maintain current levels of climate finance.</p><p>During the discussions Canada announced it would double its financing to $4.4bn over the next five years, with Germany raising its contribution by (EURO)2bn to (EURO)6bn annually through to 2025.</p><p>The G7 confirmed that the financing would come from multiple sources. Ministers called upon Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), bilateral Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), multilateral funds, public banks, and export credit agencies to \"ensure that financial flows from these institutions are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement\".</p><h>What wasn't agreed...</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A just transition</emphasis></p><p>Alongside climate change, the key theme of the G7 discussions was the COVID-19 pandemic. It has highlighted the need to create a \"just\" economic recovery that captures new green markets. Green groups and activists hoped that the G7 would use its considerable wealth to enshrine mechanisms to ensure all parts of society can prosper as nations rebuild economies.</p><p>That wasn't the case. The G7 instead stated: \"We are steadfastly committed to addressing barriers to accessing finance for climate and nature faced by women, marginalised people, and underrepresented groups and increasing the gender-responsiveness and inclusivity of finance\".</p><p>A reaffirmation of supporting the SDGs was also mentioned, but no specific plans were issued.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mobility</emphasis></p><p>The official communique does outline the importance of tackling emissions from the global transport sector, but unlike a net-zero energy agreement, efforts to reduce transportation emissions remain more fractured.</p><p>The G7 confirmed that it would \"intensify efforts in enhancing the offer of more sustainable transport modes\", including encouraging phase-out of traditional passenger vehicles in favour of electric vehicles (EVs) before 2040.</p><p>The G7 also pledged to support the \"development and adoption of ambitious mid- and long-term measures\" to decarbonise from both the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p><p>Heading into the summit, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye called on the leaders of the G7 to agree to escalating mandates for 10% sustainable aviation fuel blends by 2030, growing to at least 50% by 2050. As such, some parts of the industry have been left disappointed by the lack of official plans from the G7.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green infrastructure</emphasis></p><p>Technically, the G7 did agree on a new framework aimed at funnelling billions into green infrastructure. However, the details of this new framework are largely non-existent.</p><p>The G7 agreed on a new \"Build Back Better for the World\" scheme that has been likened to a climate version of America's post-war Marshall Plan.

They are understandable, tangible and measurable - and a clear sign of our level of ambition.</p><p>However, as you rightly point out, the F2F represents much more than a list of targets. It sets out a roadmap for action. These range from actions on food security, the improvement of animal welfare standards, reducing the pressure of fish stocks in the seas around Europe, to actions on food waste and food fraud.</p><p>Whilst initial reactions to the strategy centred on the targets proposed, I am seeing in my regular meetings with all the stakeholders involved that the focus is shifting towards all the various actions we have put forward in the F2f.</p><p>It is very encouraging to see the real willingness of our partners along the food chain to engage with us in order to deliver the transformational change our citizens and consumers expect from us.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/farm-to-fork-strategy-whats-on-the-menu/\">Farm to Fork Strategy - What's on the menu?</url></h><p>In this special edition of the agrifood podcast, EURACTIV's agrifood team\u00a0spoke to a range of policymakers and stakeholders to hear their remarks on the presentation of the highly anticipated Farm to Fork strategy, the new EU's landmark food policy</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So, will the focus be more on 'constructive aspects' of the F2F from now on, in terms of solutions provided to food producers?</emphasis></p><p>The F2F already clearly identifies the tools and solutions that we will provide to food producers and, as the strategy is implemented at national, regional and local levels, many more will become available.</p><p>Our Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will remain key tools to support the transition to sustainable food systems while ensuring a decent living for farmers, fishers and their families.</p><p>Research and innovation will also be key drivers in accelerating the transition to sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems - and we will invest generously in these areas. We have proposed to spend, under Horizon Europe, no less than (EURO)10 billion on research and innovation in the agricultural, aquaculture and food production sectors to find digital technologies and nature-based solutions for the agri-food sector. With the InvestEU Fund, we will also aim to promote investment in the agri-food sector for all actors, no matter their size.</p><p>The results of these investments will be part of the many solutions we will be able to offer to support this important transition. With the F2F, we aim to provide an opportunity for Europe's farmers, fishers and food producers to become global leaders in sustainability. Our determination to act is matched by the investments we are making and the tools we have to deliver on these important commitments.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/special_report/farm-to-fork-in-search-of-a-solution-oriented-approach/\">Farm to Fork: In search of a solution-oriented approach</url></h><p>The debate on targets has inevitably prompted extensive attention before and after the launch of the Farm to Fork strategy (F2F) and other crucial aspects, like its practical implementation, have been neglected so far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you think that the F2F - like every transition - presents trade-offs as well?</emphasis></p><p>All transitions have a cost - but in this case, the cost of inaction would be even greater for all of us.\u00a0 The bottom line is that our citizens demand healthy and sustainably produced food, from a healthy and green planet. It is our duty to deliver nothing less than that.</p><p>The transition to sustainability could thus represent a competitive 'first mover' advantage for our farmers in the medium term. We estimate that, at the global level, sustainable food systems can create new economic value of more than (EURO)1.8 trillion.</p><p>I am fully aware that some sectors, such as farming and fishing, will need support to adapt to new requirements and ways of working.\u00a0 However, I am equally convinced that the transition to sustainability and redesign of our food systems brings economic opportunities for all, not least for our farmers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But how to cope with pitfalls that may arise?</emphasis></p><p>I do not underestimate the short-term potential impact on sectors. For this reason, we will accompany the transition with both financial and regulatory tools. Financially, the new Common Agricultural Policy will provide member states with the means to reward and compensate for the sustainable choices of farmers.</p><p>The change we envisage with the F2F will not happen overnight, but we have the opportunity to build robust food systems for the future, as well as support a green and sustainable recovery from COVID-19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Earlier in June, ministers complained about the risk of asymmetries between the new high demands on EU producers and lower sustainable standards of imported products. In order to avoid this scenario, how important is the 'external' dimension of the strategy?</emphasis></p><p>The transition towards sustainable food systems cannot be successfully achieved by the EU alone.\u00a0 To raise the sustainability standards globally, we have to work with our international partners, at bilateral or at the multilateral levels, such as through the United Nations and the WTO.</p><p>This includes supporting developing countries in their transition to sustainable food systems and making food safety a top priority in future bilateral EU agreements.</p><p>We will deploy all diplomatic efforts to establish alliances in the international field to drive the convergence to a global sustainable food system so that EU farmers are not disadvantaged compared to third-country producers.</p><p>Reflections on how such environmental issues of global concern could be integrated in the EU's decision-making on, for example, maximum residue levels for pesticides are ongoing.

Ursula von der Leyen's new ambition for Europe is crucial - not least because it should spur other regions of the world to raise their game.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Europe urgently needs to talk about how best it can reach this new goal. The coronavirus recovery plan and the 2021-2027 budget mean the EU will spend (EURO)1.8 trillion over the next seven years, a third already earmarked for climate action. But such unprecedented sums also demand unprecedented care and the courage to do things differently. In the interests of our planet - and of our children, who will be paying off the debt we're currently incurring - we must ask how to spend all this money effectively. This is our last chance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From conventional approaches to systemic change</emphasis></p><p>\"Conventional approaches will not be sufficient,\" the Commission pointed out last December when it published the \"European Green Deal\" proposals to make the EU climate neutral by 2050. Not only did it flag the need for a new 2030 emissions target. It stressed only \"experimentation, and working across sectors and disciplines\" would allow the EU to reduce and offset its carbon emissions to its \"net zero\" goal in thirty years' time.</p><p>Europe has to take this cue to openly address the insufficiency of \"conventional approaches\". These have mainly entailed energy substitution and one-off projects primarily dealing with direct emissions - and they have produced predominantly incremental change. Our solve for too many cars or buildings producing too much carbon dioxide, too many cows producing too much methane, steelmaking using too much coal has been to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy, create low-flatulence animal feed, bring re-use to steelmaking.</p><p>These are important steps, but individual solutions, addressing the problem 'at the surface', as it were, can only do so much. We have not yet had the courage to change the shape of our lives and our expectations.</p><p>The traditional logic of substitution has conditioned us to look for linear - and often technology-driven solutions for what are in reality are multi-dimensional or 'wicked' problems, and even more so because they involve changing human behaviour. Climate has been described as a system in which a butterfly's wing flap in the USA can help form a typhoon in China. It is a non-linear or complex system in which a small change in input can lead to a huge change in output - but mostly in ways that are hard or impossible to forecast. Social systems are likewise inherently complex and unpredictable and since human behaviour is at the core of climate change, engaging physical systems and social systems effectively, and together, is essential.</p><p>So we have to start thinking of our world and its climate as complex interrelated systems - and then deal with the diversity and uncertainty of their possible inputs and outputs. And to do that we need complexity friendly tools, methods and incentives, and evaluation frameworks. Our approach can no longer be focused on individual, sector based and discrete solutions. We need to insist on approaches that are multi-faceted and joined up.</p><p>As President von der Leyen herself noted during Wednesday's State of the Union speech, \"the mission of the European Green Deal involves much more than cutting emissions. It is about making systemic modernisation across our economy, society and industry.\" Achieving systemic modernisation, or systemic change, will spring from a new type of \"systems innovation\" that experiments and tests for integrated and exponential solutions and effects in systems - starting with cities, regions, industries, value chains.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/we-can-do-it-eu-chief-announces-55-emissions-reduction-target-for-2030/\">'We can do it!': EU chief announces 55% emissions reduction target for 2030</url></h><p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced plans on Wednesday (16 September) to target a 55% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as part of a broader European Green Deal programme aimed at reaching \"climate neutrality\" by mid-century.</p><p>Cities, for example, cover less than 2% of the world's surface but produce more than 60% of carbon emissions. Systems innovation brings different groups together to defy a city's complexity by devising projects that join up and deliver more than incremental change. Madrid, Vienna and Krakow and 12 other European metropolitan areas have teamed up with EIT Climate-KIC to work across sectors - integrating innovations and disciplines. In the case of Madrid, this means experimenting with regulatory scenarios, a zero-carbon campus and nature-based solutions.</p><p>In Italy's Dolomites, we are working with local governments and over a hundred local stakeholders to learn from a devastating storm in 2018. These groups have identified three systems as being core to making the region more resilient to weather events: the wood value-chain, forest management and tourism. Together, we are connecting a portfolio of systems-innovation projects that will transform these systems for the better. Multi-faceted and joined up, they will make rapid transformation possible.</p><p>As we teeter on the edge of chaos, we have to respond to emerging issues as flexibly as possible and work together in a less transactional and less top-down way. Madrid and the Dolomites embody experimentation and inter-disciplinary approaches that draw on citizen engagement to find the best solutions and apply them widely. We need to press on with technological advance. But we also need to unlock systems transformation through social transformation - getting stakeholders to produce ideas \"by the people, for the people\".</p><p>The complexity that challenges us demands that we learn our way into the future. We must ensure that we build a transformational capability for the future, not just fix things now, so that our investments enable social and economic systems to take decisions about themselves in an effective and distributed way.</p><p>Europe needs to explore unconventional approaches to meet the new target. Given the vast funds available to power the EU's \"green recovery\" after pandemic and recession, Europe has never had a better opportunity to be ambitious. The European Commission understands that. Now it needs to give the EU member states, their regions and cities the means to work in a systemic way to achieve the objective in time. We should not be modest.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/opinion/an-eu-2030-climate-target-of-at-least-55-is-not-only-necessary-it-is-also-possible/\">An EU 2030 climate target of at least 55% is not only necessary - it is also possible</url></h><p>Ambitious climate policy in the EU can underpin a sustainable economic growth that supports the development of a competitive, modern economy that delivers benefits for all, and acts as a beacon of inspiration to the rest of the world, writes Dan J\u00f8rgensen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1508788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WJ-WDG1-JCF9-43T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1168\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 21, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>2030 climate and energy targets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Institute of Innovation and Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRNP</classCode><className>GREEN DEALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A3R8</classCode><className>CARBON OFFSETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DPLV</classCode><className>RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;
