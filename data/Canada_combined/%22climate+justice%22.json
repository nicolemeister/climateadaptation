This is a real, living force that is dramatically changing the world we live in. With increasing temperatures and shifting weather patterns, we are fundamentally changing the ecology and environment of our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These changes will not only have ramifications for the natural world, but they will also have serious impacts on the stability of ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies around the globe.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a deep dive into how global warming is reshaping the ecology and environment, exploring the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to one of the most pressing challenges of our time.</p><p>Understanding Global Warming and Its Causes</p><p>Global warming is defined as a long-term increase in Earth's average temperature across the climate system, primarily due to the buildup of greenhouse gases- including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)- in the atmosphere. These gases can trap heat from the sun, or the greenhouse effect.</p><p>In the past century, humans have been responsible for extremely high rates of greenhouse gas buildup through activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial pollution, and high-intensity agriculture practices. The result? A planet that is getting warmer and changing rapidly with extreme weather events and disruptions, melting ice caps and glaciers, increasing sea levels, and ecosystem changes.</p><p>Impact on Biodiversity and Species Extinction</p><p>Species extinction is accelerating due to global warming. There are approximately one million animal vertebrate and plant species threatened with extinction, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), many of which have been in decline for decades. It is driven by significant changes in habitats, climate stress, and invasive species in changing ecosystems.</p><p>Coral reefs are host to massive bleaching events due to rising sea temperatures. Coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots, coast protectors, and the foundation of marine food chains. Their decline has huge implications for aquatic species and coastal communities that count on them for food and income.</p><p>Oceanic and Atmospheric Changes</p><p>The oceans are essential for regulating the climate of Earth. However, global warming is causing the oceans to absorb significantly more heat, and it is affecting the oceans chemically by causing ocean acidification and decreasing oxygen levels. These changes are affecting all marine species, from the largest fish to the smallest plankton, and are affecting the global food web.</p><p>Furthermore, melting glaciers and polar regions are causing sea levels to rise, which is putting coastal populations and habitats at greater risk. In addition, as ocean temperatures increase, hurricanes and cyclone events become more intense and more destructive, resulting in increasingly frequent and extreme weather events.</p><p>The atmosphere is similarly affected by climatic extremes. Changes in temperature in different regions are changing the timing and amount of rainfall, resulting in extended droughts in some areas and prolonged flooding in other areas. The climate extremes will have direct effects on agriculture, water availability and public health.</p><p>Forests, Wildfires, and Ecosystem Collapse</p><p>Forests are among the most affected ecosystems when it comes to global warming. Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and intense wildfires. These fires not only destroy vast areas of forest but also release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, further fueling global warming in a vicious feedback loop.</p><p>In many regions, forests are struggling to regenerate due to changing climate conditions. This weakens their ability to act as 'carbon sinks', which are natural systems that absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, crucial for maintaining the balance of the ecology and environment.</p><p>Human Influence and Environmental Stress</p><p>Human activities are deeply intertwined with ecological change. Urban expansion, industrialization, and infrastructure development are fragmenting habitats and reducing the resilience of ecosystems to climate change.</p><p>Agriculture, which depends heavily on stable weather conditions, is also being disrupted. Crop failures, water scarcity, and soil degradation are becoming more common, threatening global food security. In turn, this can lead to social instability, migration, and conflict over natural resources.</p><p>The most vulnerable communities-particularly those in developing countries-are bearing the brunt of these changes, despite contributing the least to global warming. This raises important questions about 'climate justice', which advocates for the fair treatment of all people and the equitable distribution of climate mitigation resources, regardless of their contribution to the problem.</p><p>Towards a Sustainable Future</p><p>Addressing global warming and its impact on the ecology and environment requires immediate and sustained action at all levels-individual, local, national, and global. Key strategies include:</p><p>Lower greenhouse gas emissions by using cleaner energy approaches (solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear).</p><p>Protect and regenerate natural ecosystems (forests, wetlands, oceans).</p><p>Encourage sustainable agriculture and responsible consumption.</p><p>Invest in climate adaptation and resilience, especially for at-risk areas.</p><p>Create community education programs to inform and engage people about climate change, encouraging them to take action.</p><p>However, much more needs to be done to meet climate goals and prevent further damage to the planet's life-support systems.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The effects of global warming on the ecology and environment are deep, broad and increasing. Changing habitats, species extinction, rising seas and failing ecosystems are just a few consequences already in evidence around the world.</p><p>But through collaboration, scientific advancement and a dedication to living sustainably, we can lessen damage together and try to maintain an ecological balance on Earth for generations to come.

July 22, 2024 now marks the hottest day on record, surpassing the previous heat records set in 2023. </p><p>Extreme weather events are impacting many tourism hotspots, such as the recent Jasper wildfire, the April 2024 flooding of Dubai airport and the 2023 Maui wildfires. Yet tourism continues to grow, and travel levels are expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels shortly. </p><p>Climate change is an inseparable aspect of modern tourism. On the one hand, the key components of tourism \u2014 transportation, aviation in particular, as well as accommodation \u2014 are major contributors to carbon emissions. Aviation emissions alone account for an estimated eight to 10 per cent of overall greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>But, in turn, climate change also poses increasing and severe risks to tourism businesses. Beach holidays are threatened by rising sea levels, ski resorts can no longer depend on snowfall and some tourism businesses risk becoming uninsurable. </p><p>Until recently, the response to the climate crisis has focused largely on climate action. This includes addressing the impacts of carbon emissions through mitigation (using technologies to prevent emissions) and adaptation (adjusting to climate change) in impacted areas. </p><p>However, our new report from The Travel Foundation argues the tourism industry needs to consider climate justice before undertaking any climate actions. We conducted in-depth interviews with a wide range of tourism experts to determine how the industry can play a role in a just transition. </p><p>Climate justice</p><p>The tourism industry\u2019s engagement with climate justice is well overdue. The concept of climate justice first gained international recognition in 2000 when the first climate justice summit was held alongside COP 6 at the Hague.</p><p>Climate justice is an inclusive approach to climate action that centres the voices and needs of communities most impacted by climate change. Indigenous, Black and other marginalized communities are particularly vulnerable to the severe impacts of climate change.</p><p>As, Daniela Subtil, the network co-ordinator for Stay Grounded, a network of organizations promoting alternatives to aviation to address climate change, said:</p><p> \u201cThe impacts of the climate crisis that aviation contributes to are being felt\u2026 by marginalised, historically and systematically marginalised peoples. Yet there is a very tiny percentage of the world\u2019s population flying.\u201d </p><p>Climate justice recognizes that these communities often lack the resources needed to deal with the impacts of climate extremes. Despite contributing the least to the climate crisis, both historically and in the present, many of these communities \u2014 particularly across the Global South \u2014 are bearing the brunt of its consequences. </p><p>Our report highlights that low-income countries account for less than one per cent of travel and tourism emissions, but will suffer the most from climate change.

General Assembly asked the court in 2023 to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments when their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?</p><p>Here are some of the key points from the opinion delivered Wednesday.</p><p>A healthy planet is a basic human right</p><p>In a simple statement that could have profound legal ramifications, the court said everyone is entitled to a habitable planet.</p><p>\u201cThe human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is therefore inherent in the enjoyment of other human rights,\u201d court President Yuji Iwasawa said during a two-hour hearing.</p><p>A livable planet is a human right and is part of international customary law, meaning every country is obliged to protect it, not just countries that have signed climate treaties and other agreements.</p><p>Violating international law</p><p>A failure to address climate change, the court said, could be a violation of international law.</p><p>That matters because it applies to all countries and paves the way for legal actions, including states returning to the ICJ to hold each other to account; domestic lawsuits; and investment agreements that have to conform to international law.</p><p>\u201cWith today\u2019s authoritative historic ruling, the International Court of Justice has broken with business-as-usual and delivered a historic affirmation: Those suffering the impacts of climate devastation have a right to remedy and full reparation,\u201d said Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law.</p><p>Payback time?</p><p>The court ruled that some countries or individuals suffering from the effects of climate change could be eligible for compensation.</p><p>For climate damage linked to greenhouse gas emissions, \u201crestitution may take the form of reconstructing damaged or destroyed infrastructure, and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity,\u201d the court said.</p><p>If that\u2019s not possible, financial compensation could be assessed, though the judges conceded it \u201cmay be difficult to calculate, as there is usually a degree of uncertainty with respect to the exact extent of the damage caused.\u201d</p><p>Activists hailed that part of the decision as a historic turning point in their search for justice.</p><p>\u201cThe ICJ\u2019s decision brings us closer to a world where governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities.

Not the worst thing for a 63-year-old woman, but definitely a pain in the ... foot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm hobbling out of bed, gingerly taking the stairs and experiencing random stabbing aches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now I'm trying to manage it with pricey orthotics, physio, anti-inflammatories, silicone toe spacers, massage and expensive runners. Surgery might be in the future.</p><p>Heels? Never again.</p><p>Truth is, I mostly stopped wearing them after leaving a corporate job in downtown Toronto 20 years ago to freelance from home. I swapped boss-lady pumps for Birkenstocks and never looked back. These days, my only nod to heeled footwear is a pair of red wedge Fly London shoes and knee-high boots with two-inch heels - comfy enough to (almost) run in.</p><p>I paid a price for years of squeezing into what was considered de rigueur office-footwear in the '80s and '90s.</p><p>Like many older women, I'm now dealing with the fallout.</p><p>About 80 per cent of women over 40 have foot pain - mostly from wearing heels. Bunions, where the big toe leans inwards, affect nearly 60 per cent of women and are nine times more common in women than men. Other problems include hammertoes, Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, collapsed arches and sprained ankles.</p><p>Killer heels have literally been killing our feet.</p><p>According to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society, 88 per cent of women wear shoes that are too small. While men's shoes are designed for movement and utility, women's often prioritize elegance over ease, beauty over balance.</p><p>I partly blame Sarah Jessica Parker, who turned Manolo Blahnik into a household name with the \"Sex and the City\" series. At 60, she is starring in the sequel, \"And Just Like That,\" clicking around New York in four-inch heels: sparkly slingbacks, platforms, glossy boots.</p><p>Her character Carrie Bradshaw once called her shoe obsession \"a little substance issue.\" She named her new cat Shoe.</p><p>Even SJP has admitted to permanent foot damage and now wears heels mostly for red carpets and cameras.</p><p>Some women will try anything to make stilettos work, including undergoing \"Cinderella\" surgeries: toe shortening, fat pad injections (taking fat from the abdomen to cushion the balls of the feet), even baby toe removal.</p><p>As extreme as that sounds, it's not unprecedented. For 1,000 years in China, girls endured the brutal practice of foot binding to keep feet child-sized. Women hobbled in pain because beauty was linked to immobility and submission.</p><p>In some ways, we haven't come that far. Footwear still prioritizes appearance over health. \"Dainty\" is the ideal - not width, balance, or stability.</p><p>High heels shift your centre of gravity, putting pressure on the balls of your feet. Over time, tendons shorten, calves contract, spines realign and toes deform.</p><p>What's marketed as confidence is, in reality, a slow reshaping of your skeleton.</p><p>A University of Alabama at Birmingham study found that ER visits for heel-related injuries doubled from 2002 to 2012. The pandemic brought temporary relief. With office clothes swapped for loungewear, heel injuries dropped. But by 2022, \"return-to-office\" foot issues increased.</p><p>In some workplaces, heels weren't just expected - they were mandatory. In 2016, London receptionist Nicola Thorp was sent home without pay for refusing to wear them. Outrage followed, along with a petition of more than 150,000 signatures to ban sexist dress codes.</p><p>In 2017, B.C. amended workplace regulations to prohibit mandatory workplace high heel policies, citing health and discrimination concerns. Other provinces followed. The message was clear: pain shouldn't be a job requirement.</p><p>It's only in the last few years that airlines ditched rules mandating female flight crew wear heels. As recently as 2019, Norwegian Air insisted women wear them - even while trekking through airports - and only permitted flats with a doctor's note, which had to be renewed every six months. (Guess they figured out it's a lot easier to handle an evacuation when you're not dressed like you're heading to a cocktail party at 30,000 feet.)</p><p>In Japan, the #KuToo movement took off in 2019 after actress Yumi Ishikawa tweeted about being forced to wear heels at work. Her post, featuring a photo of her bloodied feet, went viral and thousands of women responded with their own photos.</p><p>Fortunately, some fashion brands are designing shoes with wider toe boxes, ergonomic support and platforms. Sneakers and stylish flats are showing up at weddings, boardrooms and red carpets.

Their art is temporary, but its impact is lasting.</p><p>\"While hard numbers can take years to collect, our team collects tons of anecdotal transportation data from passersby on every project about the area,\" said Chelsea Ritter-Soronen, CEO of Chalk Riot, \"We will report these learnings back to planning teams for them to consider.\"</p><p>The group's work aligns with recent findings that painted streets slow down drivers and reduce crashes. A 2022 study by the Asphalt Art Initiative showed that street art installations cut road crashes by up to 50%. Color and pattern get attention. And in our distracted society, attention saves lives.</p><p>In the article, Chalk Riot explains how they turn crosswalks into illustrated stories, empty roads into a skateboarder and dogwalker heaven, and gray intersections into bright zones that feel welcoming-and safe. Their designs don't just decorate-they inform behavior.</p><p>\"Plain crosswalks fade into the road. Ours pop out and tell you to slow down,\" said one artist. \"It's not just about being seen. It's about one's humanity being respected.\"</p><p>With pedestrian deaths at a 40-year high-7,522 in 2022 alone-the need for safer street design is urgent. Most roads in the U.S. are still built with cars in mind. Chalk Riot challenges that. Their temporary murals act as a test run for permanent change.</p><p>\"We're the dress rehearsal,\" said a team member. \"If people like it-and they usually do-the city can build it for good.\"</p><p>But their mission is bigger than art. It's about equity. Their projects give voice to neighborhoods, include local artists, and highlight stories too often ignored. Chalk Riot has created murals about climate justice, LGBTQ+ pride, and racial equity-while calming traffic at the same time.</p><p>\"Art can protect people. It can make a street feel more human,\" one team member added.</p><p>Now, they're encouraging others to join the movement.</p><p>Call to Action:</p><p>You don't need to be an artist to make a difference. Start by noticing dangerous intersections. Talk to your neighbors. Advocate for safer crosswalks. Bring local artists into the conversation. Pitch a street mural to your city.

Generously hosted by Heineken at Fundaci\u00f3n Cruzcampo, the gathering brought BIER's mission to life: uniting global beverage leaders to drive environmental sustainability through collaboration, knowledge sharing, and technical advocacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This meeting marked the first Roundtable under the leadership of Erica Pann, BIER's new Executive Director. With deep expertise in sustainability strategy and cross-sector facilitation, Erica strengthens BIER's commitment to technical excellence and collaborative progress.</p><p>Erica is joined in leadership by Nicolas Clerget (HEINEKEN), serving as Chair of BIER's Steering Committee, and David Grant (PepsiCo) as Co-Chair. Together, this team reflects the diversity, experience, and vision of BIER's global membership-and they are actively shaping the organization's next chapter of impact.</p><p>Key Themes from the Spring 2025 Agenda</p><p>The Spring Roundtable set the tone for continued progress across BIER's 2025 priority workstreams. The agenda reflected BIER's vision of a beverage industry that is authentically sustainable, anchored in science and data, supported by world-class practices, and trusted by consumers, customers, and stakeholders alike. Highlights included:</p><p>- Nature-Positive Strategies: Members explored how to integrate regenerative agriculture, biodiversity, and watershed health into long-term sustainability and value chain strategies.<br/>- Water Replenishment &amp; Impact Metrics: Sessions focused on measuring the co-benefits of water replenishment, including climate resilience, biodiversity gains, and community well-being.<br/>- Industry Consortia as Catalysts: The group examined how industry-wide coalitions like BIER drive consistency, credibility, and collective momentum in achieving environmental goals.<br/>- Decarbonization &amp; Net Zero Pathways: Members engaged with early insights on the SBTi Net Zero Standard 2.0 and participated in working sessions focused on Scope 3 emissions and hard-to-abate categories.<br/>- Thermal Energy Innovation: Real-world case studies showcased renewable thermal applications, highlighting projects from Diageo, Asahi, and others advancing low-carbon heat solutions.<br/>- Zero-Deforestation Claims: Sessions addressed the path from high-level commitment to credible implementation, with a focus on traceability, regulatory compliance, and phased action plans.<br/>- Just Transition &amp; Regional Resilience: Participants explored how companies are embedding climate justice into energy transition strategies and navigating emerging geopolitical dynamics.</p><p>From Strategy to Site: A Sustainability Showcase</p><p>Members also toured HEINEKEN's brewery and solar farm, home to Europe's largest solar thermal plant for industrial use.

Common themes include:</p><p>- Benchmarking and Standardization: Access to trusted metrics and methodologies helps members assess performance and identify opportunities for improvement.<br/>- Collaborative Innovation: BIER fosters a culture of co-creation, where companies share best practices and develop scalable solutions together.<br/>- Collective Action and Credibility: Participation amplifies individual efforts through collective initiatives, reinforcing member credibility with stakeholders.<br/>- Knowledge Sharing and Capacity Building: Members benefit from a platform that promotes open exchange and continuous learning.<br/>- Strategic Alignment and Advocacy: BIER supports unified advocacy and strategic alignment on key sustainability issues, enabling more effective industry engagement.</p><p>A Global Membership, A Unified Purpose</p><p>BIER values a membership base that reflects the diversity and expertise of the global beverage industry, drawing insights from across the value chain. Representing many of the most recognized names in brewing, distilling, and non-alcoholic beverages, BIER members bring their knowledge, commitment, and passion to collaboratively address environmental challenges that no single company can solve alone.</p><p>Through the market leadership of its members, BIER continues to position itself as the sustainable voice of the beverage industry, driving stakeholder trust and advancing solutions that benefit both the sector and the planet.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>The Spring 2025 Roundtable exemplified BIER's mission in action. Through technical engagement, open dialogue, and shared vision, members continue to set the pace for environmental sustainability across the beverage sector. With the guidance of Executive Director Erica Pann, Chair Nicolas Clerget, and Co-Chair David Grant, BIER is well-positioned to support member-driven progress in the months and years ahead.</p><p>A heartfelt thank you to Heineken for their warm hospitality and to every member who attended, shared insights, asked questions, and contributed to the Sevilla Roundtable's success.<br/><br/>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable on 3blmedia.com.<br/><br/>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/beverage-industry-environmental-roundtable\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/beverage-industry-environmental-roundtable</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/spring-2025-roundtable-recap-advancing-beverage-environmental-su-1041180\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["- Industry Consortia as Catalysts: The group examined how industry-wide coalitions like BIER drive consistency, credibility, and collective momentum in achieving environmental goals. - Decarbonization &amp; Net Zero Pathways: Members engaged with early insights on the SBTi Net Zero Standard 2. 0 and participated in working sessions focused on Scope 3 emissions and hard-to-abate categories. - Thermal Energy Innovation: Real-world case studies showcased renewable thermal applications, highlighting projects from Diageo, Asahi, and others advancing low-carbon heat solutions. - Zero-Deforestation Claims: Sessions addressed the path from high-level commitment to credible implementation, with a focus on traceability, regulatory compliance, and phased action plans. - Just Transition &amp; Regional Resilience: Participants explored how companies are embedding climate justice into energy transition strategies and navigating emerging geopolitical dynamics.

Rising sea levels have swallowed a cemetery on the island of Carriacou, Grenada, scattering and washing away headstones and tombs. And Grenada is using that horrifying image as evidence in its fight for climate justice. The Caribbean nation is part of a landmark case unfolding at the International Court of Justice this week. It's seeking to hold the world's biggest polluters accountable for the damage they've caused. Justin Sobion is an international environmental lawyer acting as Grenada's counsel in the case. We reached him in The Hague.</p><p><br/><br/>NK: Justin, our listeners just heard a little bit about what happened at Tibeau cemetery. But why did you want to choose that as the central piece of evidence in Grenada's ICJ submission?<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: When I first heard about Tibeau cemetery in February this year, actually I was in a meeting in Grenada and it was the Attorney General who was mentioned about civil rights and how the whole cemetery is actually washed out in the beach or under the sand. And I was like, wow, this is like unique, in a good way for the case but of course, in an unfortunate way for the people who have lost their beloved ones to the matters of the sea. I did some further research and I realized that this has not been heard by any other country. And I thought, this is something that is unique and we need, I should raise it in the case before the ICJ. And it so happened that we found one individual from Carriacou who cannot find her, I think it's her paternal great grandparents, grandmother.<br/><br/>NK: And what did she tell you about that?<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: That she was totally emotional about it. Her reaction is that in Carriacou, made up of merely 95 per cent of the population, the descendants of Africans who came across the Atlantic, the middle path through slavery. And they have a deep connection with the few with the past generations because of sea level rise, climate change totally restrict their ability to become guardians of their ancestors in the afterlife.<br/><br/>NK: So they're losing that connection, the integrity of the land as well. There are many, many layers. I know Grenada and you are set to make arguments at the court on Thursday. In the meantime, you've been listening to other countries make their case. What has stood out to you as you've been listening in?<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: We are affected by a lot of these hurricanes. And I heard it today from Dominica, we heard it from Barbados, we heard it from the Bahamas. Dominica, for example, said in the 1960s there was one hurricane and he kept on going, 1980s with 12 for the season. Now, this is 2020, he said there were 19, I believe he said hurricanes in one season. Now, hurricane season in the Caribbean runs from July to maybe late October, and we are faced with a vicious financial cycle of totally rebuilding our economies every time. A hurricane starts off as a tropical storm, but within less than 24 hours, it becomes a category five. So the hurricanes get more intense. So some countries don't have any notice. Imagine if somebody tells you in the next 12 hours, okay, there is going to be a category four, maybe a five hurricane coming, you need to go home now from work and prepare yourselves. But we are having a vicious cycle of building every year, every single Caribbean country. Well, not every single Caribbean country would get hit in one year, but every other country. You know, this year it was Grenada.<br/><br/>NK: This is the first time in the court's history that it is taking up the climate crisis, that the ICJ is doing this, whether big polluters can be sued for not doing enough to slow the effects of climate change and the climate crisis. Do you see this as a turning point?<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: No, the ICJ is not going to say, U.S., China, Japan, European Union, you all of the biggest polluters. You all are responsible. You all need to pay reparations. No, what the ICJ is going to say is countries, you need to have a rapid and deep and immediate cuts in greenhouse gases. So, for example, they would say that. But what I can see is that after this ICJ advisory comes out opinion, which I think will be probably in one year, what is going to happen is it will be it will open up the doors for small island states to start to maybe look for climate reparations.<br/><br/>NK: Well, not a legally binding opinion. It won't be legally binding but you're saying it will send a signal that will have power of its own.<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: Yet, depending on how ambitious this advisory opinion is, it will be opening the doors in the international architecture of international law for other states to say, okay, based on this advisory opinion, this and what is happening to our economies, let's try to sue particular states. It may even be in the International Court of Justice again or it might be on a national level.<br/><br/>NK: It does sound like you feel that the court is going to do what you want it to do or say what you want it to say. How confident are you in that?<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: Our message has been, let's not get too complacent because we know we have looked at all the 15 judges and we know that there are some judges out there who are going to be very, they're going to be very conservative. We know there are some radical judges there, who will, a little bit understanding of the tragedy that is going on in small island developing states. But our main goal is to try how do we push the conservative judges over the edge? And so it's, That being said, we are not going into this saying that this, the court is going to rule in our favour, eyes closed, no, we still... Like a David and Goliath, we still have to prove our case beyond reasonable doubt. You know, we are telling judges, today I heard a submission that says that you don't want to be on the wrong side of history. And those are, that's the message we want to tell the judges, because the present generation is not going to judge what you say it's going to be somebody who's not even born yet.<br/><br/>NK: Grenada is still trying to rebuild after hurricane Beryl. What do you hope people in Grenada take away from what you and others are doing at the court?<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: Grenadians are very much resilient people. But our message again, this is a conversation that we've been having with our legal team. How much more resilient can you be?<br/><br/>NK: Justin, I appreciate your time. Thank you for this.<br/><br/>JUSTIN SOBION: All right. Thank you very much.<br/><br/>CH: Justin Sobion is an international environmental lawyer.

All the efforts to make the buses themselves accessible - ramps, kneeling buses, DARTS vans with trained drivers - are of no use to those who cannot pay for the service, either because of the barriers on the way to accessing free tickets for the many riders living in poverty or because of the barriers to using Presto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The changes to the payment system have excluded the people who are the most dependent on transit - this must be corrected.</p><p>Another factor that must be considered urgently is the forecasted extremely hot summer.

Yes, we have cooling centres, but are people expected to walk there from their overheated units, in the outdoors heat? The buses themselves are an already running, efficient system of mobile cooling centres. Let's make HSR and DARTS fares optional on extreme heat days.</p><p>During the 2021 heat dome in British Columbia, 619 people died due to the heat.

All the efforts to make the buses themselves accessible - ramps, kneeling buses, DARTS vans with trained drivers - are of no use to those who cannot pay for the service, either because of the barriers on the way to accessing free tickets for the many riders living in poverty or because of the barriers to using Presto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The changes to the payment system have excluded the people who are the most dependent on transit - this must be corrected.</p><p>Another factor that must be considered urgently is the forecasted extremely hot summer.

Yes, we have cooling centres, but are people expected to walk there from their overheated units, in the outdoors heat? The buses themselves are an already running, efficient system of mobile cooling centres. Let's make HSR and DARTS fares optional on extreme heat days.</p><p>During the 2021 heat dome in British Columbia, 619 people died due to the heat.

Four years after the province promised relief, many are still vulnerable to the 'silent killer'", "published": "2025-08-02", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> NEW WESTMINSTER, B.C. - Tracey McKinlay insisted she was fine before saying goodbye to her sister and hanging up the phone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The temperature hadn't fallen below 20 C in three days, and McKinlay's apartment at the Legion Manor, a subsidized building for seniors operated by B.C. Housing and the Legion, was a hot box. The 61-year-old lived on the tenth floor, in a small, east-facing studio where the morning sun would stream in through a wall of windows - only one of which could be opened. She had no air conditioner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was June 2021 and the heat dome settling over the normally temperate lower mainland would soon break temperature records and make headlines. The provincial coroner would later find extreme heat contributed to hundreds of deaths. Ninety per cent of the victims were, like McKinlay, 60 years and older. Most also had a chronic health condition and lived alone in old, poorly insulated housing without air conditioning. McKinlay ticked all the boxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We knew the heat dome was pretty nasty,\" said Jeanne Hansen, McKinlay's sister. \"We were checking in. That day, she said she'd gone out for her walk, that she was OK, that everything was fine.\"</p><p>McKinlay hadn't told her sister that her fan - the only thing keeping her cool - was broken.</p><p>The deadly temperatures in June 2021 spurred B.C. to the forefront of Canada's fight against extreme heat. The province developed an early warning system that sent alerts to cell phones. It said it would spend $30 million on a new program to give 28,000 air conditioners to medically vulnerable and low-income people by 2026. It updated the provincial building code to require cooling in at least one room in new buildings, among other measures.</p><p>But four years after the pledges were made, many remain vulnerable. The free air conditioner program struggled to find its footing, and then de-prioritized the low-income people who need it the most. The cooling centres have often sat empty, according to one 2025 study. The B.C. Building Code update doesn't include buildings constructed before March 2024, which are more likely to be rentals or subsidized housing.</p><p>Municipalities put forward a motion to push for a provincial maximum indoor temperature law that would include older buildings, but the motion failed.</p><p>Tenants, advocates and frustrated lawmakers are concerned the province is not moving fast enough to protect seniors from the next life-threatening heat wave.</p><p>The stakes are high: Without more safeguards to protect people from high temperatures, by 2030 the heat could kill an average of more than 1,300 people, hospitalize 6,000, and cost at least $100 million in hospital expenses every year in B.C. alone, according to a report by the Canadian Climate Institute.</p><p>\"B.C. has had to play catch-up incredibly fast - they've had to go from zero to 100 in a couple of years,\" says Ryan Ness, one of the authors of the report. \"They've got some things in place - especially in terms of how to respond in terms of emergencies, but in terms of adapting and preventing things from getting to a crisis point, there's still a lot that needs to be done.\"</p><p>At the Legion Manor, which houses seniors and veterans, a reporter who visited last summer found the province's push for greater protection appeared to fall short of what residents need. While the Manor had turned the top-floor rec room into a cooling room, it was empty on the hot afternoon the reporter visited. The Manor had acquired heat-blocking rubber curtains, but in early August 2024 the drapes sat in a pile in a storage room. Misters had been installed in the building's concrete courtyard, but they were turned off. On the ninth floor, a resident waited for an air conditioner he had applied for weeks before.</p><p>Just one floor up and down the hall is where, in June 2021, McKinlay sweltered.</p><p>Heat is the 'silent killer'</p><p>That summer, it seemed everybody underestimated the heat. They were focused on the fires. As Canada warms twice as fast as the global average thanks in part to fossil fuel pollution, wildfires are becoming more frequent and ferocious. They decimate forests, spark mass evacuations and cost a fortune in damages. The entire town of Lytton, B.C., burned to the ground.</p><p>But the fires are nowhere near as lethal. A provincial coroner's report revealed that McKinlay and at least 618 other people had been killed by extreme temperatures during the 2021 heat dome. Of the 618 people who died, two-thirds were 70 or older; more than half lived alone.</p><p>\"We often refer to heat as the silent killer for that reason, but it's becoming less and less silent in Canada,\" said Sarah Henderson, a senior environmental health scientist at B.C.'s Centre for Disease Control. \"For people in public health, everyone knows that heat is the biggest risk.\"</p><p>Heat sensitivity is influenced by age more than by any other risk factor. When we age, our bodies become less efficient at regulating body temperature and staying hydrated. Older adults are also more likely to be on medications that impede the body's temperature regulation. When it's hot, older people are more susceptible to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or heart attacks or other cardiovascular issues. Heat can also reduce cognitive function, causing delirium or confusion.</p><p>Those with arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, or other chronic health conditions; as well as those who are socially isolated, who live alone; and lower-income people are all more vulnerable to heat-related deaths.</p><p>McKinlay was 61. She lived alone on a fixed income. She had schizophrenia and was taking antipsychotic medications, which can make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature.</p><p>Her two sisters checked up on her by phone, as they often did. Neighbours and the building managers had been trying to look out for one another, too. On June 29, a day after temperatures soared to 42 C, a neighbour repeatedly knocked on McKinlay's door but got no response. When the police came, they found McKinlay in her chair, wearing her sweatshirt and jeans. McKinlay had died overnight, the coroner later said, from \"effects of heat.\" She had put on extra layers when she started to feel shivery, a common symptom of hyperthermia.</p><p>Housing in materially deprived neighbourhoods like the New Westminster community McKinlay lived in is more likely to be older, poorly insulated and of a lower quality, which means the living space heats up faster and stays hot for longer than in better insulated homes. Ninety-eight per cent of the heat dome deaths happened indoors.</p><p>Air conditioning program had cold start</p><p>In temperate B.C., where average monthly temperatures fluctuate between zero and 20 C year-round, households have had the lowest rate of air conditioning in the country, with only three in 10 residents having access to cooling, according to a 2023 study.</p><p>In June 2023 - two years after the heat dome - the province and BC Hydro invested $10 million to launch a free air conditioner program. After the first year, the program installed just over 7,000 units, not yet enough to meet demand. Then the province put $20 million more into the program, bringing the total investment to $30 million. B.C.'s Ministry of Health said more than 27,500 air conditioning units had been distributed. A 2024 BC Hydro survey found that access to cooling in B.C. homes had increased to five in 10 residents - though it's hard to pinpoint whether that rise is due to the air conditioner program or people buying more air conditioners as it gets hotter.</p><p>The application process for the air conditioner program was inaccessible for some. When the program launched, applications were only available online, which meant that people with low computer literacy - older adults among them - struggled to access the form. An applicant also needed a BC Hydro account, but renters in social housing don't have one.</p><p>Just one resident in the Legion Manor applied for an air conditioner the summer the program launched, according to Sharon Ennis, the building manager. She started making the air conditioner applications a priority. Once paper applications were allowed, she lent a hand to tenants who wanted to apply. Ten residents had applied by the end of last summer.</p><p>Don Brookes, who on a hot afternoon in August 2024 showed a reporter his small apartment where it felt even hotter, said he had applied a few weeks before and was waiting to see if he had been approved. The average wait time for an air conditioner, said BC Hydro, is four weeks from application to installation. But in the summer of 2024, Ennis said at the time, residents at the Legion manor waited 8 to 12 weeks or longer.</p><p>\"It gets really hot in my apartment in the summer,\" Brookes said. \"When it heats up, I'll usually go downstairs, and I sit in the cool, shaded corner of the patio.\"</p><p>The 65-year-old lives one floor below where McKinlay died.</p><p>A year later, Brookes says he still hasn't received an air conditioner and that he has not heard from BC Hydro about if and why his application was rejected. BC Hydro said it couldn't offer particulars on Brookes' case, but said, in general, that delayed installation most commonly occurs \"when we have incomplete applications, or if customers are not readily available for installation.\"</p><p>There were other hoops for applicants to jump through: The application required either a recommendation letter from the regional health authority or proof that an applicant's income didn't exceed a certain threshold. Obtaining proof of income was challenging for those who were previously unhoused or had never set up an account with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p><p>Renters needed to provide a signed consent form from their landlord, though landlords could refuse to allow air conditioner installation.</p><p>Nadine Nakagawa, New Westminster councillor and a renter, said her tenancy agreement prohibited air conditioners. She suspected it had something to do with the esthetics of the building. \"Even if I took one of those free air conditioners, I'm not allowed to have it,\" Nakagawa said. Judith Peuvergne, a representative of Arpeg Group, the developer that owns and manages Nakagawa's building, said while window-mounted air conditioning units are prohibited due to \"both design and safety concerns due to the current window configuration,\" portable interior air conditioning units are permitted. Building management also keeps a dozen portable AC units that it offers for a $100 refundable deposit, Peuvergne added.</p><p>Nakagawa has heard similar concerns from her constituents. \"I hear a lot from people saying that doesn't work for me, for any number of reasons - mostly because landlords will not allow it, or it doesn't work with their housing situation.\"</p><p>The air conditioning program distributed more than 27,500 units but the $30 million has been exhausted. There are 660,000 rental households in the province, and seniors make up 20 per cent of total renters.</p><p>Disability and housing advocate Gabrielle Peters, who suffered a heat stroke during the heat dome, said there shouldn't be a cap on the number of air conditioners the province will supply for people in need. \"It shouldn't be based on a Black Friday sale logic,\" she said, where there's a limited supply and only \"the first 500 people through the door get an air conditioner,\" she said. BC Hydro said it's never had to turn away customers due to a limited number of AC units being available.</p><p>In September 2024, BC Hydro and the province narrowed the eligibility requirements, shutting the program down to applications on an income basis. Now, only people who are getting home care through provincial programs can access free air conditioners with a referral from their health authority. This means that low-income people, and people whose health issues don't meet the threshold for home care - like some with chronic illnesses - can't access the program.</p><p>BC Hydro told the Star it has among the lowest electricity rates in North America and pointed to programs like its rebates - including $50 off eligible portable air conditioners and $30 off air purifiers - as well as free energy assessments and energy saving kits. It said it has funding to renew the air conditioner program and will continue to make units available to medically vulnerable customers through health care authority referrals, until March 2028.</p><p>This year at the Legion Manor, nobody has applied for an air conditioner because of the change in policy, building manager Ennis said. The building bought a \"loaner\" air conditioner, free for residents to borrow, and now has extra fans, too, she added.</p><p>Critics say a program designed to help the vulnerable should not throw up barriers to them. This May, advocates in B.C. called on BC Hydro to cut the red tape around the air conditioner program and make it more accessible to low-income people.</p><p>Cooling centres hard to access for those who need them most</p><p>Cooling centres are a cornerstone of B.C.'s extreme heat strategy. In 2024, more than 60 communities, including First Nations, opened cooling centres, according to B.C.'s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness. Since 2022, the province has put $689,000 towards cooling centres in 190 local governments and First Nations. Experts emphasized that their effectiveness has been limited and least accessible for the people who really need them.</p><p>When it's the middle of a heat wave and someone is mobility-challenged, without a car, low-income and vulnerable to high temperatures, it's tough to get to a cooling centre. In municipalities in Metro Vancouver, unpredictable bus schedules, inaccessible stops and buses, and long travel times with multiple transfers can make it even tougher, said Liv Yoon, a researcher with the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Yoon conducted a study on the usefulness of cooling centres and found the barriers often outweighed the benefits for older adults.</p><p>Locals Yoon talked to were unsure where the cooling centres were, when they were open, or even what they were. Many of the 60 metro Vancouver residents Yoon interviewed \"thought we meant shelters, that are only meant for unhoused people.\" \"There is a lack of clarity about what these are, especially if you're a senior and you're not digitally plugged in,\" she said.</p><p>\"Cooling centres are kind of moot. People just want to be comfortable where they live,\" said Yoon.</p><p>On a hot weekday morning in early August 2024, volunteers served coffee, smoothies and pastries in the lobby of Veterans' Manor in Vancouver's downtown east side. The volunteers worked with Whole Way House, a non-profit that runs community programming across the city.</p><p>Resident Robert Busch sipped a cup of coffee and chatted with his neighbours. Busch, 70, has lived in an apartment in a low-income B.C. Housing building for veterans and older men at risk of homelessness, since 2017. He's had five heart attacks in as many years, and suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, as well as lung disease, which makes it hard for him to breathe. Busch is on end-of-life care, but he's able to stay at home with the support of his doctors and support workers.</p><p>\"I have a tough time dealing with the heat, and my room is like an oven,\" he said. \"I'm so sick I can barely do anything. I'm stuck in my room because I usually don't have the energy to get down here, and I can't breathe at all. It's terrible.\"</p><p>Whole Way House has turned the building's lobby into a cooling centre, where it hosts these coffee hours three mornings a week as a way to draw residents out of their overheated rooms. Later that same morning, Robert Busch attended a workshop with a CRA representative, organized by the non-profit, to help residents who hadn't filed their taxes in a while get their proof of income in order to apply for an air conditioner. (Last summer, when the Star visited Whole Way House, the program eligibility criteria had not yet changed.)</p><p>\"I like it here, it's like its own little community,\" Busch said of Veterans' Manor. By summer 2025, Busch had received his free air conditioner from BC Hydro. </p><p>A study by the National Institute on Ageing found that four in 10 adults age 50 and over in Canada are socially isolated. The isolation makes heat waves deadlier. Older people who live alone and don't have regular contact with others are more vulnerable to high temperatures. During the 2021 heat dome, more than half of those who died had lived alone, and were found during a wellness check by family or friends, a health-care support worker, or police.</p><p>Drawing older residents out of their rooms and ushering them into social interactions is one of the best ways to protect them from the heat.</p><p>\"Having that person who calls you or emails you to say how are you doing today is really key to making sure that people are OK,\" says Jennifer Baumbusch, a gerontological researcher at UBC and nurse practitioner. \"Because (heat) sneaks up on you.\"</p><p>The Legion Manor, where McKinlay lived, now hosts biweekly barbecues in the top floor cooling room. The building also launched a pilot community care program where care aides conduct daily checks on residents. \"So that nobody slips through the cracks, and for making sure we don't lose anyone to the heat,\" Ennis said.</p><p>Wellness checks from landlords or health-care workers are a good start, but Jenny Konkin, president and co-founder of Whole Way House, has found that to build community, people \"want an opportunity to contribute.\"</p><p>\"So, whether that's volunteering to help make coffee or set up the tables or doing an art program or learning something new, it helps us as humans, I think, to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves,\" she said.</p><p>Push for bylaws on max indoor temperature</p><p>Social connections alone aren't enough to safeguard against the heat. McKinlay knew many in her community, but those connections could not protect her from her unsafe apartment.</p><p>After the heat dome, B.C. changed its building code to require new buildings have one cool space under 26 degrees. The regulation doesn't apply to apartments and residences that have already been built, like McKinlay's former apartment in the Legion Manor.</p><p>There has been a growing push by tenants' rights and environmental advocacy groups for maximum indoor temperature bylaws in existing buildings. These laws would cap indoor temperatures at 26 C in at least one room in each residence during heat events, just as municipalities have minimum indoor temperature laws regulating how cold a residence can get in the winter.</p><p>Some B.C. municipalities are now trying to write their own new rules so that a maximum indoor temperature law applies to all types of buildings.</p><p>New Westminster councillors Nakagawa and Tasha Henderson are pushing for legislation that ensures each unit has at least one cool room, not including the bathroom. The council is now examining how to implement the potential bylaw. In May 2025, it passed a law that would ban buildings in the city from prohibiting air conditioners. In fall 2024, Port Moody, another city in the metro Vancouver area, amended its standards of building bylaw to require that landlords can't prohibit air conditioners, and that they must be kept in good working order.</p><p>A representative from the B.C. Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said the province is working to develop requirements for existing buildings by 2030.</p><p>A Pembina Institute study found that retrofitting low income residences experiencing energy poverty across Canada could cost $2.8 billion annually from 2025 to 2050 in public investment, raising questions about how it will be funded and whether most landlords will absorb the cost.</p><p>'Like opening an oven door'</p><p>Nearly four years after Hansen and Armstrong lost their sister to the heat, Hansen struggles as she revisits that summer. \"I have a lot of guilt associated with Tracey's death. It's my biggest regret,\" she said.</p><p>As soon as she and her sister entered McKinlay's apartment the day after she died, \"It was like opening an oven door. ... Had I known, we would've picked her up and taken her somewhere safe,\" Hansen said.</p><p>Hansen wanted to do something to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat but struggled a bit to figure out how.</p><p>She doubted whether giving everyone an air conditioner would be effective. \"More than likely a lot of the elderly wouldn't use it, because they would be afraid of running their electricity bill up, and many of them have to choose between food and medication,\" she said.</p><p>In the weeks after McKinlay's death, the sisters launched Tracey's Legacy and collected 80 fans for McKinlay's neighbours. No other solutions seemed feasible, simple and low-cost.</p><p>On the day they donated the fans, residents came out to say thank you and share stories about her.</p><p>\"(I) blame myself,\" Hansen said. \"I didn't physically go and check on her.\" </p>", "publisher": "thestar.com", "instances": ["C. s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness.

She had no air conditioner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was June 2021 and the heat dome settling over the normally temperate lower mainland would soon break temperature records and make headlines. The provincial coroner would later find extreme heat contributed to hundreds of deaths. Ninety per cent of the victims were, like McKinlay, 60 years and older. Most also had a chronic health condition and lived alone in old, poorly insulated housing without air conditioning. McKinlay ticked all the boxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We knew the heat dome was pretty nasty,\" said Jeanne Hansen, McKinlay's sister. \"We were checking in. That day, she said she'd gone out for her walk, that she was OK, that everything was fine.\"</p><p>McKinlay hadn't told her sister that her fan - the only thing keeping her cool - was broken.</p><p>The deadly temperatures in June 2021 spurred B.C. to the forefront of Canada's fight against extreme heat. The province developed an early warning system that sent alerts to cell phones. It said it would spend $30 million on a new program to give 28,000 air conditioners to medically vulnerable and low-income people by 2026. It updated the provincial building code to require cooling in at least one room in new buildings, among other measures.</p><p>But four years after the pledges were made, many remain vulnerable. The free air conditioner program struggled to find its footing, and then de-prioritized the low-income people who need it the most. The cooling centres have often sat empty, according to one 2025 study. The B.C. Building Code update doesn't include buildings constructed before March 2024, which are more likely to be rentals or subsidized housing.</p><p>Municipalities put forward a motion to push for a provincial maximum indoor temperature law that would include older buildings, but the motion failed.</p><p>Tenants, advocates and frustrated lawmakers are concerned the province is not moving fast enough to protect seniors from the next life-threatening heat wave.</p><p>The stakes are high: Without more safeguards to protect people from high temperatures, by 2030 the heat could kill an average of more than 1,300 people, hospitalize 6,000, and cost at least $100 million in hospital expenses every year in B.C. alone, according to a report by the Canadian Climate Institute.</p><p>\"B.C. has had to play catch-up incredibly fast - they've had to go from zero to 100 in a couple of years,\" says Ryan Ness, one of the authors of the report. \"They've got some things in place - especially in terms of how to respond in terms of emergencies, but in terms of adapting and preventing things from getting to a crisis point, there's still a lot that needs to be done.\"</p><p>At the Legion Manor, which houses seniors and veterans, a reporter who visited last summer found the province's push for greater protection appeared to fall short of what residents need. While the Manor had turned the top-floor rec room into a cooling room, it was empty on the hot afternoon the reporter visited. The Manor had acquired heat-blocking rubber curtains, but in early August 2024 the drapes sat in a pile in a storage room. Misters had been installed in the building's concrete courtyard, but they were turned off. On the ninth floor, a resident waited for an air conditioner he had applied for weeks before.</p><p>Just one floor up and down the hall is where, in June 2021, McKinlay sweltered.</p><p>Heat is the 'silent killer'</p><p>That summer, it seemed everybody underestimated the heat. They were focused on the fires. As Canada warms twice as fast as the global average thanks in part to fossil fuel pollution, wildfires are becoming more frequent and ferocious. They decimate forests, spark mass evacuations and cost a fortune in damages. The entire town of Lytton, B.C., burned to the ground.</p><p>But the fires are nowhere near as lethal. A provincial coroner's report revealed that McKinlay and at least 618 other people had been killed by extreme temperatures during the 2021 heat dome. Of the 618 people who died, two-thirds were 70 or older; more than half lived alone.</p><p>\"We often refer to heat as the silent killer for that reason, but it's becoming less and less silent in Canada,\" said Sarah Henderson, a senior environmental health scientist at B.C.'s Centre for Disease Control. \"For people in public health, everyone knows that heat is the biggest risk.\"</p><p>Heat sensitivity is influenced by age more than by any other risk factor. When we age, our bodies become less efficient at regulating body temperature and staying hydrated. Older adults are also more likely to be on medications that impede the body's temperature regulation. When it's hot, older people are more susceptible to heat exhaustion, heat stroke, or heart attacks or other cardiovascular issues. Heat can also reduce cognitive function, causing delirium or confusion.</p><p>Those with arthritis, depression, high blood pressure, or other chronic health conditions; as well as those who are socially isolated, who live alone; and lower-income people are all more vulnerable to heat-related deaths.</p><p>McKinlay was 61. She lived alone on a fixed income. She had schizophrenia and was taking antipsychotic medications, which can make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature.</p><p>Her two sisters checked up on her by phone, as they often did. Neighbours and the building managers had been trying to look out for one another, too. On June 29, a day after temperatures soared to 42 C, a neighbour repeatedly knocked on McKinlay's door but got no response. When the police came, they found McKinlay in her chair, wearing her sweatshirt and jeans. McKinlay had died overnight, the coroner later said, from \"effects of heat.\" She had put on extra layers when she started to feel shivery, a common symptom of hyperthermia.</p><p>Housing in materially deprived neighbourhoods like the New Westminster community McKinlay lived in is more likely to be older, poorly insulated and of a lower quality, which means the living space heats up faster and stays hot for longer than in better insulated homes. Ninety-eight per cent of the heat dome deaths happened indoors.</p><p>Air conditioning program had cold start</p><p>In temperate B.C., where average monthly temperatures fluctuate between zero and 20 C year-round, households have had the lowest rate of air conditioning in the country, with only three in 10 residents having access to cooling, according to a 2023 study.</p><p>In June 2023 - two years after the heat dome - the province and BC Hydro invested $10 million to launch a free air conditioner program. After the first year, the program installed just over 7,000 units, not yet enough to meet demand. Then the province put $20 million more into the program, bringing the total investment to $30 million. B.C.'s Ministry of Health said more than 27,500 air conditioning units had been distributed. A 2024 BC Hydro survey found that access to cooling in B.C. homes had increased to five in 10 residents - though it's hard to pinpoint whether that rise is due to the air conditioner program or people buying more air conditioners as it gets hotter.</p><p>The application process for the air conditioner program was inaccessible for some. When the program launched, applications were only available online, which meant that people with low computer literacy - older adults among them - struggled to access the form. An applicant also needed a BC Hydro account, but renters in social housing don't have one.</p><p>Just one resident in the Legion Manor applied for an air conditioner the summer the program launched, according to Sharon Ennis, the building manager. She started making the air conditioner applications a priority. Once paper applications were allowed, she lent a hand to tenants who wanted to apply. Ten residents had applied by the end of last summer.</p><p>Don Brookes, who on a hot afternoon in August 2024 showed a reporter his small apartment where it felt even hotter, said he had applied a few weeks before and was waiting to see if he had been approved. The average wait time for an air conditioner, said BC Hydro, is four weeks from application to installation. But in the summer of 2024, Ennis said at the time, residents at the Legion manor waited 8 to 12 weeks or longer.</p><p>\"It gets really hot in my apartment in the summer,\" Brookes said. \"When it heats up, I'll usually go downstairs, and I sit in the cool, shaded corner of the patio.\"</p><p>The 65-year-old lives one floor below where McKinlay died.</p><p>A year later, Brookes says he still hasn't received an air conditioner and that he has not heard from BC Hydro about if and why his application was rejected. BC Hydro said it couldn't offer particulars on Brookes' case, but said, in general, that delayed installation most commonly occurs \"when we have incomplete applications, or if customers are not readily available for installation.\"</p><p>There were other hoops for applicants to jump through: The application required either a recommendation letter from the regional health authority or proof that an applicant's income didn't exceed a certain threshold. Obtaining proof of income was challenging for those who were previously unhoused or had never set up an account with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</p><p>Renters needed to provide a signed consent form from their landlord, though landlords could refuse to allow air conditioner installation.</p><p>Nadine Nakagawa, New Westminster councillor and a renter, said her tenancy agreement prohibited air conditioners. She suspected it had something to do with the esthetics of the building. \"Even if I took one of those free air conditioners, I'm not allowed to have it,\" Nakagawa said. Judith Peuvergne, a representative of Arpeg Group, the developer that owns and manages Nakagawa's building, said while window-mounted air conditioning units are prohibited due to \"both design and safety concerns due to the current window configuration,\" portable interior air conditioning units are permitted. Building management also keeps a dozen portable AC units that it offers for a $100 refundable deposit, Peuvergne added.</p><p>Nakagawa has heard similar concerns from her constituents. \"I hear a lot from people saying that doesn't work for me, for any number of reasons - mostly because landlords will not allow it, or it doesn't work with their housing situation.\"</p><p>The air conditioning program distributed more than 27,500 units but the $30 million has been exhausted. There are 660,000 rental households in the province, and seniors make up 20 per cent of total renters.</p><p>Disability and housing advocate Gabrielle Peters, who suffered a heat stroke during the heat dome, said there shouldn't be a cap on the number of air conditioners the province will supply for people in need. \"It shouldn't be based on a Black Friday sale logic,\" she said, where there's a limited supply and only \"the first 500 people through the door get an air conditioner,\" she said. BC Hydro said it's never had to turn away customers due to a limited number of AC units being available.</p><p>In September 2024, BC Hydro and the province narrowed the eligibility requirements, shutting the program down to applications on an income basis. Now, only people who are getting home care through provincial programs can access free air conditioners with a referral from their health authority. This means that low-income people, and people whose health issues don't meet the threshold for home care - like some with chronic illnesses - can't access the program.</p><p>BC Hydro told the Star it has among the lowest electricity rates in North America and pointed to programs like its rebates - including $50 off eligible portable air conditioners and $30 off air purifiers - as well as free energy assessments and energy saving kits. It said it has funding to renew the air conditioner program and will continue to make units available to medically vulnerable customers through health care authority referrals, until March 2028.</p><p>This year at the Legion Manor, nobody has applied for an air conditioner because of the change in policy, building manager Ennis said. The building bought a \"loaner\" air conditioner, free for residents to borrow, and now has extra fans, too, she added.</p><p>Critics say a program designed to help the vulnerable should not throw up barriers to them. This May, advocates in B.C. called on BC Hydro to cut the red tape around the air conditioner program and make it more accessible to low-income people.</p><p>Cooling centres hard to access for those who need them most</p><p>Cooling centres are a cornerstone of B.C.'s extreme heat strategy. In 2024, more than 60 communities, including First Nations, opened cooling centres, according to B.C.'s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness. Since 2022, the province has put $689,000 towards cooling centres in 190 local governments and First Nations. Experts emphasized that their effectiveness has been limited and least accessible for the people who really need them.</p><p>When it's the middle of a heat wave and someone is mobility-challenged, without a car, low-income and vulnerable to high temperatures, it's tough to get to a cooling centre. In municipalities in Metro Vancouver, unpredictable bus schedules, inaccessible stops and buses, and long travel times with multiple transfers can make it even tougher, said Liv Yoon, a researcher with the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Yoon conducted a study on the usefulness of cooling centres and found the barriers often outweighed the benefits for older adults.</p><p>Locals Yoon talked to were unsure where the cooling centres were, when they were open, or even what they were. Many of the 60 metro Vancouver residents Yoon interviewed \"thought we meant shelters, that are only meant for unhoused people.\" \"There is a lack of clarity about what these are, especially if you're a senior and you're not digitally plugged in,\" she said.</p><p>\"Cooling centres are kind of moot. People just want to be comfortable where they live,\" said Yoon.</p><p>On a hot weekday morning in early August 2024, volunteers served coffee, smoothies and pastries in the lobby of Veterans' Manor in Vancouver's downtown east side. The volunteers worked with Whole Way House, a non-profit that runs community programming across the city.</p><p>Resident Robert Busch sipped a cup of coffee and chatted with his neighbours. Busch, 70, has lived in an apartment in a low-income B.C. Housing building for veterans and older men at risk of homelessness, since 2017. He's had five heart attacks in as many years, and suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, as well as lung disease, which makes it hard for him to breathe. Busch is on end-of-life care, but he's able to stay at home with the support of his doctors and support workers.</p><p>\"I have a tough time dealing with the heat, and my room is like an oven,\" he said. \"I'm so sick I can barely do anything. I'm stuck in my room because I usually don't have the energy to get down here, and I can't breathe at all. It's terrible.\"</p><p>Whole Way House has turned the building's lobby into a cooling centre, where it hosts these coffee hours three mornings a week as a way to draw residents out of their overheated rooms. Later that same morning, Robert Busch attended a workshop with a CRA representative, organized by the non-profit, to help residents who hadn't filed their taxes in a while get their proof of income in order to apply for an air conditioner. (Last summer, when the Star visited Whole Way House, the program eligibility criteria had not yet changed.)</p><p>\"I like it here, it's like its own little community,\" Busch said of Veterans' Manor. By summer 2025, Busch had received his free air conditioner from BC Hydro. </p><p>A study by the National Institute on Ageing found that four in 10 adults age 50 and over in Canada are socially isolated. The isolation makes heat waves deadlier. Older people who live alone and don't have regular contact with others are more vulnerable to high temperatures. During the 2021 heat dome, more than half of those who died had lived alone, and were found during a wellness check by family or friends, a health-care support worker, or police.</p><p>Drawing older residents out of their rooms and ushering them into social interactions is one of the best ways to protect them from the heat.</p><p>\"Having that person who calls you or emails you to say how are you doing today is really key to making sure that people are OK,\" says Jennifer Baumbusch, a gerontological researcher at UBC and nurse practitioner. \"Because (heat) sneaks up on you.\"</p><p>The Legion Manor, where McKinlay lived, now hosts biweekly barbecues in the top floor cooling room. The building also launched a pilot community care program where care aides conduct daily checks on residents. \"So that nobody slips through the cracks, and for making sure we don't lose anyone to the heat,\" Ennis said.</p><p>Wellness checks from landlords or health-care workers are a good start, but Jenny Konkin, president and co-founder of Whole Way House, has found that to build community, people \"want an opportunity to contribute.\"</p><p>\"So, whether that's volunteering to help make coffee or set up the tables or doing an art program or learning something new, it helps us as humans, I think, to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves,\" she said.</p><p>Push for bylaws on max indoor temperature</p><p>Social connections alone aren't enough to safeguard against the heat. McKinlay knew many in her community, but those connections could not protect her from her unsafe apartment.</p><p>After the heat dome, B.C. changed its building code to require new buildings have one cool space under 26 degrees. The regulation doesn't apply to apartments and residences that have already been built, like McKinlay's former apartment in the Legion Manor.</p><p>There has been a growing push by tenants' rights and environmental advocacy groups for maximum indoor temperature bylaws in existing buildings. These laws would cap indoor temperatures at 26 C in at least one room in each residence during heat events, just as municipalities have minimum indoor temperature laws regulating how cold a residence can get in the winter.</p><p>Some B.C. municipalities are now trying to write their own new rules so that a maximum indoor temperature law applies to all types of buildings.</p><p>New Westminster councillors Nakagawa and Tasha Henderson are pushing for legislation that ensures each unit has at least one cool room, not including the bathroom. The council is now examining how to implement the potential bylaw. In May 2025, it passed a law that would ban buildings in the city from prohibiting air conditioners. In fall 2024, Port Moody, another city in the metro Vancouver area, amended its standards of building bylaw to require that landlords can't prohibit air conditioners, and that they must be kept in good working order.</p><p>A representative from the B.C. Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said the province is working to develop requirements for existing buildings by 2030.</p><p>A Pembina Institute study found that retrofitting low income residences experiencing energy poverty across Canada could cost $2.8 billion annually from 2025 to 2050 in public investment, raising questions about how it will be funded and whether most landlords will absorb the cost.</p><p>'Like opening an oven door'</p><p>Nearly four years after Hansen and Armstrong lost their sister to the heat, Hansen struggles as she revisits that summer. \"I have a lot of guilt associated with Tracey's death. It's my biggest regret,\" she said.</p><p>As soon as she and her sister entered McKinlay's apartment the day after she died, \"It was like opening an oven door. ... Had I known, we would've picked her up and taken her somewhere safe,\" Hansen said.</p><p>Hansen wanted to do something to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat but struggled a bit to figure out how.</p><p>She doubted whether giving everyone an air conditioner would be effective. \"More than likely a lot of the elderly wouldn't use it, because they would be afraid of running their electricity bill up, and many of them have to choose between food and medication,\" she said.</p><p>In the weeks after McKinlay's death, the sisters launched Tracey's Legacy and collected 80 fans for McKinlay's neighbours. No other solutions seemed feasible, simple and low-cost.</p><p>On the day they donated the fans, residents came out to say thank you and share stories about her.</p><p>\"(I) blame myself,\" Hansen said. \"I didn't physically go and check on her.\" </p>", "publisher": "thestar.com", "instances": ["C. s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness.

It said it has funding to renew the air conditioner program and will continue to make units available to medically vulnerable customers through health care authority referrals, until March 2028.</p><p>This year at the Legion Manor, nobody has applied for an air conditioner because of the change in policy, building manager Ennis said. The building bought a \"loaner\" air conditioner, free for residents to borrow, and now has extra fans, too, she added.</p><p>Critics say a program designed to help the vulnerable should not throw up barriers to them. This May, advocates in B.C. called on BC Hydro to cut the red tape around the air conditioner program and make it more accessible to low-income people.</p><p>Cooling centres hard to access </p><p>Cooling centres are a cornerstone of B.C.'s extreme heat strategy. In 2024, more than 60 communities, including First Nations, opened cooling centres, according to B.C.'s Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness. Since 2022, the province has put $689,000 towards cooling centres in 190 local governments and First Nations. Experts emphasized that their effectiveness has been limited and least accessible for the people who really need them.</p><p>When it's the middle of a heat wave and someone is mobility-challenged, without a car, low-income and vulnerable to high temperatures, it's tough to get to a cooling centre.</p><p> In municipalities in Metro Vancouver, unpredictable bus schedules, inaccessible stops and buses, and long travel times with multiple transfers can make it even tougher, said Liv Yoon, a researcher with the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Yoon conducted a study on the usefulness of cooling centres and found the barriers often outweighed the benefits for older adults.</p><p>Locals Yoon talked to were unsure where the cooling centres were, when they were open, or even what they were.

People just want to be comfortable where they live.\"</p><p>On a hot weekday morning in early August 2024, volunteers served coffee, smoothies and pastries in the lobby of Veterans' Manor in Vancouver's downtown east side. The volunteers worked with Whole Way House, a non-profit that runs community programming across the city.</p><p>Resident Robert Busch sipped a cup of coffee and chatted with his neighbours. Busch, 70, has lived in an apartment in a low-income B.C. Housing building for veterans and older men at risk of homelessness, since 2017. He's had five heart attacks in as many years, and suffers from cirrhosis of the liver, as well as lung disease, which makes it hard for him to breathe. Busch is on end-of-life care, but he's able to stay at home with the support of his doctors and support workers.</p><p>\"I have a tough time dealing with the heat, and my room is like an oven,\" he said. \"I'm so sick I can barely do anything. I'm stuck in my room because I usually don't have the energy to get down here, and I can't breathe at all. It's terrible.\"</p><p>Whole Way House has turned the building's lobby into a cooling centre, where it hosts these coffee hours three mornings a week as a way to draw residents out of their overheated rooms. Later that same morning, Robert Busch attended a workshop with a CRA representative, organized by the non-profit, to help residents who hadn't filed their taxes in a while get their proof of income in order to apply for an air conditioner. (Last summer, when the Star visited Whole Way House, the program eligibility criteria had not yet changed.)</p><p>\"I like it here, it's like its own little community,\" Busch said of Veterans' Manor. By summer 2025, Busch had received his free air conditioner from BC Hydro. </p><p>A study by the National Institute on Ageing found that four in 10 adults age 50 and over in Canada are socially isolated. The isolation makes heat waves deadlier. Older people who live alone and don't have regular contact with others are more vulnerable to high temperatures. </p><p>During the 2021 heat dome, more than half of those who died had lived alone, and were found during a wellness check by family or friends, a health-care support worker, or police.</p><p>Drawing older residents out of their rooms and ushering them into social interactions is one of the best ways to protect them from the heat.</p><p>\"Having that person who calls you or emails you to say how are you doing today is really key to making sure that people are OK,\" says Jennifer Baumbusch, a gerontological researcher at UBC and nurse practitioner. \"Because (heat) sneaks up on you.\"</p><p>The Legion Manor, where McKinlay lived, now hosts biweekly barbecues in the top floor cooling room. The building also launched a pilot community care program where care aides conduct daily checks on residents. \"So that nobody slips through the cracks, and for making sure we don't lose anyone to the heat,\" Ennis said.</p><p>Wellness checks from landlords or health-care workers are a good start, but Jenny Konkin, president and co-founder of Whole Way House, has found that to build community, people \"want an opportunity to contribute.\"</p><p>\"So, whether that's volunteering to help make coffee or set up the tables or doing an art program or learning something new, it helps us as humans, I think, to feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves,\" she said.</p><p>Push for bylaws </p><p>on max indoor temperature</p><p>Social connections alone aren't enough to safeguard against the heat. McKinlay knew many in her community, but those connections could not protect her from her unsafe apartment.</p><p>After the heat dome, B.C. changed its building code to require new buildings have one cool space under 26 degrees. </p><p>The regulation doesn't apply to apartments and residences that have already been built, like McKinlay's former apartment in the Legion Manor.</p><p>There has been a growing push by tenants' rights and environmental advocacy groups for maximum indoor temperature bylaws in existing buildings. These laws would cap indoor temperatures at 26 C in at least one room in each residence during heat events, just as municipalities have minimum indoor temperature laws regulating how cold a residence can get in the winter.</p><p>Some B.C. municipalities are now trying to write their own new rules so that a maximum indoor temperature law applies to all types of buildings.</p><p>New Westminster councillors Nakagawa and Tasha Henderson are pushing for legislation that ensures each unit has at least one cool room, not including the bathroom. The council is now examining how to implement the potential bylaw. In May 2025, it passed a law that would ban buildings in the city from prohibiting air conditioners. In fall 2024, Port Moody, another city in the metro Vancouver area, amended its standards of building bylaw to require that landlords can't prohibit air conditioners, and that they must be kept in good working order.</p><p>A representative from the B.C. Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs said the province is working to develop requirements for existing buildings by 2030.</p><p>A Pembina Institute study found that retrofitting low income residences experiencing energy poverty across Canada could cost $2.8 billion annually from 2025 to 2050 in public investment, raising questions about how it will be funded and whether most landlords will absorb the cost.</p><p>'Like opening an oven door'</p><p>Nearly four years after Hansen and Armstrong lost their sister to the heat, Hansen struggles as she revisits that summer. \"I have a lot of guilt associated with Tracey's death. It's my biggest regret,\" she said.</p><p>As soon as she and her sister entered McKinlay's apartment the day after she died, \"It was like opening an oven door ... Had I known, we would've picked her up and taken her somewhere safe,\" Hansen said.</p><p>Hansen wanted to do something to raise awareness about the dangers of extreme heat but struggled a bit to figure out how.</p><p>She doubted whether giving everyone an air conditioner would be effective. \"More than likely a lot of the elderly wouldn't use it, because they would be afraid of running their electricity bill up, and many of them have to choose between food and medication,\" she said.</p><p>In the weeks after McKinlay's death, the sisters launched Tracey's Legacy and collected 80 fans for McKinlay's neighbours. No other solutions seemed feasible, simple and low-cost.</p><p>On the day they donated the fans, residents came out to say thank you and share stories about her.</p><p>\"(I) blame myself,\" Hansen said. \"I didn't physically go and check on her.\"</p><p>This article is part of an ongoing Toronto Star series produced in collaboration with Toronto Metropolitan University and the National Institute on Ageing.

The court warned that failure to fulfill this obligation could lead to legal consequences, including financial compensation and other forms of restitution.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cFailure of a state to take an appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions, including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses, or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies, may constitute an internationally wrongful act, which is attributable to that state,\u201d ICJ president Yuji Iwasawa said, reading out the court\u2019s decision.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Today, the tables have turned. The world's highest court provided us with a powerful new tool to protect people from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis \u2014 and to deliver justice for the harm their emissions have already caused,\" former UN human rights chief Mary Robinson said.</p><p>\"This is even better than we could have expected...We have the ICJ explicitly saying that fossil fuel production, subsidies, all of this, could be breaches of international law. I thought that was so beyond what was possible. I\u2019m still in ecstasy with everything that just happened,\" Greenpeace International legal counsel Danilo Garrido told The Pointer. \u201cThis will open the door for new cases, and hopefully bring justice to those, who despite having contributed the least to climate change, are already suffering its most severe consequences. The message of the Court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licenses and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of international law. Polluters must stop emitting and must pay for the harms they have caused.\u201d</p><p>The ICJ took six years to come to this decision, and it all began with young people demanding climate justice.</p><p>In 2019, a group of 27 law students at the University of the South Pacific and members of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC), frustrated by global inaction, convinced the government of Vanuatu to bring a case before the ICJ to clarify states\u2019 legal obligations under international law in addressing climate change.</p><p>In March 2023, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution recognizing climate change as \u201can unprecedented challenge of civilizational proportions\u201d and requesting an ICJ advisory opinion.</p><p>The court received a record 91 written submissions, over 100 oral statements, and 65 responses to follow-up questions.</p><p>The world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitters argued that their obligations were limited to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p><p>In its submission, Canada defended its ongoing fossil fuel production by citing the flexibility within the Paris Agreement, stating that it \u201cdoes not contain explicit commitments related to the restriction of fossil fuel production,\u201d leaving each country to decide which measures to take to meet climate goals.</p><p>The ICJ decisively rejected this narrow view, affirming that a broader range of treaties also apply, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Montreal Protocol, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.</p><p>The opinion clarifies that obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement are not just voluntary.</p><p>In Canada, young activists have already taken both federal and provincial governments to court, including the ongoing La Rose case against the federal government and the Mathur case against the Doug Ford government in Ontario for violating the rights of young people by failing to adequately address the threat of climate change.\u00a0</p><p>The ICJ ruling could strengthen their efforts.</p><p>\u201cIt's a historic decision that we believe reinforces what is really the gruelling consensus from judges around the world, that the climate crisis is a human rights crisis. Today's decision\u2026has made it clear that governments have a responsibility to protect human rights in the face of growing climate threats,\u201d Ecojustice lawyer Fraser Thomson, who is leading the Mathur case, said.</p><p>\u201cThe ICJ has affirmed what the science and communities and Indigenous people have been saying for years, that a safe and healthy climate is a precondition to all of our human rights.\u201d</p><p>Launched in 2019, the same year Pacific Island students began the campaign that led to the ICJ opinion, Mathur and La Rose cases both argue that inaction on climate change by the government violates Sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protect the rights to life, liberty, security of the person and equality.</p><p>The youth plaintiffs argue that climate change disproportionately harms young people. From worsening air quality to increased mental health burdens, they say they will suffer the most severe consequences of environmental degradation unless Canada and Ontario take urgent and meaningful action.</p><p>\u201cWhen they delivered the opinion this morning, I was honestly taken aback. I was on the edge of my seat,\u201d climate Activist Albert Lalonde, also one of the 15 plaintiffs in the La Rose case, told The Pointer on July 23.</p><p>\u201cAt first, it took a while to get a sense of where it was going, but I\u2019ve been left with this strange feeling of, \u2018This is actually great,\u2019 and I'm not used to having great news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe woke up in a world without a real legal framework to address climate change. Now we have one. That\u2019s a huge shift,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lalonde notes that there has been debate over the \u201clex specialis rule\u201d, where more specific laws override general ones, the court interpreted international law in a way that reflects complex planetary realities.</p><p>He described Canada\u2019s response as \u201cbizarre,\u201d aligning with a new form of climate denialism, not denying climate change exists, but pretending that decarbonized pipelines are feasible.</p><p>\u201cThis opinion should have serious implications for Canadian policy. If we believe in science and the rule of law, then we must accept the obligations and thresholds the ICJ laid out as a bottom line.\u201d</p><p>One of the most consequential shifts, he said, is legal: the ICJ found that state emissions, not just individual projects or pieces of legislation, can constitute internationally wrongful acts.</p><p>If a causal link can be established between a state\u2019s emissions and harm in another country, the emitting state could be held internationally liable, whether through compensation, restitution, or by halting the activity causing harm.</p><p>\u201cUsually, constitutional challenges focus on one law or decision. In La Rose, our argument is that Canada\u2019s entire pattern of actions and emissions constitutes wrongful conduct, violating our Charter rights to life, liberty, and security\u2026and now we have international legal backing for that framing,\u201d Lalonde said.</p><p>\u201cEnforcement remains a challenge, but establishing this norm is itself powerful,\u201d which will be key as La Rose moves toward an eight-week trial beginning on October 26, 2026.</p><p>ICJ advisory opinions may be nonbinding, but Thomson says Canadian courts have historically cited them as authoritative interpretations of international law.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cJudges weighing climate cases here will likely pay close attention to this one,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Because Canadian courts often interpret international law through the lens of the Charter, Thomson believes the ICJ\u2019s interpretation could provide persuasive guidance, especially as climate litigation remains relatively new territory.</p><p>\u201cThe Supreme Court has previously cited ICJ rulings when interpreting the Charter. That could happen in the Mathur case this December, or in La Rose, or in any future case holding governments accountable for the climate crisis,\u201d he said.</p><p>Greenpeace International\u2019s legal counsel, Danilo Garrido, clarifies that \"even though the opinion itself isn\u2019t binding, the ICJ found that two core obligations, the duty to prevent significant environmental harm and the duty to cooperate, are customary international law. That means they apply to all states, whether or not they\u2019re part of specific treaties. In practice, that makes this a huge legal win.\"</p><p>At a time when not only the younger generation, but also the world\u2019s highest court is calling for stronger climate action, Doug Ford is taking the country\u2019s most populous province in the wrong direction.\u00a0</p><p>In 2017, Ontario\u2019s electricity grid was 96 percent emissions-free with four percent of the province\u2019s electricity coming from fossil fuels, largely due to the successful phase-out of coal and major investments in renewable energy.\u00a0</p><p>By 2024, that number quadrupled to 16 percent, an IESO report highlighted.</p><p>The result? Emissions rose.</p><p>According to Canada\u2019s national emissions inventory, Ontario emitted 157 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in 2022, a 5.7 percent increase from 2020.</p><p>           The Ford government has set a target of reducing GHG emissions to 144 megatonnes by 2030, but its track record coupled with its latest energy strategy for Ontario, suggests they may fall short of this goal, potentially exposing the province and the country to significant environmental, legal and financial risks following the ICJ decision.\u00a0</p><p>On June 12, the provincial government unveiled \u2018Energy for Generations\u2019, which it touts as \u201cOntario\u2019s first-ever integrated energy plan\u201d, a roadmap designed to meet future energy needs, support housing development, and power what it calls \u201cthe most competitive economy in the G7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the turn of the century, our great grandparents had the vision to build Ontario\u2019s hydroelectric dams, later our grandparents started the build-out of Ontario\u2019s nuclear fleet, and today, that responsibility falls on us to build for the future,\u201d Minister of Energy and Mines Stephen Lecce said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>A key part of the plan is the construction of four small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) at the Darlington Nuclear Station near Oshawa.\u00a0</p><p>The untested, first-of-their-kind BWRX-300 reactors, designed by American-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, will depend on enriched uranium imports from the United States and require a new transmission line stretching from the Pickering or Darlington nuclear plants to supply power to much of Southern Ontario, and are expected to take seven to ten years to build.\u00a0</p><p>And it won\u2019t come cheap.</p><p>The PC government claims the SMR project will cost $20.9 billion, but a new report from the Ontario Clean Air Alliance estimates a far more likely price tag of at least $27 billion.</p><p>\u201cWe are going in the wrong direction,\u201d Ontario Clean Air Alliance chair Jack Gibbons told The Pointer.</p><p>Toronto resident David Smith shared with The Pointer his written submission to the IESO, calling for a shift toward decentralized, community-based energy systems like solar panels, geothermal, microgrids and storage.</p><p>\u201cWhy not Ontario, when wind and solar are well understood, lower cost, cleaner, faster to install, healthier for the population, and what will ultimately be used to replace gas?,\u201d Smith wrote, flagging issues with conflict of interest, particularly with Enbridge running the province\u2019s energy efficiency programs while profiting from gas use.</p><p>Fossil gas is expected to generate a quarter of Ontario\u2019s electricity by 2030, up from just four percent in 2017 under former premier Kathleen Wynne, marking a dramatic shift under Ford\u2019s government that reverses progress made under previous premiers to phase out dirty energy.</p><p>Gibbons notes that instead of importing more high-cost nuclear power, the province should be building a third line to southern Ontario, including downtown Toronto, from a Lake Ontario offshore wind farm.</p><p>But offshore wind isn\u2019t even on the table.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, the Doug Ford government is hostile to renewables, especially offshore wind power, and it's very pro-nuclear power and gas power. And therefore, it doesn't want to develop Lake Ontario wind power, which we need to do to move Ontario to a renewable energy future,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cOffshore wind generation has not been considered as part of the IESO\u2019s regional planning process due to the province\u2019s moratorium on off-shore wind that has been in place since 2011,\u201d the province\u2019s electricity system operator, Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), confirmed in a statement shared with The Pointer.\u00a0</p><p>Gibbons warns nuclear energy comes with significant challenges: it\u2019s slow to deploy, extremely expensive and will drive up electricity bills. In contrast, investing in energy efficiency and renewables would lower costs.\u00a0</p><p>Nuclear also produces toxic radioactive waste that remains hazardous for up to a million years, placing a long-term burden on future generations.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think it makes any sense,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the Ford government is pursuing it because of the very powerful nuclear lobby in Ontario, and that\u2019s the real problem.\u201d</p><p>A 2021 report by the United NationsEconomic Commission for Europe (UNECE) states that international climate goals may not be met without nuclear in the mix.\u00a0</p><p>But like Smith, environmental advocates in Ontario warn of serious drawbacks, both technological and economic.</p><p>Environmental Defence programs director Keith Brooks told The Pointer the Ford government\u2019s pride in building the first small modular reactors (SMRs) in the G7 should raise red flags.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere are no operating SMRs anywhere in the world right now. That means major risk; projects may not be completed on time, they might underperform, and they\u2019re likely to cost far more than expected,\u201d Brooks noted.</p><p>\u201cOntario is doubling, tripling, even quadrupling down on nuclear,\u201d he said, despite a long history of projects coming in over budget and behind schedule. \u201cWe don\u2019t share the government\u2019s enthusiasm. Ontario\u2019s last round of nuclear builds led to billions in stranded debt and the dissolution of Ontario Hydro.\u201d</p><p>The government\u2019s plan assumes that by 2050, 75 percent of Ontario\u2019s electricity will come from nuclear, while the share of renewables like wind and solar is projected to shrink.</p><p>Tucked into Ford\u2019s latest energy blueprint is a spotlight on Brampton\u2019s Emerald Energy from Waste incinerator, where they are experimenting with a hydrogen electrolyzer powered by garbage to \u201cassess how clean hydrogen produced on-site could be used for heavy-duty vehicles or to provide grid services.\u201d</p><p>On paper, it sounds like a glimpse into a cleaner, tech-powered future, but it comes with important caveats.</p><p>First, the plan fails to mention that the company in question has plans to redevelop its incineration system in three phases, replacing the existing facility and building a new one on the same site to increase its capacity from 182,000 to up to 900,000 tonnes per year.</p><p>Second, hydrogen leaks easily and has a strong, often overlooked warming effect. Scientists, including those at the Environmental Defense Fund, warn that its near-term climate impact is much greater than previously understood, making leak prevention vital.</p><p>Currently, hydrogen is mainly used in fertilizer and oil refining. Government investments in hydrogen risk propping up fossil fuel\u2013derived \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen, which relies on natural gas and flawed carbon capture, potentially locking in polluting infrastructure under the guise of clean energy.</p><p>Only green hydrogen, made from water using renewable energy, offers real climate benefits, and even then, it\u2019s best suited for sectors with limited alternatives like steelmaking or long-haul flights. For cars and home heating, clean electricity is usually cheaper and better for the climate.</p><p>On July 22, the United Nations unveiled two new reports signalling that the global shift to renewable energy has crossed a \u201cpositive tipping point.\u201d Solar and wind are now so affordable and scalable that they\u2019re rapidly outpacing fossil fuels, and reshaping the global energy economy.</p><p>\u201cThe fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said during his speech unveiling the reports.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.\u201d</p><p>The data backs him up. In 2024, 74 percent of the growth in global electricity generation came from solar, wind, and other renewables, according to the UN\u2019s multi-agency report Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. Even more striking: 92.5 percent of all new electricity capacity added to the grid globally came from clean energy sources.</p><p>Under the Ford government, renewables are set to scale back from 35 percent to just 25 percent.</p><p>Such provincial decisions are often influenced by federal policy.</p><p>In December 2024, under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, the federal government weakened its own clean electricity regulations. Originally designed to achieve net-zero power grids by 2035, the final rules now allow fossil fuels to remain in electricity generation until as late as 2050. Former environment minister Steven Guilbeault framed the move as a necessary compromise to preserve grid reliability.</p><p>Canada\u2019s overarching climate targets, enshrined in the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, include a 40\u201345 percent emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2030, and net-zero by 2050.\u00a0</p><p>Clean electricity is a cornerstone of that transition.\u00a0</p><p>But with fossil gas now allowed to persist for decades, the urgency of decarbonizing other sectors like transport, buildings, and heavy industry is undermined.</p><p>Parallel to this, the oil and gas sector stands as the country\u2019s largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 31 percent of the national total.\u00a0</p><p>In 2022 alone, the industry emitted 217 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, with the oil sands sub-sector responsible for over a third of that, 12 percent of Canada\u2019s total emissions.\u00a0</p><p>But the climate impact doesn\u2019t stop at Canada\u2019s borders.</p><p>The country exports most of its crude oil and nearly half of its fossil gas, and when these fuels are burned abroad, they release an estimated 939 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, 1.3 times more than Canada emits domestically.</p><p>Despite the outsized global footprint, the industry is still pushing ahead with plans to expand both extraction and exports, raising urgent questions about the future of Canada\u2019s climate leadership and its international responsibilities.</p><p>The ICJ ruling made it clear that countries must ensure their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) collectively meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit.</p><p>But the UNEP\u2019s 15th annual \u201cEmissions Gap\u201d report warns \u00a0Canada is currently not on track to meet its NDCs under existing policies.\u00a0</p><p>Albert Lalonde notes Canada has been failing these obligations both historically and presently, pointing out that aiming for net zero by the IPCC\u2019s global deadline is not leadership, \u201cit\u2019s the bare minimum.\u201d</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:anushka.yadav@thepointer.com\">anushka.yadav@thepointer.com</email></p><p>At a time when vital public information is needed by everyone, The Pointer has taken down our paywall on all stories to ensure every resident of Brampton, Mississauga and Niagara has access to the facts.

The message of the Court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licenses and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of international law.

There are almost daily reports of climate-exacerbated extreme events such as wildfires, floods, extreme winter weather and hurricanes continuing to take lives and destroy property at the cost of billions of dollars. The human-accelerated cause is our greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) - chiefly the extraction and burning of fossil fuels.</p><p>Numerous scientific studies have stressed the need to rapidly reduce our GHG emissions over the next five to 10 years by transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.</p><p>Major transitions such as this are not easy, but we have no choice to maintain a stable climate.</p><p>Fortunately, we have climate leaders we can learn from. A record 47 per cent of the European Union's electricity now comes from solar and other renewables. EU policy aims to make Europe climate neutral by 2050. BloombergNEF reports this trend is also happening on a global scale: \"Almost 91 per cent of global net power capacity additions came from solar and wind in 2023 versus six per cent from fossil fuels.\"</p><p>On the Canadian front, the David Suzuki Foundation's 2022 report, \"Shifting Power: Zero-Emissions Electricity Across Canada by 2035,\" states that \"Reliable, affordable, 100 per cent emissions-free electricity in Canada by 2035 is entirely possible. Not only that, it would create numerous jobs and help Canada meet its international climate obligations.\"</p><p>This transition is not only necessary for our survival; it is also a national opportunity.</p><p>In Waterloo Region, an exciting growth area is that of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs): small-scale clean energy systems that power nearby locations and can be connected to electrical grids.</p><p>For instance, Rockway Mennonite Collegiate in Kitchener recently worked with a local installer and financial institutions to mount 875 rooftop solar panels  that should provide the school with 100 per cent of its future electrical needs.</p><p>Going forward, a December 2024 report from Power Advisory LLC, \"From Small to Mighty: Unlocking DERs to Meet Ontario's Electricity Needs,\" delivers recommendations that the next government will need to act on to build clean energy resources for the future.</p><p>In this election, we must not ignore the climate crisis. We know the disastrous impact of GHG emissions and rapidly increasing global warming. We have the tools to move away from fossil fuels and to accelerate the transition to clean energy.

It highlights the systemic harms caused by current global standards that undervalue the lives of children of color, particularly in the Global South, and seeks binding accountability from corporations perpetuating environmental and social injustices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inequity by Design: Suffering and Injustice is Increasing Exponentially</p><p>It has been normalized that companies and other entities deliberately externalize ethical and legal costs of social and ecological harm as part of a business strategy and model - called \"permissible harm thresholds.\" Companies discount the value of others' lives, rights, or futures when they calculate that externalizing harm is more profitable than internalizing responsibility. This functions as a shadow discount rate - applied not to money, but to the moral and legal weight of harm.</p><p>Litigation risk, reputational damage, or regulatory capture are factored in as acceptable trade-offs. These choices are often guided by assessments of enforceability, public pressure, and regulatory weakness, not actual ethical standards. For example, a vertically integrated dairy conglomerate may not pay for the water pollution it causes, leaving costs to fall on public health systems and local governments. It may not price in the antibiotic resistance its practices accelerate, deferring costs onto future public health infrastructure, and uses subsidies that disadvantage small producers, harming fair market competition. These factors are treated as legal risk mitigation rather than moral failure, shaping business models as much as any Discounted Cash Flow projection.</p><p>A Deliberate, Systemic Moral Failure</p><p>Business models that include \"permissive harm,\" \"discount rates,\" and similar engineered adjustments constitute equity, reparations, and impact fraud. They conceal responsibility for climate and related crises, infant mortality, and the violation of children's fundamental rights - including the systemic devaluation of children of color and the harm done to their life chances and legal protections. Impacted rights can include democratic voting rights or the right to ensure governance derives from empowerment of constituents.</p><p>A New Standard of Legitimacy: Starting at Birth</p><p>The activists argue that the root of systemic injustice lies in what Carter Dillard, a leading FSM voice, terms the \"widely contested standard\" or \"equity fraud\" - a framework that justifies entitlements and government authority without first securing the birthrights of children. Rather than measuring justice from high levels of permissible harm that protect elite interests, FSM proposes an equity-based metric that starts from zero, evaluating the harm inflicted on the most vulnerable - particularly infants and nonhuman animals - from the moment they enter the world.</p><p>\"Legitimacy and equity start with fully measuring the harm,\" says Dillard. \"This is not charity or investment, but reparations. It's about telling the truth from the beginning - from birth.\"</p><p>Exposing Flaws in Power Structures</p><p>The interview highlights how unjust standards are embedded in laws, definitions of fraud, enforcement methods, and misleading cost-benefit analyses - all of which FSM argues are preempted by international law. As Dillard explains in his essay for CounterPunch, global systems often sidestep the real source of power - the act of constituting authority through relational equity at birth. This insight is not just philosophical; it is a practical blueprint for justice that challenges governments, academics, and philanthropists to shift from performative reforms to structural accountability.</p><p>If cost/benefit assessments do not start from zero, elevating infants and animals above the threshold of intergenerational justice, they risk engaging in performative work rather than meaningful change.</p><p>From Charity to Reparations: Empowering Through Birth</p><p>FSM's approach conditions all forms of authority and wealth on measurable empowerment of children at birth. This involves building systems where entitlements are derived not from exploitation, but from ensuring fertility delay, parental readiness, fair resource distribution, and geographic justice. This vision moves beyond traditional social justice models and calls for a transformative restructuring of how legitimacy is defined.</p><p>\"We're not just talking about improving a broken system,\" Dillard notes. \"We're talking about legitimizing the very foundations of society.\" The Fair Start Movement offers a proactive disclosure and compensation framework that places children's sovereignty at the center of national sovereignty.</p><p>Linking Animal Rights, Racial Justice, and Ecological Survival</p><p>FSM insists that true animal liberation and racial justice cannot exist independently. Most activists, they argue, unintentionally perpetuate injustice by working downstream - addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Using flawed standards undermines both animal and human rights and often benefits elites at the expense of those activists claim to protect.</p><p>\"Most animal rights activists didn't choose animals over racial justice,\" the FSM team explains. \"They were misled into serving neither.\" This critique urges advocates to align methods with moral goals, moving beyond token campaigns to build truly equitable systems.</p><p>Taking Action Against Corporate Abuse</p><p>FSM's commitment to action is exemplified in its call for accountability from corporations like Coca-Cola and Fairlife. In response to revelations of cruelty and exploitation, FSM demands that these companies provide transparency about their impacts - not only on animals but on future generations and the climate. As outlined in their public statement, FSM believes that exposing and correcting these abuses is central to building a just and legitimate society.</p><p>This direct advocacy challenges government, philanthropy, and corporate actors to adopt transparent, equitable, and future-focused practices.</p><p>Fair Start: A Tool for Measuring Real Impact</p><p>The Fair Start framework is a tool that allows governments, organizations, and individuals to recalibrate their impact based on whether they measurably empower children as they enter the world. This baseline of equity, FSM argues, is the only way to ensure we're building just systems rather than perpetuating harm under new names.</p><p>\"The act of telling the truth about our starting point - admitting the use of flawed standards - is what legitimates future relations,\" says Dillard. \"Without that, we're just rearranging power for our benefit.\"</p><p>Foundations Must Confront Their Role in Climate Injustice</p><p>FSM also critiques philanthropic foundations for enabling environmental harm under the guise of charity. Many uphold systems of inherited privilege while claiming to support justice and sustainability. By failing to acknowledge their contributions to ecological degradation and intergenerational inequity, they perpetuate climate injustice. Real equity requires redistributing not just wealth but power, beginning by prioritizing future generations and the planet over profit and legacy.</p><p>Foundations are called upon to reevaluate their legitimacy by asking: Are we empowering future generations or simply preserving our influence? Without a true fair start, FSM contends, no philanthropic effort can be sustainable.</p><p>Empowering Children Through Birthright Equity</p><p>FSM's insight into the intersection of climate justice and birthright equity emphasizes rethinking the global standard of freedom and its impact on vulnerable populations. They advocate for empowering individuals from birth, asserting that legitimacy of societal structures should stem from equitable treatment of all children, regardless of race or socio-economic status. The current economic model discounts future lives, perpetuating systemic inequities that benefit the wealthy few at the cost of marginalized groups.</p><p>Addressing these foundational disparities aims to foster a world where individual and political autonomy is recognized and protected from birth.</p><p>Rethinking Birthright Wealth and Systemic Exploitation</p><p>FSM points out that many today's environmental and social issues, including the climate crisis, can be traced back to disregard for the rights of infants and animals. The absence of a rights-based framework centered on birthrights has allowed unchecked exploitation of natural resources and human capital, deeply tied to birthright wealth and privilege.</p><p>FSM urges governments, activists, and philanthropists to adopt a more inclusive, rights-based approach to policy-making, ensuring every child is born with opportunities for self-determination and political empowerment.</p><p>The Fork in the Road: Legitimacy or Collapse</p><p>The conversation concludes with a call to action: one path preserves wealth created through flawed standards, further fueling climate breakdown and social instability; the other reorients that wealth to constitute just, legitimate nations. \"Children should be born as democratic ends, not economic means,\" FSM emphasizes.</p><p>Next Moves: Mobilizing Legal Action for Climate Justice</p><p>Filing a Landmark Petition with the African Commission<br/>Fair Start Movement activists are taking a bold step by filing a pivotal petition with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR).

We had $104.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, bank time deposits, restricted cash, and had $239.2 million in undrawn borrowing capacity available under existing revolving reducing credit facilities. Furthermore, we had contracted revenue of approximately $171.5 million, net of commissions, from our non-cancellable spot and period time charter contracts excluding the Scrubber benefit, and additional borrowing capacity in connection with the financing of one unencumbered vessel and six newbuilds upon their delivery. In relation to capital expenditure requirements of the six newbuilds, the schedule of payments was $9.5 million in 2025, $109.9 million in 2026 and $56.5 million in 2027. The scrap value17 of the fleet was $290.6 million and the outstanding consolidated debt before deferred financing costs was $535.9 million, including the unsecured bond.

The declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will always be subject to the discretion of the Board of the Company. There is no guarantee that the Companys Board will determine to issue cash dividends in the future. The timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on, among other things: (i) the Companys earnings, fleet employment profile, financial condition, cash requirements, and available sources of liquidity; (ii) decisions in relation to the Companys growth, fleet renewal, and leverage strategies; (iii) provisions of Marshall Islands and Liberian law governing the payment of dividends; (iv) restrictive covenants in the Companys existing and future debt instruments; and (v) global economic and financial conditions. War in Ukraine As a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine that commenced in February 2022, the US, the EU, the UK, Switzerland and other countries have announced unprecedented levels of sanctions and other measures against Russia and certain Russian entities and nationals. We intend to comply with these requirements and will address their potential consequences. We do not have any Ukrainian or Russian crews, and our vessels currently do not sail in the Black Sea. While we conduct only limited operations in Russia, we will continue to monitor the situation to assess whether the conflict could have any impact on our operations or financial performance. Trade disruption in the Red Sea and conflicts in the Middle East Due to the attacks on merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea, there has been a disruption in the maritime trade and supply chains through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal. Since the beginning of this disruption, we have diverted our fleet from sailing in the Red Sea region. The conflicts in the Middle East represent additional geopolitical and economic risks that could increase the volatility of the global economy. While our vessels currently do not sail in the Red Sea, we will continue to monitor the situation to assess the potential impact on our operations.

Management Discussion of Second Quarter 2025 Results During the second quarter of 2025, we operated in a weaker charter market environment compared to the same period in 2024, with decreased revenues due to lower charter hires, decreased earnings from scrubber-fitted vessels and increased operating expenses. During the second quarter of 2025, we operated 46.75 vessels on average, earning an average TCE of $14,857 compared to 45.43 vessels earning an average TCE of $18,650 during the same period in 2024. The Company's net income for the second quarter of 2025 was $1.7 million, down from $27.6 million during the same period in 2024. The main factors driving the change in net income are as follows: Net revenues: Net revenues decreased by 16% to $65.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $78.5 million for the same period in 2024. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues from charter hires and decreased revenues earned by our scrubber-fitted vessels. Vessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses increased by 9% to $28.1 million for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $25.9 million for the same period in 2024. The increase was mainly due to the following factors: (i) higher costs for spare parts, stores, and provisions, which rose to $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2025, from $5.0 million for the same period in 2024 as a result of the increased average number of vessels operating during the second quarter of 2025 and the increased supplies during the second quarter of 2025 for completed and upcoming dry-dockings; (ii) increased crew wages and expenses which grew to $10.9 million for the second quarter of 2025, from $10.1 million for the same period in 2024, mainly due to the increased average number of vessels operating during the second quarter of 2025; and (iii) higher repair and maintenance expenses, which increased to $6.9 million from $7.1 million for the same period in 2024 as a result of the increased average number of vessels operating during the second quarter of 2025. The Company expenses dry-docking and pre-delivery costs as incurred, which vary from period to period. Excluding dry-docking costs and pre-delivery expenses of $4.3 million and $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively, vessel operating expenses increased by 13% to $23.8 million during the second quarter of 2025 from $21.1 million during the same period of 2024. Dry-docking expenses are related to the number of dry-dockings in each period while pre-delivery expenses are related to the number of newbuild deliveries and second-hand acquisitions in each period. Some shipping companies may defer and amortize dry-docking expenses, while many do not include dry-docking expenses within vessel operating expenses but present these separately. Depreciation: Depreciation expenses increased by $1.0 million or 7% to $15.1 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $14.1 million for the same period in 2024, due to the delivery of newbuild vessels in 2025 and 2024 and the sale of older vessels in 2024. Foreign currency gain/(loss): Foreign currency loss amounted to $6.9 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to a gain of $0.5 million for the same period in 2024, due to the unrealized loss on the valuation of the 100 million bond. Gain/(Loss) on derivatives: Gain on derivatives amounted to $5.7 million for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2024, due to unrealized gain on foreign currency agreements. Voyage expenses: Voyage expenses increased to $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2025, from $4.1 million for the same period in 2024 mainly due to increased bunker consumption costs for scrubber fitted vessels under charter agreements, which provide for variable consideration based on the bunker consumption. Gain on sale of assets: No vessels were sold during the second quarter of 2025. Gain on sale of assets for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to $6.6 million, as a result of a gain from the sale of the Maritsa and the Panayiota K. Interest expense: Interest expense increased to $7.8 million in the second quarter of 2025 from $7.6 million for the same period in 2024, as the net result of the increased weighted average loan outstanding of $549.8 million during the second quarter of 2025, compared to $499.9 million for the same period in 2024 and the decreased weighted average interest rate of 5.69% during the second quarter of 2025, compared to 6.43% for the same period in 2024, affected by the lower USD rates environment. Daily vessel operating expenses17: Daily vessel operating expenses, calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by the ownership days of the relevant period, increased by 6% to $6,607 for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $6,254 for the same period in 2024. Daily vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and predelivery expenses increased by 10% to $5,604 for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $5,089 for the same period in 2024. Daily general and administrative expenses17: Daily general and administrative expenses, which include management fees payable to our Managers and daily company administration expenses, increased by 13% to $1,809 for the second quarter of 2025, compared to $1,595 for the same period in 2024, due to the increase in the management fees payable to our Managers and the effect of the appreciation of the EUR versus the USD. 17 See table 4 //st Unaudited Interim Financial Information and Other Data SAFE BULKERS, INC.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. The Company believes that including these supplemental financial measures assists our management and investors in: (i) understanding and analyzing the results of our operating and business performance; (ii) selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives; and (iii) monitoring our financial and operational performance in assessing whether to continue investing in us. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income and Adjusted earnings per share are useful in evaluating the Companys operating performance from period to period because the calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financings, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital expenditures and acquisitions, the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income/(loss) generally further eliminates from EBITDA and Net Income/(loss) respectively the effects from impairment and loss on vessels held for sale, gain/(loss) on sale of assets, gain/(loss) on derivatives, early redelivery income/(cost), other operating expenses and gain/(loss) on foreign currency, items which may vary from year to year and for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the Companys results as reported under US GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share are frequently used as measures of operating results and performance, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net income/(loss) and Adjusted earnings/(loss) per share should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the excluded items. //st TABLE 4: FLEET DATA, AVERAGE DAILY INDICATORS RECONCILIATION</p><p>Three-Month Period Ended Six-Month Period Ended</p><p>June 30, June 30,</p><p>2024 2025 2024 2025 FLEET DATA Number of vessels at period end 45 47 45 47 Average age of fleet (in years) 9.99 10.26 9.99 10.26 Ownership days(1) 4,134 4,254 8,418 8,394 Available days(2) 3,991 4,133 8,221 8,236 Average number of vessels in the period(3) 45.43 46.75 46.25 46.38 AVERAGE DAILY RESULTS Time charter equivalent rate(4) $ 18,650 $ 14,857 $ 18,397 $ 14,756 Daily vessel operating expenses(5) $ 6,254 $ 6,607 $ 5,840 $ 6,192 Daily vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and pre-delivery expenses(6) $ 5,089 $ 5,604 $ 5,063 $ 5,575 Daily general and administrative expenses(7) $ 1,595 $ 1,809 $ 1,553 $ 1,710 TIME CHARTER EQUIVALENT RATE RECONCILIATION (In thousands of U.S. Dollars except for available days and Time charter equivalent rate) Revenues $ 81,947 $ 68,689 $ 166,922 $ 135,904 Less commissions (3,399) (2,944) (6,705) (5,811) Less voyage expenses (4,115) (4,342) (8,975) (8,561) Time charter equivalent revenue $ 74,433 $ 61,403 $ 151,242 $ 121,532 Available days(2) 3,991 4,133 8,221 8,236 Time charter equivalent rate(4) $ 18,650 $ 14,857 $ 18,397 $ 14,756 _____________ (1) Ownership days represent the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. (2) Available days represent the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession, net of off-hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which includes major repairs, dry-dockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. (3) Average number of vessels in the period is calculated by dividing ownership days in the period by the number of days in that period. (4) Time charter equivalent rate, or TCE rate, represents our charter revenues less commissions and voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of available days during such period. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on period time charters and spot time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts, while charter rates for vessels on period time charters and spot time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. We have only rarely employed our vessels on voyage charters and, as a result, generally our TCE rates approximate our time charter rates. (5) Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period. Vessel operating expenses include crewing, insurance, lubricants, spare parts, provisions, stores, repairs, maintenance including dry-docking, statutory and classification expenses and other miscellaneous items. (6) Daily vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and pre-delivery expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses excluding dry-docking and pre-delivery expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period. Dry-docking expenses include costs of shipyard, paints and agent expenses and pre-delivery expenses include initially supplied spare parts, stores, provisions and other miscellaneous items provided to a newbuild acquisition prior to their operation. (7) Daily general and administrative expenses are calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses for the relevant period by ownership days for such period. Daily general and administrative expenses include daily management fees payable to our Managers and daily company administration expenses. //st Table 5: Detailed fleet and employment profile as ofJuly 18, 2025 Vessel Name Dwt Year Country of Charter Charter Commissions3 Charter Period4</p><p>Built1 Construction Type Rate2 CURRENT FLEET Panamax Zoe11 75,000 2013 Japan Period $ 13,000 5.00 % April 2025 February 2026 Koulitsa 2 78,100 2013 Japan Period $ 13,000 5.00 % May 2025 October 2025 Kypros Land11 77,100 2014 Japan Period13 $ 13,800 3.75 % August 2020 August 2022</p><p>BPI 82 5TC * 97% -

Yet, housing for migrant agricultural workers in Canada is often overcrowded, dangerous and undignified. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid government inaction, our group of 29 researchers, clinicians and advocates with the Coalition for National Housing Standards for Migrant Agricultural Workers (CoNaMi), have developed a proposal for national housing standards. This work is backed by clinical experience, hundreds of interviews and surveys and migrant agricultural workers' own advocacy.</p><p>Inadequate housing</p><p>When two of us - Anelyse and Susana - interviewed 151 migrants in Ontario and British Columbia as part of our research, workers described conditions of isolation, crowding, inadequate ventilation, poor maintenance and proximity to hazards such as agrochemicals. </p><p>Both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers struggled to access health care, groceries and social services. In addition, their phone and internet access was often unreliable. </p><p>Some workers reported employer-imposed restrictions on leaving the property, and bans on visitors. These living conditions pose serious risks to workers.</p><p>Similarly to research led by the Centre for Climate Justice in British Columbia, we also encountered several workers who endured significant hardships as a result of extreme weather events. </p><p>Consistent with recent research in Nova Scotia, we found that a lack of meaningful union representation, precarious status and low wages created coercive conditions in which workers felt forced to accept poor living conditions. </p><p>Marginalization </p><p>and exploitation</p><p>As migrant workers typically live on the farms where they work, the lines between work and home can be blurred. This living arrangement often contributes to isolation and surveillance by employers. It may also enable harassment and abuse. </p><p>Furthermore, migrants are geographically separated from their families for months or years at a time. Research that Adam has conducted in Atlantic Canada and Ontario, Jill in Qu\u00e9bec and Susana in Ontario and British Columbia, outlines how poor housing conditions not only threaten workers' health and well-being, but also contribute to their marginalization and exploitation. </p><p>Workers often describe feeling demeaned and controlled, and they wonder why Canada, a country so willing to accept their labour, is so reluctant to accept their common humanity. </p><p>In 2024, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery has described Canada's temporary foreign worker program, accessed by migrant agricultural workers to come to Canada, as \"a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery,\" a statement echoed by international human rights watchdog Amnesty International.</p><p>Yet the federal government has failed to meaningfully improve housing conditions or establish clear, enforceable and mandatory standards. This inaction persists despite years of reviews, consultations and recommendations. </p><p>In fact, a study commissioned by the federal government to review the possibility of a national housing standard for migrant agricultural workers in 2018 called for greater consistency in housing quality assessments. </p><p>Academic experts have long called for a national housing standard, as well as proactive and unannounced housing inspections. Other professional and labour organizations have identified the need for greater interjurisdictional co-ordination and attention to issues of safety, pandemic preparedness, privacy and dignity. </p><p>Furthermore, safeguarding housing quality requires policy changes that provide meaningful status and adequate collective bargaining representation to migrant workers, as these conditions underlie their vulnerability in housing. </p><p>In the 2020 Auditor General of Canada report, the need for national minimum accommodation requirements for migrant agricultural workers was identified. However, housing remains a key concern for these workers who have not yet benefited from such proposed recommendations.</p><p>National housing standard</p><p>A national housing standard for migrant agricultural workers is a crucial step toward protecting their rights and mitigating their vulnerability. These standards must include:</p><p>Appropriate and enforced housing standards Ensure robust and proactive enforcement of housing standard. Living quarters must be well-constructed, safe and dignified.</p><p>Privacy, security, access and freedom Guarantee workers' rights to privacy, movement, access to health and social services and freedom from surveillance. Workers must have access to transportation and be able to enjoy rest, leisure and a social life. </p><p>Dignified living conditions Safeguard basic rights to comfort, storage and personal care by prescribing minimum standards and ratios for private bedrooms, common areas, laundry and cooking facilities. Workers should have private bedrooms and reliable internet access.</p><p>Health and safety in housing Protect workers from the spread of illness, extreme weather events and other hazards through proper air conditioning, ventilation and reduced occupancy ratios for bathrooms and kitchens.</p><p>Co-ordinated government leadership Prevent different jurisdictions passing the buck by mandating co-ordination, data-sharing and training among federal, provincial and municipal governments. For example, inspectors should be trauma-informed and armed with strategies to mitigate implicit bias and to anticipate barriers this group faces because of their precarious status. The federal government must lead with adequate funding and policy reform to address barriers that prevent workers from advocating for decent housing. </p><p>The evidence is clear. Canadian governments must raise the bar from the floor, and create national standards for migrant agricultural workers' housing.</p><p>C.

Ramping up energy investment, deploying continuous finance and advancing energy projects represent Africa's core priorities, as 600 million Africans lack access to reliable power and 900 million Africans lack access to clean cooking fuels. Projects like the TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG development and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline seek to maximize Africa's resources for the benefit of local communities. In West Africa, developments such as Perenco's Cap Lopez LNG Terminal and associated LPG facility, the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline and the Eni-led Congo LNG project will catalyze long-term economic growth and energy resilience, with natural gas, LNG and LPG set to play a critical role in the continent's energy poverty reduction strategy. The Southern African region is only just starting to realize the full potential of its oil and gas resources, with recent discoveries made in Zimbabwe's Cabora Bassa Basin by Invictus Energy and Namibia's prolific Orange Basin by Shell, TotalEnergies and Galp. Namibia is also home to the development of sub-Saharan Africa's largest green hydrogen project led by Hyphen Hydrogen Energy, while Mauritania is pioneering green hydrogen through Chariot's Project Nour and CWP Global's AMAN Project, coupled with expanded gas development from the bp-operated Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG project.</p><p>Despite Africa's unmet energy requirements, global energy lending has only tightened, as major European and other Western banks exit the fossil fuels industry in Africa, while financing fossil fuels in Western countries. These institutions have not been equitable when it comes to facilitating adequate energy and climate finance for African countries, where local populations are disproportionately affected by both climate risks and restrictions on fossil fuel development. Europe has made repeated calls for natural gas and green finance, yet there is a considerable blockage on energy finance for African countries. This chokehold continues to inhibit Africa's industrial growth and the establishment of critical gas-driven industries like power, petrochemicals, fertilizers and mining, keeping the continent at a developmental lag.</p><p>We Africans deplore the continuous polarization of the energy dialogue in Western countries and call on the demonization of African oil and gas to stop. We urge free market solutions to Africa, and not a continuous push for aid so that Africans pledge to leave their resources in the ground. More aid is not the answer. Investment is key. From Cape to Cairo, from Nairobi to Dakar, we stand united toward meeting our shared obligations to fight climate change, noting that wealthy nations need to decarbonize and Africa needs to industrialize.</p><p>It is the position of African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector that African countries must diversify available pools of capital and create financial instruments outside of traditional institutions - tapping into private equity and non-conventional bonds - to fund new exploration and energy initiatives. Moreover, African countries must put in place attractive regulatory and fiscal terms, thereby creating an enabling environment and removing all barriers to investment, such as incohesive regulation, excessive red tape or nationalistic policies. With competitive terms and incentives in place - followed by the integration of ESG principles and capacity building requirements - African energy projects will be able to compete effectively for global capital and work toward making energy poverty history across the continent.</p><p>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.</p><p>Download image: <url normalizedValue=\"https://apo-opa.co\">https://apo-opa.co</url> /4bI9Yyk</p><p>SOURCE: African Energy Chamber</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/865501/africa-paris-declaration-on-energy-transition-climate-justice-and-energy-poverty\">press release</url> on accesswire.com</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["The declaration aligns Africa's position on the global energy transition and climate justice debate, following the conclusion of the Invest in African Energy forum in ParisJOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA / ACCESSWIRE / May 20, 2024 / African civil society, human rights groups, environmental groups, governments and the private sector stand firm in their commitment to align Africa's efforts in combating energy poverty and fostering industrialization, all while advocating for a just energy transition and ensuring climate justice.

How well is CARE doing this in areas vulnerable to climate change?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 16, 2024 / CARE</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Figure 1: CARE is making an impact in most highly climate vulnerable countries but there are opportunities to better integrate gender-resilience-climate.</p><p>Background</p><p>CARE empowers poor and marginalized people to take action on the climate crisis and to build knowledge for global change. We know that climate change affects poor and marginalized people the most. Extinction means that people who rely on biodiversity for survival can no longer produce food. Extreme weather events destroy the shelters and homes of people who don't have insurance or savings to rebuild. Women and girls face higher rates of sexual and economic abuse as their families face economic hardship.</p><p>CARE's recent study with the Southern African Resilience Academy (SARA) and partners showed that food and livelihood programs need to integrate gender transformative approaches, climate adaptation, and resilience building, as well as systems strengthening, to support inclusive and sustained growth in communities vulnerable to climate change, conflict, and poverty. So, 3 years into our CARE's Vision 2030 strategy, CARE examined how well we are integrating these factors - especially in geographic areas most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Triangulating data for research-inspired analysis</p><p>We triangulated data from the three sources below, and based our analysis on the research findings and context:</p><p>1. CARE impact data. CARE's Program Information and Impact Reporting System (PIIRS) records impact from every project implemented by CARE and/or partners, measured through indicators that correspond to SDGs and CARE's Vision 2030 strategy. We analyzed impact data on livelihood recovery in humanitarian emergencies, food security, and climate resilience and adaptive capacities.</p><p>2. CARE program quality (PQ) data. We assessed the percent of programs that met minimum CARE PQ standards for gender, resilience building, and climate adaptation.</p><p>3. Climate vulnerability scores from the University of Notre Dame's Global Adaption Initiative (ND-GAIN) Country Index. This tool ranks countries based on their climate vulnerability and readiness to implement climate adaption solutions.</p><p>For the countries that we have a presence in, we plotted each country's impact (from our identified relevant indicators) against the percent of projects that met the minimum PQ standards (for our identified relevant standards) in each country. This showed where our programming was impactful and tested our research finding that integration leads to higher impact. To go even deeper, we then looked at this relationship among the countries that have the highest ND-GAIN index climate vulnerability score, among countries that CARE has a presence in (Figure 1). We further used historical internal program data to examine these relationships and came to two major conclusions.</p><p>Our findings</p><p>Among countries that CARE works in, CARE is making an impact in some of the most highly climate vulnerable countries (Somalia, Chad, Niger, etc.) but there are opportunities to better integrate gender, resilience, and climate in these locations. Countries where we have higher integration and more reported impact tend to be countries like Ethiopia (not shown), Niger, Uganda, and Zimbabwe (not shown) where climate vulnerability capacity analyses (CVCA) have been applied for several years, where locally led adaptation approaches have been applied, and which have established and sustained institutional funding - in line with the conclusion from the SARA research that integration leads to impact and quality programming.</p><p>Some countries highly vulnerable to climate change report no impact (Sierra Leone, Burundi, Sudan, Tonga) but that does not mean we are not doing important work there. Impact is measured in the long-term and often after a project is completed, so while this finding shows areas to ramp up programming, which we know how to do from the research findings, it also flags places where we are already working and should be prepared to measure impact later on.</p><p>Action resulting from the combination of analysis and research insights</p><p>This analysis is a prime example of using triangulation of data from various sources in combination with research-based evidence to inform programming.</p><p>As an organization, CARE is continuing to leverage our existing technical capacity in climate justice programming in Asia and MENA - regions that face climate vulnerability.</p><p>As a research community, we should continue to openly share data and methods to allow for analysis such as these. Additionally, we should share evidence-based research like the SARA paper, to inspire analysis and programs. We can also continue to embed gender in our research by assessing how gender affects outcomes such as climate vulnerability and readiness, and being critical of sources that do not include gender in analysis.</p><p>As a global community, we can deepen our investment in gender transformative approaches and climate adaptation for systems transformation. This analysis highlights the positive relationship between integrating gender, resilience and climate and impact, and shows that community-led approaches and strong institutional funding make for a bigger impact.

A lack of practical alternatives is forcing many developing nations to build refineries and coal mines while some developed countries are trying to get rid of them. They need help to catch up, to avoid worsening the problems that wealthier neighbours have already inflicted on the planet. </p><p>Help could come in the form of climate finance and technology transfer. At COP15 in 2009, developed countries pledged US$100 billion annually by 2020 to support climate action in developing nations. The commitment was achieved two years late in 2022.</p><p>Building a truly healthy planet requires a forward-looking approach to climate action which looks past short-term solutions. However, we must also recognize that while all states are responsible for addressing global environmental destruction, not all are equally responsible. </p><p>To achieve consensus on climate action, we must address underlying inequities. We must recognize that we can no longer deny poorer countries the right to have equal voices in setting the forward-looking plans which need to be made in the coming years. Put simply, we must reassert the value of fairness.</p><p>Going beyond current initiatives</p><p>Climate justice requires a commitment to the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, ensuring that the costs and benefits of climate action are shared fairly. In other words, climate justice must be integrated into all aspects of the global political economy, including development financing, technology transfer and international trade policies.</p><p>Existing initiatives such as the Green Climate Fund, climate adaptation and resilience initiatives and the UN\u2019s Loss and Damage Mechanism under the Climate Change Framework Convention do provide important frameworks for climate justice. </p><p>However, these programs alone are not sufficient to address climate injustice. We need to do much more, and that will take more buy-in and greater investment from the world\u2019s wealthier countries. </p><p>Global investments in climate justice must extend beyond existing frameworks. Our efforts should encompass reforms to international trade and global governance to ensure greater equity and fairer representation for all peoples.</p><p>Enlightened self-interest</p><p>It doesn\u2019t take an expert in political science to predict that when asked to pay most countries will become mired in politics and inaction. In that case, the most practical, substantial motivation to act may lie in enlightened self-interest. </p><p>As experts had predicted, weather catastrophes are directly and indirectly creating growing numbers of climate refugees, driving more displaced people from the Global South to seek safety and prosperity in Europe and North America, straining resources, fueling xenophobia and driving politicians to close borders.</p><p>By helping countries in the Global South to address their climate-driven crises, developed countries would help people remain in their homes and instead of having to seek refuge in the Global North. That cynical calculus may finally be what drives the change necessary to address climate issues around the world.</p><p>At this point, the source of the motivation matters much less than motivation itself. Only quick, significant and inclusive action can help save what is not already doomed.</p><p>COP29 is set to be all about finance as discussions will largely focus on increasing funding to help lower-income countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted at the opening of COP29, climate finance is not charity, it\u2019s an investment in the collective well-being of all humanity. </p><p>These deliberations offer a renewed opportunity to prioritize climate justice by reinforcing financing for mitigation and adaptation strategies rooted in equity and fairness.</p><p>___</p><p>Bonny Ibhawoh receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

While the United Nations climate conferences, known as Conferences of the Parties (COP) have made strides in international climate policy, their efforts to address climate justice remain contentious and widely considered inadequate. I am a legal historian and scholar of human rights currently involved in an ongoing UN-led research project which seeks to identity the challenges and good practices necessary for developing processes and systems to address climate injustice. As part of that work, I am currently in Azerbaijan to discuss my preliminary findings with a range of stakeholders at COP29. This year\u2019s COP29 represents a critical moment to centre climate justice at the heart of the global effort against climate change. Climate (in)justiceThe concept of climate justice is rooted in the knowledge that the impacts of climate change are unevenly distributed across the globe. It emphasizes the ethical responsibility of those who have reaped the most benefits from carbon-intensive development to reduce their emissions and assist those who are most affected by climate change.

They need help to catch up, to avoid worsening the problems that wealthier neighbours have already inflicted on the planet.", "Building a truly healthy planet requires a forward-looking approach to climate action which looks past short-term solutions. However, we must also recognize that while all states are responsible for addressing global environmental destruction, not all are equally responsible. To achieve consensus on climate action, we must address underlying inequities. We must recognize that we can no longer deny poorer countries the right to have equal voices in setting the forward-looking plans which need to be made in the coming years. Put simply, we must reassert the value of fairness. Going beyond current initiativesClimate justice requires a commitment to the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, ensuring that the costs and benefits of climate action are shared fairly. In other words, climate justice must be integrated into all aspects of the global political economy, including development financing, technology transfer and international trade policies. Existing initiatives such as the Green Climate Fund, climate adaptation and resilience initiatives and the UN\u2019s Loss and Damage Mechanism under the Climate Change Framework Convention do provide important frameworks for climate justice. However, these programs alone are not sufficient to address climate injustice.

In that case, the most practical, substantial motivation to act may lie in enlightened self-interest. As experts had predicted, weather catastrophes are directly and indirectly creating growing numbers of climate refugees, driving more displaced people from the Global South to seek safety and prosperity in Europe and North America, straining resources, fueling xenophobia and driving politicians to close borders. By helping countries in the Global South to address their climate-driven crises, developed countries would help people remain in their homes and instead of having to seek refuge in the Global North.", "That cynical calculus may finally be what drives the change necessary to address climate issues around the world. At this point, the source of the motivation matters much less than motivation itself. Only quick, significant and inclusive action can help save what is not already doomed. COP29 is set to be all about finance as discussions will largely focus on increasing funding to help lower-income countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres noted at the opening of COP29, climate finance is not charity, it\u2019s an investment in the collective well-being of all humanity. These deliberations offer a renewed opportunity to prioritize climate justice by reinforcing financing for mitigation and adaptation strategies rooted in equity and fairness. ___Bonny Ibhawoh receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

CCL-Canada's national manager, Cathy Orlando, arranged the venue, and MPs from all political parties, CCLers and others participated.</p><p>Participants first stood in a circle holding a rope. Morin, Brown, and other helpers, such as teenage climate activist Sophia Mathur, wove other ropes within the circle to create a giant dreamcatcher. It sounds simple, but I found that, as the dreamcatcher took shape, it was a profoundly moving illustration of the interconnectedness of all things.</p><p>As I understood him, during the event, Will Morin said that we need to return to Indigenous knowledge to heal what is damaging the Earth.</p><p>My interpretation of this is that we need to return to equal sharing, which was and is a nearly universal practice among hunter-gatherers everywhere \u2013 and we are all descended from hunter-gatherers. When a group of hunters returned to the camp with a kill, someone (usually not one of the hunters) would divide up the meat so that everyone present got an equal share. It was a simple but elegant form of mutual aid, life insurance, and environmental protection because it minimized the waste of resources.</p><p>When Champlain first came to what is now Canada, he reported that the Montagnais, who lived a pure hunter-gatherer existence, occasionally starved to death. He tried to persuade them to take up agriculture. The Montagnais refused, saying, as I recall, that they had only \"pity and contempt\" for those who farmed.</p><p>Why did they feel that way? I suspect that at least part of it was because they knew that agriculture would mean the mechanism of equal sharing would break down.</p><p>Citizens Climate Lobby's main focus is carbon fee-and-dividend, which means charging a fee on fossil fuels, similar to a carbon tax, and then distributing the proceeds to everyone as equal dividends, similar to a universal basic income \u2013 and equal sharing.</p><p>Senior government officials have told members of CCL-Canada that we played an important role in bringing about Canada's carbon tax with rebate program. Unfortunately, the government only partially adopted carbon fee-and-dividend, and some members feel that the problems the carbon tax program now faces are a result.</p><p>Canada's carbon tax is not universal, meaning it is a patchwork quilt across the country. Only retail fossil fuels are taxed, while big industry has its own complicated and inefficient program, making the rebates smaller for everyone. Most importantly, until recently, the government hid the rebates so that most Canadians who got them did not know they were receiving them.</p><p>CCL-Canada's 2024 national conference will be held in Ottawa from June 1 to 4. Will Morin will be there again and plans to build an even bigger dreamcatcher. I sincerely hope that, while we are doing that, we can also fix the shortcomings in Canada's carbon tax with rebates program so that it benefits all Canadians and can lead to the global carbon fee-and-dividend that we need to control climate change.</p><p>Keith McNeill</p><p>Clearwater, B.C.</p><p>Copyright 2024 Clearwater Times</p>", "publisher": "Clearwater Times (N.
