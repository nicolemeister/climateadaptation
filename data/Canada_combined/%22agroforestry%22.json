Mitti Labs is pioneering a tech-driven approach to decarbonize rice production and reward regenerative practices.</p><p>Supported by the Regenerative Future Fund, an impact-first venture fund, Mitti Labs' AI-powered digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) platform combines satellite and sensor data with field support to help farmers adopt Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD reduces methane and water use by up to 40% while maintaining or increasing yields. According to Mitti Labs, here are a few ways they are gaining traction:</p><p>- Field results are compelling: In Telangana's Warangal, AWD cut water use by 37% while maintaining yields. In Haryana's Safidon, AWD reduced water by 19% with no yield loss. These results mean lower methane emissions, improved water conservation, and new income streams for thousands of climate-vulnerable farmers.<br/>- Marketplace leadership: Partnering with Carbon Place, Good Carbon, Ceezer, and Cloverly, Mitti Labs enables secure purchases of methane-based carbon credits for buyers globally that would like to support avoidance efforts. Its entire 2025 offset supply is fully allocated, with more set for 2026 and 2027.<br/>- Global recognition: Sylvera, a carbon ratings agency, called Mitti Labs a \"key enabler\" of methane reduction in rice (Sylvera, 2024).</p><p>As Madhuri, a Mitti Labs Field Manager in Warangal, shares, \"It is encouraging to see more and more farmers understanding our AWD programs and coming forward to join our movement.\" Community leaders echo the impact: \"One in every four farmers in Warangal is now participating.\"</p><p>Since 2023, Mitti Labs has onboarded 30,000 farmers, expanded digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) capabilities to 10 million hectares, and launched projects with partners like Syngenta Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. Their pipeline spans India and Southeast Asia, targeting 200,000+ farmers and over one million carbon avoidance credits per year. With tech and new markets, Mitti Labs is shaping the future of rice decarbonization.</p><p>Digital Green: AI for Climate-Resilient, Regenerative Farming</p><p>Digital Green is transforming agricultural advisory services for smallholder farmers through its AI-powered assistant, Farmer.Chat.

Mitti Labs is pioneering a tech-driven approach to decarbonize rice production and reward regenerative practices.</p><p>Supported by the Regenerative Future Fund, an impact-first venture fund, Mitti Labs' AI-powered digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) platform combines satellite and sensor data with field support to help farmers adopt Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD reduces methane and water use by up to 40% while maintaining or increasing yields. According to Mitti Labs, here are a few ways they are gaining traction: //st * Field results are compelling: In Telangana's Warangal, AWD cut water use by 37% while maintaining yields. In Haryana's Safidon, AWD reduced water by 19% with no yield loss. These results mean lower methane emissions, improved water conservation, and new income streams for thousands of climate-vulnerable farmers. * Marketplace leadership: Partnering with Carbon Place, Good Carbon, Ceezer, and Cloverly, Mitti Labs enables secure purchases of methane-based carbon credits for buyers globally that would like to support avoidance efforts. Its entire 2025 offset supply is fully allocated, with more set for 2026 and 2027. * Global recognition: Sylvera, a carbon ratings agency, called Mitti Labs a \"key enabler\" of methane reduction in rice (Sylvera, 2024).</p><p>As Madhuri, a Mitti Labs Field Manager in Warangal, shares, \"It is encouraging to see more and more farmers understanding our AWD programs and coming forward to join our movement.\" Community leaders echo the impact: \"One in every four farmers in Warangal is now participating.\"</p><p>Since 2023, Mitti Labs has onboarded 30,000 farmers, expanded digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) capabilities to 10 million hectares, and launched projects with partners like Syngenta Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. Their pipeline spans India and Southeast Asia, targeting 200,000+ farmers and over one million carbon avoidance credits per year. With tech and new markets, Mitti Labs is shaping the future of rice decarbonization.</p><p>Digital Green: AI for Climate-Resilient, Regenerative Farming</p><p>Digital Green is transforming agricultural advisory services for smallholder farmers through its AI-powered assistant, Farmer.Chat.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.</p><p>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.</p><p>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY</p><p>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.</p><p>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.</p><p>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO 2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway. (1)(2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.</p><p>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.</p><p>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.</p><p>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.</p><p>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.</p><p>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)</p><p>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON</p><p>At Mondele\u0304z International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.</p><p>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.</p><p>Completeness &amp; Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)</p><p>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.</p><p>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondele\u0304z International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.</p><p>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.</p><p>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO 2e emissions in base year 2018). (1)</p><p>CLIMATE RISKS &amp; RESILIENT COMMUNITIES</p><p>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.</p><p>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.</p><p>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.</p><p>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.</p><p>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.</p><p>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.</p><p>For more details please read our Annual Report</p><p>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION</p><p>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :</p><p>- Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights <br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/>- Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights PolicyOur goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondele\u0304z International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/>- Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.</p><p>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS</p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS &amp; INGREDIENT SOURCING</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA</p><p>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.</p><p>- Read more about our deforestation position on our website</p><p>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.</p><p>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.</p><p>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests</p><p>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.</p><p>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices. (4)</p><p>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms. (29)</p><p>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry</p><p>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).</p><p>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:</p><p>- Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/>- Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/>- Biodiversity preservation.<br/>- Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/>- Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.</p><p>We launched the carbon booster project in Co\u0302te d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nin\u0303o in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.</p><p>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.</p><p>Understanding Our Impact on Forests</p><p>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.</p><p>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Co\u0302te d'Ivoire and Nigeria.</p><p>Overall results in West Africa (Co\u0302te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms .(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Co\u0302te d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.</p><p>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact</p><p>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.</p><p>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes</p><p>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.</p><p>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY</p><p>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk , Milka and Philadelphia , and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO 2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.</p><p>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs</p><p>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO 2e emissions from baselines that Mondele\u0304z International began establishing in 2018.</p><p>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.</p><p>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.</p><p>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO 2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.</p><p>Australia on Its Way</p><p>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 Mondele\u0304zAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.</p><p>Emerging Technologies &amp; Innovations in Dairy</p><p>Our Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.</p><p>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation &amp; Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.</p><p>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.</p><p>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector</p><p>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.</p><p>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.</p><p>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL</p><p>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.</p><p>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.</p><p>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT</p><p>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.</p><p>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:</p><p>- Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/>- Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/>- Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/>- Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.</p><p>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.</p><p>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact</p><p>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.</p><p>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.</p><p>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.</p><p>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.</p><p>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.</p><p>MANUFACTURING</p><p>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023. (5)</p><p>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.</p><p>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS</p><p>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO 2e emissions. (1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.</p><p>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.</p><p>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.</p><p>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.</p><p>PACKAGING</p><p>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.</p><p>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.</p><p>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS</p><p>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.</p><p>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO 2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.</p><p>INNOVATION</p><p>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:</p><p>- Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/>- Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondele\u0304z International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/>- Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet<br/>our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/>- Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/>- EcoDesign Development: R&amp;D colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/>- Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.</p><p>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM</p><p>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials. (1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.</p><p>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.</p><p>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1)</p><p>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.</p><p>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa. (1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.</p><p>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. </p><p>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch. CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050. We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy. In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO 2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway. (1)(2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites. For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities. For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments. We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF. We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.) STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions. To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging. Completeness &amp;Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1) To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures. We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation. Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions. Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO 2e emissions in base year 2018). (1) CLIMATE RISKS &amp;RESILIENT COMMUNITIES Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain. Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches. We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis. The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to )4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics. The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements. We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures. For more details please read our Annual Report STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies : //st 1. Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations. 2. Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025 Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach. Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level. Our full deforestation position is available on our website. 3. Increasing regenerative agricultural practices To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders. ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS &amp;INGREDIENT SOURCING RAW MATERIALS - COCOA We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa. //st * Read more about our deforestation position on our website We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative. Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues. Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms. Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices. (4) We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms. (29) Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia). Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services: //st * Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood. * Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility). * Biodiversity preservation. * Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot). * Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events. We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality. We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring. Understanding Our Impact on Forests We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests. In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms .(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate. Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program. In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors. Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana. As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes. RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk , Milka and Philadelphia , and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO 2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year. Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO 2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018. Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain. In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1. In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO 2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions. Australia on Its Way Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term. Emerging Technologies &amp;Innovations in Dairy Our Research &amp;Development (R&amp;D) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies, and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan. As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation &amp;Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe. In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future. Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America. Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025. By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy. RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG. Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually. Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction. RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program. Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives: //st * Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation; * Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops; * Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and * Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health. We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026. Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint. To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024. In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems. The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices. This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform. MANUFACTURING We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023. (5) We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity. LOGISTICS OPERATIONS Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO 2e emissions. (1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation. We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers. Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia. In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. PACKAGING We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business. These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio. SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans. First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO 2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi. INNOVATION During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include: //st * Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings. * Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins. * Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050. * Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges. * EcoDesign Development: R&amp;D colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging. * Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition. WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials. (1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients. The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories. Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1) In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1 &amp;2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year. Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa. (1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap. View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. (1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach. Reported information following Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidelines for near-term target excludes Capital Goods, Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials, Employee Commuting, Downstream Transportation at Customer, and End of Life Treatment.The long-term target excludes these same categories, except for Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials and Employee Commuting. We have recalculated our base year 2018 and most recent years (2023 and 2024) inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards. Recent updates incorporate acquisitions Chipita and Ricolino. The footprint includes all acquisitions and divestitures to date except for Evirth. For more details, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual. Reported information is verified by an independent third-party and available in our ESG Reporting &amp;Disclosure Reporting Archive. In the context of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an \"absolute target\" refers to a reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a specific percentage or amount, measured against a baseline year, rather than a reduction per unit of production or activity. (2) Our near-term goal aligns with the latest standards and guidelines including the current SBTi Net Zero Standard (from March 2024) and the current SBTi FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) Guidance (from December 2023) by setting near-term targets in line with limiting warming to 1.5C. (3) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for West Africa includes Cte d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana. (4) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 covers Brazil, Cameroon, Cte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria unless otherwise stated (which differs from prior years). (5) Reported information includes all divestitures to date and the following acquisitions (which were not included in previous years): Chipita, Clif bar, Give &amp;Go, Gourmet Foods, Ricolino and Tate's Bake Shop except for Evirth (subject to future data integration). We have recalculated our base year 2018 (where applicable) and most recent years (2023 and 2024) for year-over-year comparison.

As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms. Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.", "Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow.

During May 2025, the requantification request was submitted to Verra, which would move all credits from the current VMR0006 methodology to the new VM0050 methodology, including current Base Carbon inventory and future project issuances.

The concession incorporates or surrounds multiple zones of historical and active polymetallic mineralization, including skarns, breccia pipes, and vein systems that are inferred to relate to monzonite intrusions, and offers immediate exploration opportunities for copper and associated metals.</p><p>\"The Vainilla acquisition option extends Orocos control of the Santo Tomas porphyry copper district, presenting immediate exploration upside and the potential for meaningful near-term results from multiple porphyry, skarn and breccia targets,\" stated Ian Graham, President of Oroco. \"The acquisition was encouraged in part by the transformational community, state and federal governments support for the Santo Tomas project as part of its inclusion in Plan Mexico and Plan Sinaloa. Vainilla is highly complementary to Santo Tomas development, both geologically and, potentially, economically. It aligns very well with Orocos strategic and operational objectives and in no way impedes or detracts from our development plans at Santo Tomas.

The study, completed at US$1750/oz gold, US$3.85/lb copper and US$22.50/oz for silver, delivered an NPV (based on a discount rate of 8%) of US$3.22bn on a capex of US$1.55bn for an initial 12 Mtpa underground block caving operation. The evaluation also showed an after-tax IRR of 24% and a first 10-year free cash flow generation of US$7.1bn. The PFS assessed Mineral Reserves 539.7 Mt tonnes, which represents only 18% of the total resource over an initial 28-year project life.</p><p>On 15 July 2024, SolGold announced a gold stream agreement with FrancoNevada and Osisko Royalties (the \"Streamers\") pursuant to which the Streamers would pay US$100m as pre-development funding in three tranches, conditional on achieving various technical and permitting milestones. The first US$33.3m was received on signing. A further US$650m contribution to development expenditure will be provided on completion of the feasibility study, permitting and financing, subject to CPs, acceptable financing packages for the balance funding required. SolGold has agreed, in consideration for this funding, a life of mine stream priced at 20% of the spot gold price at the time for 20% of gold production for the first 10 years and 12% thereafter. The stream represents approximately 5% of total revenue for the project and provides some 42% of currently estimated capital development costs. SolGold retains change of control buyback options on the stream to the extent of 50% within 3 years and 33 1/3 % for a further two years.</p><p>SolGold continues to advance de-risking programs, permitting and financing discussions and to reevaluate the Project at recent consensus prices for copper and gold.</p><p>On 28 October 2024, SolGold appointed G-Mining Services to be the Project Manager for the Feasibility Study.</p><p>The Company operates with transparency and in accordance with international best practices.

It takes five years for a tree to start producing the seeds that are processed into cocoa used to make chocolate and other delectable foods.</p><p>Climate change raises the risks for farmers: Hotter weather hurts yields and longer rainy seasons trigger the spread of fungus and deadly pests. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns have made it harder for farmers to deal with those challenges.</p><p>So farmers are switching to other crops, further reducing cocoa supplies and pushing prices higher: In 2024, prices nearly tripled, reaching about US$12,000 per ton, driving up chocolate costs and leading some chocolate makers to try growing cocoa in laboratories.</p><p>Indonesia is the third-largest producer of cocoa in the world, behind Cote D'Ivoire and Ghana, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, farmers are joining with businesses and nongovernmental organizations to develop better growing practices and improve their livelihoods.</p><p>Sitting in the shade of his forest farm in south Sumatra, 3 miles (5 kilometers) from a national park where Sumatran tigers and rhinos roam, farmer Santoso is working with Indonesian chocolate maker Krakakoa.</p><p>After he began working with the company in 2016, Santoso starting using practices that helped his cocoa trees flourish, regularly pruning and grafting new branches onto older trees to promote growth and prevent the spread of disease. He is using organic fertilizer and has adopted agroforestry techniques, integrating other crops and trees such as bananas, dragon fruit, coffee and pepper, into his farm to foster a healthier ecosystem and invest in other income sources.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn't very successful before we met Krakakoa,\u201d Santoso said. \u201cBut then, we received training ... things are much better.\u201d</p><p>Krakakoa has trained more than 1,000 cocoa farmers in Indonesia according to its founder and CEO, Sabrina Mustopo. The company also provides financial support.</p><p>Santoso and other farmers in Sumatra said the partnership helped them to form a cooperative provides low-interest loans to farmers, with interest paid back into the cooperative rather than to banks outside of the community.</p><p>Cocoa farmers who need bigger loans from government-owned banks also benefit from partnering with businesses, as the guaranteed buyer agreements can provide collateral needed to get loans approved, said Armin Hari, a communications manager at the Cocoa Sustainability Partnership, a forum for public-private collaboration for cocoa development in Indonesia.</p><p>Dozens of other businesses, the government and nongovernmental organizations and cooperatives are also working with cocoa farmers to better cope with climate change, benefiting thousands, Hari said. He pointed to a collaboration between Indonesia's National Research and Innovation Agency and the local division of international chocolate maker Mars, which have released a new variant of cocoa that produces more pods per tree.</p><p>Challenges still remain, said Rajendra Aryal, the FAO's country director for Indonesia.

The study, completed at US$1750/oz gold, US$3.85/lb copper and US$22.50/oz for silver, delivered an NPV (based on a discount rate of 8%) of US$3.22bn on a capex of US$1.55bn for an initial 12 Mtpa underground block caving operation. The evaluation also showed an after-tax IRR of 24% and a first 10-year free cash flow generation of US$7.1bn. The PFS assessed Mineral Reserves 539.7 Mt tonnes, which represents only 18% of the total resource over an initial 28-year project life.</p><p>On 15 July 2024, SolGold announced a gold stream agreement with FrancoNevada and Osisko Royalties (the \"Streamers\") pursuant to which the Streamers would pay US$100m as pre-development funding in three tranches, conditional on achieving various technical and permitting milestones. The first US$33.3m was received on signing. A further US$650m contribution to development expenditure will be provided on completion of the feasibility study, permitting and financing, subject to CPs, acceptable financing packages for the balance funding required. SolGold has agreed, in consideration for this funding, a life of mine stream priced at 20% of the spot gold price at the time for 20% of gold production for the first 10 years and 12% thereafter. The stream represents approximately 5% of total revenue for the project and provides some 42% of currently estimated capital development costs. SolGold retains change of control buyback options on the stream to the extent of 50% within 3 years and 33 1/3 % for a further two years.</p><p>SolGold continues to advance de-risking programs, permitting and financing discussions and to reevaluate the Project at recent consensus prices for copper and gold.</p><p>On 28 October 2024, SolGold appointed G-Mining Services to be the Project Manager for the Feasibility Study.</p><p>The Company operates with transparency and in accordance with international best practices. SolGold is committed to delivering value to its shareholders while simultaneously providing economic and social benefits to impacted communities, fostering a healthy and safe workplace, and minimizing environmental impact.</p><p>SolGold is listed on the London Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange (LSE/TSX: SOLG).</p><p>See<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.solgold.com.aufor\">www.solgold.com.aufor</url> more information.

It is heavily rooted in agriculture, life skills, and personal development. From the cloverbud project where children aged six to eight learn about other projects in their province, to projects like beef or outdoor living for youth aged 9-21, there is something for everyone. 4-H is also an important program for providing youth with public speaking, critical and methodical thinking, patience, work ethic, and many other skills through their project work as well as general functions such as public speaking competitions.</p><p>Through involvement in the program, youth can earn high school credits, explore their passions, gain an appreciation for agriculture and where our food comes from, and attend provincial and national trips focused on things like personal development, agriculture, or career development. This is only a small number of the endless opportunities that are available through 4-H.</p><p>Children aged six to eight are eligible for the cloverbuds project. Juniors (ages nine to 13) and seniors (ages 14 to 21) are eligible for projects like foods, aquaculture, gardening, tractor, small engines, agroforestry, sheep, swine, horse, dog, poultry, dairy, honeybee, beef, and many more. Seniors can complete more advanced projects like junior leader (helping a leader facilitate a project), senior management (creating your own project within a pre-existing project), and self-determined (creating your own project).</p><p>In our district, the second largest in the province, we have numerous active clubs which cover areas all the way from Lone Butte to south of Kersley.</p><p>If you want to see us in action, watch for the dates of the 67th Annual Williams Lake and District 4-H Show and Sale to be announced for August of 2025. You can also check out the Williams Lake and District 4-H and 4-H British Columbia Facebook pages for important dates and events as well as photos taken at events.</p><p>If you are interested in this program as an adult, we are always looking for more screened volunteers and leaders. Volunteers help with things like public speaking competitions, chaperoning trips and camps, and administering workshops. Leaders often volunteer for a single project that they already have experience with where they help their members complete their projects from start to finish, carry out project evaluations, provide exams for members trying to obtain certificates, and organize the parts of shows specific to their project.</p><p>I, a 4-H BC Ambassador for the Central Interior Region, am going into my eighth year in 4-H and have experienced things like provincial communications finals, a national trip, and countless club and district activities and functions.\u00a0 I am confident in saying that joining 4-H is the most valuable decision that I have made in terms of positive effect on my future.

Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Indeed, our ingredient-sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions-reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as cocoa and wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental and social benefits for the communities involved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CLIMATE RISKS AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For us at Mondel\u0113z International, more sustainable snacking is part of a future where people and planet thrive together. Operating at global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights and investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.</p><p>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, inform our strategies and ultimately sharpen and enhance our approach. Find out more in Corporate Governance.</p><p>Our climate strategy encompasses our goal to decarbonize our end-to-end supply chain by 2050 in line with the SBTi guidance and following recognized carbon accounting standards (GHG Protocol). As such, we are focusing on the reduction of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.</p><p>Our metrics are aligned with the SBTi requirements across our value chain including Scopes 1,2 and 3 reduction targets as well as breaking emissions out into FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) and non-FLAG related emissions.

AIM TO SEEK NO DEFORESTATION ACROSS PRIMARY COMMODITIES BY 2025</p><p>Deforestation doesn't only contribute to global climate change - it also has a serious impact on local communities and ecosystems. At Mondel\u0113z International we're aiming for the end of deforestation across our primary commodities over the next two years. Our phased approach means we aim for cocoa, palm, soy, and paper materials placed on the market after December 30, 2024 and used by our European business, to be deforestation free - with our goal for other regions to follow by December 31, 2025. The cutoff date is December 31, 2020 in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted in a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after 31 December 2020.</p><p>When it comes to deforestation, two of the commodities we source - cocoa and palm - are regarded as at-risk. We work closely with our key cocoa and palm suppliers to supply us with deforestationfree cocoa and palm. We also call on our suppliers, including those of soy, pulp and paper, to take steps to end deforestation in their own supply chains.</p><p>Our full deforestation free position is available on our website.</p><p>Cocoa</p><p>It's been a decade since we launched our signature sustainability program, Cocoa Life, which takes an integrated approach to help tackle the root causes behind the social, economic and environmental challenges faced by cocoa farming. We've carefully monitored its progress, mapping the farms registered and partnering with Global Forest Watch to monitor the forests via satellite technology. Cocoa Life continues to grow, and we're aiming to source all the cocoa volumes we need for our chocolate brands via the program by 2025.</p><p>Cocoa Life isn't the only example of our leadership in this area. It was in 2015 that Mondel\u0113z International first raised the issue of cocoa-driven deforestation at COP21 in Paris. Two years later, we became a founding member - also with the Governments of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana and 36 other chocolate and cocoa companies - of Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI). Today, CFI is a leading publicprivate partnership to help address deforestation and restore forests in cocoa growing areas.</p><p>Find out more in Cocoa Life.</p><p>Palm Oil</p><p>We've been RSPO certified since 2013. We gather information on the mills where our direct suppliers source from, which we make public, while at the same time we continue to engage with our direct suppliers to help tackle environmental and social challenges in the supply chain.</p><p>The Palm Oil Action Plan (POAP) we have in place makes our suppliers responsible for preventing deforestation in their own operations or supply chains. This requires them to map and monitor all plantations and engage with any that fail to comply.</p><p>At Mondel\u0113z International we only account for a small fraction of the total demand for palm oil. To help drive wider change, we're involved with many other organizations that are also committed to improving the palm oil supply chain across the world. These include bodies like the Consumer Goods Forum Forest Positive Coalition (CGF FPC), the Consumer Goods Forum Human Rights Coalition (CGF HRC), the Palm Oil Transparency Coalition (POTC), the Palm Oil Collaboration Group (POCG) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).</p><p>Find out more in Palm Oil.</p><p>Soy</p><p>The comparatively low levels of soy that we buy means we have little direct influence over the sector. That said, we apply CGF sourcing guidelines to purchasing of this ingredient.</p><p>We also track indirect emissions from the dairy industry that arise from the use in cattle food of raw ingredients such as soy grown in deforested areas. That gives us the insight we need to buy most of our dairy ingredients from suppliers whose farmers are selective about what they feed their cows. It also helps us engage openly with our suppliers on the need to provide dairy products based on deforestation-free cattle feed.</p><p>Pulp and Paper</p><p>For pulp and paper, we require the mills and printers that supply us to be Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified. As part of our strategy implementation by end of 2025, we aim to leverage chain of custody certification programs to confirm that the virgin paper packaging we use is sourced from sustainably managed forests.</p><p>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation.

The few groves that stand today are either protected by Indigenous communities who preserve them for their faith and traditions, or are being grown and tended back into existence by ecologists who remove tea trees from disused farms and plant seeds native to this biodiverse region. It takes decades, but their efforts are finally starting to see results as forests flourish despite ecological damage and wilder weather caused by climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The teams bringing back the forests \u2014 home to more than 600 native plants and 150 animal species found only here \u2014 know that they still need to work around their neighbors.

The neighboring mountainous region of Wayanad suffered devastating landslides that killed nearly 200 people earlier this year, and Halan warns Nilgiris may suffer a similar fate.</p><p>Halan also warned the region is susceptible to long droughts and excess heat because of climate change, and that's already affected some tea harvests.</p><p>Restoring forests brings life back to Nilgiris</p><p>In a small mountain fold just a few hundred meters below the region\u2019s tallest peak, native trees planted 10 years ago have grown up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) tall. A stream flows amid the young trees that replaced nearly 7 acres of tea plants.</p><p>\u201cThis whole place was tea plantations and this stream was not flowing throughout the year,\u201d said Bosco, the ecologist. \u201cSince we began our restoration work, it flows through the year and the trees and bamboo have grown well along the stream.\u201d</p><p>The forests are known as Shola-grassland forests or cloud forests because they can capture moisture from high-altitude mist. </p><p>Bosco said the plants and trees have an \u201cincredible capacity to provide for life\u201d across the nearly 2,000 acres his organization works to restore. The native trees maintain the microclimate underneath them by providing nutrients to the soil. That helps saplings and small plants grow even during hot, dry summers.</p><p>The region is also home to several Indigenous communities, called Adivasi, many of them classified as highly vulnerable with only a few thousand of their people remaining. </p><p>Representatives of these Adivasi communities consider themselves the original custodians of the forests and have also restored forests in the region.

And overseeing a reforestation project on the Boa Vida farm near town of Bonito is a woman who is a \"traditional seed guardian,\" Elida Cristina Martins.</p><p>\"I found that if we planted baru with bananas nearby it grows much faster than when planted alone, and the bananas help break the wind and keep the ground wet to keep the baru healthy,\" she said as she gave a recent tour of her farm to a group of visitors from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Tapestry Foundation.</p><p>The Tapestry Foundation is entering the second year of a four-year, $3 million grant to WWF to establish a deforestation-free leather supply chain and to work on reforestation efforts on the Cerrado, a vast tropical biome that includes the Pantanal headwaters, and which provides much of the water, produce and beef within Brazil and for export. One of the planet's richest savannas and one of 34 biodiversity hotspots in the world, the Cerrado is being steadily deforested as individual landowners and companies clear natural habitat to graze cattle and grow soy.</p><p>Some of the Tapestry Foundation funding goes to WWF-Brazil to fund unique reforestation programs like the one on Boa Vida. Although national legislation requires that landowners must preserve 20 percent to 35 percent of their land and all riparian vegetation as well, the rest of the land can be legally cleared due to the lack of a zero-deforestation law for the Cerrado. Because half of the Cerrado has already been converted to pasture and farmland, it's been under heavy use, and two-thirds of the pastures in the Pantanal headwaters are under moderate to severe degradation. Landscape restoration and pasture rehabilitation are key parts of solving the environmental crisis in Brazil and are therefore among the highest priorities of WWF and the Tapestry Foundation.</p><p>\"The purpose of our work in Brazil is to try to be part of the solution towards a more sustainable leather supply chain- one that works for the environment and local communities. During our time in Brazil, it was important that we met with local people and communities to better understand the impact climate change is having on the most vulnerable populations,\" said Julia Furnari, Director of the Tapestry Foundation. \"For vulnerable communities like this one, where so many depend on nature to survive, protecting the community and the environment helps to turn sustainable practices into long-term solutions while creating opportunity for so many.\"</p><p>Roughly 36 families live on the Santa Lucia settlement, of which Boa Vida is a part, and Elida Cristina Martins has been farming and raising cattle for more than 25 years on 12 hectares, or nearly 30 acres. Nearly one-third of the land in the settlement is owned by women, she said, creating a unique economic opportunity for a group that often gets overlooked in discussions about the wealth of the land and environment in South America.</p><p>\"We have an integrated system, where baru is planted with\u202fCrotalaria\u202fand sorghum to determine which grows better together,\" she said. The sorghum can be used for cattle feed, and therefore can be revenue-producing.</p><p>In the last year alone, she has planted 2,200 trees. \"We're always testing what will work better. We experiment with multiple people planting and with a single person - me - planting, to see which grows better,\" she said. \"And we plant mango, cashew, coconut, guava, lime, pineapples --- all alongside the baru to protect it and help it thrive. Every species has a time to fruit and so you also have fruit all year long.\"</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Tapestry, Inc. on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Tapestry, Inc.<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-inc\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/tapestry-inc</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/755883/The-Tapestry-Foundation-Heads-to-Brazil-for-an-In-Person-Look-at-Agroforestry\">https://www.accesswire.com/755883/The-Tapestry-Foundation-Heads-to-Brazil-for-an-In-Person-Look-at-Agroforestry</url></p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["com/profiles/tapestry-incEmail: info@3blmedia. comSOURCE: Tapestry, Inc.

Their commitment to food security and environmental sustainability ensures that we have healthy food choices now and for future generations. They provide us with protein-rich soy while minimizing water waste, environmental degradation, and soil erosion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To do so, they use cutting-edge agricultural technology that lets them grow nutrient-dense crops while also protecting our environment's health. In fact, in 2015 alone, U.S. soybean farmers used biotechnology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 58.8 billion pounds. Learn how U.S. soybean farmers are leveraging advanced agricultural technology and systems into their farming practices to adapt to our evolving environmental and food needs.</p><p><br/>Emerging Farming Technologies and Systems</p><p>Cover Cropping</p><p>U.S. Soybean farmers use a technique called cover cropping to improve their soil and its surrounding ecosystem. In a cover crop system, farmers plant a mixture of beneficial seeds with the purpose of renewing the soil after the main crop is harvested. The seed mix includes species that protect the soil, prevent runoff, and slow water movement across the field.</p><p>Smart Irrigation and Center-Pivot Systems</p><p>Healthy soil and effective water conservation would not be possible if U.S. soybean farmers didn't use smart irrigation and center pivot systems. These systems help deliver the precise amount of water needed to grow healthy, nutrient dense soy, while using fewer resources. Soil moisture sensors, weather sensors and GPS analyze moisture levels and weather patterns, so U.S. farmers can cultivate soy as efficiently as possible. These systems can be monitored remotely with smartphones, tablets and computers, so farmers can properly nourish soybeans - promoting healthy soil and environmental sustainability, from their fields to our kitchen tables.</p><p>Conservation Tillage</p><p>U.S. soybean farmers are achieving more with less by planting fields using minimal or no tillage techniques. By adopting conservation tillage, soybean farmers reduce soil disturbance, which helps enhance nutrient retention and biodiversity. This method also reduces soil erosion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over 74% of soybean acres are cultivated using conservation tillage, demonstrating how readily U.S. soybean farmers have embraced this eco-friendly farming practice.</p><p>What does this mean for you? Well, quite simply: when you choose U.S. grown soy-based foods, you can be confident that U.S. soybean farmers are committed to sustainable farming practices that ensure the long-term health of our planet.</p><p><br/>Buffer Strips, Windbreaks, and Agroforestry</p><p>Buffer strips and windbreaks are vital parts of sustainable farming. They act like natural fences, keeping soil and water safe. These vegetative buffers are strategically placed near water and around fields to stop soil and nutrients from washing away when it rains, also referred to as run off. By doing this, they reduce soil erosion and nutrient loss. When used with other management water systems, these \"natural fences\" keep water clean and help soybean farms last a long time.</p><p>Farmers also use agroforestry to serve a similar function. By planting trees alongside crops, they improve the soil, increase biodiversity, and sequester carbon.</p><p>Precision Agriculture</p><p>Precision agriculture revolutionizes soybean farming with technology. Using GPS and sensors, farmers can monitor their fields closely. They can plan when to plant and harvest while using less resources, helping to sustain our environment's health.</p><p>Plant Breeding and Biotechnology</p><p>Herbicides are important for high crop yields, as they remove pesky weeds competing with soybeans for sunlight and other resources. To provide enough crops to feed communities across the country, U.S. soybean farmers use emerging biotechnology and plant breeding technology to help improve weed control without harming the soil.</p><p>For example, biotech soybean crops are herbicide resistant and come packed with nutritional benefits. By planting herbicide-tolerant soybeans, farmers can control weeds without ploughing deep into the soil to bury them, which can erode topsoil.</p><p>U.S. Soybean Farmers' Dedication to Sustainability</p><p>Technological innovations and sustainable practices embraced by U.S. soybean farmers showcase their dedication to sustainable and environmentally conscious farming.</p><p>That's why U.S. Soy has teamed up with reputable partners like Texas Tech University and the Southern Soybean Research Program to reduce the impact drought has on soybean crops, which could potentially improve crop yields by 10-15%. Through advanced farming technologies in water management, nutrient conservation, soil management, precision agriculture, plant breeding, and biodiversity, these farmers are not just producing food-they are ensuring the well-being of our planet for current and future generations.</p><p>You can rest assured that when you choose U.S.-grown soy products, you're supporting a system that prioritizes food security, environmental health, and sustainable development.</p><p>To understand how U.S. Soy fosters partnerships and innovation in farming technologies for environmental sustainability, learn more from U.S Soy's Sustainability report.</p><p>Innovative U.S. Soybean Farming and Agriculture Technology</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from U.S. Soy on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: U.S. Soy<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-soy\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/us-soy</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: U.S. Soy</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/878629/us-soybean-farmer-innovation\">press release</url> on accesswire.com</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["Well, quite simply: when you choose U.

(\"Klimat X\" or the \"Company\") which carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets, is pleased to announce it has signed a binding agreement with the national government of Suriname to develop mangrove carbon credit and agroforestry projects. The Company has built a presence in Suriname and is actively conducting fieldwork to establish project size and feasibility. //st * The Agreement identifies 2 initial mangrove carbon credit projects in the Coronie and Commewijne Districts (the 'Projects') covering at least 3,000 ha, which will be led, structured, and managed by Klimat X (the \"Company\") while exploring for other project sites. * Since the signing of the Agreement in December 2022 , a team led by the Company team has conducted extensive due diligence and scoping to optimize and de-risk the projects. </p><p>* On April 24 , the Klimat X technical and field team, led by Dr. Steve Crooks from Silvestrum Climate Associates commenced fieldwork in Suriname to establish the technical foundations for measuring greenhouse gas emissions reductions. * Building on the previous expeditionary trips, the team is working to evaluate the potential immediate and long-term greenhouse gas benefits from mangrove conservation and restoration from the projects. * Degraded mangroves with impaired hydrology can be a significant source of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and the team will be directly measuring these emissions during the fieldwork. Interventions that restore the natural hydrology of the project sites can dramatically reduce methane emissions, generating significant volumes of carbon credits. * Klimat X is also in active discussions with two significant international organizations (and prospective partners), already active in-country, to assist with elements of both civil engineering and community work that are likely to be needed in the successful delivery of the projects. * Klimat X remains grateful to the Faculty of Technical Sciences at the University of Suriname for their continued insights and support for the Projects and hopes a relationship of mutual benefit will continue to strengthen with Company investment in capacity building.</p><p>CEO, Dr. James Tansey comments, \"Mangroves play a critical role in regulating climate change and in protecting coastlines from storms and sea level rise. This latest jurisdictional agreement builds on the model we have established in other countries including Mexico and Sierra Leone. We will be able to invest in the protection and restoration of these mangrove areas, reducing emissions of carbon and methane on an unprecedented scale. As recently announced, there is strong interest from buyers in these projects.\" Background</p><p>Klimat X, through its controlled subsidiary, Pomeroon Trading (Holdings) Limited ('PTHL'), has entered into a legally binding co-operation agreement (the 'Agreement') with the Government of the Republic of Suriname. The Agreement outlines details of the co-operation agreed between the parties with regard to the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation of mangroves in Suriname, including the qualification of these projects for voluntary carbon credits and the subsequent sale and marketing of those credits. The background to the agreement acknowledged the globally leading significance of the Republic of Suriname as one of only three net negative carbon emitters globally, and the commitment of its people and Government to protecting and restoring its considerable natural endowment. Suriname has approximately 100,000 ha of mangroves, which provide critical biodiversity habitat and protect the coastline from floods and sea level rise. Following the completion of the current period of fieldwork, the Company will provide estimates of the potential scale of the carbon credit production from these interventions. Klimat X will work directly with large buyers to fund the completion of the project through a pre-purchase or investment agreement. About Klimat X</p><p>Klimat X carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets. In contrast to streaming and royalty companies, Klimat X works upstream as a direct owner and operator of projects, addressing a key supply constraint the current market and the rapidly growing demand for carbon credits in global voluntary and regulated markets. The Corporation intends to achieve this by investing in the exploration, restoration and management of terrestrial and marine systems that can either be protected to enhance the sequestration of greenhouse gases or restored from a degraded status to fully productive ecosystems. Klimat X will draw on the experience of a senior executive team and board that provide access into key target jurisdictions through relationships in the mining and natural resources sectors, combined with decades of experience in carbon markets. Klimat X plans to deploy capital at risk under various arrangements (including cooperation, assignment and production sharing agreements) with large landowners and governments in various suitable jurisdictions around the world.

Set against a backdrop of lush forests, pristine waters, and a remarkable community, this inaugural event brought together Sheshegwaning First Nation and New Grain Kitchen of Gore Bay, an innovative culinary enterprise, to showcase the rich bounty of the land and waters of Manitoulin Island. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The event was centered around one star ingredient: sushi-grade rainbow trout, farmed in the crystal-clear waters surrounding Sheshegwaning. New Grain\u2019s renowned restauranteur, Genevieve Sartor, made this trout the focus of her sophisticated catering events for the past year, including her restaurant\u2019s menu the previous year. Ms. Sartor, a passionate gastronome with a global perspective, declared this fish to be the best she had ever tasted in her worldwide travels. \u201cI\u2019ve tasted fish in some of the most exquisite places, but Sheshegwaning\u2019s rainbow trout is something truly special,\u201d she said, her voice full of admiration for the pristine environment that produces such exceptional quality. </p><p>The collaboration between New Grain, Odawa Island Farms, and the local Sheshegwaning community went far beyond a simple meal. It was an immersive experience designed to educate, inspire, and connect people to the land and its traditions. The day began with a boat tour to the offshore fish farm, where guests saw firsthand the trout swimming in the clear, cold waters. Mike Miske, project manager for Odawa Island Farms, served as the tour guide, sharing insights into the farm\u2019s sustainable practices. </p><p>\u201cOffshore farming works well here because the strong, varied lake currents provide excellent water conditions. The fish grow faster and healthier, with better meat quality,\u201d Mr. Miske explained, pointing to the waters surrounding the cages. \u201cBut those same currents can also be our biggest challenge, making it hard to access the cages in rough waters. Still, we\u2019ve partnered with Sheshegwaning to complete our business cycle. We have our own factories, we grow our own fingerlings, and now, thanks to this partnership, we can raise our own fish right here.\u201d </p><p>The farm operates with a deep respect for the environment, something that aligns perfectly with the values of the Anishinaabek people. Daily checks on oxygen and temperature levels ensure the health and well-being of the fish, and during winter, aeration tubes keep oxygen flowing even under a thick layer of ice. This careful balance of tradition and innovation was echoed throughout the event, which aimed to fuse sustainable Indigenous food practices with local food culture while advocating for food security. </p><p>As the boat tour ended, guests were led to the Land First Youth Initiative Food Forest, a project spearheaded by Kiara Genereux, a former sous chef under Joseph Shawana, a renowned Anishinaabe chef from Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory. Ms. Genereux\u2019s vision for the food forest was rooted in her deep connection to the land and her desire to educate the next generation on sustainable food systems. This forest represents the future, where community members rely on the land in a sustainable way, just like their ancestors did. </p><p>Ms. Genereux\u2019s passion for food and community shone through in her collaboration with Ms. Sartor, which began when she reached out to discuss the food forest project. The idea quickly evolved into the full-fledged event that unfolded that day, combining traditional Anishinaabek food practices with the culinary creativity of New Grain Kitchen. Together, they curated a multi-course meal that not only highlighted the local rainbow trout but also featured wild rice, foraged ingredients, and other traditional foods. </p><p>\u201cI wanted this event to be integrative, to demonstrate a real commitment to local food, but not just in the sense of supporting young, white farmers,\u201d Ms. Sartor explained. \u201cThis is about all of us, in every shape and form we come in, contributing to food security here on Manitoulin. It\u2019s about making sure everyone has a seat at the table.\u201d </p><p>For Ms. Sartor, this event wasn\u2019t just about food\u2014it was about creating a space where diverse voices could come together to share stories, knowledge, and meals. \u201cTruth and Reconciliation isn\u2019t just a day. It\u2019s a practice, something we have to do together, day after day. And one of the most powerful ways to foster that connection is by breaking bread and eating fish together.\u201d </p><p>The meal itself was a testament to the land\u2019s bounty and the cultural heritage of the Anishinaabek people. Ms. Sartor crafted each dish to reflect the local environment, using ingredients sourced from Manitoulin Island. \u201cEverything on this menu is a love letter\u2014to this place, to the people, to the land. The potatoes come from the Amish, the trout has been smoked here by Kiara and Curtis, and the wild rice sourdough with trout gravlax was inspired by the image of trout swimming among the wild rice fields,\u201d Ms. Sartor explained, her passion evident as she spoke. </p><p>As the guests took in the Sheshegwaning community hall, transformed by candlelight and a fine dining atmosphere, Leonard Genereux spoke to the Odawa peoples\u2019 history as traders.  </p><p>\u201cWe used to travel with medicines and natural foods, but we also carried medicines and materials for trade. We set up trade centers where people from different areas would gather. Our reach extended as far as the Ohio Valley and up to Winnipeg. We used water routes for trading, including exchanging buffalo with the Sioux for fish. Conflicts would arise when one side took too much, so we had to regulate ourselves. Sheshegwaning has always been dear to me. When I was a kid, I described it as \u2018free.\u2019 Here we aren\u2019t centred on money, we are focused on respect and natural law.\u201d </p><p>Each course was not only delicious but also deeply meaningful, reflecting the interconnectedness of the land, the food, and the people who prepared it. \u201cThis event isn\u2019t meant to be self-aggrandizing,\u201d Ms. Sartor said. \u201cI\u2019m here to be a conduit, to engage with my environment as much as I can and to facilitate certain things where I can. My hand is guided by what\u2019s available, by the land itself. There\u2019s a kind of poetry to that\u2014an ecosystemic relationship between the food we eat and the stories we tell.\u201d </p><p>As guests enjoyed the meal, they were also treated to a tour of Odawa Freshwater Gardens, where Mr. Genereux\u2019s (Ms. Genereux\u2019s father) spoke about the history of the land and the traditional agricultural practices of the Odawa people. \u201cWe\u2019re reintroducing practices and plants that sustained our ancestors for generations,\u201d Mr. Genereux said, walking through rows of apple trees, chokecherry bushes, pawpaw and raspberries. \u201cWhat they did in the past is sustaining us today. We\u2019re just learning as much as we can to carry it forward.\u201d </p><p>The conversation revolved around sustainable living, food preservation, and the importance of traditional knowledge passed down from Elders. Mr. Genereux shared stories of how his ancestors lived off the land, planting crops and medicinal plants with an understanding of the natural world that is often lost in modern farming practices. \u201cMy grandpa had four acres, and that would feed a family of 14 for a year. That\u2019s the kind of knowledge we need to reclaim\u2014how to live with the land, not just off of it.\u201d </p><p>The event also touched on the role of agroforestry and the potential for collaboration with institutions like the University of Toronto, where students might volunteer to learn from the rich traditions of the Sheshegwaning community. \u201cThis is about more than just growing food,\u201d Mr. Genereux said. \u201cIt\u2019s about growing relationships\u2014with each other, with the land, and with the future.\u201d </p><p>By the end of the day, it was clear that this event had accomplished much more than introducing people to the exquisite flavours of Manitoulin Island. It had sparked conversations about sustainability, food sovereignty, and the importance of Indigenous food systems in the broader dialogue around climate change and food security. </p><p>Ms. Sartor, reflecting on the day\u2019s success, spoke of her hopes for the future. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see this grow into something much bigger\u2014where we can truly put Manitoulin on the map as a culinary destination. We have the product, the knowledge and the passion to make it happen.\u201d </p><p>As the sun set over the waters of Sheshegwaning, the event left a lasting impression on all who attended. It was a celebration not only of food but of the deep cultural and environmental connections that sustain us all, a powerful reminder that the future of food lies in the wisdom of the past, and in the hands of those who are willing to carry it forward. </p>", "publisher": "The Canadian Press", "instances": ["\u201d The conversation revolved around sustainable living, food preservation, and the importance of traditional knowledge passed down from Elders.

So, we set out to create a solution; freedom and self-sustainability oriented communities, now known as Veritas Villages.</p><p>I've been blessed to have created several successful businesses in my lifetime and have learned there is a formula to doing so. The formula starts with a great concept that has a growing market that is hungry for it. Then you add world class people who can deliver that concept. This can only be done with people that are passionate about making the concept come to life and who are willing to go beyond the regular call of duty to make it happen.</p><p>Roughly one year ago, my son Spencer, co-founder with myself of the Autris Group of companies, and I met our now CFO, Don Morrison, and together we decided to allow our clients, and ultimately anyone that sees the value in our business model, to be a part of it. We decided the best way to do this would be to acquire and reactivate a public company, Autris (AUTR) and to equip that company with the necessary assets and competencies to pursue our goals of building a world class organization dedicated to promoting freedom and self-sustainability through the acquisition, design, development, and construction of freedom and self-sustainability oriented communities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><p>While it is early in our journey, a great deal was accomplished in the past year, and I am pleased to report some of our accomplishments.</p><p>Just Some of Our Fiscal Highlights of the last year: //st * Acquired and Reactivated Autris after 9 years of dormancy. * Completed 4 substantial transformative acquisitions, creating the Autris Group of companies. * Reported Positive Earnings of $354,097 while at the same time investing in new communities and infrastructure and increasing working capital to $2,850,319 * Reported a Record $3,892,862 in Deferred Revenue which will become revenue this new fiscal year. * Reported Record Asset Growth (quarter over quarter exponential) of $10,351,949. * Reported Record Shareholders Equity of $5,056,919. * Retired All Outstanding Mortgage Amounts ahead of schedule and Remain Debt Free. * Permitted our Flagship Property in Panama, \"Veritas Village - Coronado\" and sold approximately 80% of the development within the first months. * Welcomed senior talent in areas of Operations, Finance, and Legal including our COO, Erik Vik and Board Member Mikkel Thorup. * Sold Out available parcels at our Vida Verde Agroforest - Cosiguina project in Nicaragua and acquired additional land to expand the Agroforestry business.</p><p>Looking Ahead //st * We intend to acquire new property in Costa Rica, Mexico, Argentina and beyond to continue to create Veritas Villages throughout the region. * Hire additional personnel to manage the increasing number of communities. * Grow our Property and Rental Management Division as our communities grow. * Increase our marketing reach to the ever-growing freedom-oriented market in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and beyond. * Increase the number of Freedom oriented Affiliates we work with to market our communities. * Work with key partners to create International Self-Governance Cities. * Continue to become the de facto company known for creating freedom and sustainability-oriented communities.</p><p>Core Values</p><p>Most importantly, we are operating on a culture of transparency and accountability, to our customers, to each other and to our shareholders. Our organization is defined by our F.I.R.S.T philosophy (Freedom, Independence, Resiliency, Sustainability and Transparency). A commitment to these values is what we believe will continue to make us extremely successful into the future.</p><p>We continue to build a culture of high expectations within the company, and to ensure everyone has a clear understanding of strategic objectives, and a clarity and commitment to the individual roles we play in attaining our common goals. We expect our leaders to set an example within the organization and we challenge each other daily to ensure that we have the courage to question the status quo, ruthlessly prioritize what will bring us closer to our goals, provide constructive feedback to our teams, have the difficult conversations that will make us better and remain committed to developing and elevating our incredible workforce.</p><p>In the upcoming year, we are committed to growing our business by investing in our people and processes to enhance our competitiveness, seeking out acquisitions that align with our core values, and help build our portfolio of projects and brand awareness.</p><p>I am optimistic for the opportunities that lie ahead for Autris, and I am grateful to our management and employees for their support during this year of transition. On behalf of Autris' leadership team, I extend my sincere thanks to our loyal like-minded customers, our dedicated employees, our collaborative partners and our supportive shareholders.

Now, they aim to change the region", "published": "2024-09-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">APIWTXA VILLAGE, BRAZIL It was just before dawn when the Ashaninka people, wearing long, tunic-like dresses, began singing traditional songs while playing drums and other instruments. The music drifted through Apiwtxa village, which had welcomed guests from Indigenous communities in Brazil and neighboring Peru, some having traveled three days. As the sun rose, they moved beneath the shadow of a huge mango tree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dancing, which would last until the following morning, marked the end of the annual celebration recognizing the Ashaninka territory along the winding Amonia River in the western Amazon. The multi-day, nearly aroundthe-clock festivities included the ritual of drinking ayahuasca, the sacred psychedelic brew, archery tournaments, climbing towering acai palm trees and face-painting with red dye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was once a gathering to commemorate the Ashaninka has evolved into a showcase of what they have done:the village\u2019s self-sufficiency, which comes from growing crops and protecting its forest, is now a model for an ambitious project to help 12 Indigenous territories in western Amazon, amounting to 640,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), about the size of the U.S.state of Delaware.</p><p>In November, the Organization of Indigenous People of the Jurua River, known by the Portuguese acronym OPIRJ, secured $6.8 million in support from the Amazon Fund, the world\u2019s largest initiative to combat rainforest deforestation. With Apiwtxa as the model, the grant is geared toward improving Indigenous land management with an emphasis on food production, cultural strengthening and forest surveillance.</p><p>\u201cWe are expanding everything that we did at Apiwxta to an entire region,\u201d said Ashaninka and OPIRJ leader Francisco Piy\u00e3ko, speaking in front of his home in Apiwtxa. \u201cThis is not only about implementing a project. What is at stake is cultural change. This is essential to protect life, the territory and its peoples.\u201d</p><p>Indigenous groups have long argued that they are in the best position to conserve and protect forests, having been successful stewards of lands for thousands of years. Indigenous land management is increasingly a central policy discussion at climate talks as global warming worsens and other methods to protect forests, such as carbon credit schemes, have largely not been successful.</p><p>In Brazil, Indigenous territories comprise 23% of the Amazon region, which is roughly the size of South Africa and largely covered with old-growth rainforests that store large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when released into the atmosphere. In 2022, only 2% of all deforestation in the Amazon happened inside Indigenous territories, most by non-Indigenous land-grabbers. In Ashaninka\u2019s Amonia territory, the deforested area today is 0.03%, underscoring the tribe\u2019s successful forest management.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago, when the Brazilian government recognized the Ashaninka\u2019s territorial rights, the area where Apiwtxa sits was a sprawling cattle farm run by non-Indigenous settlers. Loggers had degraded the remaining forest, depleting the region of mahogany and other valuable trees. Indigenous families lived scattered and in fear. With few options, some worked for farmers and loggers in slave-like conditions.</p><p>The land demarcation, which forced outsiders to leave, opened the door to reforestation and cultural rebirth. The Ashaninka transferred their main village, Apiwtxa, to an abandoned pasture in a strategic location for surveillance.

Now they aim to change the region", "published": "2024-09-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">APIWTXA VILLAGE, Brazil (AP) \u2014 It was just before dawn when the Ashaninka people, wearing long, tunic-like dresses, began singing traditional songs while playing drums and other instruments. The music drifted through Apiwtxa village, which had welcomed guests from Indigenous communities in Brazil and neighboring Peru, some having traveled three days. As the sun rose, they moved beneath the shadow of a huge mango tree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The dancing, which would last until the following morning, marked the end of the annual celebration recognizing the Ashaninka territory along the winding Amonia River in the western Amazon. The multi-day, nearly around-the-clock festivities included the ritual of drinking ayahuasca, the sacred psychedelic brew, archery tournaments, climbing towering acai palm trees and face-painting with red dye.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was once a gathering to commemorate the Ashaninka has evolved into a showcase of what they have done: the village\u2019s self-sufficiency, which comes from growing crops and protecting its forest, is now a model for an ambitious project to help 12 Indigenous territories in western Amazon, amounting to 640,000 hectares (1.6 million acres), about the size of the U.S. state of Delaware.</p><p>In November, the Organization of Indigenous People of the Jurua River, known by the Portuguese acronym OPIRJ, secured $6.8 million in support from the Amazon Fund, the world\u2019s largest initiative to combat rainforest deforestation. With Apiwtxa as the model, the grant is geared toward improving Indigenous land management with an emphasis on food production, cultural strengthening and forest surveillance.</p><p>\u201cWe are expanding everything that we did at Apiwxta to an entire region,\" said Ashaninka and OPIRJ leader Francisco Piy\u00e3ko, speaking in front of his home in Apiwtxa. \"This is not only about implementing a project. What is at stake is cultural change. This is essential to protect life, the territory and its peoples.\u201d </p><p>______</p><p>EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.</p><p>______</p><p>Indigenous groups have long argued that they are in the best position to conserve and protect forests, having been successful stewards of lands for thousands of years. Indigenous land management is increasingly a central policy discussion at climate talks as global warming worsens and other methods to protect forests, such as carbon credit schemes, have largely not been successful. </p><p>In Brazil, Indigenous territories comprise 23% of the Amazon region, which is roughly the size of South Africa and largely covered with old-growth rainforests that store large quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that drives climate change when released into the atmosphere. In 2022, only 2% of all deforestation in the Amazon happened inside Indigenous territories, most by non-Indigenous land-grabbers. In Ashaninka's Amonia territory, the deforested area today is 0.03%, underscoring the tribe's successful forest management. </p><p>Thirty-two years ago, when the Brazilian government recognized the Ashaninka\u2019s territorial rights, the area where Apiwtxa sits was a sprawling cattle farm run by non-Indigenous settlers. Loggers had degraded the remaining forest, depleting the region of mahogany and other valuable trees. Indigenous families lived scattered and in fear. With few options, some worked for farmers and loggers in slave-like conditions.</p><p>The land demarcation, which forced outsiders to leave, opened the door to reforestation and cultural rebirth. The Ashaninka transferred their main village, Apiwtxa, to an abandoned pasture in a strategic location for surveillance. In the following years, the village leadership, spearheaded by Francisco Piy\u00e3ko's father, Ant\u00f4nio, and his siblings, set up a governance system focused on the collective good and self-sufficiency, according to an article coauthored by anthropologist Carolina Comandulli and the Apiwtxa Association.</p><p>In Apiwtxa today, each one of the 80 families must take care of an area of forest that includes fruit trees and medicinal plants.

(\"Klimat X\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV:KLX)which carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets, is pleased to announce it has signed a binding agreement with the national government of Suriname to develop mangrove carbon credit and agroforestry projects. The Company has built a presence in Suriname and is actively conducting fieldwork to establish project size and feasibility.</p><p>       The Agreement identifies 2 initial mangrove carbon credit projects in the Coronie and Commewijne Districts (the 'Projects') covering at least 3,000 ha, which will be led, structured, and managed by Klimat X (the \"Company\") while exploring for other project sites.Since the signing of the Agreement in December 2022, a team led by the Company team has conducted extensive due diligence and scoping to optimize and de-risk the projects.On April 24, the Klimat X technical and field team, led by Dr. Steve Crooks from Silvestrum Climate Associates commenced fieldwork in Suriname to establish the technical foundations for measuring greenhouse gas emissions reductions.Building on the previous expeditionary trips, the team is working to evaluate the potential immediate and long-term greenhouse gas benefits from mangrove conservation and restoration from the projects.Degraded mangroves with impaired hydrology can be a significant source of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and the team will be directly measuring these emissions during the fieldwork. Interventions that restore the natural hydrology of the project sites can dramatically reduce methane emissions, generating significant volumes of carbon credits.Klimat X is also in active discussions with two significant international organizations (and prospective partners), already active in-country, to assist with elements of both civil engineering and community work that are likely to be needed in the successful delivery of the projects.Klimat X remains grateful to the Faculty of Technical Sciences at the University of Suriname for their continued insights and support for the Projects and hopes a relationship of mutual benefit will continue to strengthen with Company investment in capacity building.</p><p>CEO, Dr. James Tansey comments, \"Mangroves play a critical role in regulating climate change and in protecting coastlines from storms and sea level rise. This latest jurisdictional agreement builds on the model we have established in other countries including Mexico and Sierra Leone. We will be able to invest in the protection and restoration of these mangrove areas, reducing emissions of carbon and methane on an unprecedented scale. As recently announced, there is strong interest from buyers in these projects.\"</p><p> Background</p><p>Klimat X, through its controlled subsidiary, Pomeroon Trading (Holdings) Limited ('PTHL'), has entered into a legally binding co-operation agreement (the 'Agreement') with the Government of the Republic of Suriname. The Agreement outlines details of the co-operation agreed between the parties with regard to the protection, preservation, and rehabilitation of mangroves in Suriname, including the qualification of these projects for voluntary carbon credits and the subsequent sale and marketing of those credits. The background to the agreement acknowledged the globally leading significance of the Republic of Suriname as one of only three net negative carbon emitters globally, and the commitment of its people and Government to protecting and restoring its considerable natural endowment. Suriname has approximately 100,000 ha of mangroves, which provide critical biodiversity habitat and protect the coastline from floods and sea level rise. Following the completion of the current period of fieldwork, the Company will provide estimates of the potential scale of the carbon credit production from these interventions. Klimat X will work directly with large buyers to fund the completion of the project through a pre-purchase or investment agreement.</p><p> About Klimat X</p><p>Klimat X carries on the business of developing validated and verified carbon credits from afforestation and reforestation of degraded land areas and marine ecosystems, including mangroves, for sale into international voluntary carbon markets. In contrast to streaming and royalty companies, Klimat X works upstream as a direct owner and operator of projects, addressing a key supply constraint the current market and the rapidly growing demand for carbon credits in global voluntary and regulated markets. The Corporation intends to achieve this by investing in the exploration, restoration and management of terrestrial and marine systems that can either be protected to enhance the sequestration of greenhouse gases or restored from a degraded status to fully productive ecosystems. Klimat X will draw on the experience of a senior executive team and board that provide access into key target jurisdictions through relationships in the mining and natural resources sectors, combined with decades of experience in carbon markets. Klimat X plans to deploy capital at risk under various arrangements (including cooperation, assignment and production sharing agreements) with large landowners and governments in various suitable jurisdictions around the world.</p><p> Reader Advisory</p><p>The TSXV has in no way passed upon the merits of the Acquisition or the Project Rights Assignment Agreement and has neither approved nor disapproved the contents of this news release.</p><p>Neither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. </p><p>This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Yet the adverse effects caused by species overexploitation, changes in land and sea uses, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution, climate change and displacement of communities are putting these ecosystems under ever-increasing pressure. This means we are increasingly challenged on how to preserve natural capital while also meeting production and consumption needs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there is a solution. All stakeholders who make use of a landscape's natural resources, whether directly or indirectly, have a key role to play in maintaining the ongoing health and feasibility of that landscape. A collaborative approach is the best way to achieve global climate and biodiversity goals and to protect our landscapes - and this is where the sustainable landscape approach comes in.</p><p>What is a landscape?</p><p>There is currently no scientific consensus on the definition of a 'landscape.' South Pole considers a landscape to be a geographical space consisting of natural and/or human-modified ecosystems which are influenced by ecological, historical, political, economic and socio-cultural activities and processes.</p><p>To get the boundaries just right, the area to be considered as a landscape should be defined collectively and collaboratively by all the stakeholders involved, with a clear goal in mind of maximising positive impacts while maintaining control over the monitoring and governance processes. If a defined landscape is too small, it won't capture the breadth of activities that influence or are impacted by the natural health of the landscape. But if it's too big, it may not be useful for driving action relating to governance, ecosystem services, human living patterns, supply chains, and sustainable production.</p><p>The Sustainable Landscape Approach (SLA)</p><p>The sustainable landscape approach (SLA) is a collaborative process that integrates policies and practices for multiple land uses within a given area. This is done in order to effectively address environmental challenges and maximise positive outcomes.</p><p>The sustainable landscape approach brings together all stakeholders (landowners, businesses, governments, civil society, NGOs, investors and others) who have an influence on a specific landscape and incentivises them to partner up in working towards a common goal. The specific roles and responsibilities for the SLA are defined in an action plan, and a committee and landscape manager are also appointed to lead the coordination and the follow-up. Consensus and communal benefit should be at the heart of the process.</p><p>Ultimately, the sustainable landscape approach ensures that the landscape is considered as a broader ecosystem of activities and actors, rather than as a patchwork of individual sites and/or projects. The approach also helps address the environmental, social and political challenges commonly associated with the protection and restoration of ecosystems: by systematically coordinating the design, implementation, monitoring, and follow-up of the activities implemented in a territory by a given group of actors, the SLA seeks to reconcile agricultural, industrial, conservation, economic development and other competing land use activities..</p><p>Benefits of the SLA</p><p>Managing an area with a sustainable landscape approach can provide several key benefits, including:</p><p>Enhanced ecosystem services to store carbon, maintain watersheds and conserve biodiversity, all contributing to the local economy and to productivity in the agricultural sector.<br/>Improvement of value chains through more efficient use of resources, along with reduced pressure on the agricultural frontier on local ecosystems.<br/>Defined opportunities for technical assistance to build farmers' capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources.<br/>The design of financial mechanisms to channel investments into promoting biodiversity and reducing emissions.<br/>Better access to premium markets and potentially higher incomes from implementing sustainability protocols that are recognised by buyers.<br/>Incentives for communities to take conservation actions based on clear results.<br/>Greater recognition of all stakeholders, activities, and challenges through an inclusive governance structure.</p><p>The four pillars of sustainable landscape management</p><p>All activities implemented under the SLA - like forest conservation or restoration, the installation of solar panels, development of agroforestry and silvopastoral systems, capacity building, job creation or creating better health or education infrastructure - should fall under one of four fundamental pillars:</p><p>Governance: actions to promote transparency, participation, inclusion, and coordination in land use policies.<br/>Human well-being: actions to protect and improve quality of life across health, education and employment.<br/>Sustainable production: actions to manage supply chains by using more sustainable practices with a reduced impact on ecosystems.<br/>Natural capital: actions to protect and restore ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p><p>Such activities are generally implemented and monitored by the owner of the land area that is being managed with a sustainable landscape approach, and this landowner receives technical support from other stakeholders, including NGOs, academics and project developers. The landowner reports on progress using specific metrics and shares any lessons learned in order to improve the management of the landscape.</p><p>Can two different conservation instruments coexist?</p><p>Within a landscape, environmental projects can be leveraged to improve the local quality of life and to conserve vulnerable ecosystems, all while contributing to the fight against climate change and offering adaptation options for local communities.</p><p>Depending on a landscape's characteristics, different types of projects can be combined within a landscape's boundaries, even when those projects are associated with different environmental markets (i.e. the compliance or voluntary market). For example, a single landscape could combine a REDD+ project in a stable forest, a habitat bank for biodiversity offsets, and a water payment for ecosystem services scheme (PES).</p><p>Case study: the Alicante River Canyon</p><p>South Pole's Alicante River Canyon project is an example that brings together different project types within the same landscape.

This tropical savanna is home to the maca\u00faba, a highly adaptable oil-producing tree with a penchant for scrubbing harmful CO2 from the air. Maca\u00faba fruit yields advanced vegetable oils (AVOs) and high-protein food - and it can be 15 times more productive than soybeans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are restoring the landscape that was deforested\u2026Macau\u0301ba was native here many, many years ago,\" Felipe Morbi, S.Oleum co-founder and Agroforestry VP, said. \"Now we are bringing back these trees, and also all the other species, to restore this biodiversity.\"</p><p>S.Oleum seeks to accomplish this scientifically, using maca\u00faba and other crops in an integrated crop-livestock-forest approach, according to Morbi. The goal is to create working farms that rejuvenate degraded, low-yielding soil - and that sequester into the soil more carbon than they generate.</p><p>Science-Based Approach to Reforesting the Cerrado</p><p>\"We are looking for the balance of the system,\" Morbi said in a new SAP video. \"We will measure the amount of carbon in the soil, the moisture, the biodiversity in terms of the plants we have, and also native animals coming back to the area.\"</p><p>Toward that end, S.Oleum is starting small, but aiming big. Most of the current crop grows on a 700-hectare, or more than 1,700-acre, pilot farm. But S.Oleum intends to plant more than 65 million additional maca\u00faba trees by 2029, which would reforest 180,00 hectares - about 444,800 acres - in Brazil's southeastern state of Minas Gerais.</p><p>Over time, maca\u00faba trees also help improve the nutrient and moisture capacity of the soil, making it easier to grow other crops, according to de Blanco. And S.Oleum increases farm productivity by growing carefully chosen crops in between rows of maca\u00faba trees, such as sunflowers, peanuts, and yucas.</p><p>\"If you do it right, agriculture as a system is positive for the environment,\" de Blanco said. \"Plants that were deforested a few decades ago, they are currently in a poor state because they were depleted by poor management\u2026We believe there are better ways, and that's what we are pursuing here.\"</p><p>An innovative case in point: maca\u00faba trees increase a biome's carbon sequestration levels. Removing this greenhouse gas helps more than the planet; S.Oleum also generates revenue by selling carbon credits and building trust via its data.</p><p>Any Little Bit of Data</p><p>\"Any little thing, any generation of data that R&amp;D is currently developing, is extremely important,\" Mirelle Santos, S.Oleum Agroforestry R&amp;D manager, said. \"We want to deploy technologies as dictated by those urgent needs.\"</p><p>This could include remote sensing via drones that run fruit-recognition software, according to Santos. This would help S.Oleum gather and compile data quickly, without human error - and without sending workers, who must dress in personal protective equipment (PPE) to defend against snakes, mosquitos, the brutal Cerrado sun (even in winter), and dangerous maca\u00faba thorns, which grow even on seedlings.</p><p>S.Oleum's intricate business model combines agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, and carbon offsetting - and that leads to a lot of complexity. SAP technology will be an important differentiator for this small enterprise, as well as a foundation for its future growth.</p><p>\"We have a big project to run; so, a lot of people, a lot of machines, a lot of suppliers,\" Morbi said. \"And we need everything in the right moment, in the right way.\"</p><p>How to Best Manage ESG Metrics</p><p>\"SAP is different because it is recognized as one of the most reliable ERP systems on the market, not only based on the technology,\" de Blanco said. \"Also, because it has well-established and well-defined processes.\"</p><p>Standardizing processes was \"extremely important\" for S.Oleum both internally and to inspire customer, stakeholder, and regulatory confidence, according to de Blanco. SAP will also enable S.Oleum to run its circular enterprise as well as record, report, and act on its sustainability data.</p><p>\"We have a very integrated system, and a very circular way to produce things,\" de Blanco said. \"Finding out where waste is generated - and where it's being used - is very important to ensure the carbon intensity and the circularity of our systems at our entire site\u2026This is where SAP helps us.\"</p><p>SAP S/4HANA, SAPAriba solutions, SAP Concur solutions, and SAP SuccessFactors solutions will help standardize all of S.Oleum's processes, which will improve transparency and compliance, according to S.Oleum IT Director Marcio Propp. To help better manage and understand its myriad environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, the company has also begun implementation of SAP Sustainability Control Tower and SAP Sustainability Footprint Management.</p><p>\"It is super important that we have a very robust core system in place because it will serve as the basis for all our other processes\u2026and practically all niche applications focused on digital agriculture connect with this core with SAP,\" Propp said. \"SAP is an agribusiness market standard, and it makes perfect sense for S.Oleum to be part of this ecosystem.\"</p><p>That's a big deal because compliant, transparent ESG metrics are crucial to S.Oleum's success, according to de Blanco.</p><p>A Matter of Trust</p><p>\"Somewhere around one-third of our revenues come from carbon credits,\" de Blanco said. \"This is our, let's say, core business\u2026to convert sustainability into revenues and financial results.\"</p><p>That will require trust. SAP core technologies, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP Sustainability solutions, will help S.Oleum keep that trust, thanks to a reliable foundation of sustainability data and robust, auditable ESG metrics for reporting.</p><p>\"My advice for companies that are starting their sustainability endeavor: do it as quick as you can,\" de Blanco said. \"And do it attached to science.\"</p><p>For more information on how SAP helps companies record, report, and act on their sustainability goals, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sap.com/sustainability\">www.sap.com/sustainability</url>.</p><p>Photo Credit S.Oleum</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from SAP on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: SAP<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sap\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/sap</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: SAP</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/772986/How-High-Tech-Helps-SOleum-Deliver-ESG-Metrics-You-Can-Trust\">https://www.accesswire.com/772986/How-High-Tech-Helps-SOleum-Deliver-ESG-Metrics-You-Can-Trust</url></p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 8, 2023 / SAPHow can a three-year-old agroforestry company produce trustworthy, sustainable feedstock - raw materials for finished goods, energy, and more - while reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere?
