Game: </p><p>Disaster Scenario: Flood</p><p> Riparian wetlands built up along edges of a river provide defense from flood waters much the same as mangrove forests   avoid disturbing them.Take advantage of natural defense features by building any dikes or walls behind the wetlands - this will reduce the likelihood they will be overtopped.Try to leave as much open floodplain (and wetlands) in front of flood control infrastructure (i.e. dikes, retaining walls) as possible - this will allow flood waters to spread out and reduce the maximum flood elevation - making the infrastructure more effective. This will also allow you to reduce the number of dike and retaining wall tiles needed - useful as these are very expensive.There are a wide array of flood defenses (dikes, retaining walls) than can be built in this scenario. Thay are very expensive, however, and should only be placed in areas where it would be difficult to relocate buildings. Stronger flood defenses will be needed on the lowest laying areas.Upgrade the community center and evacuation planning.Place important community buildings in safe locations.Prioritize the removal of less resistant buildings from low lying areas. If you need to build in low lying areas, prioritize using robust buildings and materials like concrete hotels.</p><p>Disaster Scenario: Tsunami</p><p> Avoid disturbing existing coastal wetlands (mangrove, tidal marshes) as these act as natural wave breaks, attenuating wave speed and inland reach. They greatly reduce the likelihood of buildings built behind them from being swept away or severely flooded. They can also reduce the likelihood of coastal defenses such as dikes being overtopped if built behind wetlands.If you cannot avoid building on lowlands, building behind wetlands is generally safer and building your coastal defences to include them can notably reduce costs.Coastal forests, like wetlands, provide some level of defense against tsunami waves by reducing their flow rate. Building behind large forests can notably safeguard buildings though may not stop flooding entirely   don't neglect flood proofing of buildings.Coastal sand dunes can provide a largely natural defense against tsunami waves   build them up in areas where you cannot relocate buildings from low laying areas.Upgrade the community center; it has several upgrades related to disaster preparedness, including early warning systems and evacuation planning that can greatly increase the survival chances of the population.To facilitate evacuation, make sure to place community buildings (churches, hospitals, and schools) or large buildings like hotels in as low risk an area as possible while still being near the rest of the town.Remove any buildings that do not have strong enough construction to resist a tsunami.

They can include wildlife corridors, cover cropping, natural water retention measures, wetland restoration and buffer strips. </p><p>Such measures sequester carbon and foster biodiversity. They also enhance human health and well-being.

In contrast, the extraction of natural resources is included in the calculation of gross domestic product, which is an important indicator of the effectiveness of government. This must change.</p><p>Conventional approaches to accounting do not allow nature-based assets to appear on government or corporate balance sheets because, unlike engineered assets, they are not bought or sold. This discrepancy disincentivizes economic actors and governments from investing in forests, wetlands and watersheds because the investments cannot be capitalized, or yield measurable financial returns.</p><p>It is critical, then, that governments enable accounting for natural assets.</p><p>Frameworks exist for doing just that. Indeed, the Capital Coalition and the Natural Assets Initiative have developed excellent examples. In May 2022, the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board even released a consultation paper on natural resources reporting.</p><p>Authorizing the valuation of natural assets in conventional accounting would be a decision that could unlock significant investments in NbS, while still being light on public finances.</p><p>Offer biodiversity credits</p><p>Although imperfect, carbon markets have been helpful in attracting capital to fund low-carbon technologies. This capital is, however, often directed at human-made technologies, such as innovations in battery technologies needed for electrification \u2014 rather than more cost- and carbon-effective NbS. </p><p>Carbon credits motivate decarbonization through human-made infrastructure, such as through energy systems. Biodiversity credits, on the other hand, serve to enhance biodiversity, which is more far-reaching and grounded in NbS. </p><p>Such credits can work in several ways. First, companies that reduce biodiversity could offer payments to companies improving biodiversity, such as investments in nature-based infrastructure or landowners who manage their land responsibly. Alternatively, investing in certification bodies can create standards for responsibly produced products, such as wood, concrete or steel. </p><p>On Oct. 28, the International Advisory Panel on Biodiversity Credits (2024) introduced the Framework for High-Integrity Biodiversity Credit Markets to help guide the creation of a biodiversity credits market.</p><p>The framework aims to attract significant investments to conserve and restore ecosystems and biodiversity by establishing standards and monitoring systems, which should have the added bonus of tackling greenwashing.</p><p>Valuing nature</p><p>Valuing nature is not straightforward. There are no clear measures of biodiversity. Any measure of biodiversity must be sensitive to local ecosystems and local communities. It needs to build on local knowledge, especially from people who live on the land in question, such as Indigenous Peoples. </p><p>Yet, people with deep local knowledge are often excluded from such conversations, because corporations and governments generally favour Western science-based knowledge over community-based knowledge. It is critical to engage in inclusive multi-party dialogue for NbS to reach the ambition of sustainable development.</p><p>Governments must build on the progress made on carbon markets in Baku and develop an international biodiversity credit system that is based on an inclusive approach before it is too late.</p><p>As the world comes together to tackle climate change at the COP29 meeting, civil society, businesses and governments should be looking not for big solutions, but for the cheaper, quicker and often more effective nature-based alternatives. </p><p>With just a few key measures, governments can lead the way.</p><p>___</p><p>Diane-Laure Arjali\u00e8s receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and Western University.</p><p>Tima Bansal receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.  ___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The stakes in Baku are high with 2024 on track to be the hottest year recorded, the first to potentially break the 1. 5 C Paris Agreement threshold, and Canada experiencing warming rates twice the global average. Most governments, including here in Canada, are looking to options to mitigate the effects of climate change through regulations or funding new technologies. To this end, nature-based solutions (NbS) offer the most promising path forward. There are three key strategies for governments to maximize the growth (and impact) of NbS.

World leaders in Baku should take notice. What is a nature-based solution? Nature-based solutions (NbS) use nature, rather than human-made infrastructure, to mitigate climate change. They can include wildlife corridors, cover cropping, natural water retention measures, wetland restoration and buffer strips. Such measures sequester carbon and foster biodiversity. They also enhance human health and well-being. What\u2019s more, NbS can help protect human made infrastructure from the effects of climate change, such as floods, storm surges and erosion. And all these benefits can come at a fraction of the cost of traditional infrastructure.", "And all these benefits can come at a fraction of the cost of traditional infrastructure. A recent meta-study of 155 peer-reviewed articles showed that NbS were more effective than engineering solutions in attenuating hazards in 65 per cent of studies and more cost-effective in 71 per cent. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, the total global finance for NbS in 2022 reached USD $200 billion. Approximately USD $600 billion will be needed to reach climate, biodiversity and land degradation targets by 2030. Of that total investment, only 18 per cent or USD $35 billion is from the private sector.

It is embedded in corporate sustainability, supply chains, and ESG mandates.<br/>- Finance is a critical enabler, with calls for creative, localized funding models and stronger integration into ESG and investment frameworks.<br/>- Collective action is essential but complex, requiring trust, transparency, and local ownership to succeed.<br/>- Communication matters-simplifying language and storytelling are vital to engaging stakeholders, driving action and breaking out of echo chambers.<br/>- Policy frameworks must catch up, with stronger integration of water into climate adaptation plans and global governance. Scalable impact will come from localized solutions, backed by strong partnerships between government, business, and finance<br/>- AWS Standard Version 3.0 introduces streamlined requirements, deeper integration of climate and biodiversity, and new expectations for collective action and water reuse.</p><p>As the climate crisis intensifies and biodiversity loss accelerates, water stewardship is emerging not just as a sustainability imperative-but as a strategic, economic, and social necessity. At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.</p><p>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay &amp; Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.</p><p>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:</p><p>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point</p><p>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.</p><p>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.</p><p>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"</p><p>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking</p><p>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health.

Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact</p><p>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.</p><p>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"</p><p>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice</p><p>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.</p><p>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"</p><p>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice</p><p>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.</p><p>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"</p><p>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps</p><p>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.</p><p>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"</p><p>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship</p><p>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:</p><p>- Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/>- Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/>- Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/>- Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/>- Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.</p><p>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.</p><p>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change</p><p>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.</p><p>Final Thoughts</p><p>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.</p><p>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

Through TGRA,Bayer, a global enterprise with core competencies in the life science fields of agriculture and healthcare, in collaboration withGenZero, a Temasek-owned investment platform dedicated to accelerating decarbonization globally,Shell Energy India Private Limited, a subsidiary of Shell Plc and investor in nature-based solutions, are committed to reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions through sustainable agricultural practices. The 'Ae' rating reflects the project's high standalone carbon rating ('a') combined with a very high likelihood of successful project execution ('aa'). A standalone Carbon ex ante of 'a' is comparable to the highest rated ex post Soil Carbon &amp; Agriculture credits. Receiving an 'Ae', a top-quartile rating confirms a high likelihood that each TGRA credit will deliver one ton of CO2e avoidance. Speaking on the rating achieved, Suhas Joshi, IndiaCarbon Initiative Lead at Bayer said, \"We are incredibly proud of this milestone. The Ae rating is not only a validation of TGRA's scientific and operational rigor, but also a testament to the collective commitment of our alliance."]}, {"relevance_score": 32, "title": "Project to study coastal flooding, erosion on lake", "published": "2025-07-31", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As climate change transforms the environment, resulting in frequent storm surges and extreme weather events that impact municipal infrastructure and homes, a pilot project will study how to deal with coastal flooding and erosion on Lake Ontario's western shoreline.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority chief administrative officer Leilani Lee-Yates, at The Shore Hotel in Jordan, announced the launch of the Lake Ontario Coastal Resilience Pilot Project.</p><p>This four-year study will review, map and recommend improvements to the coastal shoreline of Lake Ontario from the mouth of the Niagara River in Niagara-on-the-Lake to Joshua's Creek in Oakville/Mississauga.</p><p>The lake study will cover 95 kilometres of shoreline involving the NPCA, Hamilton Conservation Authority and Conservation Halton shorelines, plus 10 coastal municipalities.</p><p>Lee-Yates said about 25 per cent of Canada's population lives in the Lake Ontario watershed, and 80 per cent of the water comes from other Great Lakes.</p><p>\"The project will provide a plan with actions for our partners to support,\" said Lee-Yates in an interview with Niagara This Week. \"It will have a clear road map for actions.

Severe rainfall events are not new, but they are becoming more frequent and costly due to human-caused climate change.</p><p>Flooding is a challenge affecting everything from economic security, to drinking water and the pursuit of truth and reconciliation. Canada must adapt to the urgent risks posed by worsening floods. Luckily, numerous pathways exist for individual Canadians to engage in collective actions to protect ourselves and our communities.</p><p>I learned the realities of flooding the hard way: by getting my socks wet when I stepped foot on my basement floor. Water from a pipe seeped behind the walls and under the waterproof floor. It caused damage that was, for a variety of reasons not covered by home insurance. However, I turned out lucky, all things considered. The average cost of a flooded basement in Canada is over $40,000.</p><p>Climate change is shifting how water moves through landscapes both in our communities and around the globe. Information and awareness is key in this world of changing conditions. However, a 2022 audit of flood risk preparedness in Ontario reported that public awareness of personal flood risk and liability is poor across the province.</p><p>Many Canadians are just one bad storm away from an unmitigated watery disaster. Floods are the most expensive and most frequent type of natural hazard in Canada. An analysis of insurance solutions for flood risk found that current residential flood risk in Canada is estimated at $2.9 billion per year. </p><p>Meanwhile, more homes in floodplain areas are becoming uninsurable due to increasing risk. Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario have the greatest number of homes at high risk of flood damage in Canada and this number will continue to grow. </p><p>There is a widening gap in Ontario between spending on infrastructure by all levels of government, and the scale of investments required to bring public assets like roads and buildings up to a state of good repair. Amid budget crunches and pressure to keep taxes low, solutions for adapting infrastructure to climate change are still chronically underfunded.</p><p>Nature-based community driven solutions have huge potential to address gaps in infrastructure, promote resilience and build ecological knowledge \u2014 often at a much reduced cost than traditional hard solutions like seawalls or embankments.  </p><p>Perpetuating injustice</p><p>Besides damaging infrastructure, flooding causes a variety of harmful effects on water quality and human health. During storms and snowmelt, runoff conveys pollutants such as plastics, road salt, fertilizers and pesticides into watercourses.</p><p>Much of Canada\u2019s stormwater infrastructure was built back when urban centres were smaller and sewers had fewer connections. These older systems have limited capacity to cope with large surges. </p><p>When water levels suddenly rise, operators are left with no option but to release overflows into waterways.

Critically, community involvement in creating green infrastructure helped ensure sustained interest in its stewardship. Our collaboration supported public education through seminars and a dedicated webpage. These resources promote individual actions to coexist with water, such as flood-proofing homes and adapting landscaping.

Some common themes that emerged were competition, skill shortages, rollback on certain EU rules, and challenging political impacts.</p><p>Germany:</p><p>Holger Hillen, HPC AG, believes there are lots of investments to be made in Germany, for construction of infrastructure and other facilities, and this is what drives their core business. This makes him hopeful for the next five years. He expects strong growth in energy connections, water infrastructure, and for sustainability to heat up again in two years, as CSRD requirements come in for more companies.</p><p>Netherlands:</p><p>Right now, one of the biggest sources of work for Antea Group's 1,700 staff in the Netherlands is working with companies to achieve their energy savings obligations in line with the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED). This sets legally binding targets for energy efficiency across different industries in the EU. Last updated in 2023, the directive now applies to more companies, Dieuwke Martens-Bakker says.</p><p>One big challenge ahead for the Netherlands, like many other European countries, is a congested electricity grid. This is hindering the ability to meet increasing electricity demands and the integration of sustainable energy production, Martens-Bakker explains. This is making decentralised energy solutions, which do not rely on the central grid, more popular in the Netherlands, and something which Antea Group is increasingly involved in. The company helps organisations analyse their energy mix and look at alternatives like local grids and recycling waste heat, she says.</p><p>Belgium:</p><p>Antea Group Belgium offers E&amp;S services in areas including permitting, environmental studies, ecology, mobility studies, and energy.

The sector faces mounting pressure: water scarcity, rising debt, and up to 15% post-harvest losses (NABARD study). In the last three years, 70% of smallholders have lost half or more of a crop, with 71% reporting severe climate impacts and incomes down 15.7% since 2022 (2024 Farmer Voice survey). Ultimately, by 2030, India is projected to see a substantial 5.8% decline in working hours - equivalent to 34 million full-time jobs - due to heat stress (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/08/income-insurance-india-climate-resilience/#:~:text=Between%202015%20and%202021%2C%20India,data%20from%20SwissRe%20and%20Aon\">WEF</url>).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, the promise of AI-driven innovation is real: investing in 15 foundational agricultural datasets could unlock $65 billion in value for Indian farmers (WEF), making food systems more resilient and profitable. According to the India Digital Agriculture Council, only 30% of Indian farmers were using digital tools-representing a vast, untapped opportunity for climate-smart transformation.</p><p>The Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund and Climate Grants Portfolio support tech ventures and nonprofits that combine technology and farmers' engagement for a more regenerative future. This means scaling reforestation, soil health, carbon markets, and nature-based solutions across India. Here are a few examples.</p><p>Mitti Labs: Transforming Rice for Climate and Livelihoods</p><p>Rice farming consumes 30% of the world's freshwater (WFP) and produces 12% of global methane emissions (WWF)-making it central to India's food and climate goals. Mitti Labs is pioneering a tech-driven approach to decarbonize rice production and reward regenerative practices.</p><p>Supported by the Regenerative Future Fund, an impact-first venture fund, Mitti Labs' AI-powered digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) platform combines satellite and sensor data with field support to help farmers adopt Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD reduces methane and water use by up to 40% while maintaining or increasing yields. According to Mitti Labs, here are a few ways they are gaining traction:</p><p>- Field results are compelling: In Telangana's Warangal, AWD cut water use by 37% while maintaining yields. In Haryana's Safidon, AWD reduced water by 19% with no yield loss. These results mean lower methane emissions, improved water conservation, and new income streams for thousands of climate-vulnerable farmers.<br/>- Marketplace leadership: Partnering with Carbon Place, Good Carbon, Ceezer, and Cloverly, Mitti Labs enables secure purchases of methane-based carbon credits for buyers globally that would like to support avoidance efforts. Its entire 2025 offset supply is fully allocated, with more set for 2026 and 2027.<br/>- Global recognition: Sylvera, a carbon ratings agency, called Mitti Labs a \"key enabler\" of methane reduction in rice (Sylvera, 2024).</p><p>As Madhuri, a Mitti Labs Field Manager in Warangal, shares, \"It is encouraging to see more and more farmers understanding our AWD programs and coming forward to join our movement.\" Community leaders echo the impact: \"One in every four farmers in Warangal is now participating.\"</p><p>Since 2023, Mitti Labs has onboarded 30,000 farmers, expanded digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) capabilities to 10 million hectares, and launched projects with partners like Syngenta Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. Their pipeline spans India and Southeast Asia, targeting 200,000+ farmers and over one million carbon avoidance credits per year. With tech and new markets, Mitti Labs is shaping the future of rice decarbonization.</p><p>Digital Green: AI for Climate-Resilient, Regenerative Farming</p><p>Digital Green is transforming agricultural advisory services for smallholder farmers through its AI-powered assistant, Farmer.Chat. This innovative platform addresses the need for timely, localized, and actionable farm and market recommendations - especially for resource-poor, low-literacy, and low-connectivity populations. Farmers and extension workers can resolve queries using voice, text, images, or video in regional languages. The platform provides crucial information such as weather forecasts, crop and pest disease warnings, and reminders for regenerative practices.</p><p>Supported by the Cisco Foundation's Climate Grant Portfolio in 2024, Farmer.Chat has reached over 460,000 smallholder farmers since its launch in 2022. Evidence shows it drives behavior changes, particularly in adopting regenerative practices like improved crop nutrition, disease management, soil health, and organic fertilization.</p><p>With women making up over 42% of India's agricultural labor force - and facing barriers like lower mobile phone ownership - Digital Green's design enables climate-smart advice to reach those who need it.</p><p>As CEO Rikin Gandhi shares, \"Thanks to partners like Cisco Foundation, we're helping build a more resilient, equitable food system-one voice, one decision, one farmer at a time.\"</p><p>Farmers for Forests: AI-Powered Monitoring for Reforestation</p><p>Farmers for Forests (F4F) is using AI to revolutionize monitoring in agroforestry practices, particularly in regions facing significant tree cover and biodiversity loss - India alone has lost 5 million trees in two decades. With support from the Cisco Foundation's Climate Grants Portfolio, F4F is developing an open-source AI platform using drone and satellite data for scalable, accurate monitoring.</p><p>The platform detects even small trees under four feet - often missed by traditional satellite models - and monitors carbon sequestration and irrigation infrastructure. It integrates computer vision models like Meta's Detectron-2 and DeepForest, plus AI trained on tree datasets for species classification and biomass estimation. These tools enable carbon estimation and biodiversity mapping, supporting holistic ecological restoration.</p><p>F4F's vision is to enable high-integrity, data-backed reforestation and agroforestry across one million hectares by 2030. Their technology empowers grassroots implementers-especially smallholder and tribal communities-with transparent, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring, fostering improved tree survival, enhanced biodiversity, and the creation of jobs. The platform's focus on vulnerable farmers enables AI-driven insights to translate into tangible benefits like increased water security, improved soil health, and greater resilience through efficient resource management and carbon sequestration.</p><p>Harnessing AI for Agriculture in India</p><p>In addition to the Regenerative Future Fund and the Climate Grant Portfolio, Cisco's India CSR program is also working to support the agritech startup ecosystem in India through Krishi Mangal (with Social Alpha ), supporting startups like TraceX (advanced AI-ML supply chain compliance and deforestation monitoring), Satyukt Analytics (satellite and AI-powered insights for agriculture) and Jaljeevika (AI-driven chatbots for aquaculture, boosting productivity and traceability).</p><p>Cisco and the Cisco Foundation's holistic investment strategy aligns with global recommendations: build digital infrastructure, data ecosystems, and scalable AI applications for India's 150 million smallholders, building on AI's 40% growth rate in the last five years ( WEF ).

Glaciers are another major contributor to summer water flows in B.C., but they are losing their ability to recover mass during the winter.</p><p>\"It's really important to recognize that water management is a highly complex thing,\" Anderson said. \"And there are many different competing needs and users who need water at different times of the year.\"</p><p>But he also cautioned against the view that building dams upriver is a solution by itself. Downstream uses may also need to be considered, and a more comprehensive management plan for entire watersheds needs to be implemented, Anderson said.</p><p>Parkes said his farm has spent millions of dollars on technology to improve water-use efficiency, such as upgrading irrigators and using ground sensors.

The initiative brings together various Kenyan partners from government, non-government and civil society organizations as well as the private sector, with a particular focus on empowering women-led and youth-led organizations. Cascadia is contributing its expertise in engineering, biology and markets to support Kenyan seaweed farmers. Our goal is to comprehensively assess the entire seaweed value chain in Kenya and provide recommendations for improvements that can lead to greater prosperity for the seaweed farmers on the ground,\" said Jennifer O'Neill, senior project manager of Cascadia's nature-based solutions division. One of the key interventions involves designing a land-based nursery to provide high-quality seed stock to farmers. This nursery will function as a biobank, focusing on developing more resilient seaweed crops. Furthermore, Cascadia plans to bring nurseries closer to the water, enabling farmers to manage their own seed supply more efficiently and at a larger scale. Beyond production, Cascadia is also focused on improving market access for the farmers. The company is exploring the potential of bringing a Kenyan-made seaweed-based biostimulant into domestic and regional markets."]}, {"relevance_score": 23, "title": "Saanich teachers craft free urban streams curriculum", "published": "2025-05-01", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new free curriculum created by a pair of Saanich educators builds on a nationwide, nature-based initiative to keep students immersed in outdoor wonderment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While many lesson plans \u2013 that adhere to B.C.Ministry of Education requirements \u2013 come at a cost to teachers, the BC Urban Streams and Watersheds is a free resource.

The sector faces mounting pressure: water scarcity, rising debt, and up to 15% post-harvest losses (NABARD study). In the last three years, 70% of smallholders have lost half or more of a crop, with 71% reporting severe climate impacts and incomes down 15.7% since 2022 (2024 Farmer Voice survey). Ultimately, by 2030, India is projected to see a substantial 5.8% decline in working hours - equivalent to 34 million full-time jobs - due to heat stress (WEF).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, the promise of AI-driven innovation is real: investing in 15 foundational agricultural datasets could unlock $65 billion in value for Indian farmers (WEF), making food systems more resilient and profitable. According to the India Digital Agriculture Council, only 30% of Indian farmers were using digital tools-representing a vast, untapped opportunity for climate-smart transformation.</p><p>The Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund and Climate Grants Portfolio support tech ventures and nonprofits that combine technology and farmers' engagement for a more regenerative future. This means scaling reforestation, soil health, carbon markets, and nature-based solutions across India. Here are a few examples.</p><p>Mitti Labs: Transforming Rice for Climate and Livelihoods</p><p>Rice farming consumes 30% of the world's freshwater (WFP) and produces 12% of global methane emissions (WWF)-making it central to India's food and climate goals. Mitti Labs is pioneering a tech-driven approach to decarbonize rice production and reward regenerative practices.</p><p>Supported by the Regenerative Future Fund, an impact-first venture fund, Mitti Labs' AI-powered digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) platform combines satellite and sensor data with field support to help farmers adopt Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD reduces methane and water use by up to 40% while maintaining or increasing yields. According to Mitti Labs, here are a few ways they are gaining traction: //st * Field results are compelling: In Telangana's Warangal, AWD cut water use by 37% while maintaining yields. In Haryana's Safidon, AWD reduced water by 19% with no yield loss. These results mean lower methane emissions, improved water conservation, and new income streams for thousands of climate-vulnerable farmers. * Marketplace leadership: Partnering with Carbon Place, Good Carbon, Ceezer, and Cloverly, Mitti Labs enables secure purchases of methane-based carbon credits for buyers globally that would like to support avoidance efforts. Its entire 2025 offset supply is fully allocated, with more set for 2026 and 2027. * Global recognition: Sylvera, a carbon ratings agency, called Mitti Labs a \"key enabler\" of methane reduction in rice (Sylvera, 2024).</p><p>As Madhuri, a Mitti Labs Field Manager in Warangal, shares, \"It is encouraging to see more and more farmers understanding our AWD programs and coming forward to join our movement.\" Community leaders echo the impact: \"One in every four farmers in Warangal is now participating.\"</p><p>Since 2023, Mitti Labs has onboarded 30,000 farmers, expanded digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) capabilities to 10 million hectares, and launched projects with partners like Syngenta Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. Their pipeline spans India and Southeast Asia, targeting 200,000+ farmers and over one million carbon avoidance credits per year. With tech and new markets, Mitti Labs is shaping the future of rice decarbonization.</p><p>Digital Green: AI for Climate-Resilient, Regenerative Farming</p><p>Digital Green is transforming agricultural advisory services for smallholder farmers through its AI-powered assistant, Farmer.Chat. This innovative platform addresses the need for timely, localized, and actionable farm and market recommendations - especially for resource-poor, low-literacy, and low-connectivity populations. Farmers and extension workers can resolve queries using voice, text, images, or video in regional languages. The platform provides crucial information such as weather forecasts, crop and pest disease warnings, and reminders for regenerative practices.</p><p>Supported by the Cisco Foundation's Climate Grant Portfolio in 2024, Farmer.Chat has reached over 460,000 smallholder farmers since its launch in 2022. Evidence shows it drives behavior changes, particularly in adopting regenerative practices like improved crop nutrition, disease management, soil health, and organic fertilization.</p><p>With women making up over 42% of India's agricultural labor force - and facing barriers like lower mobile phone ownership - Digital Green's design enables climate-smart advice to reach those who need it.</p><p>As CEO Rikin Gandhi shares, \"Thanks to partners like Cisco Foundation, we're helping build a more resilient, equitable food system-one voice, one decision, one farmer at a time.\"</p><p>Farmers for Forests: AI-Powered Monitoring for Reforestation</p><p>Farmers for Forests (F4F) is using AI to revolutionize monitoring in agroforestry practices, particularly in regions facing significant tree cover and biodiversity loss - India alone has lost 5 million trees in two decades. With support from the Cisco Foundation's Climate Grants Portfolio, F4F is developing an open-source AI platform using drone and satellite data for scalable, accurate monitoring.</p><p>The platform detects even small trees under four feet - often missed by traditional satellite models - and monitors carbon sequestration and irrigation infrastructure. It integrates computer vision models like Meta's Detectron-2 and DeepForest, plus AI trained on tree datasets for species classification and biomass estimation. These tools enable carbon estimation and biodiversity mapping, supporting holistic ecological restoration.</p><p>F4F's vision is to enable high-integrity, data-backed reforestation and agroforestry across one million hectares by 2030. Their technology empowers grassroots implementers-especially smallholder and tribal communities-with transparent, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring, fostering improved tree survival, enhanced biodiversity, and the creation of jobs. The platform's focus on vulnerable farmers enables AI-driven insights to translate into tangible benefits like increased water security, improved soil health, and greater resilience through efficient resource management and carbon sequestration.</p><p>Harnessing AI for Agriculture in India</p><p>In addition to the Regenerative Future Fund and the Climate Grant Portfolio, Cisco's India CSR program is also working to support the agritech startup ecosystem in India through Krishi Mangal (with Social Alpha ), supporting startups like TraceX (advanced AI-ML supply chain compliance and deforestation monitoring), Satyukt Analytics (satellite and AI-powered insights for agriculture) and Jaljeevika (AI-driven chatbots for aquaculture, boosting productivity and traceability).</p><p>Cisco and the Cisco Foundation's holistic investment strategy aligns with global recommendations: build digital infrastructure, data ecosystems, and scalable AI applications for India's 150 million smallholders, building on AI's 40% growth rate in the last five years ( WEF ).

Through this exclusive agreement, which commenced in 2022, Anew markets RMG on behalf of CNX and advises CNX on emerging monetization opportunities for RMG environmental attributes.</p><p>\"RMG represents one of the most impactful and scalable decarbonization tools available today,\" said Randy Lack, President at Anew Climate. \"We are proud to continue our collaboration with CNX, which supports the next generation of methane capture projects and will continue to drive adoption of RMG across sectors.\"</p><p>RMG is currently recognized under several state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado, and Illinois. In 2024, Argonne National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy subsidiary, integrated RMG into the federal GREET model, enabling RMG to qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act's Section 45V and 45Z tax credit programs, further supporting the environmental benefits linked to RMG.</p><p>\"We believe RMG represents a unique opportunity to scale methane abatement while producing reliable, low-carbon energy,\" said Alan Shepard, CNX President and Chief Financial Officer. \"We value our exclusive collaboration with Anew, as together we've demonstrated the commercial value of this resource. This contract extension ensures continued investment in the capture and deployment of RMG across new projects that will reduce environmental impacts for decades to come.\"</p><p>With over three years of success in bringing RMG to market, Anew and CNX have established this low-carbon intensity gas as a trusted, high-impact decarbonization solution. This extension of their exclusive agreement will allow continued project development and ensure that RMG continues to create long-term value, delivering measurable environmental benefits across multiple markets.</p><p>About Anew Climate<br/>Anew Climate, LLC, is a global leader in diverse climate solutions built on the principles of transparency and accountability.

(\"Ostrom Climate\" or the \"Company\"), a global carbon project developer and climate solutions company, announced a Cooperation Agreement with Klima 1.5 Corp (\"Klima\"), a carbon management company in the Philippines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ostrom Climate and Klima have committed to producing a conceptual plan and feasibility study for nature-based solutions (NBS) carbon projects in the Philippines, particularly in Mindanao, the southernmost major island in the country and the second largest, after Luzon. This strategic alignment aims to support project execution and maximize environmental and economic benefits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Strategic Focus on Afforestation, Reforestation &amp;Revegetation (ARR) Projects</p><p>Both Ostrom Climate and Klima will focus on developing NBS carbon projects that utilize natural processes and ecosystems to capture and store carbon, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting biodiversity. The key focus of the Cooperation Agreement centers around Afforestation, Reforestation &amp;Revegetation (ARR) projects, which are essential for capturing and storing carbon, enhancing biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development.</p><p>The Philippines, with its rich biodiversity and vast natural resources, presents significant NBS opportunities. Mindanao, which spans over 9.75 million hectares, is particularly promising due to its extensive forest cover and diverse ecosystems. The target project areas are primarily active logging sites with licenses and management plans in place.</p><p>These initiatives will not only contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but will also support local communities through enhanced livelihoods and resilience to climate change. Management believes that the development of NBS can serve as a model for similar projects across the Philippines, driving national and global climate goals.</p><p>Jane Boles, International Land Use Director at Ostrom Climate, said \"Our deepening partnership with Klima is a testament to our shared commitment to sustainable development and climate action. The combined expertise and resources of both organizations will enable us to deliver high-quality carbon projects that benefit both the environment and local communities in the Philippines.\"</p><p>Scope and Responsibilities</p><p>The agreement outlines the responsibilities of each party in identifying and developing potential project areas. Klima will continue to manage local stakeholder engagement, provide legal and regulatory support, and ensure the timely execution of project management duties. Ostrom Climate will bring its technical expertise, socio-environmental assessments, and economic modeling to the partnership, ensuring that all projects meet high standards of environmental performance and financial viability. Management believes that the agreement will also pave the way for potential joint ventures, subject to favorable feasibility study results and corporate approvals.</p><p>Expanding Ostrom Climate's Established Presence in the Philippines</p><p>On June 5, 2024, Ostrom Climate unveiled its evolved business strategy to focus on high-quality carbon project development, aiming to leverage the anticipated exponential growth of carbon markets by 2050. This strategic shift involved transitioning from a project development and carbon management consultancy to a lead equity partner in carbon projects. A significant initiative under this strategy was the launch of a flagship Climate-Smart Agriculture project in the Philippines. In collaboration with the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) in the Philippines, the Company announced the Upper Pampanga River Climate-Smart Agriculture Rice Project (UPRIIS).</p><p>The UPRIIS project is set to transform rice cultivation across approximately 100,000 hectares in Central Luzon, Philippines. By utilizing Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) practices, the project aims to reduce methane emissions by up to 48% per hectare, aligning with sustainable water management practices and global climate goals. According to the European Commission, methane is estimated to be between 28 to 84 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere versus carbon dioxide (CO2).</p><p>Building on the foundation laid by the UPRIIS project, the expanded cooperation agreement with Klima will enable Ostrom Climate to leverage its established resources and presence in the Philippines. This larger footprint will provide Ostrom Climate with operating leverage to execute more high-quality carbon projects across the country. Management believes that the collaboration with local partners and recognition by government authorities and the country's largest industrial players will solidify Ostrom Climate's capacity to drive substantial environmental impact through innovative and sustainable solutions.</p><p>\"The collaboration with Klima represents a significant step forward in our mission to drive impactful climate action, adding to our established Climate-Smart Agriculture presence in the country,\" said Phil Cull, CEO of Ostrom Climate. \"By widening our presence in the Philippines, we will be better positioned to develop and implement more comprehensive solutions that will address both environmental and socio-economic challenges.\"</p><p>About Klima 1.5 Corp.</p><p>Klima is the Ayala Group's platform for its carbon management business through nature-based solutions.

The portfolio therefore decarbonized much faster than anticipated, and La Caisse reported a nearly 50% reduction in its carbon footprint, while over the same period, global emissions increased by 6%.</p><p>To keep advancing toward its goal of having a carbon-neutral portfolio in 2050, LaCaisse is now aiming for $400billion in climate action investments by 2030. This strategy includes investments in companies committed to decarbonizing their activities, as well as investments in climate solutions. These solutions consist of assets that facilitate the decarbonization ofthe economy, such as low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and other products and services.</p><p>\"Today, we are reaffirming our sustainable investing convictions because they are at the heart of our fiduciary responsibility. We are demonstrating even greater ambition by going beyond calculating our portfolio's carbon emissions to work even harder on transitioning the real economy across all sectors by encouraging the companies we invest in to adopt clear and credible decarbonization plans.

Open Road Impact, a newly created non-profit, is the successor to the Open Road Impact Fund (ORIF), a fixed-term investment fund, which will wind down as planned in 2025. The organization also officially rebranded away from Open Road Alliance to 'Open Road Impact' as part of its move to a not-for-profit model. This new non-profit structure allows Open Road to keep impact at the forefront of its work and double down on its catalytic investment approach as the organization scales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As the world becomes more uncertain, philanthropy has an obligation to move quickly and fix things. In Open Road's case, our hybrid philanthropic and investment approach allows us to maximize our impact with every dollar we deploy,\" says Open Road's Founder, philanthropist Laurie Michaels.</p><p>As a 501(c)(3) organization, Open Road can now aggregate donations, grants, \"PRI\" investments, and other charitable contributions to advance advocacy and innovative partnerships strategies. For example, earlier this year, Open Road received grant funding to support former grantees of USAID's Development Innovation Ventures portfolio. In addition to these new strategic initiatives, Open Road Impact will continue the core strategy previously offered by the Open Road Impact Fund-- fast, flexible bridge loans and plans to expand its reach to help \"unstick\" capital across the impact ecosystem.</p><p>\"Moving to a non-profit model affords us the ability to be much more flexible with regards to where and when we deploy our capital,\" said Caroline Bressan, CEO of Open Road Impact. \"Open Road is purposely embracing an impact-first, philanthropic hybrid model that allows us to prioritize impact, take calculated risks and offer faster, more flexible capital to keep vital projects on track. We are hopeful that Open Road can serve as an example to the industry to reprioritize the original tenets of impact investing and are proud of the social and environmental impact we have had around the globe.\"</p><p>With support from a number of leading impact firms, such as Ceniarth and Blue Haven Initiative, Open Road is set to seamlessly pick up where the last fund ended. Adopting an evergreen non-profit structure to keep their bridge loans in the market in perpetuity, Open Road has reemphasized the importance of prioritizing impact for the organizations and end-beneficiaries they fund.</p><p>\"This new Open Road structure is helping us to ensure that mission-driven organizations around the world stay on track, especially as we are all navigating uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical events across the impact ecosystem,\" added Bressan.</p><p>Open Road Impact Fund Five-Year Impact Report<br/>Between 2020 and 2025, the fixed-term Open Road Impact Fund stepped in to support borrowers as they navigated through the world's unexpected events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a pullback of private foreign investment in Africa and the war in Ukraine. Open Road Impact has continued this strategy most recently, by providing essential bridge capital to mission driven organizations affected by the USAID funding freeze.</p><p>Open Road Impact Fund's five-year impact report details how since 2020, ORIF disbursed $54 million over 94 loans, keeping $549 million of committed funding on track.

In the UAE and broader GCC region, this urgency is amplified by a unique mix of environmental sensitivity, ambitious development agendas, and climate-related risks. That's where \"building with nature\" comes in, a concept that is both innovative and deeply rooted in ancient wisdom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At Terra Nexus, this isn't just a philosophy, it's our practice. As an environmental consultancy firm specializing in infrastructure and the built environment, we help clients align growth with ecological stewardship, delivering real-world solutions that balance environmental priorities with development objectives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What Does \"Building with Nature\" Really Mean?</p><p>At its core, building with nature means designing infrastructure and urban developments in ways that harmonize with natural systems rather than working against them. It's about making strategic decisions that:</p><p>- Minimize environmental disruption<br/>- Preserve or enhance ecosystems<br/>- Build climate resilience into infrastructure<br/>- Unlock long-term benefits for both people and the planet</p><p>Globally, the construction sector is one of the largest contributors to climate change and resource depletion:</p><p>- The 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction (UNEP/GlobalABC) highlights that in 2021, the sector was responsible for over 34% of global energy demand and about 37% of energy- and process-related CO\u2082 emissions.<br/>- Climate Action Accelerator reports that the buildings sector (both construction and operation) accounted for 36% of global energy consumption in 2020, which aligns with the 30-32% range commonly cited<br/>- It is responsible for over 50% of raw material extraction worldwide (EU Analysis).</p><p>This scale of impact means our industry holds powerful potential for positive change. Read more about Green Building Certification here and the Top Green Building Benefits.</p><p>Localizing the Approach: The UAE and GCC Context</p><p>Across the Gulf region, massive infrastructure and urban planning projects are reshaping coastlines, deserts, and mountains capes. From NEOM to new waterfront masterplans in the UAE, growth is happening at an unprecedented pace. This makes environmental planning more essential than ever.</p><p>At Terra Nexus, we specialize in embedding environmental intelligence early in the development lifecycle. Our projects range from mixed-use mega-developments on thousands of acres to localized upgrades like improving marine water quality in a coastal marina.</p><p>Key point: Early involvement is critical. When we are brought into a project during the planning and design phase, we can make the most meaningful impact, steering decisions that avoid sensitive habitats, reduce construction impacts, and improve long-term sustainability outcomes.</p><p>Real-World Examples: Building with Nature in Action:</p><p>UAE Coastal Development Masterplan</p><p>In a confidential but large-scale coastal development in the UAE, Terra Nexus provided ecological mapping and strategic advice on land use. Our goal: identify which areas were suitable for development and which should be preserved due to environmental value.</p><p>Results:</p><p>- Protected kilometers of seagrass beds and coral reefs<br/>- Conserved ecologically valuable land from being cleared<br/>- Integrated blue-green infrastructure to mitigate flood risk and cool urban microclimates</p><p>By applying geospatial analysis and ecological assessments, we helped the project team design a world-class destination with a minimized environmental footprint.</p><p>Mountain Hospitality Destination in Saudi Arabia</p><p>In a mountainous, forested region of Saudi Arabia, Terra Nexus led the environmental framework for a new hospitality and residential masterplan. Despite its remote location, the project presented ecological challenges: flood-prone zones, erosion risks, and forested areas at risk of being cleared.</p><p>Some of the solutions that we implemented on the project included:</p><p>- Avoiding high-risk areas and integrating erosion protection measures<br/>- Creating ecological corridors for wildlife movement and habitat connectivity<br/>- Developing a native planting palette tailored to the site's climate and soil<br/>- Enhancing forest preservation within the development envelope</p><p>This case shows how even complex sites with rugged terrains can benefit from an approach that works with, not against, natural features.</p><p>Retrofitting Nature into Existing Projects</p><p>While early planning is ideal, building with nature isn't limited to greenfield sites. Even in already-developed areas, upgrades and rehabilitation projects can bring environmental and social value.</p><p>For example, we partnered with engineers to improve water circulation in a small UAE marina where stagnation had reduced water quality. With minor engineered interventions, marine health improved, benefiting both environmental quality and overall user experience.</p><p>In these retrofit scenarios, phasing and stakeholder coordination are key. Creative thinking, combined with empathy for operational realities, helps deliver win-win outcomes.</p><p>Key Benefits of Building with Nature</p><p>Whether you're working in the UAE or halfway around the world, here are five compelling reasons to adopt a building with nature strategy:</p><p>- Lower capital and operational costs - Leveraging natural topography, materials, and systems can reduce the need for expensive earthworks or engineered infrastructure.<br/>- Enhanced climate resilience - Nature-based designs reduce vulnerability to flooding, erosion, and extreme heat.<br/>- Improved livability and user experience - Green spaces, natural shade, and biodiversity improve wellbeing for residents and visitors alike.<br/>- Regulatory readiness - In regions like the UAE and KSA, environmental permitting is mandatory. Building with nature ensures compliance and competitive advantage.<br/>- Positive brand and investor perception - Sustainable, eco-sensitive developments are increasingly attractive to both stakeholders and the public.</p><p>This approach also makes business sense. Developers benefit from cost savings, long-term durability, and market differentiation.</p><p>Challenges, and How We Overcome Them</p><p>Implementing this philosophy isn't without hurdles:</p><p>- Speed of development: In the GCC, projects move quickly. You need nimble, adaptive strategies.<br/>- Changing mindsets: Some stakeholders remain rooted in traditional \"hard\" engineering methods.<br/>- Budget concerns: Upfront costs may appear high, even if long-term savings exist.</p><p>Our response:</p><p>- Use data visualization and GIS tools to show clear environmental risks and solutions.<br/>- Present a business case alongside ecological benefits.<br/>- Ensure recommendations are feasible, grounded in regulatory context, and matched to available resources.<br/>- Engage with design teams as collaborators, not enforcers, building trust and shared vision.</p><p>Why Local Expertise Matters</p><p>Environmental conditions are highly contextual. Soil, water, climate, regulations, community norms, these differ not only country to country but even city to city. That's why local knowledge is vital.</p><p>At Terra Nexus, our team understands:</p><p>- The intricacies of the region's unique climate, native species, and marine habitats<br/>- How to navigate permits and approvals with local authorities<br/>- The realities of contracting, supply chains, and land-use constraints</p><p>Partnering with Inogen Alliance gives us access to global tools and peer expertise, but it's our local insight that ensures success on the ground.</p><p>Final Takeaways</p><p>If you're just starting your journey into building with nature, here are two simple but powerful pieces of advice:</p><p>- Keep an open mind.

It is also true of my own country as well. But this is a new day. It is a New Era. And I am proud to say that the United States has done more to promote clean energy and reduce carbon pollution in the last eight months than at any other time in our history.</p><p><br/><br/>SH: In 2009, then US President Barack Obama addressed the United Nations on the danger of climate change and his plan to address it. Last week, 16 years later, the Trump administration made a very different announcement.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>LEE ZELDIN: Yeah, actually, later today, we're going to be making a big announcement in Indiana. And something that happened back in the Obama administration, 2009, was that they put forward this regulation called the endangerment finding. What's the significance? How big is the endangerment finding? Well, repealing it will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America. So it's kind of a big deal.<br/><br/>SH: Lee Zeldin is the new Trump-appointed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator. He was talking on the conservative American podcast Ruthless, announcing the plan to repeal the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. That's a scientific finding that's been at the heart of the US action to fight climate change. Scientists in both the US and in Canada say the repeal will have major consequences for the fight against climate change. Scott Saleska is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. Good morning.<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: Good morning, Sean.<br/><br/>SH: We'll get to the specifics in a moment, but what do you make of this news from the Trump administration?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: As we can see all around us, the signs of climate change are upon us, from increased wildfires to heat waves to droughts to seemingly more intense storms. And this is just the beginning of what we'll see if climate change is not limited. And the Trump administration here in the United States is taking a step backward and trying to pull back a whole array of climate change related regulations and policies. And so it's very concerning, obviously.<br/><br/>SH: You said this is just the beginning. What do you mean by that?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: I mean, the things that we are seeing in terms of more intense wildfires, more heat waves, more extreme events in our weather, overall hotter conditions is just the beginning of what we will see if steps are not taken to limit contributions to that problem. And so sometimes, you hear people say, well, this is just the new normal. And I respond to that by saying, well, this isn't the new normal. The new normal is going to be worse than this.<br/><br/>SH: What is the endangerment finding?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: Yeah, so this is getting into the details of what's going on legally. In order to place some of these regulations, in particular, limits from automobiles, back in the early 2000s, the EPA promulgated what is called the endangerment finding, which is just a legal finding that says that the administrator of the EPA judges that greenhouse gases are air pollutants that contribute to the problem of endangering public health or welfare because of climate change. And what the law says specifically is that the head of the EPA shall, by regulation, prescribe standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant, which in his judgement cause or contribute to air pollution, which, and the key phrase is, may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. So once you've made a determination that there's a reasonable anticipation of endangerment, it doesn't require certainty, it doesn't require absolute proof, it just requires that it's reasonable to be worried that there might be endangerment. And that standard in terms of the science is very clear. It is reasonable to anticipate endangerment. It\u2019s much more than just reasonable, but it certainly meets that standard for regulation. But what they're trying to do now is to somehow reverse that finding, which would be impossible to do as a matter of science, more or less, because reversing it on its merits would mean making the case that it is unreasonable to anticipate that there might be endangerment from climate change. And even whatever level of uncertainty you might think is still associated with climate change, and there are, you know, there are uncertainties in the details, even though the big picture is very clear, that doesn't make any sense to say it's unreasonable to anticipate danger from these changes. We're already seeing those changes, so that ship has sailed.<br/><br/>SH: What kind of specific regulations resulted from the endangerment finding?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: Well, the first one was limits on emissions from automobiles, and particularly increases in the standards for, mileage standards for cars. And they also then a few years later, in 2016, made a similar endangerment finding for emissions from aircraft. They're in the process now of implementing emission limits on power plants, which is also being proposed for repeal by the Trump administration. So these are all limits that are important, you know, an important first step for contributing to these problems. It's just the first step. It's really frustrating that even every time we try to take a first step like this, there's this reversal. So it's, it's a concern.<br/><br/>SH: Why is the EPA proposing to repeal it? What's their rationale?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: Well, they've said a number of different things, and I don't think they would legally stand up, at least in the old court system in the US. I don't know about right now, but one of the things they've said is that it's too uncertain to regulate these. The uncertainty is not significant, or the certainty of the contribution of greenhouse gases is not significant, where they've sort of defined significance in a way that has never been, hasn't been used before. But US, say just from a power plant, US contributes about 5% of total global emissions to climate change. And you might say, well, 5% is not that much, but 5% all by itself at this stage would be a significant contribution to causing climate change that would be regulatable if it was all by itself. And so to say that, you know, the US historically has been the single biggest contributor as a country to climate change. And to say that somehow, emissions from these automobiles or power plants is not significant when those are some of the biggest contributors to US emission of greenhouse gases, and the US itself historically is the single biggest nation. If that is not significant, then there is no level. That would be significant and no way in which it would be possible to regulate a whole array of air pollution problems. And this is actually, a concern of ours is that that's actually what the goal of this administration is, is to basically stop as much regulation as possible that is protecting the environment across the board, not just with regard to climate change.<br/><br/>SH: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin again on the Ruthless podcast talked about the cost of the existing regulations under the endangerment finding. Take a listen.<br/><br/>SOUNDCLIP<br/><br/>LEE ZELDIN: I mean, most Americans, we care about the environment. We want clean air, land and water. Conservatives love the environment, want to be good stewards of the environment. There are people who then, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country.<br/><br/>SH: Lee Zeldin says repealing the endangerment finding will save, quote, trillions. What do you make of that?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: I think that's just misleading hocus pocus. I mean, economic studies after economic studies show that we can mitigate climate change in a rational, economically rational way. Already, the alternatives from solar to wind to, as a transition, sort of gas-fired systems are cheaper than coal plants. So there's no new coal plants being ordered to be built, which is the basis for a lot of greenhouse gas emissions and the basis for historically, most of our electricity generation. The Trump administration is actually putting roadblocks in the way of private industry who wants to build alternative energy power plants. So they're taking steps that are at odds with the claim that this is somehow going to save money. In fact, it\u2019s going to be the other way around if, you know, if a conservative administration is taking steps to interfere with the private market that wants to build more of these alternative energy systems, solar and wind, which are much cheaper these days than coal or nuclear, certainly much cheaper than coal and many of the sources that are contributing to greenhouse gases.<br/><br/>SH: Are Americans paying attention? How do they feel about what's happening?<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: There's so many things happening. I think that's a good question. There is clearly strong interest, as Lee Zeldin himself referred to in that quote that you just played. Americans want there to be, and I think not just Americans, globally, this is a global problem. People want to do something about climate change and think we should be doing something about climate change, and we can. And so I hope the concern will, people will see that this is a problem and sort of stand up against this, these changes, which are anti-science, anti-public interest, anti-economic growth.<br/><br/>SH: Scott, thanks for talking to us.<br/><br/>SCOTT SALESKA: My pleasure. Thank you.<br/><br/>SH: Scott Saleska is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona. We reached him in Michigan. Sarah Burch is a professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Management at the University of Waterloo, a Canada Research Chair in Sustainability Governance and Innovation, and the Executive Director of the Waterloo Climate Institute. She also works with the IPCC, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Sarah, hello.<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Hello, good morning.<br/><br/>SH: You're a climate scientist here in Canada. How are you feeling about this news?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: I have mixed feelings, of course. I mean, I think that this is sort of a blatant disregard of incredibly abundant science and honestly, common sense. Canada is in a slightly different boat, I guess, certainly. We are making some progress reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, but we are moving much too slowly as well. So, you know, we've seen that Canada is last among the G7 in its progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We\u2019re just not moving quickly enough. And we're the only country in that group whose emissions have actually gone up since 1990 instead of going down. They've come down since 2005, and that's really, really important progress, and they're slowly inching down each year. But we've committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, you know, to between 40 and 45% by 2030, and we\u2019re moving too slowly to reach that goal at this point.<br/><br/>SH: Why does it matter to Canada if the US does this?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, we feel the impacts of climate change here in Canada. You know, 10 or 15 years ago, we used to talk about this as something that might unfold, you know, 50 years from now or 100 years from now or in places far, far away. And as we see this summer and the last several summers, the impacts of climate change are already unfolding now in Canada. You know, for instance, you can recall the distant past of 2024 when the, you know, raging forest fires and other climate change impacts cost more than $8 billion in insured losses. That was triple the year before, and 12 times what we paid in the sort of average decade prior to that. So the costs of climate change are escalating astronomically, and we have to be part of a, you know, a collective in dealing with that. We can't just reduce our emissions here in Canada and expect the impacts to decline. You know, we have to get on board together.<br/><br/>SH: You worked on the IPCC's latest climate change report. What did that assessment tell us?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, it was a mixed bag. There were some not so great findings and some more positive signals. So on the not so great side, the IPCC found that we are not on track to reducing our emissions at the pace and scale we'd need to limit warming to 1.5 or even two degrees above those pre-industrial average temperatures. And that's our goal. We want to manage warming, limit warming to that level so that we don't enter sort of a deeply uncertain and heavily impacted world. So we're not on track. We're not moving fast enough.<br/><br/>SH: So what\u2019s causing us to not move fast enough?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, in Canada, there's a couple of different answers to that question. One is, of course, that we have an enormous oil and gas industry that's responsible for about a quarter of our emissions here in Canada. And those emissions from that sector have typically gone up and that sector has grown. They've ever so slightly come down in the last couple of years. Our population is also growing here, this sort of thing. So those are some of the main, main reasons. But the positive side of the IPCC findings, which are so important to keep in mind, is that we now have the solutions to climate change, the solutions to greenhouse gas emissions in every sector, in every climate. And some countries actually are reducing their emissions fast enough. So we have pathways to follow. We're not inventing our way out of this as we go.<br/><br/>SH: Without the US, how effective will efforts from Canada and the rest of the world be when it comes to preventing the world from reaching that 1.5 Degree Celsius limit?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, it's unavoidable that the United States is an important part of the equation globally when we're, you know, collectively trying to ratchet down our emissions quickly. But I would say that, you know, the renewable energy transition is already underway. It's underway in the United States. It\u2019s underway globally. You know, China installed more renewable energy capacity last year than the rest of the world combined. So that process is already underway. The markets are reflecting that. Renewable energy is cheaper in many places now than fossil fuels. So I don't believe that this will halt efforts at all to address climate change. It's an added challenge, certainly, and makes the efforts of the rest of us even more important. But more importantly, I think, here in Canada, we need to choose solutions to climate change that, you know, tackle multiple problems simultaneously. We can use it as an opportunity. We also are facing a biodiversity crisis. We want to improve public health. And, you know, things like nature-based solutions, bringing nature back into cities, using wetlands to cushion us from floods instead of just building a giant wall, you know, these sorts of solutions can actually, you know, help us with biodiversity, help us with physical health and make our communities more beautiful. And we want those things. So I think we can do those with or without the United States.<br/><br/>SH: How is the global community reacting to this decision by the US?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, this is somewhat ironic because I was just working with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change a week and a half ago, during which a really landmark decision came down from the International Court of Justice, the ICJ, saying that countries needed to make every available effort to address climate change, that it is our responsibility to do that. The global community is largely in agreement that climate change is a, you know, clear and present danger, that collaboration is required to deal with it. And so I think, you know, I think the United States is pulling against a really important global consensus in that regard.<br/><br/>SH: Where do you find hope right now that real progress can still be made in the fight against climate change?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: I see enormous hope, honestly. I'm surrounded, I get the privilege of working on this day in, day out, and sometimes it's pretty grim, but most of the time, actually, what I see is hundreds, if not thousands, of communities around the world taking climate change incredibly seriously and making their communities better as a result. So everything from small, small efforts to build cycling infrastructure, to create community gardens that enhance, you know, food security, I'm seeing investments in public transit, I'm seeing just a higher level of discourse, you know, more sophisticated understanding of what's happening and how important it is for Canadians and folks around the world to deal with it. So while we're not moving fast enough, I see evidence that, you know, deep seeds have been planted to make really positive change.<br/><br/>SH: How do we get more Canadians to see the urgency?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, I think the urgency is all around us. It's hard to avoid, honestly, in summers like this and the ones past. My sense is actually that Canadians understand the urgency. They just don't, they're struggling to envision what their communities could or should look like. And that's the conversation we're not having. I think we're having a lot of conversations about extreme events and the cataclysmic losses, but I'd like to have a conversation about what we want our communities to look like and feel like and smell like in the future.<br/><br/>SH: And how do you have those conversations? What needs to be said to get that kind of understanding?<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Well, this is, you know, each community will look different if it's following, you know, a more sustainable development pathway, and that's good. We need diversity across our communities in how they respond to climate change. But I think that this is a very place-based, community-focused conversation. This can be led by all different folks, from small businesses to nonprofits to municipal government, talking about how we want to improve public health, for instance, by, you know, enhancing our public transit and our active transport infrastructure and also reducing emissions at the same time, how we bring nature into our cities so that we have food for us to make us more, you know, food secure while also sinking carbon and also enhancing biodiversity. So we have these solutions that can deliver, you know, multiple benefits at the same time. And it's, you know, really up to communities, with the support of higher levels of government, to drive those solutions forward.<br/><br/>SH: Sarah Burch, thanks for talking to us this morning.<br/><br/>SARAH BURCH: Thanks so much. I appreciate it.<br/><br/>SH: Sarah Burch is a professor in the Department of Geography and Environmental Management at the University of Waterloo, a Canada Research Chair in Sustainability Governance and Innovation, and the Executive Director of the Waterloo Climate Institute.

The multi-year partnership, InSoil's largest raise to date and one of Europe's largest financial commitments to climate-resilient farming, grants Key Carbon royalty rights to InSoil's Green Loans financing model, which offers zero-interest loans to farmers adopting regenerative agricultural practices in return for a fixed share of carbon credits. In addition, Key Carbon's subsidiary, EU Soil Carbon Corp, will fund the expansion of InSoil's carbon farming business, which provides farmers with further technical and financial support in implementing regenerative practices. As farmers across Europe face headwinds from climate change and global regulatory dynamics, financial and agronomic support from projects like these are critical to achieving the systemic shifts that achieve real impact in carbon sequestration and a more resilient food system that doesn't leave the stewards of our lands in the dust,\" said Laimonas Noreika, CEO of InSoil. \"Through this agreement with Key Carbon, we will be able to reach more farmers, accelerate climate-positive outcomes, and deliver the kind of high-integrity credits the carbon market increasingly demands. As institutional interest in nature-based solutions continues to grow, our work with Key Carbon will represent a model for blending sustainable finance with climate impact, and turning soil into both a climate solution and a revenue stream for European farmers. Luke Leslie, CEO of Key Carbon, said: \"Corporate appetite for carbon credits is increasingly shifting towards high-integrity, removal-based and localised solutions to meet the evolving compliance standards. Our partnership with InSoil will provide increased access to funding for farmers, enabling the transition to regenerative agriculture and growing Key Carbon's supply of high-quality carbon credits. With its deep agronomic expertise and strong local networks, InSoil is uniquely positioned to deliver meaningful environmental outcomes and ensure the integrity of carbon credit generation. The partnership will also provide Key Carbon with access to millions of hectares of European farmland with the potential to deliver additional biodiversity monitoring. With conventional agriculture accounting for more than 20% of global emissions and soil seen as a critical carbon sink, this collaboration aims to unlock funds that help farmers generate high-quality, nature-based carbon credits that are scientifically validated and third-party verified in alignment with the EU Carbon Removals Certification Framework (CRCF)."]}, {"relevance_score": 27, "title": "New expert advisory board takes action at intersection of climate, nature, and technology", "published": "2025-01-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA, ON, Jan. 14, 2025 /CNW/ - Canada's Forest Trust Corporation (CFTC) announced the launch of its National Advisory Board, bringing together experts and leaders to accelerate nature-based solutions in Canada.

We recently conducted a study with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of more than 100 companies that operate in emerging markets to identify trends in sustainability priorities, reporting practices and how strategies are anchored and financed at these companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Methodology</p><p>The study included 104 companies across six sectors: Energy, Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT), Transport, Mining, Water &amp; Waste, and \"Cross-Cutting\" companies with operations across more than one sector. Data was gathered from publicly available documents, company websites, and databases like S&amp;P Capital IQ and LSEG Data &amp; Analytics. This information was analyzed using a sector performance model developed by KPMG which considered 51 KPIs across Strategy, Governance, KPI &amp; Data Reporting, Environmental, Social, and Community Benefit-Sharing.</p><p>Key findings</p><p>1. Companies are embracing sustainable finance</p><p>51% of the companies studied used sustainable finance. Among the financial instruments most used by the companies, green bonds (53%) lead, followed by sustainability-linked bonds (30%) and loans (25%). Moreover, 25% of the companies have sought support from DFIs and multilateral development banks such as IFC, EBRD and ADB. Among the six major sectors these companies are operating, Water &amp; Waste (75%), and Energy (74%) sector companies are leading in terms of the use of sustainability-linked finance whereas Transport sector companies (16%) trail the companies in other sectors.</p><p>2. Increased disclosure on gender equality data</p><p>Most companies have disclosed gender-related data, indicating a growing commitment to transparency and accountability. Standout sectors include mining and energy while sectors with opportunities to enhance disclosures include TMT, transport, water, and waste sectors. Despite increased disclosure and reporting, fewer companies publicly disclose targets for gender diversity. Further, there is opportunity to encourage a comprehensive approach to inclusion that goes beyond gender to include other key areas such as disability, underserved groups and communities depending on the operational and geographic contexts these companies are operating in.</p><p>3. Decarbonization targets and nature-based solutions</p><p>We reviewed company-specific targets across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 as well as whether these were structured as carbon neutral or net-zero targets. The analysis showed that:</p><p>- Energy sector companies lead in comprehensive emissions targets, with 38% of companies setting targets across Scope 1, 2 and 3.<br/>- Transport sector companies demonstrate the highest commitment to carbon neutral &amp; net-zero targets (42%) despite lower scope coverage of carbon emissions.<br/>- Data from Water &amp; Waste sector companies indicate only 13% of them reported coverage across all metrics such as carbon emissions across Scope 1,2, and 3 as well as carbon neutral &amp; net-zero targets.</p><p>Across all sectors, there is limited progress in Scope 3 reduction targets by the companies analyzed. 44% of companies do not disclose Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>4. Increasing focus on nature</p><p>Companies are increasingly prioritizing biodiversity by integrating it into their operations through conservation, restoration, innovative solutions, and sustainable land management. As part of their resilience strategy, companies are prioritizing nature-based solutions and initiatives that help drive the global energy transition and combat climate change. However, the adoption rate of sustainable disclosure standards on this newer topic remains lower and slower than many others: Only 10 out of 104 companies analyzed are the adopters of Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).</p><p>5. Evolving efforts on community benefit-sharing</p><p>Based on the analysis of twenty-five companies in energy and infrastructure sectors on their community-benefit sharing efforts, the majority (84%) have been disclosing education and skill-focused initiatives with measurable impact. Other areas include humanitarian support/environmental protection (48%), health-related projects (44%) community climate resilience initiatives (8%).</p><p>Across sectors there is also priority placed on disclosing impacts in Latin America and Africa, with a focus on cultural heritage preservation, access to improved infrastructure and services, community-level education, and healthcare improvement, among others.</p><p>The path forward: Overcoming challenges and accelerating impact</p><p>- Companies in emerging markets will benefit from the recent agreement at COP29 in Baku [1] that will triple climate finance to developing countries from the previous goal of US$ 100 billion annually, to US$ 300 billion annually by 2035.

Grants for watershed security projects are provided from the interest earned on the fund. The initial $100-million contribution will generate a $3-5 million annual baseline budget for grants and programs.</p><p>Interim Governance and Working Towards a Permanent Entity </p><p>Since the announcement of the initial $100-million endowment to the WSF, the First Nations Water Caucus (FNWC)   with the First Nations Fisheries Council (FNFC) acting as its secretariat   partnered with the Real Estate Foundation of British Columbia (REFBC) to provide interim Fund stewardship. Together, the interim partners are working to create a permanent entity to oversee, manage and grow the Fund over the long term. The Province of BC acts in an advisory role to the interim Fund.</p><p>The First Nations Water Caucus (FNWC) iscomprised of the First Nation delegates who participate in the joint B.C.-First Nations Water Table (Water Table). The Water Table addresses water and watershed security issues of concern between First Nations in B.C. and the Province through co-development and consensus. FNWC was first convened by FNFC in June 2022 and, since then, has worked with the Province at the Water Table to co-develop a draft Watershed Security Strategy for B.C.</p><p>The First Nations Fisheries Council (FNFC) is a non-profit society that works to develop a cohesive and united voice among First Nations in B.C. FNFC, as the secretariat to FNWC, implements the goals and priorities of FNWC and carries out the substantive operational work. They are partnering with REFBC as interim stewards of the Fund and supporting the co-development process.</p><p>The Real Estate Foundation of BC (REFBC) is a philanthropic organization working to advance sustainable, equitable, and socially-just land use across what is known as B.C. For many years, REFBC has been proud to work with First Nations, local governments, the Province and a broad network of partners to advance watershed security through its grants, research and convening, and as host of the Healthy Watersheds Initiative.</p><p>SOURCE  Watershed Security Fund</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/June2025/11/c5484.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/June2025/11/c5484.html</url></p>", "publisher": "Canada NewsWire", "instances": ["The WSF grant allows our Nations and local communities to advance critical collaborative work and studies to protect and recover this heavily impacted watershed.

To reach this goal, PlantVillage will draw down 3 million tonnes per day for 365 days a year,' he added.\"</p><p>AAC safeguards ancient wildlife migration corridors through trusting relationships with Indigenous communities</p><p>\"The Andes Amazon Conservancy (AAC) collaborates with 4 Indigenous Nations in Ecuador in an Indigenous-led conservation program that maintains connectivity between the Andes and Amazon and safeguards ancient wildlife migration corridors.</p><p>Contiguous habitats that support wildlife migration are vital to preserving and sustaining the region's increasingly endangered biological diversity.</p><p>The effectiveness of AAC's work is rooted in the trusting relationships we have established with more than 70 Indigenous communities.</p><p>We integrate traditional knowledge and modern conservation technology to foster sovereign Indigenous land stewardship and sustainable land conservation while planning for 100 years of human population growth.</p><p>Funding from the Cisco Foundation is augmenting this collaborative capacity-building work for ecological connectivity and restoration.</p><p>Cisco's support provides necessary resources to more than 135 Indigenous people who are spearheading this conservation project, provides numerous iterations of GIS maps that reflect the unique conservation choices of each community, and supports the legal documentation and registration of those conservation choices.</p><p>The result will be a 175-mile long, 6-million acre Indigenous-planned and implemented eco-cultural corridor and will pave the way for a new model for conservation in an era where 80% of the world's remaining biodiversity is in Indigenous territories.\"</p><p>Seacology connects communities to conservation through a unique deal</p><p>\"Seacology protects island habitats and assists local communities by offering villages a unique deal: if they agree to create a forest or marine reserve, we'll provide something the village needs, like a schoolhouse, health clinic, water system, etc. Since 1991, we've launched 392 projects, working with villages on islands in 68 countries, helping to protect approximately 1.4 million acres of some of the world's most vulnerable ecosystems.</p><p>In 2021, we launched our second largest project to date: The Dominican Republic National Mangrove Initiative. This ambitious project aims to protect the country's critical mangrove forests through a nationwide mangrove pride campaign while supporting economically vulnerable coastal residents by developing mangrove-related eco-businesses.</p><p>In addition, we are engaging coastal youth with a new initiative called Play for the Mangroves, which provides free sports equipment to under-resourced Dominican youth in exchange for their participation in mangrove education and hands-on conservation activities.</p><p>Seacology is incredibly grateful to the Cisco Foundation for supporting this initiative. With Cisco's help, Seacology and our local partner Grupo Jaragua have hosted talks and webinars, funded a mangrove-themed mural project, organized a photography exhibit, visited schools and universities, helped establish 5 new businesses, and distributed baseball and volleyball equipment and mangrove-branded uniforms to youth throughout the country.</p><p>Mangroves, so critical to climate change mitigation and adaptation, are becoming a source of pride throughout the country, ensuring their future protection.\"</p><p>View original content here</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc</url><br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@3blmedia.com\">info@3blmedia.com</email></p><p>SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p><br/><br/>View source version on accesswire.com: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accesswire.com/768293/Cisco-Celebrating-Nature-Based-Solutions-This-World-Environment-Day\">https://www.accesswire.com/768293/Cisco-Celebrating-Nature-Based-Solutions-This-World-Environment-Day</url></p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / July 17, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.
