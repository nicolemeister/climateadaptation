Holding another Olympics in Midsummer is tempting more scorching competitions, and Europe is warming faster than other continents. But it's not just Olympics, fires, floods, melting is forcing us to confront. How is climate change impacting sport, and can sport adapt?<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>We are seeing more heat waves now than we ever have before, 15 years\u2026<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>We asked Madeleine Orr, a sports ecologist at the University of Toronto. She recently wrote Warming Up: How Climate Change is Changing Sport.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>The problem becomes if you're not able to sweat, you're not able to cool down, your inner organs are going to start to get pretty warm as well and that's where we start to see major catastrophic incidents of heat stroke for example.

It became where they serve food to the community because people know where the soccer field is, but it also was the place that was dry.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Wildfires last summer dispersed red smoke thousands of kilometres forcing pro sport to cancel games. Under the smoke, there was no community sport either.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>That's the challenge, is if you live near a wildfire you're probably not competing. It just shuts it down and, and those kids definitely are feeling it.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>In summer or winter, heat is a weapon. World Cup ski events in the Alps were cancelled nine times this year because of snowless slopes.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>We are seeing a 35-day drop on both sides of the Atlantic in the skiable days, roughly 300 athletes wrote a letter to Federation of skiing last year asking for more action on this.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The climate is becoming a ferocious opponent. Just ask the athletes. Olympians warned in June of health risks even with specialized heat training, releasing a major report, Rings of Fire.<br/><br/>JAMIE FARNDALE (BRITISH RUGBY SEVENS PLAYER):<br/>If we are competing in these hotter, hotter conditions and yeah it's definitely, definitely scary.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE SPEAKER 3:<br/>You're going to have athletes who are barely alive and unable to perform at their best.<br/><br/>UNIDENTIFIED MALE SPEAKER 6:<br/>Laurence Vincent Lapointe of Canada picking up the silver.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Laurence Vincent Lapointe, who won silver and bronze, knows all about too much heat.<br/><br/>LAURENCE VINCENT LAPOINTE (CANADIAN CANOEIST):<br/>This was exactly what never give up means.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Her victories in Tokyo even more precious after a heat related collapse, she told us she's never forgotten it.<br/><br/>LAURENCE VINCENT LAPOINTE (CANADIAN CANOEIST):<br/>I had an hour and a half to recover from my first, my first race of day on to my next race. Suddenly, like I said, I cannot move. I'm laying down in the shade because there's nothing to do. I'm just like feeling too, too sick to move. I had to jump into a nice bath. After that, they had to like lay me down in a AC room with electrolyte water and lots of protein bars and just like pressure sleeves on my legs, legs in the air and everything and everyone was, everyone was worried, me included.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The heat and humidity almost ended the dream she'd had since childhood.<br/><br/>LAURENCE VINCENT LAPOINTE (CANADIAN CANOEIST):<br/>So the problem is most people think of what it was like when they were young, right? When I was a kid, you know, you had to drink a bit, and you had to put your sunscreen and you were fine. But nowadays, if you don't drink like three times as much, and you don't do this and that like very, very specific things for cooling yourself in between races then you, you can drop.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Madeleine Orr is urging athletes to advocate for change using their power and influence as flag bearers for their country and for climate action, including breaking ties with some sponsors.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>Athletes are competing for teams that might be sponsored by an entity that doesn't necessarily want to talk about climate change. So for example, if you're competing on Team Canada, just sponsored at the moment by Petro-Can and RBC, two brands obviously connected to funding fossil fuels and producing fossil fuels. It can feel a bit tricky of figuring out right, like how exactly what I approach some of these issues.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Of course, you're talking in the year that the Edmonton boilers went to the Stanley Cup.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>Yes.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>That's not a popular opinion.<br/><br/>MADELEINE ORR (SPORTS ECOLOGIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO):<br/>It's not. It's not. And here's the thing, right? It's really tricky because you're now having to if you walk away from fossil fuels to say, okay, well, what are we going to replace it with.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>The Olympics have always been about faster, higher, stronger and now hotter. Athletes need protection from the ravages of our changing climate.<br/><br/>ADRIENNE ARSENAULT (CBC-TV):<br/>So Susan, I understand, Paris promised the greenest Olympic Games ever. But I gather already the running into trouble.<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Yeah. I mean, part of their sustainability plan was no air conditioning in the athletes' village, instead in floor cooling. But there was so much pushback. They've had to order 2,500 AC units. Teams can pay for them, and Canada will be taking advantage of that.<br/><br/>ADRIENNE ARSENAULT (CBC-TV):<br/>What was curious is like how does sport actually adapt to climate change?<br/><br/>SUSAN ORMISTON (REPORTER):<br/>Well, Madeleine Orr in our story, she says the number one thing is every sport is a heat and air quality policy like we have rules around storms or lightning, and she says change the coaching culture don't push through when it's blistering hot because heat can kill.<br/><br/>ADRIENNE ARSENAULT (CBC-TV):<br/>Alright, good advice.

The nation is scrambling to protect communities from warming and has pledged to slash emissions, but in the short term the worsening weather remains a threat.</p><p>\u201cThe risks from climate change are right before us,\u201d said Yasuaki Hijioka, deputy director of the Center for Climate Change Adaptation at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, northeast of Tokyo. </p><p>\u201cYou can in principle try escaping from a flood. But heat affects such a wide area, there is almost no escape. Everyone is affected.\u201d</p><p>Japan is already prone to natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons. Secure infrastructure has kept people safe for the most part. But climate change means communities are often caught off guard because the systems were engineered for the weather conditions of the past.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re pushing the electrical grid that was designed for the 20th century into a new century of warming and heat extremes, then you are going to have to consider whether your energy system and your health care system are really designed for a warming planet,\u201d said Kim Cobb, director of The Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. </p><p>More people are getting sick because of heat stroke. </p><p>           Last year, more than 200 temperature records were broken in cities across the nation, sending energy grid to near-capacity and over 71,000 people to hospital for heatstroke through the months of May to September. Patients were mostly elderly but a fair number of children and middle-aged adults were also hospitalized, according to government figures. Eighty people died. </p><p>The warming weather can also hold more moisture, adding flooding and landslides to the summer forecast, something that Japan has also seen with growing frequency.</p><p>In 2019, bullet trains were partially submerged in flooding from Typhoon Hagibis. Homes and highways were caught in landslides. Flooded tunnels trapped people and cars. Dams couldn't withstand the surprisingly heavy rainfall. </p><p>Hijioka\u2019s research is focused on flood management, such as diverting water from swelling rivers upstream into rice paddies and ponds to drain to avert flooding.</p><p>To prevent deaths from heatstroke, a proposed law would designate certain buildings in communities, such as air-conditioned libraries, as shelters. That kind of law on the national level is new in Japan. </p><p>Despite the country's advanced economy, some people cannot afford air conditioning, especially in areas not accustomed to the heat. Schools in northern Japan, such as in Nagano, have installed air conditioning because of the extreme heat in recent years. </p><p>\"More people have been dying from heatstroke than from river flooding in Japan,\u201d said Hijioka. \u201cWe need to view climate change as a natural disaster.\u201d </p><p>Michio Kawamiya, director of the Research Center for Environmental Modeling and Application, and his team research Japan\u2019s higher temperatures and how they affect people.</p><p>Among their findings: Since 1953, cherry blossoms have bloomed on average one day sooner every decade. Maple leaves have changed color 2.8 days slower per decade. The risk of typhoons has gone up and the amount of snowfall has declined, even as the threat of heavy snowfall remains.</p><p>Japan has made some headway in curbing the amount of fossil fuels it spews, but it's still the world's sixth-highest emitter. After the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, the country shut down nuclear generation, and, fatefully for the climate, invested in new coal plants as well as imported oil and gas to keep its grid running. Nuclear plants have gradually restarted since then.</p><p>On the positive side, its excellent public mass-transit transportation has kept gas-guzzling cars off roads, lowering the country's carbon footprint. Some Japanese people have been turning their air conditioning off to save energy, but that has health implications, as it comes precisely at a time when heat has been reaching dangerously high levels. </p><p>The country has already worked so hard to conserve energy by reducing demand that doing more has often been compared to \u201cwringing water out of a totally dry rag,\u201d Kawamiya said in an interview at his office in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo. </p><p>Still, critics say Japan could be doing more to boost renewable energy use, such as solar and wind power. The government plans for renewables to make up over a third of the country's power supply by 2030 and to phase out coal use sometime in the 2040s.</p><p>Japan is also part of the Group of Seven leading economies that pledged to be largely free of fossil fuels for electricity by 2035.</p><p>Since Fukushima, Japan has kept most of the nation\u2019s 50-some nuclear reactors offline, in response to public opinion that\u2019s turned against the technology. Nuclear power is considered a clean energy as it doesn\u2019t emit greenhouse gases, but it does produce radioactive waste.</p><p>About 10 reactors are up and running, 24 reactors are being decommissioned. What Japan will eventually decide on nuclear power remains unclear. </p><p>Hijioka, who believes Japan lags in the shift toward renewable energy, said he was frustrated by policymakers who he said have dragged their feet on dealing with climate change, but are pushing a return to nuclear. </p><p>Despite its potential to curb planet-warming emissions, skepticism remains among some climate experts about turning to nuclear power due to costs and timescales of projects compared to how quickly and cheaply an equivalent amount of renewable energy can come online. There are also concerns among the public.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s utterly irresponsible, when we think about the next generation,\" Hijioka said. \"We may be old, and we may die so it might not matter.

Last year, more than 200 temperature records were broken in cities across the nation, sending energy grid to near-capacity and over 71,000 people to hospital for heatstroke through the months of May to September. Patients were mostly elderly but a fair number of children and middle-aged adults were also hospitalized, according to government figures. Eighty people died. The warming weather can also hold more moisture, adding flooding and landslides to the summer forecast, something that Japan has also seen with growing frequency. In 2019, bullet trains were partially submerged in flooding from Typhoon Hagibis. Homes and highways were caught in landslides. Flooded tunnels trapped people and cars. Dams couldn't withstand the surprisingly heavy rainfall. Hijioka\u2019s research is focused on flood management, such as diverting water from swelling rivers upstream into rice paddies and ponds to drain to avert flooding. To prevent deaths from heatstroke, a proposed law would designate certain buildings in communities, such as air-conditioned libraries, as shelters."]}, {"relevance_score": 23, "title": "Canadian men to face Wales and England in July rugby test matches", "published": "2021-05-11", "bodyText": "<p>The Canadian men\u2019s rugby team, which last played in October 2019 at the World Cup in Japan, will return to action in July against tough opposition in Wales and England.</p><p>The 23rd-ranked Canadians will face No. 6 Wales on July 3 at Principality Stadium in Cardiff and No. 3 England on July 10 at Twickenham.</p><p>It\u2019s rare that Canada gets to play Tier 1 nations outside of the World Cup these days.

Please stay calm and protect yourself,' blared a message in Japanese and English at one venue. <br/> 'Taking action in a panic may lead to danger.' <br/> Tokyo 2020 says it has contingency plans for various natural disasters,'prioritising the safety of spectators and people involved', though they declined to offer further details. <br/> The risks are real, said Toshiyasu Nagao, an expert on earthquake prediction studies with Tokai University's Institute of Oceanic Research and Development. <br/> 'It would be no surprise if a big earthquake hit directly beneath the capital tomorrow,' he told AFP. <br/> 'And it's not just in Tokyo, the risks of an earthquake are everywhere in Japan.' <br/> - 'A little nerve-wracking' - <br/> Seven earthquakes of magnitude six or higher have hit Japan so far this year, including a 7.3-magnitude quake in February, and a March jolt that sparked a tsunami advisory. <br/>Japan is also haunted by the 2011 quake which triggered a tsunami that killed more than 18,500 people and caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster. <br/> Tokyo's government says the city's permanent Olympic venues feature the latest technology in case of disaster. <br/> The $340 million Ariake volleyball arena, for example, has shock-absorbing giant rubber cushions to keep it safe even during violent shaking, and is certified for use as a shelter. <br/> Waterfront facilities, including the Olympic Village, are built on embankments or protected by sea walls that can withstand a tsunami of almost two metres (6.5 feet) \u2014 the maximum height predicted inside Tokyo Bay, the city says. <br/> In some ways, the pandemic has made potential disaster response less complicated as almost all fans will be barred from the Games, making the prospect of mass spectator evacuations unlikely. <br/> But some 70,000 athletes, media and officials will still be in Tokyo for the Olympics and Paralympics, and controlling infection risks during an emergency response could be difficult. <br/> Japaneseauthorities have already updated their emergency policies, limiting space at shelters to avoid crowding and stocking up on masks and disinfectant. <br/> 'Evacuation management can directly contradict infection control measures,' warned Sakiko Kanbara, professor of disaster nursing at University of Kochi. <br/> 'We have to be aware that a disaster in ordinary times is quite different from one in a pandemic.' <br/> Still, emergency preparation is so deeply embedded in Japanese life that Tokyo even has several disaster simulation centres where visitors can experience artificial jolts and practice evacuation. <br/> On a recent visit to the Ikebukuro Life Safety Learning Centre, English teacher Mike Diakakis said he had found a quake in Tokyo earlier this year 'a little nerve-wracking'. <br/> 'You don't really think about it until you've experienced it,' he said. <br/><url

The storm delivered high winds and record-breaking precipitation to a large portion of Honshu from Mie Prefecture in the west to Iwate in the north. Storm surge raised sea levels by more than 1 meter above mean sea level along parts of the coast. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its Level 5, or highest level, special warning for heavy rain; unprecedented rainfall followed. A wide swath of Honshu just outside the Tokyo metro area received between 250 mm and 500+ mm (10 and 20+ inches) of rain; the resort town of Hakone, where 939.5 mm (37 inches) of precipitation was recorded, broke the calendar-day rainfall record for all of Japan. Hakone's rainfall represents the second-heaviest 24-hour rainfall ever recorded in Japan--25 inches (635 mm) of the 37 inches fell in just 12 hours. Many regions received between 30% and 40% of their yearly rainfall in just two days, with more than 100 stations breaking daily rainfall records at those locations. As a result of the large swath of unprecedented rainfall in Honshu, numerous rivers--the Abukuma, Arakawa, Chikuma, Kuji, Naka, Shinano, Tone, and Watarase rivers among them--experienced severe and devastating flooding.</p><p>According to AIR, of the ~540 river gauging stations on Honshu island, more than 85 exceeded their 100-year return period peak flows, with more than 100 exceeding their historical records. In addition, shortly before Hagibis made landfall, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the region--parts of which were in the early stages of recovery from Typhoon Faxai, which struck just one month prior. Much of central and eastern Japan experienced severe flooding and landslides; power outages and travel disruption were widespread.</p><p>Because of the intense rainfall within a short time period, much of the floodwater has a high mud content and includes a large amount of debris; this could potentially increase the costs of repair and cleanup and drive up business interruption losses--especially for commercial and industrial properties. In addition, Hagibis impacted some of the same region damaged by Typhoon Faxai a few weeks earlier.

The expected rainfall, in particular, has raised fears, with the JMA warning that high tides ahead of a full moon increase the risk of flooding. It has issued warnings for strong wind, high waves, landslides and serious flooding for large areas of Honshu.Non-compulsory evacuation orders have been issued to some 600,000 people in eastern Japan already, according to public broadcaster NHK.- Power outages - With the centre of the storm still hundreds of kilometres away in the Pacific, torrential rain was falling and tornado-like gusts of wind ripped into several homes in Chiba, east of the capital, destroying one.Five people were sent to hospital, but none suffered serious injuries, the local fire department told AFP.The JMA has forecast half a metre (nearly 20 inches) of rain for the Tokyo area in the 24 hours to midday on Sunday, with more for the central Tokai region.Television footage showed gigantic waves smashing into coastal breakwaters and residents living near a river in Tokyo piling up sandbags in front of their houses.Others have nailed wooden boards to the frames of windows. </p><p>By 9:00am local time (0000GMT) 11,600 households in Chiba had already lost power.

Officials are not expected to make a final decision on that match until Sunday morning, after they have assessed any damage to the venue and transport links.

The reserve increase primarily relates to two large casualty reinsurance contracts, one of which is in run-off, and one of which has been renewed at progressively smaller participations over the past several years.</p><p>While painful in the short term, this was the prudent and responsible course of action based on the level of ceding company reported losses compared to actuarial projections. Our response to the data was decisive and we feel confident about the overall level of our net loss reserves, which stand at $1.1 billion.</p><p>Our investment income was quite strong, both for the quarter and the year. The net investment income return on net invested assets was 1.5% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 6.0% for the full year. The ratio of net invested assets to equity was 2.5:1 as of December 31, 2019, which points to the return on equity potential of the business going forward.</p><p>We fully utilized our $75 million share repurchase program during the 2019 fourth quarter. The Board has authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $50 million. The exact timing and magnitude of further share repurchases is dependent on a number of factors, but will likely be deployed at a slower pace than our prior program in order to pursue opportunities in an improving insurance market.</p><p>Our ultimate objective is to steadily grow book value per share over time. By this measure, we are pleased to report 3.4% quarterly growth in book value per diluted common share, which stands at $43.49 as of December 31, 2019. For the 2019 full year, the increase in book value per diluted common share was 10.9%.</p><p>As we enter the new year, we are optimistic about the prospects for further book value growth due to the overall positive insurance rate environment, the composition of our in-force insurance and reinsurance portfolio, the strength of our balance sheet, the earnings power of our fixed-income investment portfolio, and the potential material accretive benefit of our new share repurchase program.\"</p><p>Underwriting</p><p>The following table summarizes the Company's underwriting results on a consolidated basis: //st</p><p>Three Months Ended December 31,</p><p>Year Ended December 31,</p><p>2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change</p><p>($ in thousands) Gross $ 156,254 $ 160,937 (2.9 )% $ 754,881 $ 735,015 2.7 % premiums written Net premiums 112,353 132,360 (15.1 )% 532,862 604,175 (11.8 )% written Net premiums 133,446 146,973 (9.2 )% 556,690 578,862 (3.8 )% earned Underwriting (37,819 ) (22,660 ) (66.9 )% (54,076 ) (25,840 ) (109.3 )% income (loss) (1) % Point % Point Change Change Loss ratio 100.9 % 87.9 % 13.0 % 81.4 % 76.2 % 5.2 % Acquisition 22.3 % 23.4 % (1.1 )% 22.8 % 24.4 % (1.6 )% expense ratio General &amp; 5.1 % 4.1 % 1.0 % 5.5 % 3.9 % 1.6 % administrative expense ratio Combined ratio 128.3 % 115.4 % 12.9 % 109.7 % 104.5 % 5.2 % Adjusted 126.4 % 114.2 % 12.2 % 107.3 % 103.3 % 4.0 % combined ratio (2)</p><p>(1) Underwriting income (loss) is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and is calculated as net premiums earned, less loss and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses.

The increase in the loss ratio reflects 18.1 points of prior year and 2.9 points of current year loss reserve strengthening, primarily in the casualty reinsurance line of business. Casualty reinsurance prior year loss reserves were strengthened by $24.0 million, primarily due to a higher than anticipated level of reported losses on one professional lines quota share treaty program and one non-renewed multi-line quota share treaty.

Top of his immediate priorities will be ensuring a huge scandal in the English Premiership doesn't spill over into the international squad. Saracens players will make up at least a third of England's starting team during the Six Nations while the north London club reels from a salary-cap saga that will see it relegated from the country's top division at the end of this season. Players from rival teams might harbour some resentment and ill-feeling toward their Saracens counterparts, which could affect the atmosphere in the England squad when they link up for international duty, so Jones is planning clear-the-air talks over a beer before the tournament. \"If players are angry about it, then say it, get it out,\" Jones says. </p><p>\"We've got players from potentially 12 different clubs. That's 12 different ideas of what's right and what's wrong.\" Also not helping matters is the broken arm suffered by Billy Vunipola that has ruled out the powerful No. 8 from the whole Six Nations. Jones didn't select a genuine No. 8 in his 34-man squad, so the back row that was so effective at the World Cup will be reshuffled. There are eight uncapped players, with back-rower Ben Earl the most likely to be the first getting into the 23. England has a tough start, with away matches against France and Scotland followed by home games against Ireland and Wales, but is the team to beat after reaching the World Cup final less than three months ago.</p><p>NEW FACE: Jacob Umaga. His father played for Samoa and his uncle was a captain of the All Blacks. So what is Jacob Umaga doing in the England squad? Well, he was actually born here, after his parents moved to England in 1995 so that father Mike could play rugby league for Halifax in the north of the country. Jacob's heritage suggested he'd always become a rugby player and he was at the Leicester Tigers academy before joining Wasps in 2016. Having played for England Under-18s and Under-20s, he made his English Premiership debut this season and, after just four starts, is in the senior national squad as the third-choice flyhalf behind Owen Farrell and George Ford. The 21-year-old Umaga is a goalkicker who is also comfortable at centre and fullback, so offers Eddie Jones the kind of versatility which makes him an option on the bench. Because, except for injuries, he is unlikely to be getting ahead of Farrell or Ford anytime soon despite his famous surname.</p><p>QUOTE: \"My aim is to make England the greatest rugby team the world has ever seen. That's my mindset.\" England coach Eddie Jones.</p><p>ODDS: 4-5</p><p>- By Steve Douglas</p><p>FRANCE</p><p>COACH: Fabien Galthie</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 4th</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2002, '04, '06, '07, '10</p><p>OUTLOOK: The general view was that Fabien Galthi\u00e9 was pulling the strings behind the scenes during the Rugby World Cup before officially replacing the ineffective Jacques Brunel after the tournament. Working in Brunel's shadow, Galthi\u00e9 was widely credited with improving the flagging fitness, lack of sharpness, and low confidence in the side. Now the former standout scrumhalf - he won 64 test caps with Les Tricolors - has a chance to stamp his identity on a team which looks to be on the way up following years of misery under Brunel and predecessors Guy Noves and Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9. Galthie's clearly looking long-term because he's selected seven uncapped players in his squad of 28. Just four players have 30 test caps or more, and only centre Ga\u00ebl Fickou has 50. Several thirtysomethings have been shown the exit, and some a little harshly such as fullback Maxime M\u00e9dard, winger Yoann Huget and flyhalf Camille Lopez, who were among France's best players in the World Cup quarterfinal loss to Wales. No. 8 Louis Picamoles and captain Guilhem Guiardo retired, leaving Galthi\u00e9 to shape his side around 20-year-old flyhalf Romain Ntamack, a rising star who impressed at times during the World Cup with some slick passing, tactical maturity and cool penalty kicking. Galthi\u00e9 has shown he is ready to take risks, naming the relatively inexperienced back-rower Charles Ollivon as his new captain, despite the fact he has only 11 caps. He made made new additions to the backroom staff, too, with former hooker Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez the general manager and Shaun Edwards the defence coach adding steel and experience. Galthi\u00e9's approach is a refreshing change from the diehard conservatism shown by Brunel and, at times, Noves. Now it's down to the players to justify Galthi\u00e9's faith in them, although a first Six Nations title since the 2010 Grand Slam looks beyond them. They could not have a more demanding first match than Rugby World Cup runner-up England.</p><p>NEW FACE: Although Matthieu Jalibert has been capped, his international career lasted 30 minutes before he sustained a serious knee injury being tackled by Ireland's Bundee Aki. That was in 2018 and, after almost one year without playing, the 21-year-old flyhalf is keen to make up for lost time. Only one problem: He's competing for a starting place with another slick young gun in Ntamack. It's a nice dilemma to have for new coach Fabien Galthi\u00e9, who has been impressed with Jalibert's performances this season for Union Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles, the leader of France's Top 14. Jalibert has shone with the precision of his kicking game. In a recent win against Pau he set up two tries for winger Santiago Cordero with different types of kicks.</p><p>QUOTE: \"A successful championship is a championship that is won.\" France coach Fabien Galthi\u00e9.</p><p>ODDS: 6-1</p><p>- By Jerome Pugmire</p><p>IRELAND</p><p>COACH: Andy Farrell</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 3rd</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2009, '14, '15, '18</p><p>OUTLOOK: Second favourite looks right, thanks to a good schedule. Ireland start at home against Scotland and Wales, has two weeks to plot how to topple favourite England at Twickenham, then another two weeks to recover before welcoming Italy, followed by a finish against France in Paris. The same schedule earned Ireland the championship in 2014, ahead of England on points difference. That was Joe Schmidt's first Six Nations. With the trophy-laden Schmidt gone, former assistant Andy Farrell has been quick to make his mark. With a more relaxed attitude, he turned over a couple of available training days to the squad to rest before it jetted off to Portugal for a warm-weather training camp. The first-time head coach has also decided to name his match teams on Tuesdays, two days earlier than previously; he wants his players to have time to get their minds and the game plan right. His first squad is also radical, with 12 Rugby World Cup players out, and six newcomers in. However, the XV that opens against Scotland won't likely depart much from the World Cup. The pack could feature hooker Rob Herring and new No. 8 Caelan Doris. But the backline will be very familiar, pivoting around new captain Jonathan Sexton. The flyhalf has proved his leadership abilities at Leinster and has the squad's respect. The only question regards his durability: Sexton is recovering from tearing right knee ligaments nearly two month ago. In the absence of the injured Joey Carbery and excluded Jack Carty, Sexton's backup is expected to be the uncapped Billy Burns, a former England Under-20 standoff whose strength is clever kicks.</p><p>NEW FACE: Bigger doesn't mean better, but Caelan Doris has been making his size count this season. Likened to New Zealand captain Kieran Read, Doris has been pushing his 1.94-meter, 106-kilo frame around so impressively for Leinster that Ireland couldn't deny him. That's no surprise. He shone at the under-20s world championship in 2017 and captained Ireland in 2018. What also might not surprise is if he's the starting No. 8 against Scotland on the Six Nations opening weekend. The skills are all there. Doris has a willingness to carry, an ability to break the line, make meters with ball in hand, and offload with panache. Then there's a high successful tackle rate, turnovers won at the breakdown, and a lineout option. The competition in the squad is tough. There's incumbent CJ Stander and another new cap, Max Deegan, another Leinster product. Ireland doesn't have to worry about No. 8.</p><p>QUOTE: \"The key is to make sure we don't get too ahead of ourselves, we want to stand for something - we want to stand for what we said we would stand for.\" Ireland coach Andy Farrell.</p><p>ODDS: 4-1</p><p>- By Foster Niumata</p><p>ITALY</p><p>COACH: Franco Smith</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 6th</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: 4th 2007, '13</p><p>OUTLOOK: One win would make the campaign a success. Italy hasn't won in the championship since 2015 against Scotland. The last home win was in 2013. Conor O'Shea quit as coach after the Rugby World Cup without winning a Six Nations match. Franco Smith received the job on an interim basis in November. The Italian federation is continuing its coach search, but Smith wants to prove himself. The former Springboks inside back coached Treviso from 2007-13 before returning to the Cheetahs. When he left Italy in 2013 after more than a decade there, he hoped he could return when he was a better coach. He's a better coach and keen to take this chance. He's impressed by the calibre of players and their skillsets. He hopes in the limited time he has, to get them to be the best they can be, and that he can work with the club coaches. Smith and Sergio Parisse agreed the former captain will be available only for the last game, against England in Rome. It will be Parisse's swansong, his 19th season in an Italyjersey, but Smith says Parisse is not playing for a send-off but to contribute to a notable Italy performance. \"He deserves a send-off but its not a send-off game, it's a game where we hope he can still make a difference,\" Smith says. He adds they are moving on, looking for new leaders, and identified seven, including new captain Luca Bigi, the Treviso hooker.</p><p>NEW FACE: Danilo Fischetti would already be capped for Italy but for Typhoon Hagibis. Injuries and suspensions depleted Italy's stock of props at the Rugby World Cup in October, so Fischetti and Zebre teammate Giosue Zilocchi were summoned to Japan. Zilocchi already had two caps and was part of the World Cup training camp but Fischetti was uncapped and starting only his second season at Zebre. The duo were expected to appear in Italy's last pool match against New Zealand, but the biggest typhoon to hit Japan in 60 years arrived and the match was cancelled. The loosehead also went to Chicago in 2018 for a test against Ireland but didn't get in. Third time might be the charm for Fischetti in this championship after featuring for Italy in under-20 wins over Wales, Argentina, and Scotland. He turns 22 on Sunday.</p><p>QUOTE: \"We want to be the best version of ourselves.\" Italy coach Franco Smith.</p><p>ODDS: 500-1</p><p>- By Foster Niumata</p><p>SCOTLAND</p><p>COACH: Gregor Townsend</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 5th</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: 3rd 2001, '06, '13, '18</p><p>OUTLOOK: More realistic. The optimism that swirled around Murrayfield a year ago has evaporated. Glasgow and Edinburgh haven't reached the European Champions Cup quarterfinals, and there's no recent positive test results to believe in momentum: The Rugby World Cup ended in another pool stage exit to no surprise. Scotland isn't a title contender for the Six Nations like it believed it was a year ago. Instead, it'll be back to fighting with Italy to avoid the wooden spoon. That makes their third-round match in Rome one of the games of the tournament. The other could be the second-round visit by England, against which Scotland will try and lift the Calcutta Cup on a third straight occasion for the first time since 1972. Gregor Townsend is still in charge after the World Cup but seemingly no closer to fixing the team's defensive woes, and feeble mentality away from Murrayfield. They have conceded at least 10 tries in every tournament since 2014, and not beaten anybody on the road apart from Italy in 10 years. Not until those eternal problems are fixed will Scotland become a team to be truly feared. Following the international retirements of Greig Laidlaw and John Barclay and the decline of Stuart McInally at the World Cup, Stuart Hogg asked to be captain and proved he deserved it. Hogg is easily the team's most experienced player, and the first regular fullback-captain since Gavin Hastings. Six uncapped players made the squad, plus there were recalls for Edinburgh prop Rory Sutherland (last appeared in 2016), clubmate and centre Matt Scott (2017) and Worcester back-rower Cornell du Preez (2018). Centers Huw Jones and Rory Hutchinson are back after missing the World Cup but star flyhalf Finn Russell has been dropped for \"breaching team protocol.\" The Scots will have to hit the ground running, very fast: The campaign starts in Ireland, where they have won only once in 20 years.</p><p>NEW FACE: At 1.95 metres and 102 kilograms, Ratu Tagive looks a handful on the wing. But it took him until this season, at age 28, to prove it. Tagive was signed in late 2016 by Glasgow, then coached by Gregor Townsend, on the recommendation of scouts and former wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, as an injury replacement for Italy wing Leonardo Sarto. Tagive made his debut in February 2017. But a limited skillset, restrictions on foreign players, and a bad Achilles injury meant he's appeared only 10 times. At one point, he went almost two years between games. But he persevered. Born and raised in Sydney to parents of Fijian and African-American descent, Tagive played rugby league until he quit in 2012. He started playing rugby in 2014, a highlights video earning him trainings with the ACT Brumbies and Australia Sevens. Luck brought him to the attention of Glasgow, and he has been reacquainted with Townsend after qualifying for Scotland on residency. \"Ratu has worked really hard at his game,\" the national coach says.</p><p>QUOTE: \"At times when we've been beaten, we've beaten ourselves. We've coughed up ball cheaply, we've conceded two or three early tries and our game plan's kind of gone out the window. We've learned from that.\" Scotland captain Stuart Hogg.</p><p>ODDS: 25-1</p><p>- By Foster Niumata</p><p>WALES</p><p>COACH: Wayne Pivac</p><p>2019 SIX NATIONS: 1st</p><p>BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2005, '08, '12, '13, '19</p><p>OUTLOOK: The post-Warren Gatland era really gets going for Wales in this Six Nations, and new coach Wayne Pivac has a tough act to follow after the team's 12 years of remarkable success under his fellow New Zealander. Pivac takes over a side that is the reigning Six Nations champion, a Rugby World Cup semifinalist and one of the hardest international teams to beat. Throw in the fact that the players are used to a rigid, well-drilled game plan under Gatland, and it feels like things can only go downhill for Pivac, at least in the early stages of his tenure as he looks to implement his own style. Two positives for Pivac come in the shape of No. 8 Taulupe Faletau and scrumhalf Rhys Webb, who are back in the squad after injury and ineligibility led to them missing the World Cup in Japan. And then there is the familiar and comforting sight of Alun Wyn Jones, the 34-year-old warrior who remains as captain heading into his 14th Six Nations campaign. Pivac has mostly gone across the English border to bring in five uncapped players, the most exciting of which look to be winger Louis Rees-Zammit and big lock Will Rowlands.</p><p>NEW FACE: Louis Rees-Zammit. It was quite the few days for Louis Rees-Zammit. On Monday last week, the 18-year-old winger signed his first senior contract at Gloucester after a record-setting start to his professional career. Forty-eight hours later, he was getting called up by Wales for the Six Nations. \"I'm always a great believer that if you're good enough, you're old enough,\" says Wales coach Wayne Pivac, who adds: \"All the coaches know he has raw talent that you can't coach.\" That was made clear in April when, playing for Gloucester's reserve team against Bristol just a few months after leaving college, he ran back a restart for an 80-meter try. In his first full season in Gloucester's senior team, Rees-Zammit has 10 tries in 13 games, including becoming the youngest player to score a hat trick of tries in the English Premiership. He's a smooth, silky runner, with plenty of pace and power to go with it. He turns 19 the day after Wales plays Italy on the opening weekend. Don't bet against him having an international try to his name by then.</p><p>QUOTE: \"Last year's group won the championship.
