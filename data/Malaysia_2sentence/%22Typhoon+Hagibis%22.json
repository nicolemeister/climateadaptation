Olympic organisers have rescheduled rowing and archery over concerns about high winds from Tropical Storm Nepartak, which is packing gusts of up to 108 kmh. The storm, currently around 190km east of Choshi city, was originally headed for Tokyo, but has shifted north and is now expected to make landfall around the Miyagi region early on Wednesday. </p><p>Miyagi and neighbouring Ibaraki are hosting several Olympic events - some of the few that fans are allowed to attend, but organisers said they would not be affected by the storm. \"Games in Miyagi and Ibaraki will be held as scheduled. We expect spectators to come watch too,\" Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya told reporters. On Tuesday, the approaching storm was already bringing wind and rain to parts of Japan's east coast, making for challenging conditions at the women's triathlon in Tokyo. The event started 15 minutes late because of the weather and the wet roads slipped up several athletes during the cycling section. But conditions were better at the surfing competition, taking place east of Tokyo in Chiba. Organisers decided to squeeze the quarter-finals, semi-finals and medal events of the men's and women's competitions into Tuesday to take advantage of the waves. Japanese government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Tuesday that the storm was moving very slowly and already producing strong winds and rough seas along much of the northeast coast. He warned of \"heavy rain through tomorrow\" in the areas around Tokyo, as well as the Tohoku region to the northeast and the Hokuriku region to the northwest, where the storm will head after making landfall. Kato urged local residents to \"pay attention to the latest information about the weather and evacuation orders\". Some train services in the area where the storm will hit have been cancelled, and non-mandatory evacuation orders have been issued around the town of Atami, where heavy rain earlier this month caused a landslide that killed 21 people. Japan's typhoon season runs from around May to October, peaking in August and September.

Elsewhere, rescue workers carried out an hours-long boat operation to evacuate hundreds of people from a retirement home in Kawagoe, northwest of Tokyo, which was flooded up to its top floor. One elderly woman wearing an orange life vest was brought out from a boat on the back of a hard-hat wearing rescuer. Others were hoisted onto wheelchairs and pushed along a muddy shore on arrival by boat. Hagibis smashed into the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday night as one of the most violent typhoons in recent years, with wind gusts of up to 216kmh. The destruction forced the Rugby World Cup being hosted by Japan to cancel several games, but the \"Brave Blossoms\", as the national team is known, lifted spirits with a stunning 28-21 victory over Scotland on Sunday that puts them into the quarter-finals of the tournament for the first time. MORE RAIN EXPECTED Later in the day, strong rain is forecast in some parts of central and eastern Japan, where soil is already loosened by record-breaking rain from the typhoon, prompting Suga to urge residents to keep their guard up. \"Rain is expected in affected areas today. Because of the rain we have seen so far, levels of water are high in some rivers and soil is loose in some areas,\" Suga said. \"Please remain on your guard for landslides and river overflows.\" Typhoon Hagibis claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver. Landslides and flooding took more lives overnight, and the toll climbed higher after sunrise on Sunday, as the scale of the devastation wrought by Hagibis became clear.

Five Chinese have been found dead,\" a coastguard official told AFP. He said four other crew, from China, Myanmar and Vietnam, had been rescued and search operations resumed at daybreak for the remaining three members. \"We plan to dispatch 11 boats, two helicopters and a dozen divers to the site.

The storm prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue its highest-level rain disaster warning, saying \"unprecedented\" downpours were expected. 'I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START' More than 92,000 households were still without power early on Monday, a national holiday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The disaster left tens of thousands of people in shelters, with many unsure when they would be able to return home. \"Everything from my house was washed away before my eyes, I wasn't sure if it was a dream or real,\" a woman in Nagoya told national broadcaster NHK. \"I feel lucky I'm still alive.\" READ: Japan's capital braces for what could be worst typhoon in 60 years READ: SIA, Scoot flights to Japan affected ahead of Typhoon Hagibis \"The water came up higher than my head in the house,\" Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP.

By Monday, most subway trains had resumed service, along with many bullet train lines, and flights had also restarted. The storm also brought havoc to the sporting world, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of three Rugby World Cup matches.

Born in New Zealand but a resident of Japan since he was 15, Leitch captained a multicultural squad that represented a nation often perceived, by the Japanese as much as anyone, as monocultural. Three straight wins over Russia, Ireland and Samoa set the World Cup alight and triggered a mania that engulfed Japan for a few glorious weeks. Central to their success, Leitch says, was the 'One Team' ethos, bringing together players born in seven different countries to present an entirely new face of Japanese sport. </p><p>\"One thing we did well as a team was base our team in Japan and brought different ways of thinking and cultures ... into the team,\" Leitch told Reuters in an interview last month. \"This made it the team we had. \"There are a lot of things that Japanese society can take out from what we accomplished at the World Cup.\" Monday marks six months to the day since Japan's final pool fixture against Scotland, a match almost blown away by a super typhoon that caused the unprecedented cancellation of three other World Cup matches. Typhoon Hagibis threatened to wreak havoc with the tournament as it bore down on the Tokyo region. The Scots, who would have been eliminated had the match been cancelled, trained in the confines of their hotel while their union boss issued threats of legal action. Japan, by contrast, trained outside during the quieter moments of the typhoon and were raring to go when the match was given the green light a few hours before kickoff. \"We addressed it, said we weren't going to change anything, it is going to be raining but we are going to be training,\" Leitch recalled. \"We were fully focused on us beating Scotland. If we flip the coin and look at Scotland, they were very, very nervous. Which they should have been. \"For us to focus on ourselves and go out there and bounce Scotland was a very good feeling.\" It is hard to imagine much more going right for Japan on an emotional and unforgettable night at Yokohama Stadium. Scotland scored an early try but Japan soon hit their stride, replying with four of their own en route to a 28-21 win and a place in the last eight of a World Cup for the first time. At the final whistle, the home fans erupted in a frenzy that would have stirred the most stoic of neutrals. Leitch's first words were, typically, for those suffering from the typhoon. MASSIVE PRESSURE While the victory over Scotland looked nerveless, there had been some jitters in coach Jamie Joseph's squad a few weeks earlier when four years of hard work were put on the line in the tournament opener against Russia. \"The pressure was massive, we expected it and I thought we dealt with it very well,\" reflected Leitch. \"There was a period of 15 minutes where we were a bit flustered, but collectively I think we re-grouped.\" Japan eventually overcame their opening-night nerves, recovering from conceding the first try of the tournament to beat Russia comfortably. Next up were Ireland, who had run up 50 points against the Japanese at the same Shizuoka Stadium two years previously and were ranked number one in the world coming into the tournament. Although seen as a free hit for Japan, they were still expected to pick their strongest team for their toughest pool match and there was shock when Leitch was dropped to the bench. \"That was a very interesting week,\" Leitch said with a smile. \"It definitely wasn't a surprise. If the team was to win then the best team needed to play and the way I was playing that wasn't me. \"I had to take it on the chin and prepare the team like I usually do ... One thing I appreciate about Jamie too is that is he not going to beat around the bush and say it nicely. He will say it straight. That is what makes him such a good coach. \"But I had an opportunity to gain his trust again in that second test.\" Leitch did just that, coming on after 30 minutes with Japan trailing 12-3 and inspiring a comeback that left the Irish clinging on to a losing bonus point at the end. \"We knew, as a team, if we got everything right and played to our gameplan, everyone did their individual roles, then we would come away with what we wanted,\" said Leitch. That victory over Ireland would have gone down as the biggest upset at a World Cup had Japan not beaten South Africa at the 2015 tournament. Four years later the Springboks had their revenge, however, defeating the tired Japanese 26-3 in the last of the 2019 quarter-finals before going on to win the tournament. \"If we had played any other team we would have had a different outcome I think,\" said Leitch. \"I wouldn't have done anything differently. I think we prepared very well for that game but credit to South Africa, they brought their 'A' Game - the old scrum and maul. \"We were overwhelmed by the power of the South African scrum.\" - Reuters/nc</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["\"There are a lot of things that Japanese society can take out from what we accomplished at the World Cup.

No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address.\" Just a couple of months later, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China - and quickly demonstrated the accuracy of the report's assessment. The virus, now called COVID-19, was first discovered in China's Wuhan municipality, but was not taken sufficiently seriously by the authorities in the early weeks. Multiple mistakes being made, including the failure to comprehend the virus's speed of transmission, compounded by the delay in informing the public about the outbreak. </p><p>In fact, some who first warned of the disease - most notably the ophthalmologist Li Wenliang - were reprimanded by local authorities. (Li subsequently died of the disease.) It was not until Jan 20 that the government acted, after another doctor, Zhong Nanshan - a hero in China's fight against the 2003 outbreak of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - alerted the public of the seriousness of the new virus. Explore our interactive: All the COVID-19 cases in Singapore and the clusters and links between them Wuhan and neighbouring cities in Hubei province - with a total population of some 58.5 million people - are now in complete lockdown. Across China, as many as 700 million people are largely confined to their homes. AN UNPRECEDENTED RESPONSE China's government subsequently mobilised more than 200 medical teams from around the country, including from the military, to help contain the disease. It also built three new hospitals, and nine temporary hospitals, with unprecedented speed. And it gave provincial, municipal, and county-level governments strict instructions on improving public hygiene, isolating possible victims, and sharing experience and expertise. China's unprecedented response appeared to have slowed the spread of the disease domestically. But densely populated Wuhan is a transportation hub, home to central China's biggest airport, from which roughly 30,000 people, on average, depart daily. This means COVID-19 can and has spread around the world rapidly, testing the public health response capacity of countries far and wide. MORE COUNTRIES NOW FACE THE SAME TEST As of Feb 25, the World Health Organization reported over 80,000 cases in at least 33 countries, and 2,700 deaths (a 3.4 per cent mortality rate). Hubei province accounted for the most cases, and 95 per cent of fatalities so far. South Korea is now second to China for COVID-19 infections, with over 1,200 confirmed cases. The government has placed the country on the highest possible alert - a move that allows for lockdowns and other containment measures. The southeastern city of Daegu, where cases are concentrated, has essentially been under a state of emergency. Japan, with over 800 cases (if you count around 700 from a single cruise ship) is third on the list. READ: Commentary: Three scenarios if the COVID-19 outbreak gets worse READ: Commentary: Japan shows how not to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak The virus is also gaining ground in Europe, with 325 cases confirmed in Italy. The country has now quarantined more than 50,000 people. Even Iran is facing an uptick in infections. Hopes that a pandemic can be averted are dwindling fast. A SERIOUS ECONOMIC TOLL All of this is taking a serious economic toll, as global supply chains are disrupted and services halted. Moreover, Japan's economy - already under pressure from another consumption-tax hike and the fallout from Typhoon Hagibis - seems likely to contract even further. In South Korea, a key hub in global supply chains, Samsung Electronics has suspended smartphone plant operations in Gumi after an employee tested positive for COVID-19. After Apple warned that its quarterly revenues will take a hit, owing to slowed iPhone production and the closure of Apple stores in China, global investors are getting nervous. In the United States, the S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 3 per cent at the start of trading on Feb 24. With the outbreak still escalating, the global damage will run deeper than supply-chain disruptions. The sudden reduction in production and services is driving a shift in consumption patterns and business operations in China toward e-commerce and tele-commuting - a trend that may be mirrored in other affected countries as the virus spreads. A HUGE BELIEF IN CHINA SHAKEN The economic effects of this shift - including changes in Chinese demand for travel, tourism services, and luxury goods - will reverberate globally for months to come. But the more profound effect of the COVID-19 lockdown is on Chinese social dynamics. READ: Commentary: In Hong Kong, the COVID-19 outbreak sent shockwaves but could reinvigorate protests READ: Commentary: Hit hard by COVID-19, Singapore Airlines may need to pursue deeper capacity cuts An unprecedented number of Chinese, up to half of the population, have been trapped indoors for more than a month, with time to reflect on the disease's consequences for life, family, and society. However difficult the lockdown has been, they have been able to count on their government to deliver power, water, and online services reliably. Of course, the government has also faced plenty of criticism on social media for its early attempts to suppress critical information. But it has since allowed more open debate and feedback, as in-depth reports by Caixin magazine have shown. The COVID-19 crisis has shaken the belief that economic prosperity can compensate for social well-being. Death in one-child households terminates the whole generational lineage, something unprecedented in Chinese family history. As a result, the Chinese may reorient themselves toward health, home, and family, after years of rising travel and offline consumption. The global media frenzy, some tinged with coronavirus-fuelled xenophobia, could reinforce China's self-reflection and self-strengthening impulses, particularly in sorting out domestic public health, social security, and governance issues. Already, COVID-19 has led to swift domestic damage control and a massive re-orientation of priorities, such as innovative ways of dealing with business cash flows, survival of SMEs, job disruptions, and restoring key supply chains. A FOCUS ON RESILIENCE NEEDED But even when the virus is contained, escalating geopolitical rivalries, technological disruption, climate change, and the likelihood of new pandemics loom. So, beyond tackling the current crisis, China's government should be working on long-term resilience-building reforms in education, health care, the social safety net, and internal feedback mechanisms. The public expects no less. The same is true worldwide. At a time of unprecedented global interconnectedness, our biggest challenges are shared. Every country must work to build its resilience, or no one will be safe.

This was done through his brand of economics, known as Abenomics, aimed at addressing Japan's low inflation problem, decreasing worker productivity and the challenges raised by an ageing population. Abe has also been credited for restoring relations with China after a bilateral maritime dispute soured relations from 2012 to 2013. That is why there was a wave of concern in the international media recently when PM Abe was admitted to the Keio Hospital for check-ups on Aug 24 and Aug 17, drawing attention to his health. Due to the open transparency requirements of political office holders in Japan, his previously disclosed ailment of chronic colitis is not a new issue. It was the main cause of his resignation during his first term in office from 2006 to 2007. The ailment was managed well in his second term with the use of a new drug. Nevertheless, the visits were sufficient to trigger media speculation over leadership succession within the party. </p><p>CONCERNING TIME FOR LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION If any potential leadership change takes place hypothetically, there are two narratives about its timing. For one, critics of the administration consider these medical check-ups to be an honourable way for the Prime Minister to leave office based on legitimate health reasons. This year alone, Abe has come under criticism from the opposition parties for his plan to raise the retirement age of prosecutors. Critics charged that his government has reacted too slowly to COVID-19. A poll by Nikkei TV in May showed that 55 per cent of the respondents did not agree with Abe's handling of the crisis though the NHK poll released on Aug 12 showed that 58 per cent of those who support the Cabinet said it is better than other ministerial line-ups. READ: Commentary: How many times must Japan be urged to step up COVID-19 testing? However, many Abe allies and their Japanese supporters do not see the need to change leadership in the middle of an economic crisis and a pandemic. They have argued political continuity will be key in this battle. As of Aug 27, Japan has recorded 63,822 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 1,209 deaths. At 45th highest number of cases overall in the world, these are relatively low numbers in advanced economies. It has suffered its worst economic growth in the post-war period, as its second quarter GDP dropped at an annualised rate of 27.8 per cent though its 7.8 per cent drop from the previous quarter makes it the best performing economy among G7 economies. Despite criticisms, there is also a tacit acknowledgement that Abe is probably Japan's best bet to engineer a credible response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has after all provided a strong economic policy response to the post-bubble economy since coming into office. READ: Commentary: Japan sure is smug about beating COVID-19 There is also concern and recognition that many of his potential successors may not have the necessary factional support of leading the country out of economic difficulties yet. THE CONTENDERS FOR THE POST Contenders being highlighted by the media include younger members of Abe's cabinet: Toshimitsu Motegi, who is a trusted Abe confidante, negotiator for the US-Japan free trade agreement and now the country's Foreign Minister; Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, Defence Minister Taro Kono who is also a Washington insider, former Foreign Minister and the son of veteran China-hand and former Speaker of the House Yohei Kono. In terms of dark horse candidates, another name floated in the media is that of former economy, trade and industry minister Yuko Obuchi - the daughter of former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi who was replaced in 2000 due to a stroke while Yuko stepped down due to a scandal. She stands out as the only female candidate in this race mentioned in the media though current Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's name was momentarily also mentioned. READ: Commentary: Yuriko Koike, the woman who may be Japan's first female prime minister Besides these younger politicians, two veterans have also been touted as potential candidates: Yoshihide Suga, a trusted Abe ally and Chief Cabinet Secretary, and former LDP Secretary General Shigeru Ishiba who was formerly also Abe's main rival and contender for prime ministership. Since 2019, Japan's media has scrutinised these candidates. At various points, different candidates have enjoyed more attention since speculation that Abe may call for a snap election to renew his mandate was afoot, even though his current term lasts until September 2021. JAPAN'S BEST BETS FOR SUCCESSION That speculation continued this week as news of Abe's illness broke. This time, it was Foreign Minister Motegi's turn to enjoy the media spotlight. Presently, Motegi is also the favourite to succeed Abe. Motegi's success in building factional support, especially from the powerful Taro Aso - the current Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister - faction could prove useful in the current pandemic and economic scenarios. This is an essential step for any would-be PM aspirant as the consensus seeking nature of the Japanese political system requires its leader to be a skilful aggregator of the different interests of all stakeholders, rather than behave like an authoritarian leader. His dine-in meeting with Aso on Jul 31 was highly publicised and has positioned him as a strong and driven leader who can mobilise factional support to manage the multiple crises facing Japan. Motegi's biggest obstacle is perceived to be the faction of Wataru Takeshita, the former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) General Council Chairperson, which previously split along the lines of support for Abe in the 2018 LDP Presidential election. In the last two years, Fumio Kishida, former Foreign Minister and now chairman of the LDP's Policy Research Council, enjoyed media attention as a candidate for political succession. But, due to the pandemic, Kishida's clout has weakened in 2020 as his COVID-19 relief plan was dropped in favour of an alternative plan advocated by LDP's coalition partner, the Komeito Party. READ: Commentary: The road to a COVID-19 vaccine is long and narrowing He also carries the image of a dovish peacetime leader rather than a strong crisis leader who has to handle severe ongoing China-US tensions, challenging bilateral relations with South Korea, as well as managing the devastating economic impact of COVID-19. In fact, before the emergence of Motegi as frontrunner, veteran Suga was floated as an alternative candidate since he enjoys factional support inside the party and has a positive working relationship with LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai. Another who has impressed in recent times is Koike. In addition to providing gender diversity, the Tokyo Governor has been heralded by the media for her skilful management of the COVID-19 mitigation measures in Tokyo. Her success in doing so may convince Japan's lawmakers that she could replicate that formula on the national level too. As for future leaders-in-waiting, 2019 witnessed the emergence of a young and rising political star - Koizumi. He is the second son of charismatic former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the third youngest individual to assume a cabinet-level post in Japanese political history. Koizumi's ministerial portfolio is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has given him much-needed crisis management experience. As Environment Minister, he has to manage the fallout from the damaged Fukushima nuclear reactor, given domestic and international concerns over its leakage. Barely a month into his ministerial post in 2019, Koizumi was already put to the test in the public eye when Japan was hit by a series of typhoons, including Typhoon Hagibis, the deadliest typhoon to have directly hit Tokyo in half a century. Many consider Koizumi to be a Washington insider as he is well-acquainted with Washington DC's corridors of power as well as top Japan specialists and academics in the US. Koizumi graduated with a Masters in Political Science from Columbia University and interacted with top US-based Japan specialists while he also worked in the well-known US think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. His political pedigree as the fourth generation in his family to be in politics, US education and familiarity with Washington hands are advantageous to his future political ambitions, putting him in good stead for managing international relations in a future leadership role. His charismatic popularity with the Japanese public is another plus point. If he becomes prime minister, he can help win back support for the government, which according to opinion polls stands at 49 per cent. JAPAN'S POLITICAL FUTURE APPEARS BRIGHT While having a competent and experienced prime minister could be crucial, Japan's population can take heart knowing that, regardless, the leader of their country will have access to a highly-competent bureaucracy that not only enjoys wide public support and legitimacy but also provides sound and experienced policy advice. While it is yet unclear if Abe will or need to step down, at least the attention on his health issues has opened up a conversation on what Japan's political future after Abe may look like. Even if there is no change in the prime minister appointment, it seems a whole new generation of younger leaders have emerged to take over the baton in any post-Abe scenario. The state of Japanese leadership succession is energetically competitive with no lack of credible candidates. That may be a bright spot in an otherwise challenging period for the nation.

Average temperatures for the last five years were the highest on record for most of the planet. Land-based global temperature from January to October 2019 was approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, according to the World Meteorological Office. In Singapore, 2019 was our joint hottest year on record, on par with 2016 temperatures. The island state is heating up at about 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade - twice as fast as the rest of the world, according to the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS). READ: Commentary: That low-carbon future for Singapore isn't so far-fetched Worse, our planet's oceans, which act as a buffer by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide, continue to heat up far more quickly than previously thought. </p><p>Recent research has estimated the oceans are heating up 40 per cent faster on average than estimated five years ago. At our coast, the rate of sea level rise continues to accelerate primarily due to the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a record 411.85 parts per million (ppm) in December 2019. Carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere stays there for centuries, and carbon dioxide taken into the ocean stays for even longer, thus locking us into further climate change and global warming. HOTTER DAYS Our planet continues to heat up on average. Singapore's hottest day in 2019 was Apr 17, with 36.4 degrees C measured in Paya Lebar, according to the MSS. Our hottest days are likely to get even hotter. Hotter days are not only unpleasant for humans and many animals, but they will likely place greater strain on human health and our health system in Singapore. An increase in the number of days over 36 degrees will place tremendous stress on our vulnerable elderly and those that work outdoors. Singapore and much of Southeast Asia already experience relatively hot temperatures and high humidity year-round. High humidity means perspiration doesn't evaporate as quickly placing stress on your body as it is harder to stay cool. If the temperature continues to rise and humidity remains high then there will likely be an increase in the number of people who experience heat exhaustion and heat stroke. READ: Climate change, floods and drought: Here's how badly Singapore could be affected READ: Commentary: Jakarta, the fastest sinking city in the world faces the biggest flooding challenge This problem is not unique to Singapore. Many other regions across Asia are likely to feel the pressures of extreme heat and its effects on ageing populations and the economically disadvantaged. ABNORMAL WEATHER EVENTS While the average climate change indicators continue rising, the day-to-day impact of climate change on our lives are felt through extreme or \"abnormal\" weather events. One of the main impact of climate change is erratic rainfall patterns. Such variability in rainfall threatens agriculture and crop yields, which combined with population increase, pose considerable food security challenges to vulnerable countries in the region. In mid-2019, Thailand saw a significant drop in rice production as reservoirs dried up. Australia, a net exporter of wheat, faced the unique case of needing to seek imports to supply its domestic demand. Other events in 2019 also demonstrated the importance of understanding extreme events such as floods and droughts, as much of Asia received abnormally high or low rainfall. In India, the onset and withdrawal of the Indian Monsoon was delayed, causing a dry spell and water stress in June. The dry spell was followed by extreme rainfall that generated a series of floods in late July and early August 2019. The floods killed at least 200 people and displaced more than a million. People were going from having no water in a drought to too much water in floods in the space of a few weeks. Exceptionally dry conditions prevailed in Asia Pacific over 2019, especially Indonesia and the Mekong basin in the second half, which led to the most significant fire season since 2015, with haze spreading across the region, including Singapore.

Drought conditions in Australia also highlighted this peril to the world. Much of inland eastern Australia had been experiencing drought through 2017 and 2018, and in 2019, the drought expanded and intensified. Australia just experienced its worst fire season in recent memory, but as some fires ended, the rains came. Much of fire-ravaged eastern Australia is now experiencing dramatic flood events. There should be no doubt the Australian fires are linked to climate change. A warmer, dryer atmosphere coupled with prolonged drought were a catastrophe waiting to happen. The Australian government was warned repeatedly and accurately. The Garnaut Climate Change Review of 2008 said projections of fire weather \"suggest that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later, and generally be more intense\", further stating that \"this effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020.\" Other climate extremes that made the news several times in 2019 were tropical cyclones or typhoons, with Typhoon Hagibis barely missing Tokyo in October, but still causing severe flooding and significant economic losses. Toward year-end, the people of the central Philippines experienced yet another damaging typhoon, as Typhoon Phanfone battered the Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet, miserable and terrifying holiday to millions. With continued warming of our oceans, the future of cyclones and storms remains a topic of considerable debate. Here too, there is much more to do to answer questions about the future of cyclones in our region. READ: Commentary: I care about climate change. I don't wish to live in a Waterworld like Kevin Costner THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE RESEARCH Climate researchers are always examining the likelihood of changes in how often extreme weather and climate events will occur and whether or not they will become larger and more damaging. Unfortunately, our understanding of the dynamic processes in the tropics remains rather poor. We have very little data on the comparative frequency and intensity of past events. However, the extreme climate events of 2019 have generated a groundswell of activity calling for a new wave of climate impact research. In July 2019, for instance, Malaysia's Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources commissioned a national audit on the water industry in anticipation of the longer droughts expected due to climate change. Such research would inform and facilitate efforts by industries and governments to improve the way they interpret and manage risks around extreme climate events. What we do know is that extreme events are commonly the result of a combination of driving factors. Multiple hazardous events cascade when they act as a series. For example, droughts can lead to increased risk of wildfires, which then heighten the risk of landslides. This rising risk posed by extreme events is very real in the tropics and Asia's emerging cities. We urgently need to dig deeper for detailed investigations of likely changes in storm systems, dry periods, extreme rainfall or heat in the context of a rapidly changing climate.

CORE ISSUES FOR SINGAPORE'S FUTURE Climate change and climatic extremes are a core issue for Singapore's future. Not only do hotter days strain public health, but prolonged droughts or dry spells will almost certainly stress our water supply. This will force Singapore to consider further investment in relatively expensive water recycling and desalinisation engineering. Moreover, flooding events are all likely to affect the everyday lives of many Singaporeans by disrupting transport and business. READ: Commentary: As time runs out on the climate crisis, Singapore prepares to address the cost of adapting Against the backdrop of rising sea levels, Singapore faces an increased risk of compound flooding as flood waters reach our coast. In his Budget 2020 speech, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a new Coastal and Flood Protection fund with an initial injection of S$5 billion. Being that climate change adaptation might cost S$100 billion or more over 100 years, Singapore is beginning to set aside resources for it. As we keep an eye on climate change, it's crucial that we understand how it can manifest as extreme weather, with adverse impact on Singapore and the region.

Another 15 were missing and 177 injured by Typhoon Hagibis, which paralysed Tokyo on Saturday and dumped record levels of rain around Japan. About 100,000 homes were left without power. Rescue efforts were hindered after more than 20 rivers in central and northeastern Japan burst their banks and dozens more overflowed although their banks were still in tact, NHK said, adding that flooding rivers could cause more damage.

At one evacuation centre there, Kiyokazu Shimokawa, 71, said he waited all night with his wife and mother until they were finally rescued around 3pm (2pm Singapore time) on Sunday. \"I made the mistake of figuring that as long as we were on the second floor of the house, we'd be fine,\" he told Reuters. \"When we realised that maybe we should evacuate, it was too late - the water rose very quickly.\" Rie Hasegawa, a woman in her 30s, said she never imagined her landlocked town would face a water-related disaster, recounting how shocked she was at how fast it all happened. \"The force of the water was incredible.

The storm sank a Panama-registered cargo ship that had anchored near Tokyo. The sunken ship was located early on Sunday. A newspaper reported that at least five of the 12 crew were dead and three were missing.

The government set up a task force to deal with the damage. \"I extend my condolences for all those who lost their lives and offer my sympathy to all those impacted by Typhoon No.19 (Hagibis),\" Abe said. \"With respect to blackouts, water outage and suspension of transportation services, we intend to exert all-out efforts for the earliest recovery ... we ask the public to remain vigilant of landslides and other hazards,\" he said. Some 27,000 members of Japan's self-defence forces as well as firefighters, police and coast guard members were sent to rescue stranded people in central Japan's Nagano prefecture and elsewhere, the government said. Some came in helicopters who winched people from the roofs and balconies of flooded homes. FLOODS, LANDSLIDES NHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels. With thousands of homes without power, Japanese feared a repeat of the weeks-long power outages after last month's typhoon that hit east of Tokyo. In Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Tepco spokeswoman Emi Iwasa said the typhoon triggered 11 leak alerts at the plant. Of those, eight were confirmed as being triggered by rainwater and the rest were still being investigated. Iwasa said the operator had so far not confirmed if any radioactive water leaked into sea. Landing restrictions at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports were lifted but more than 800 flights were cancelled for the day, NHK said, as were some Shinkansen bullet train services to the worst-hit areas.

The storm claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver. The first floor of a large aged care home in Nagano city was shown under water. Rescuers took residents from another flooded aged care facility by inflatable boats and carried them on their backs to safety. They also searched for survivors in homes destroyed in landslides near Tokyo's suburbs and in Fukushima prefecture, NHK showed. \"GREAT IMPACT\" Bodies were retrieved from homes and vehicles submerged by floodwaters, from raging overflowing rivers, and from buildings buried in landslides. NHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels. \"We continue to see a great impact on people's life,\" Mr Abe said. \"The government will do its utmost,\" he added, pledging to deploy more troops and emergency officials if needed. Authorities at one point issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Close to 150 injuries have been reported so far, NHK said. The storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm of rain over 24 hours. \"The water came up higher than my head in the house,\" Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP. He moved to his family's home nearby, but that flooded too and they had to be rescued by boat. In Saitama's Higashi Matsuyama city, northwest of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses, with water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested product. \"We never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,\" said one farmer, who declined to give his name. \"We cannot even go into the flower warehouse due to the water. I don't know where to start cleaning this mess.\" The Japan Meteorological Agency had issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of the potential for once-in-decades rain totals, but lifted them early on Sunday. Just last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.

Wing Kenki Fukuoka led the way with two tries, while Kotaro Matsushima and Keita Inagaki also scored as the hosts held off a fierce second-half assault from a team they had lost against in all seven of their previous meetings. When Japan beat South Africa four years ago - having won only one of their previous 24 World Cup matches - it was considered the greatest shock in rugby history. This time, having already beaten Ireland three weeks ago, it did not even feel like a real surprise. They were faster, sharper, more inventive and, roared on by the vast majority of the delirious red-clad 72,00 crowd, absolutely relentless in everything they did as they became the first tier-two team to reach the last eight since Fiji in 2007. Having won all four of their matches to top Pool A, they will face the Springboks again in the quarter-finals and the twice-champions will be taking absolutely nothing for granted. </p><p>The result also meant that Ireland, through as runners-up, will play New Zealand. \"Tonight we went another level,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could. This is what it takes to win big test matches.\" The match was given the go-ahead only on Sunday morning after an inspection of the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis and proved a wonderfully uplifting occasion for the country after the death and destruction wrought by the storm. \"Whilst we are celebrating tonight there are a lot of people who aren't,\" Joseph said. Captain Michael Leitch said that the victory owed more to heart than skill and while that might be true of their mighty defensive effort in the final quarter, no team in the tournament so far has come close to matching the pace and directness of Japan's first-half assault. READ: Japan-Scotland match goes ahead after Typhoon Hagibis EXPLOSION OF NOISE Scotland were first on the board with a Finn Russell try after seven minutes but Japan hit back with a brilliantly-worked, high-tempo score that set the tone for the night. Fukuoka tore down the left and as he was tackled to the floor, slung a one-armed pass into the arms of the supporting Matsushima to go over and detonate an explosion of noise. If that was good, their next score was a contender for try of the tournament. Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity. Japan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of the Fukuoka. It was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try. The Scots, who came from 31-0 down to draw 38-38 with England in the Six Nations in March, dredged up that Twickenham spirit from somewhere as WP Nel and Zander Fagerson scored to get back within seven points with 25 minutes to go. It was relentless Scottish pressure and desperate, at times demented, Japanese defending from then on, but the hosts held out for another famous victory in what became a deafening cauldron of noise. It was only the second time Scotland have failed to reach the last eight - the other coming in 2011 - but they can have few complaints, bookending wins over Russia and Samoa with defeats by Ireland and the hosts. \"We had a mountain to climb after that first half but we started climbing it and I thought the effort the players put in to get back to within seven points was excellent,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \"We were obviously aware that this was huge for the home nation.

Scotland (currently 10 points) would be eliminated. Ireland (11 points) can guarantee progress with a bonus-point victory over Samoa (5). An Irish win without a bonus point could open the way for a three-way tie at the top on 15 points if Sunday's game goes ahead. In that scenario, the deadlock would be initially settled by total points difference, which currently stands at Scotland (+71), Ireland (+52) and Japan (+46). If Scotland still have the higher difference after the last two matches, they would top the group. For second place and the other ticket to the quarter-finals, the process reverts to head-to-head results and would send Japan through thanks to their win over Ireland. Should Ireland end with the best overall points difference, they would top the group and Scotland would go through in second place after what would be their win over Japan. If Scotland beat Japan with no bonus points for either side, they would pip the hosts on the head-to-head result and progress. Depending on the Ireland result, Scotland could also advance with a bonus point win - assuming Japan do not collect two bonus points in defeat. If Japan gain a losing bonus point and Scotland fail to claim a bonus point, Japan would finish above the Scots and advance to the knockout stage in first or second place. Victory or a draw for Japan would seal top spot, but they would also go through as pool winners if they lose to Scotland by seven points or less but score four tries, delivering a rare two bonus points. Four years ago Japan won three games but finished third in their pool because of bonus points, pipped to qualification by Scotland and South Africa - the only time a team has won three pool matches and not progressed. Likely outcome: Ireland to qualify with bonus-point victory over Samoa. Too close to call on who joins them. POOL B After the cancellation of New Zealand's game against Italy, the top three places are settled. New Zealand (16) top the group, with South Africa (15) runners-up. Italy (12) finish third. New Zealand will play the Pool A runners-up, with South Africa playing the Group A winners. POOL C Things are also settled here after England v France was cancelled. England (17) and France (15) are through to the last eight. Group winners England will play the runners-up from Pool D, probably Australia, with France likely to play Wales. POOL D Australia (16) and Wales (14) are guaranteed a place in the last eight but the pool's final match - Wales v Uruguay (4) on Sunday - could also still fall foul of the weather. If it is cancelled, Wales would collect two points to finish level with Australia but would get top spot due to beating them earlier in the tournament. If the game goes ahead, any sort of win for Wales would also put them top, although they would still top the group in the unlikely scenario of them picking up two losing bonus points. Fiji (7) finished third to secure automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup. Likely outcome: Wales to win last game against Uruguay, top the group and play France in last eight.

Both games were in the projected path of the large and powerful typhoon, which currently has a \"violent\" rating - the highest category by Japan's weather bureau - and is due to hit the Tokyo area on Saturday. Sunday's four games, including the key Pool A shoot-out between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama, near Tokyo, remain under review, said tournament director Alan Gilpin. \"We've taken the very difficult decision to cancel certain matches in the affected areas,\" Gilpin said. </p><p>\"While it's regrettable, we've made, we believe, the right decision with everyone's safety as the priority,\" he added. READ: England boss thanks 'typhoon gods' after World Cup game axed Tens of thousands of fans, many of them visitors from abroad, will be affected by the cancellations - the first in the tournament's 32-year history. Their tickets will be fully refunded, Gilpin said. Japan, whose capital Tokyo hosts the Olympics next year, is battered by around 20 typhoons per year and is one of the world's most seismically active countries. But Gilpin stressed he had \"no regrets at all\" about bringing the World Cup to Japan, the first Asian country to host the tournament. \"I think what you've all seen over the last three weeks absolutely in every respect vindicates the right decisions to be hosting a World Cup here in Japan,\" he said. \"We always knew there were going to be risks. It's rare for a typhoon of this magnitude to cause this impact this late in the typhoon season.\" He added that World Rugby had looked \"pretty exhaustively\" at other options for the games, including switching venues, but \"we couldn't guarantee consistent contingency plans across all those games safely for all the teams and fans involved\". Seven games were slated for the final weekend of the pool stage, when matches are tightly packed and cannot be rescheduled. Cancelled games are recorded as 0-0 draws, with both teams awarded two points. IMPACT ON FINAL PLACINGS England and France have already booked a spot in the quarter-finals but the decision to cancel Italy's match eliminates them from contention. A win over the All Blacks in Toyota could have taken the Italians through. New Zealand now top the group, ahead of South Africa. With hosts Japan and Scotland still locked in battle for a place in the knockout round, any decision to cancel that game will have a huge impact on the final placings. That decision will be taken on the day of the game. If Japan's match in Yokohama is cancelled, the hosts would go into the quarter-finals for the first time. Organisers received immediate criticism for the cancellations, with former World Cup winner Francois Pienaar telling Sky Sports: \"Everybody has worked so hard. Why, if you work that hard and prepare yourself, let weather influence the outcome of the match? It shouldn't.\" Simon Learey, a British fan here, said he had flown out for the England-France game after getting the tickets as a birthday present. \"Very disappointed, we're only here four days, only to see that game,\" said Learey. But World Rugby's Gilpin said safety had to be the determining factor in these decisions. \"We fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first,\" he said. Japan's Meteorological Agency said Hagibis was currently \"a large and violent typhoon\" and while it will weaken before hitting the mainland, it will \"remain very strong\" and have a \"significant impact over large areas\". Hagibis is currently forecast to clip the southeastern corner of Japan near Tokyo and Yokohama but given its size, the impact will be felt across wide swathes of the country. Formula One organisers also said they were \"closely monitoring\" the potential impact of Hagibis ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, southwest of Tokyo.

Gilpin defended the decision to hold the tournament, the first to be hosted in Asia, at this time of year. \"We always knew there would be risks but it's rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year,\" he said, adding that he did not feel the integrity of the tournament had been compromised. \"We have no regrets.\" CANCELLED GAMES Tournament regulations state that cancelled games are ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points going to each team. That would be enough to ensure Japan reach the quarter-finals if their game falls victim to the typhoon, which might look like some sort of sporting karma to their supporters. Four years ago Japan beat South Africa in the biggest upset in rugby history but then became the first team to fail to reach the knockout round after winning three pool games, being edged out on bonus points by Scotland. A decision on whether that match will be played is set to be made early on Sunday and the Scottish Rugby Union said it expected the game to go ahead. \"Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch and will be flexible to accommodate this,\" the SRU said on Twitter. Coach Gregor Townsend added: \"I hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played. We have got to believe, and have faith in the organisers, even if it is behind closed doors or played at a different venue.\" Ireland are due to play their final game against Samoa on Saturday knowing a bonus point victory would ensure progress. A win without a bonus point, or even a bonus point in defeat, would also send the Irish through if Japan's game is called off. Italy finished third behind New Zealand and South Africa after their match against the All Blacks was cancelled leaving an angry Parisse to question the tournament regulations. \"If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled,\" said the man who has been the backbone of Italian rugby for years. \"It is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn't news that typhoons hit Japan. \"Sure, everyone might think that Italy v New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team.\" Coach Conor O'Shea said the players' reaction to the news was \"horrible.\" \"Their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field,\" he said. New Zealand finish top of the group with South Africa going through as runners-up. Thursday's decision marks the first time a World Cup match has been cancelled since the tournament started in 1987. The 1995 semi-final between hosts South Africa and France was delayed by an hour due to a waterlogged pitch, but famously went ahead after a team of cleaning ladies took to it with brooms.

Here's a snapshot of some of the extreme weather events around the world this year. BUSHFIRES IN AUSTRALIA Australian bushfires have caused unprecedented pollution along the country's east coast, blanketing cities from Sydney to Brisbane in smoke for weeks on end. At least six people have died and more than 700 homes destroyed. </p><p>In early December, a spokesperson for the New South Wales department of environment declared that the bushfires and dust have caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen\" in Australia. READ: Sydney smoke crisis \"longest on record\" READ: Australians protest as bushfire haze sparks health concerns The region \"has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks\", but \"this event ... is the longest and the most widespread in our records\", she said. Bushfires are common in Australia, but scientists say this year's season has come earlier and with more intensity due to a prolonged drought fuelled by climate change. The fires have spawned numerous headlines, putting the spotlight on everything from the fate of golf's prestigious Australian Open to that of the hundreds of koalas living in the fire zone. Earlier this week, up to 20,000 protesters rallied in Sydney demanding urgent climate action from Australia's government, as smoke from the bushfires choking the city caused health problems to spike.

In May, Cyclone Fani made landfall, killing at least 34 in India and five in Bangladesh. One of the most powerful storms to hit the area in years, the cyclone destroyed houses, ripped off roofs and cut off power, water and telecommunications. Later in November, the destruction from Cyclone Bulbul killed at least 20 people in Bangladesh. More than 2 million were evacuated from their homes. Bangladesh's low-lying coast, as well as India's east are regularly faced with clones. In recent decades, at least hundreds of thousands of people living around the Bay of Bengal have been killed. HEATWAVE IN EUROPE A ferocious heatwave smashed records across Europe in the middle of the year, with the temperature in France surpassing 45 degrees Celsius for the first time on record. The country, along with Spain, Italy and parts of central Europe were particularly hit by the soaring temperatures. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands all saw new temperature records as well. READ: Europe's record-setting heatwave to spike even higher The extreme temperature caused about 1,500 more deaths than usual in France over June and July, up 9.1 per cent on average for the period according to the country's health ministry. The World Meteorological Organisation said the heatwave in Europe was \"absolutely consistent\" with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. FLOODING IN VENICE On top of sweltering summer temperatures, Venice was also hit with bouts of intense flooding as it neared the end of the year. The UNESCO World Heritage Site was hit by multiple major floods in less than a week, with water levels hitting their highest in half a century, at one point leaving about 80 per cent of the city submerged. READ: Devastated Venice braced for third major flood The crisis led to the government releasing (EURO)20 million (US$22 million) to tackle the devastation to churches, shops and homes. \"On behalf of the whole team, we stand close to the city of Venice,\" said Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. He was speaking on behalf of the country's football team, which had travelled to Venice in a show of solidarity. TYPHOON HAGIBIS Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan in October, killing more than 70 people across the country and triggering landslides, fierce wind and rain, and causing dozens of rivers to burst their banks. Tens of thousands of households suffered electricity blackouts and more than 100,000 households were without running water. READ: Japanese rescuers continue search for typhoon survivors as toll reaches 74 Rescuers were working round the clock to help those affected, with the defence ministry calling up several hundred reserve troops for the first time since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The crisis led Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to announce a 710 million yen (US$6.5 million) package to help areas affected by the typhoon. TYPHOON KAMMURI More recently, the deadly Typhoon Kammuri pounded the Philippines earlier this month, killing at least 13 people, toppling trees and flattening homes. The country's Ninoy Aquino International Airport was closed for half a day as a precaution, affecting hundreds of flights, while the SEA Games 2019 saw some programming postponed. The passage of the typhoon also intensified monsoon rains in the country's north, leaving the region hit by some of its worst flooding in decades and forcing tens of thousands from their homes.

A large part of the reason the Wallabies are facing the English this weekend is that Wales raced away to a 23-8 halftime lead in the crunch Tokyo match that effectively decided the winners of Pool D. Australia fought back to within one point in the second half, but the Welsh held on to win 29-25 and now face France on Sunday at the same Oita Stadium where the Wallabies take on England on Saturday.

The match will be special for Aki, who was born in New Zealand to Samoan parents but joined Irish side Connacht in 2014 and qualified for Ireland on residency.

Horne scored his first two tries from scrumhalf and added a third from the left wing as Scotland finally got their high-octane running game going in their third match in Japan. Flyhalf Adam Hastings, son of Scotland great Gavin, also made a significant contribution with the first two tries in four first-half minutes and eight conversions for a personal haul of 26 points. Horne actually crossed for what seemed like a Scottish record-equalling fourth try only for referee Wayne Barnes to call it back for a forward pass. </p><p>\"That's stage one of a two-stage week completed,\" Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said. \"As an all-round team performance, it was excellent.\" Neither Horne not Hastings are likely to start in Yokohama on Sunday when the Scots take on Japan almost certainly needing to record a victory and deprive the hosts of a bonus point to progress to the knockout stages. \"It'll be huge, our focus now is on recovery, making sure we get our preparation right for that game, and our selection,\" Townsend added. \"We've watched a lot of Japan, and I know they've watched a lot of us too. \"We've just got to make sure we deliver our best performance - we'll have to because Japan are a very good team.\" TYPHOON CONCERNS That match in Yokohama, however, is in danger of being disrupted by Typhoon Hagibis, which is projected to strike the Tokyo area on Saturday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. Tournament rules state that any pool game that cannot be played is not rescheduled and instead is recorded as a 0-0 draw, with no bonus points available. Scotland made 14 changes from the team that beat Samoa 34-0 and many of the players had a dual goal of winning the game as well as trying to force their way into consideration for Sunday's match. Scotland's scoring in the first half came in an eight-minute burst with Hastings crossing twice, while Horne intercepted a flat pass by Dmitry Perov on his own tryline to give Scotland a 21-0 lead at the break. Horne then secured the bonus point after a brilliant weaving run of more than 60 metres from Darcy Graham, who was the only player who also started against Samoa. Russia then ran out of steam and their defence faltered as they missed 41 tackles with hooker George Turner and winger Tommy Seymour crossing before Horne completed his hat-trick with more than 20 minutes remaining. Match captain John Barclay brought up the half century, just the 13th time Scotland have surpassed 50 points in tests, when he burst free with about five minutes remaining. \"We enjoyed that one, sometimes those games can get a bit scrappy,\" Barclay said. \"We were a bit nervous about this game having seen what Russia did to other teams at the tournament but we prepared well, we were very professional, played the game we wanted to play and came away with a good result.\" Squad captain Stuart McInally completed the scoring, although Hastings did cross after the gong only for Barnes to again rule the try out. \"Scotland were quick and fast and had studied us well, they played well,\" Russia coach Lyn Jones said. \"We were hoping to finish with a flourish but so be it.\" - Reuters/nr</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["\"We've watched a lot of Japan, and I know they've watched a lot of us too. \"We've just got to make sure we deliver our best performance - we'll have to because Japan are a very good team.

Dallaglio, who won the 2003 World Cup with England playing at number eight, believes New Zealand represents the biggest challenge yet for Eddie Jones' side but that recent improvements in the back row could prove decisive. England flankers Tom Curry and Sam Underhill have impressed so far in the tournament, with the former winning man of the match in the quarter-final victory over Australia. However, they, along with England number eight Billy Vunipola, will have their work cut out against a vastly experienced New Zealand back row that includes captain Kieran Read and flanker Ardie Savea, a candidate for player of the tournament. </p><p>\"I have been impressed with both back rows,\" Dallaglio told Reuters on Tuesday. \"Let's not forget Kieran Read is pretty tidy himself, quite handy and done a few things in rugby, and then Billy Vunipola is quite a special player. \"So it's a wonderful battle within the war.\" As Dallaglio knows from England's success in 2003, the whole forward pack has to work as one unit if they are to free up the flankers to work their magic as traditional number sevens, breakdown specialists adept at turning over the ball. \"The whole pack is a unit and if the front five, the tight five, go well then it allows the back row to play in a very different way,\" said Dallaglio. \"It's a really intriguing battle within the match itself and one that - obviously I am slightly biased - I am quite looking forward to and hard to pick a winner.\" MORE TO COME FROM ENGLAND England have won all four of their matches so far at this World Cup, but as the pool stage match against France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis and Argentina were reduced to 14 men early in their encounter, the team had a lot to prove heading into the quarter-final. Dallaglio thinks England answered any questions \"emphatically\" with a 40-16 win over Australia, but more will be needed against reigning world champions New Zealand. \"Like Eddie (Jones) and probably like a lot of England fans I think hopefully the best is yet to come,\" he said. \"There is a lot more left in this England side.\" England managed its way through the pool stages without facing a really challenging encounter, he said, but stepped up well against what he described as a \"good\" Australian side. \"At times they played exceptionally well and they will take a lot of confidence from that,\" Dallaglio said. \"They are certainly on-plan and they obviously now have to go up another level as well against the best side in the world.\" New Zealand, who have won 18 World Cup matches in a row, boast plenty of winning experience within their ranks, not least at head coach, with Steve Hansen aiming to become the first man to lead his team to back-to-back titles. However, Dallaglio sees Jones as England's possible trump card with the Australian aiming to reach his third World Cup final. Jones was beaten by Dallaglio's England as Australia's head coach in the 2003 final, before becoming an advisor for South Africa during their 2007 World Cup win. \"This is Eddie Jones' fourth World Cup as a coach or head coach,\" said Dallaglio. \"This is his moment as a coach and he knows he has a team that are capable of going all the way to the final and winning it.\" (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; editing by Richard Pullin) - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["\"The whole pack is a unit and if the front five, the tight five, go well then it allows the back row to play in a very different way,\" said Dallaglio. \"It's a really intriguing battle within the match itself and one that - obviously I am slightly biased - I am quite looking forward to and hard to pick a winner.

There are at least two reasons for this despair.</p><p>One is to be found in Thunberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sweden. In a speech delivered at the Climate March in Stockholm on Sept 8 last year, Thunberg accused the Swedes of living a life that uses the resources of 4.2 planets. Sweden, she said, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stealing 3.2 years of natural resources from future generations every year\u00e2\u20ac. Little wonder it has a carbon footprint that is one of the 10 worst in the world. Hard to argue with this, especially when she was speaking with the authority of Swedish climate scientist Johan Rockstrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data. Two, planet Earth is burning and \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to the discerning young eyes from Sweden to Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Neros of the world are playing the fiddle. Recent climate disasters bear this out. When this Leader was going to press, 140 bush fires were raging in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. One such, says the The Guardian of the United Kingdom, is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mega fire\u00e2\u20ac that is already the size of greater Sydney. Fire officers are saying the Sydney fire is too big to be put out.</p><p>Asia and Africa weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spared either. In China, Typhoon Lekima killed 72 in August sweeping through several provinces, causing severe floods and bringing down bridges and a dam. Typhoon Hagibis did the same in Japan in October, with 12 more deaths. Earlier in July, 162 died in a heatwave in Kumagaya near Tokyo. In India, 90 died in a heatwave in June, when temperatures hit 49\u00c2\u00baC. In March, Cyclone Idai, the deadliest storm ever to occur in the Southern Hemisphere \u00e2\u20ac\u201d according to US News \u00e2\u20ac\u201d killed 602 in Mozambique and 299 in Zimbabwe.</p><p>But fear alone would not get the climate job done. Fortunately, there is a business case for reducing our carbon footprint. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres has the numbers. Speaking to young climate activists in September last year, Guterres said, if we continued with our present lifestyle, it will cost the world US$2 trillion by 2030. Already, it is costing the United States US$240 billion a year to run its economy on fossil fuel. Investments against climate threats too come with a business case.

Berkshire benefited as resilience in consumer spending helped cause U.S. economic growth to slow less than expected, offsetting a contraction in business investment. But rising stock prices are still impeding Buffett's efforts to find places to invest. Berkshire ended September with a record US$128.2 billion of cash, despite repurchasing US$700 million of stock in the quarter. </p><p>Buffett has gone nearly four years since making a major acquisition for Berkshire, whose stock price has lagged the broader market by the most since 2009. \"There is a growing frustration among investors that the cash hoard is not being effectively deployed,\" Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said after Berkshire released its results. \"The flip side is that Berkshire's stock tends to do well when the economy softens.\" Seifert also said Berkshire's sprawl means results will often mirror macroeconomic trends. \"It's not surprising that tariffs had a negative impact on its consumer and industrial businesses,\" she said. Seifert rates Berkshire \"hold.\" Berkshire said third-quarter operating income rose 14per cent to US$7.86 billion, or roughly US$4,816 per Class A share, from US$6.88 billion, or roughly US$4,189 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected operating profit of US$4,405.16 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES. Net income fell 11per cent to US$16.52 billion, or US$10,119 per Class A share, from US$18.54 billion, or US$11,280 per share, reflecting fewer gains from Berkshire's investments. A U.S. accounting rule requires earnings to reflect unrealized gains, including on Berkshire's respective US$57 billion and US$27.8 billion stakes in Apple Inc and Bank of America Corp . Buffett said the resulting volatility can mislead investors. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and operates more than 90 businesses including the Geico auto insurer, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, and its namesake energy company and real estate brokerage. Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at US$323,400, up 5.7per cent in 2019, lagging the 22.3per cent gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 . Class B shares closed at US$215.83, also up 5.7per cent. TARIFFS WEIGH U.S. gross domestic product increased at a 1.9per cent annualized rate in the third quarter, the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday in its advance estimate of economic growth. But the Federal Reserve on the same day nevertheless lowered interest rates for the third time this year amid uncertainty over trade policy, slowing global growth and Great Britain's proposed exit from the European Union. BNSF, one of Berkshire's largest businesses, was able to boost profit 5per cent to US$1.47 billion. The railroad's cost-cutting helped offset lower revenue as demand for consumer, coal, industrial and agricultural products declined, the latter in part because of new trade policies. Berkshire also blamed U.S. tariffs for cutting into sales of gas turbine and pipe products by its Precision Castparts unit. Insurance underwriting profit was essentially unchanged at US$440 million, as improved results from reinsurance offset higher loss claims at Geico. Berkshire warned that Typhoon Hagibis, which caused widespread damage in Japan last month, will likely hurt fourth-quarter underwriting results. Nevertheless, float, a major driver of Berkshire's growth that reflects insurance premiums collected before claims are paid, rose about US$2 billion in the quarter to US$127 billion. Profit from manufacturing, services and retailing rose 2per cent, to US$2.46 billion, as higher sales from Berkshire's auto dealer and Clayton Homes mobile home units offset lower revenue from the Duracell battery, Forest River RV, and apparel and footwear businesses.

Naruhito, 59, and his Harvard-educated wife Empress Masako, 55, took over in May in a brief, tradition-filled ceremony but Tuesday's \"Sokui no Rei\" is a more elaborate ritual in which he officially announces his change in status to the world. The celebratory mood for what has been proclaimed a national holiday has been tempered by Typhoon Hagibis, which tore through Japan 10 days ago. The typhoon killed at least 80 people and prompted the postponement of a planned celebratory parade. </p><p>Congratulatory banners were flying at some subway stations and street corners, but the public response was a far cry from the celebrations in May when Naruhito's accession coincided with an unusual ten-day holiday period. Small groups of people waited at the Imperial Palace gate on Tuesday in pouring rain, waving Japanese flags and cheering a smiling Naruhito as he entered by car. The first Japanese emperor born after World War II, Naruhito acceded to the throne when his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in two centuries after worrying that advancing age might make it hard to perform official duties. \"As he is young and energetic with outstanding leadership, I hope he'll support the people of Japan, which has faced continuous disasters and typhoons,\" said Tomoko Shirakawa, 51, who was waiting in front of the palace. Naruhito began the day's ceremonies by reporting his enthronement to his imperial ancestors at one of three shrines on the palace grounds, dressed in a black headdress and pure white robes with a long train borne by an attendant. He was followed later by Empress Masako, dressed in 12-layered white robes and attended by two women in violet robes to arrange her train. TRADITION-BOUND CEREMONY For the main ceremony, Naruhito will wear a traditional burnt-orange robe and headdress, as his father did nearly three decades ago. It will start at 1pm local time (12pm Singapore time) at the Imperial Palace's Matsu no ma, or Hall of Pine, the most prestigious space in the palace. He will declare his enthronement from the \"Takamikura\" - a 6.5m high pavilion that weighs about 8 tonnes - with an ancient sword and a jewel, two of the so-called Three Sacred Treasures, placed beside him. Together with a mirror called Yata-no-Kagami, which is kept at the Ise Grand Shrine, the holiest site in Japan's Shinto religion, the three treasures comprise the regalia that symbolises the legitimacy of the emperor. Masako will also take part in the ceremony, gaining her own throne while wearing 12-layered robes and an elaborate hairstyle. Akihito pledged during his own ceremony in 1990 to observe Japan's pacifist constitution and fulfill his duty as a symbol of the state and for the unity of the people. Naruhito promised to follow his father's path and observers have noted he has so far made only small changes. \"It'll be nice if the new emperor will be as kind hearted as the former emperor and stay close to the people,\" said Ryoya Suzuki, 25, in front of the palace. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to deliver a congratulatory speech before guests including Britain's Prince Charles, who with then-wife Princess Diana attended Akihito's enthronement, as well as U.S. Transport Secretary Elaine Chao. Myanmar civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi is also expected to take part. A court banquet will be held on Tuesday night, before Naruhito and Masako host a tea party for foreign royalty on Wednesday afternoon.

A decision on the game in Yokohama will be made on Sunday when officials are able to assess the level of damage from Typhoon Hagibis, which has already forced the cancellation of two games due to be played on Saturday. One of those - New Zealand v Italy - eliminated the Italians and World Rugby are adamant that the rules, which say cancelled pool games cannot be rescheduled, must be applied identically across the board. Should the Yokohama match be cancelled, both Scotland and Japan would receive two points each, meaning Japan and Ireland would finish in the top two in Pool A and reach the quarter-finals, providing the Irish beat the already-eliminated Samoa in their final game. </p><p>World Rugby have said they are looking at alternatives - expected to be playing at a different venue or possibly behind closed doors - but Dodson says that there is also a \"force majeure\" clause that should enable the game to be played on a delayed date. \"My view is that we're not going to let Scotland be the collateral damage for a decision that was taken in haste,\" he told BBC Radio on Friday. \"I think there are alternative (venues) around Japan. If it can't take place on Sunday then we're really, really pressing the point that we need to have to get this game delayed 24 hours.\" Dodson said that he had made little progress despite constant dialogue with tournament organisers, describing the concept of a further cancellation as \"absolutely unacceptable\". He added that the SRU had taken legal opinion that \"unravels the World Rugby case\". Asked if it was too late to mount a legal challenge, he said: \"We don't know that - we have to challenge it. Rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby. \"The common sense approach to this is to play the game 24 hours later in perfect safety, where we can make sure that the pool stages are completed and the sporting integrity of the tournament remains intact.\" Many Scots fear that there is little chance of a change, believing that World Rugby are favouring the home nation as they desperately want a tier two team, and particularly the host nation, in the knockout phase. CROOKED FEED They are also still stinging from the 2015 tournament when they were denied a place in the semi-finals by an incorrect last-minute penalty that handed Australia victory at Twickenham. Last week too there was general incredulity when Samoa were penalised for a crooked scrum feed in the last minute of the match against Japan - the only time a referee has punished the offence in the whole tournament. Japan were allowed to regain possession and went on to score the fourth try they needed for a bonus point that could prove decisive - at Scotland's expense - if Sunday's game goes ahead. And it is not just the Scots who raised an eyebrow at the Pool A schedule, which gives Japan a week between each of their matches while everyone else in the tournament has at least one short turnaround. Meanwhile, fans who bought tickets for the cancelled matches through official channels have already received emails saying refunds will be paid automatically to their account. Tickets bought from \"unauthorised secondary sources\" will not be refunded. In addition to matches being called off, the typhoon's impact on transportation in Japan has also left fans frustrated.

The three-times champions, who ran in seven tries and had effectively secured victory by halftime, went into the encounter having lost two of their last three matches against the Irish but this superb performance reflected their overall record against the men in green, now standing at 29 wins, two defeats and one draw. After a tight opening 10 minutes the New Zealanders, dominating possession and territory and playing fluent, varied rugby at high pace, took complete control, quicksilver scrumhalf Aaron Smith leading the way with the first two tries.

It was awesome.\" For Ireland's outgoing skipper Rory Best, the game represented a bitter end to his international career. He was magnanimous in defeat, however. \"The All Blacks were fantastic. We felt we had prepared well and had a game plan,\" he said. \"They just came out of the blocks hard and never let us get off that again. They were just really clinical.\" The All Blacks had not played for almost two weeks since their 71-9 victory over Namibia after their final pool game against Italy was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis. They also had not been challenged since their tournament opener against South Africa four weeks ago and fans were concerned they could be under-prepared for the intensity of a knockout match. BLISTERING PERFORMANCE Steve Hansen's side allayed those fears with a blistering and bruising performance, constantly driving Ireland back at the breakdown and in the tackle and never allowing them to get their close-running game going. They also forced the Irish into numerous handling errors, particularly in contact inside their own half. After scrumhalf Smith scored his first try in the 14th minute following a sustained buildup, the All Blacks seized on two Johnny Sexton errors to put the game beyond doubt. The Irish flyhalf failed to find touch for an attacking lineout, with his opposite number Richie Mo'unga brilliantly keeping the ball in play and the All Blacks then broke into Ireland's half, Smith grabbing his second from close range three minutes later. Sexton then dropped the ball on halfway in a tackle and Mo'unga kicked it ahead with Beauden Barrett winning the race to give the All Blacks a 22-0 halftime lead. \"It wasn't just 22 points, it was all the ball we gave them and missed the penalties which would have given us field advantage,\" said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose six-year tenure with the side ended with the loss. \"It meant we were chasing our tail and they had so much ball in our half in the first half, which was tough going.\" The All Blacks kept their foot on the gas in the second half, pinning Ireland inside their own territory and controlling possession with hooker Codie Taylor, replacement flanker Matt Todd, winger George Bridge and replacement Jordie Barrett also crossing. With just over 10 minutes to go, centre Robbie Henshaw gave Ireland a face-saving try immediately after he had squandered an even better opportunity while referee Nigel Owens also awarded them a penalty try and sinbinned Todd for a professional foul. - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["\"They just came out of the blocks hard and never let us get off that again.

But the transition was not complete until his new role was officially proclaimed. In the wake of Typhoon Hagibis, the government postponed a royal parade until Nov 10, but the rest of the day's ceremonies were left unchanged. Naruhito began the day by \"reporting\" the proclamation to deities and his ancestors in the ancient royal dynasty, wearing a voluminous white robe and a rarely seen black hat complete with a tail extending up 60cm at the back of his head. And a series of banquets will be held from the evening for guests ranging from Britain's Prince Charles to South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon. The government has also announced more than half a million people convicted of minor offences will be pardoned as part of the events. Small crowds braved the rain to stand outside the palace, hoping for a glimpse of arriving visitors. Sanae Yasuda, in her 70s, had booked a tour from central Japan's Nagoya for the occasion, and decided to come even after the parade was cancelled. \"I didn't know the palace was closed, I wanted to go inside ... I'm still happy to be here,\" she told AFP. SUCCESSION WORRIES \"Today is an important day for the new emperor and the empress,\" added 78-year-old Shuichi Hachinuma, who had come from Sendai city in northeast Japan. \"I feel the emperor is closer to us, compared to in the past ... I want him to send a message of peace.\" \"I wanted to come here just to feel the atmosphere since I know the emperor and the empress are inside,\" said Michiyo Kunikata, 63. \"The couple is really international. I feel a new page has been turned for the royal family,\" she added. Oxford-educated Naruhito faces a delicate balancing act as emperor, seeking to continue his father's legacy of bringing the monarchy closer to the people while upholding the centuries-old traditions of the Chrysanthemum Throne. And the royal line faces its own challenges, with a dearth of successors thanks to rules that prevent women from inheriting the throne. The royal couple have one child, a 17-year-old daughter called Aiko. Naruhito's brother Akishino is currently crown prince. And Akishino's son - 13-year-old Hisahito - is currently the only other remaining successor. There have been calls to revise the succession rules, but so far there have been no formal moves. Despite the succession worries, the royals remain broadly popular.

But there's a catch: There are more shovels than hands. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has agreed to use US$6.5 million (5.07 million pounds) for immediate disaster relief, looks set to tap into budget reserves of US$5 billion, and may request more money to finance construction after Typhoon Hagibis tore through much of Japan's main island this month, killing 79 with seven still missing. \"We'll take fiscal steps, including a supplementary budget if necessary, so that disaster-hit local governments can do the utmost on rebuilding,\" Abe said. </p><p>But however much Abe spends, a severe labour shortage means his government will struggle to repair levee breaks and other damage across a broad swath of the country. Construction is one of the most squeezed industries in the nation's tightest job market since the 1970s. As Japan's population greys and shrinks, the supply of construction workers has slumped by 28 per cent from its peak in the late 1990s to around 5 million. Yet demand remains robust amid a nearly seven-year economic expansion and the approach of next year's the Tokyo Olympics. The construction industry has 5.3 job openings for every applicant, latest government data show, a ratio second only to that of security guards and far above the overall ratio of 1.6, which is the highest in decades. LABOUR CRUNCH The scale of Hagibis, in which 71 rivers burst 140 levees and other embankments over vast areas from Nagano, central Japan to Iwate in the far northeast of the main island, means the job of fixing the damage is vast. \"We are absolutely short of workers,\" said Yoshiaki Suzuki, president of the six-man construction firm Suzuki Kenzai Kogyo in Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo, which flooded three times since early September. Tateyama, where Suzuki lives, was still recovering from massive flooding and long power outages caused by Typhoon Faxai last month when Hagibis hit on Oct 12 to Oct 13. On Friday and Saturday, a third storm inundated the city, killing 10 in Chiba Prefecture and dumping as much as 283.5mm (11 inches) of rain on some areas over 12 hours. \"Our top priority is to restore lifelines, repair roads and cover the damaged roofs with blue plastic sheets,\" Suzuki told Reuters. \"There's no time for removing the heaps of rubble caused by the last two typhoons.\" Destabilised soil from earlier storms has led to fresh landslides, making work hazardous for people still digging out, he said. The shortage of construction workers is most pronounced in rural Japan, where the population and construction projects are in steep decline. Highly skilled workers tend to head to bigger cities, said Fumitaka Miura, director at the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private think-tank. GOING HIGH-TECH To address the worker shortage, some construction companies are embracing technology. For example, some companies fly drones over construction sites for three-dimensional measuring. The data is fed into machines that design, plan and implement projects, say officials at the Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry. These \"i-Construction\" techniques can cut working hours by 30 per cent, they say. Technological solutions like these are deployed in 60 per cent of large-scale construction projects, the officials say. But most of the disaster recovery will be done with bricks, mortar, equipment and manual labour. Speculation is mounting that Abe may ask for more funds in an extra budget at the end of the year, as the longest postwar economic boom sputters amid global trade wars and the government watches the impact of a sales tax increase this month. Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities, says the government is likely to earmark US$5 billion-US$10 billion for infrastructure rebuilding, while longtime Japan strategist Jesper Koll forecasts something more like US$20 billion to US$30 billion, given the \"need for fast and decisive government action.\" - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government has agreed to use US$6. 5 million (5. \"We'll take fiscal steps, including a supplementary budget if necessary, so that disaster-hit local governments can do the utmost on rebuilding,\" Abe said.

The Finn crossed the line 11.3 seconds ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who made a hesitant start from pole position and had to fend off a charging Lewis Hamilton in the closing laps. The result moved Mercedes 177 points clear of Ferrari, allowing them to wrap up a record-equalling sixth consecutive constructors' crown, with a maximum 176 points from four races still to be won. It also assured Mercedes of the drivers' title with only Bottas now capable of challenging five-times world champion Hamilton, whose lead narrowed to 64 points. </p><p>Mercedes have now equalled Ferrari's record six constructors' titles in a row between 1999-2004. The Italian team won five successive drivers' crowns with Michael Schumacher from 2000-04. \"Starting third is never easy here but there's no point giving up,\" said Bottas after his third win of the season and first since the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in April. \"I had a really nice car and Sebastian had an issue, so it was good to get the lead. Really proud of the team, a sixth title in a row is so impressive.\" Ferrari looked like they might delay the title celebrations after locking out the front row in a qualifying session held on Sunday morning, after being postponed from its traditional Saturday slot due to Typhoon Hagibis. But both Vettel and team mate Charles Leclerc ran into trouble at the start. Vettel launched off his grid spot a fraction too soon and slammed on the brakes before moving again. He was investigated for a false start but let off without a sanction because his car had not crossed the line. The momentary hesitation was enough to allow Bottas to sweep around the outside and into the lead. Leclerc collided with Max Verstappen as the Dutchman tried to pass around the outside, damaging the Ferrari and pushing the Red Bull, which later retired, into a spin. The Monegasque nevertheless carried on, crucially holding up Hamilton as his car shed bodywork in a shower of debris before eventually pitting for repairs at the end of the third lap. PENALTIES Leclerc, 21 and winner of two of the last five races, crossed the line sixth but dropped to seventh behind Renault's Daniel Ricciardo after being slapped with two post-race time penalties. He collected a five-second penalty for the Verstappen incident and a further 10 seconds for continuing to drive a car deemed to be in an unsafe condition. Ferrari were also fined 25,000 euros (US$27,600) for the latter offence while Leclerc was given two penalty points on his superlicence. Ricciardo and 10th-placed team mate Nico Hulkenberg could still drop back, however, with Racing Point lodging a protest against the French manufacturer for an alleged brake bias infringement. \"The lights were on but it was my mistake (at the start),\" said Vettel, a four-time winner at Suzuka. \"The Mercedes were difficult, they had more pace than us and Valtteri was flying. I'm not happy with the start of the race but everything else was fine, just lacked a bit of pace.\" Hamilton's joy at Mercedes's success was muted after the team gambled on a one-stop strategy for the Briton, even as Bottas and Vettel opted for two. With tyre degradation higher than expected, the 34-year-old was forced to pit a second time and lost track position to Vettel. \"Firstly, congratulations to the team,\" said Hamilton, who can still clinch the drivers' title at the next race in Mexico. \"That's the main point. I just wanted to bring home good points for the team.\" LAP EARLY The race officially ran for only 52 of 53 scheduled laps after the chequered flag was shown a lap early on the digital displays around the track. Drivers, who did not see the chequered flag display on their steering wheel dashboards, continued to race around but the order at the end of the 52nd lap was declared as the result. As a result, Mexican Sergio Perez retained his ninth place finish for Racing Point, despite crashing out after contact with Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly at the start of the final lap.

EXPLOSION OF NOISE Scotland were first on the board with a Finn Russell try after seven minutes but Japan hit back with a brilliantly-worked, high-tempo score that set the tone for the night as Fukuoka tore clear and slung a one-armed pass into the arms of the supporting Matsushima to detonate an explosion of noise. If that was good, their next score was a contender for try of the tournament. Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity. Japan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of Fukuoka. It was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try. The Scots, who came from 31-0 down to draw 38-38 with England in the Six Nations in March, channelled that Twickenham spirit as WP Nel and Zander Fagerson scored to get back within seven points with 25 minutes to go but with the bonus-point situation, they still needed more than two converted tries to advance. It was relentless Scottish pressure and desperate, at times demented, Japanese defending from then on, but the hosts held out for another famous victory in what became a deafening cauldron of noise. It was only the second time Scotland have failed to reach the last eight - the other coming in 2011 - but they can have few complaints, bookending wins over Russia and Samoa with defeats by Ireland and the hosts. \"We had a mountain to climb after that first half but we started climbing it and I thought the effort the players put in to get back to within seven points was excellent,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \"We were obviously aware that this was huge for the home nation. The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic and you didn't want to be the team that was losing in that atmosphere.\" (Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Toby Davis) - Reuters</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["\"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could.

At the tournament's closing press conference in Tokyo, World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said: Japan 2019 will be remembered as probably the greatest Rugby World Cup. \"It has certainly been the most ground-breaking in terms of bringing the game to new audiences and attracting new fans to the sport.\" </p><p>Officials were delighted with stadiums that were 99 per cent full, the 1.2 million people at specially designated fan zones to watch the games on big screens, and 500,000 visitors from around the world. READ: Fans mingle, tension mounts ahead of World Cup final READ: 'Plan for everything': Rugby World Cup's advice to Tokyo Olympics An incredible 54 million people tuned into Japanese television - a record for any rugby game - to watch the national team, nicknamed the Brave Blossoms, defeat Scotland to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament for the first time in nine attempts. UNITING A NATION The performance and tournament as a whole gave a nation still recovering from Typhoon Hagibis, which killed over 80 people and left thousands homeless in October, something to get behind. It was reminiscent of that stunning win by the Japanese women's football team of the 2011 World Cup just four months after the country had suffered a devastating earthquake and tsunami. Eight years on from that terrible day when the city of Kamaishi saw 1,300 of its residents killed, the city hosted two World Cup games at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium, which sits on the site of a school washed away in 2011. Such is the power of sport. This World Cup also showed that there is a new power in the world of rugby. The game has been slow to move from its heartlands of the United Kingdom, France, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand but Japan has been a breath of fresh air. \"One of the reasons we came to Asia was to actually leave a legacy,\" Mr Beaumont added. \"What we have to do is carry on working with them so when you come back in two years' time, the people are talking about (Brave) Blossoms and not about baseball.\" That is still a worry. After years of defeat at the World Cup, Japan shocked the world by defeating South Africa at the 2015 World Cup in England and winning three games in total. This awakened interest in the country but the excitement quickly faded away. Four years on, the World Cup has ignited a rugby fever in Japan much more widespread and intense than before. Its rugby bosses are determined not to miss the opportunity this time round. A NEW RUGBY COMPETITION IN JAPANJapanese officials are looking to revamp the structure of the domestic league to make it stronger on and off the field. In October, Katsuyuki Kiyomiya, the vice president of the Japan Rugby Football Union (JRFU), told reporters that he will hold a news conference in November to announce plans to launch a new domestic competition expected to start in 2021. \"This World Cup is a big event Japanese rugby has not experienced before and we are tested on how we take the excitement and enthusiasm created by this event to the next level,\" Mr Kiyomiya said. Details will follow but reports suggest there will be a new, professional 12-team league run. It will give the current Top League, a low-key affair with teams owned by corporations such as Panasonic, Toshiba and Toyota almost as a public service, a run for their money. This new league will likely run on a separate calendar to Super Rugby (the southern hemisphere competition that features clubs from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) and would aim to attract top players from that tournament. With interest in Japan at an all-time high, Mr Kiyomiya said that the league looks to generate an annual revenue of 50 billion yen (US$460 million) through sponsorship and the sale of media rights. If so, clubs would not only be able to attract talent from the traditional rugby powerhouse nations but would also be able to offer the best players in Asia the chance to pursue a lucrative career in the sport. HELPING ASIA It will help Asia's rugby aspirations for Japan to continue its ascendance. The success of Japan could serve as an example and an inspiration to its neighbours. Japan is the only Asian nation to ever appear at the World Cup. It is head and shoulders ahead of the next best teams including Hong Kong, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia. READ: Memorable moments from Japan's World Cup If World Rugby can increase representation at the World Cup for Asia, there will be more interest and investment in the sport from Asian nations, past the amateur and semi-professional level. Japan will benefit from sharpening its craft, if Asia has its own competitive rugby games. Therefore, it is also in Japan's interest that Asia improves at the game. For now, no doubt Japan's journey serves as an inspiration, but that journey is going to be long. The Brave Blossoms won just one game in its first seven World Cups from 1987 to 2011, suffering some demoralising thrashings along the way. That feels a long time ago now. If the passion that has been on display in recent weeks can be harnessed, Japan can become a force to be reckoned with - wherever the World Cup takes place.
