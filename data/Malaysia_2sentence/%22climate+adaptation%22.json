Besides taking steps to prevent global warming, we must also learn to cope with a hotter environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By 2100, Singapore may see daily maximum temperatures exceed 35 degrees Celsius for up to 351 days per year. Presently, such peak temperatures are recorded occasionally in the hotter months of May to July each year.</p><p>Being in the tropics, we also have to cope with a higher level of humidity, which impedes heat removal from the body to the environment. The combination of heat and humidity not only poses health risks, but also significantly reduces productivity, particularly for those working outdoors or in non-air-conditioned environments.</p><p>Research conducted by the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine indicates that companies lose approximately S$21 (US$16) per worker per hot day due to decline in productivity. When scaled up across the labour force, this amounts to S$2.2\u202fbillion in annual economic losses by 2035 if current warming trends persist. These findings show that the impact of heat is not just physiological, but also economic. BUILDING RESILIENCE IN OUR PHYSIOLOGY</p><p>The mechanisms that regulate body temperature can adapt to manage a greater heat load through heat acclimatisation. This process involves gradual and daily exposure to a hot environment.</p><p>For most healthy individuals, heat acclimatisation may start from 20 to 30 minutes of walking at normal pace during the warmer part of the day and increasing in duration to 1 to 2 hours over 10 to 14 days.</p><p>Water should be consumed freely during the walk and the duration of walk should be based on individual physical ability, without causing symptoms of over-exertion such as heavy panting, exhaustion or dizziness.</p><p>There is evidence that heat acclimatisation brings about increased physical performance and lower body temperature when carrying out the same tasks.</p><p>ADJUSTING DAILY ROUTINES</p><p>Around the world, people are adjusting their daily routines to cope with rising heat. Cambodia has shortened school days by two hours to help children avoid peak daily temperature, and Spain and several Gulf states prohibit outdoor work during midday.</p><p>Across Europe and the Middle East, work and leisure are increasingly scheduled around cooler periods of the day. Early gym sessions and late-night construction are becoming more common. In a recent paper, I described this trend as a shift towards a semi-nocturnal lifestyle, where activities take place before sunrise and after sunset to avoid midday heat. Another strategy is imposing a work-rest ratio for those working outdoors. This allows time for the body to cool so that the next cycle of work starts at a lower body temperature.</p><p>In occupational settings, the general work-rest ratio is around 45 to 60 minutes of work to 15 to 20 minutes of rest, though this depends on the duration and intensity of the activity, profile of workers and environmental conditions. Taking showers or wiping the body with a towel soaked in cold water can add to heat removal during rest intervals.</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY</p><p>Shade is especially useful in shielding pedestrians from the hottest part of the day. Outdoor shade is plentiful in Singapore because of its history of landscaping walking paths with trees and building sheltered walkways.</p><p>Urban planners could take this a step further by viewing shelters and pathways as one entity. Under this concept, the construction of walking path is not complete until it is also sheltered. Singapore's small geographical size makes this strategy more manageable.</p><p>The provision of cooling spots in public spaces will allow people to seek reprieve from the heat. Air-conditioned buildings can serve as cooling spots. In parks and industrial areas, air-conditioned \"cooling pods\" can be provided. Singapore has made promising progress in passive cooling. Heat-reflective roof coatings and cooling paints, which can lower the surface temperature of buildings, such as the ones deployed on HDB blocks, can help reduce indoor heat without additional energy consumption.</p><p>The fan is not as effective for body cooling when air temperature exceeds skin temperature (above 35 degrees Celsius). More viable solutions are likely to come from personal body cooling, air-conditioning and self-cooling clothing materials. Devices that cool the body rather than indoor spaces are promising due to their smaller carbon footprint, given the need to reduce emissions to avert the climate crisis.</p><p>However, these technologies are still in their early stages due to limitations in energy supply, mobility and capacity for heat removal. They would need further development to be ready for mass production.</p><p>If we want to stay safe and productive in a rapidly warming world, we must rethink not just how we cool ourselves, but also how we organise our daily activities, design our buildings, and care for the vulnerable, particularly children and the elderly.

The QS World University Rankings 2026 reflect notable institutional progress: Malaysia now leads the region with 10 universities in the Top 500, ahead of Indonesia (5) and Thailand (2) and Singapore (2). The National University of Singapore remains Asean's highest-ranked institution (8th globally), but Malaysia's Universiti Malaya (UM) has surged to 58th, overtaking regional peers like City University of Hong Kong (63), and even some UK Russell Group universities such as Sheffield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These headline achievements are no accident. They reflect years of strategic investment and reform. Malaysia's 2015-2025 Higher Education Blueprint explicitly aimed to increase the number of globally ranked institutions, and similar \"world-class university\" drives were launched in Indonesia to boost the local universities into global rankings.</p><p>Yet the QS leap, impressive as it is, reveals a double-edged reality. A sole focus on rankings can be counterproductive. The QS methodology places heavy weight on academic reputation and research output: 50 per cent of the score is linked to research and discovery, including 30 per cent from reputation surveys. This often skews institutional incentives toward chasing citations and brand recognition, often at the expense of broader educational missions. In some cases, universities have resorted to short-term tactics: hiring \"star\" researchers to boost publication metrics, pushing faculty to publish in low-tier open-access journals, or maximising publication volume over quality.</p><p>In short, success in QS rankings can mask deeper challenges, especially if institutions prioritize optics over substance.</p><p>These perverse incentives risk undermining long-term institutional capacity and regional development goals. Some Asean universities now focus disproportionately on internationally citable research, often involved or led by foreign collaborators, while underinvesting in teaching quality, local-language scholarship, or disciplines central to social-economic development. Others have launched for-profit \"international programmes\" (typically in English and targeting foreign students) to boost enrolment and appeal to rankings metrics, without parallel investment in pedagogy or curriculum quality.</p><p>Overemphasis on global citation counts can also distort research agendas, diverting attention from urgent local and regional issues, such as climate adaptation, public health, or social inclusion, that may not score highly in global rankings. This race to climb the QS ladder can easily become a race to the bottom in terms of relevance and equity, at least.</p><p>Indeed, in the drive for international prestige, some universities risk underinvesting in programs that address national development needs, such as teacher training, public health education. Such mismatches threaten the very human capital foundations that Asean economies depend on.</p><p>Encouragingly, policymakers across the region are beginning to acknowledge these tensions. The recent 2025 Asean Summit and ministerial meetings hosted in Malaysia reaffirmed a commitment to inclusive, future-ready education. Under Malaysia's chairmanship, the Langkawi Higher Education Ministers' Meeting adopted a regional cooperation framework and endorsed the Asean Global Exchange Mobility and Scholarship (Asean-GEMS) initiative, and an intra-Asean scheme to expand student mobility and academic collaboration. These are timely signals that rankings alone are not enough, and that regional cooperation must form the next frontier.</p><p>To translate these aspirations into meaningful change, Asean should pursue a set of concrete, region-wide mechanisms to foster academic quality, research collaboration, and institutional resilience.</p><p>One key step is the launch of a regional research grant fund. Asean could model a pooled funding mechanism after the EU's Horizon Europe programme, creating a modest Asean Research Council that provides grants for collaborative, multi-country research on shared challenges such as climate change, agriculture, health systems, or regional integration. This would help Asean research networks grow beyond bilateral government-to-government agreements and elevate regional knowledge production.</p><p>Quality assurance and accreditation should also be a regional priority. Asean has made early progress through the Asean University Network (AUN)-QA framework and guidelines for harmonised accreditation. These tools should be expanded and institutionalised across member states to allow mutual recognition of degrees and alignment of quality benchmarks. Peer learning networks, such as AUN's thematic working groups, can support this effort by promoting cross-border faculty evaluations, programme reviews, and shared curriculum development.</p><p>Student and faculty mobility must also be strengthened. Beyond individual scholarship programs, Asean could build a structured academic exchange initiative similar to the EU's Erasmus program. Such a scheme would enable students to study at top regional institutions in exchange for service commitments in their home countries. Faculty sabbaticals, joint appointments, and research fellowships across Asean universities would further deepen inter-institutional relationships and foster a more integrated academic community. The recent Higher Education Declaration provides a broad umbrella for such initiatives, but their success will depend on sustained political commitment and funding.</p><p>Moreover, Asean must strengthen its partnerships beyond the region. The Asean+3 University Network already links institutions across Asean, China, Japan, and Korea. This platform could be further expanded to include other dialogue partners, broadening the pool of research resources and deepening collaborative opportunities for the benefit of Asean's universities. It is also crucial to deepen collaboration between academia and industry. Governments should encourage industry actors to participate in curriculum co-development, and co-fund laboratory infrastructure. These public-private-university linkages would help ensure that education and research remain aligned with Asean's evolving economic landscape.</p><p>South-east Asia's QS rankings rise is real, and rightly deserves recognition. It signals renewed attention to higher education quality and growing investment in research capacity. But rankings are only one measure, and an incomplete one.

In response, the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) has taken proactive measures by identifying 175 high-risk trees, most of which are over 50 years old, and cutting down 147 of them. Regular inspections by certified arborists have identified 28 additional high-risk trees slated for removal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban trees are essential to urban planning, providing environmental, social, economic, psychological, and educational benefits. They improve air quality, support biodiversity, manage water resources, regulate temperatures, sequester carbon, and enhance community well-being. Trees also add aesthetic value, promote recreation, foster social cohesion, lead to energy savings, boost property values, and contribute to psychological well-being, fostering a deep connection to nature, especially for children.</p><p>Given these multifaceted benefits, municipal landscape departments must ensure proper growth and structural development, including identifying and replacing unhealthy trees when needed. Landscape architects and designers face critical tasks like addressing site availability, soil conditions, species selection, growth requirements, and maintenance to integrate street trees effectively. Despite these challenges, urban trees play a vital role in climate change adaptation by reducing temperatures by up to 8 degC, mitigating urban heat islands, and managing stormwater, crucial for preventing urban flooding during heavy rainfall events.</p><p>In response to these challenges, DBKL is enhancing its Shade Tree Management Plan and preparing new guidelines for managing old and high-risk trees, expected to be completed by July. However, there is a need for a broader enhancement of the National Plan, shifting from mere mitigation to comprehensive adaptation strategies. Globally, cities are developing innovative solutions for climate adaptation, including Paris, France; Medellin, Colombia; and Wuhan, China. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are at the forefront of globally recommended strategies. In 2020, Penang's nature-based approach to tackling climate change, led by Think City and the Penang Island City Council, won the Climathon Global Awards for the best climate project by a global city that year. This initiative has paved the way for further studies on climate-resilient urban tree species in Malaysia, and the execution of the Penang Nature-based Climate Adaptation Programme has since been launched.</p><p>Exploratory research by Think City indicated that urban tree species in Malaysia are already being affected by climate change. Understanding the resilience of different tree species to various climate impacts is critical for species selection. This study emphasised the necessity of selecting climate-resilient tree species, considering factors like habitat specialisation, saltwater intrusion, inundation tolerance, high-temperature tolerance, storm tolerance, water absence tolerance, humidity requirements, and susceptibility to predation, parasitism, and disease. Choosing the right tree for the right location is vital to ensure their longevity and functionality in urban environments, focusing on appropriate landscape typologies like urban streets, small green spaces, blue-green corridors, and seafronts.</p><p>Expanding knowledge about resilient tree species for urban planting is crucial for better-informed urban forest management decisions. Collaboration among arborists, botanists, landscape architects, urban planners, and the National Landscape Department is crucial. The government should allocate sufficient funding to enhance the effectiveness of existing tree planting campaigns, promoting more efficient tree planting and maintenance efforts. Implementing protective measures during early years, such as adequately sized tree pits with high-quality soil, root barriers, and permeable pavements, and requiring a two-year maintenance period for newly planted trees by developers or responsible parties, will contribute to a more resilient and adaptive urban forestry strategy in Malaysia, ensuring the sustainability and safety of urban environments amidst climate change challenges.</p><p>Addressing the surge of tree falls in Malaysia amidst rising climate challenges requires a comprehensive approach that balances historical preservation, environmental benefits, climate adaptation, and public safety. The proactive measures undertaken by DBKL, including the identification and removal of high-risk trees, are immediate steps. However, as climate change continues to exacerbate extreme weather conditions, a more comprehensive and national adaptive strategy is required. NbS offers a promising pathway for urban resilience. By learning from global examples and investing in local research, Malaysia can promote climate-resilient tree species through collaboration among arborists, botanists, landscape architects, and government bodies.</p><p>Ultimately, the future of Malaysia's urban landscapes hinges on our ability to adapt and innovate in the face of climate change. By prioritising both ecological sustainability and public safety, Malaysia can protect its green infrastructure, preserve its cultural heritage, and ensure the well-being of its urban populations. This holistic approach will not only reduce the risks of tree falls but also enhance the liveability and resilience of Malaysian cities for generations to come.</p><p>* Hamdan Abdul Majeed is the managing director of Think City</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

It has become apparent that due to extreme dry and wet spells in Malaysia, the risk of climate change-related disasters in Kuala Lumpur has increased significantly. The Malaysian National Water Research Institute (NAHRIM) estimates that from the 1970s to 2007, the intensity of rainfall duration increased by approximately 30per cent, while sea levels rose between 2.7 to 7.0 mm per annum from 1993 to 2010. At the same time, the incidence of droughts has increased.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The frequency and magnitude of climate change-related hazards such as droughts, wildfires, flash floods, and landslides have left the city and its residents vulnerable to further shocks and stresses. Recent incidents, including falling trees and sinkholes, are likely exacerbated by waterlogging and inadequate infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. To prevent unnecessary damage in the future and build a more resilient Kuala Lumpur, we need a well-structured Climate Adaptation Strategy.</p><p>First, we must assess Kuala Lumpur's vulnerability to extreme weather events, including precipitation, waterlogging, geohazards, heat, drought and flooding caused by both natural and human activities. Engaging in risk dialogues with all relevant stakeholders - including city government agencies, Indah Water Konsortium (IWK), the Mineral and Geoscience Department (JMG), and utility providers - is crucial to reduce such vulnerabilities. This collaboration will help formulate strategies for implementing a spatial adaptation plan and investment agenda for city's infrastructure.</p><p>The strategy should not rest solely on the shoulders of Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), it should be a collective plan, all aimed at making Kuala Lumpur climate-proof and water-resilient. The strategy will also intensify and accelerate efforts to combat heat stress, drought and the impact of urban flooding.</p><p>The spatial adaptation plan must also be integrated in the management, maintenance and monitoring of the city's environment and its utilities. Regular and systematic monitoring of the risk such as waterlogging and land integrity can mitigate the landslides and sinkhole. This can be pursued through effective legislation, visions, monitoring plans and standards. It is important to recognise that given the rapid changes in our climate, the risk assessments and the Climate Adaptation Strategy of the city must be reviewed and updated regularly.</p><p>While climate adaptation planning can mitigate and reduce risks, it cannot entirely prevent damage caused by extreme weather events. Therefore, authorities must also prioritise preparedness for calamities and hazards. Special attention should be given to emergency provisions and the rapid restoration of vital and vulnerable infrastructure.</p><p>To be climate-ready and build a resilient Kuala Lumpur, it is necessary to identify vulnerabilities, anticipate future challenges, and develop smart strategies and plans to mitigate climate-related risks. Everyone has a role to play - not just the local authority, but also utility providers, city government agencies, private companies, business associations, and the residents of Kuala Lumpur.</p><p>* Dr Camelia May Li Kusumo is an Associate Professor at the School of Architecture, Building and Design, Taylor's University.

But the international community isn't paying enough attention. It appears that developing nations, as a group, need to drive climate action. This is one reading of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's strong call to the European Union to do more for Southeast Asia during a keynote address at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. Developed and developing nations must be treated differently as far as climate action is concerned. In the view of Malaysia, a view shared by many vulnerable nations around the world, climate justice would only come about if the responsibilities of the two are differentiated according to development levels, historical contributions to emissions and current capacities, a principle that comes labelled as \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR). Or, put differently, first emitters pay more principle. Makes good sense as industrialised nations are historically responsible for emitting planet-heating pollution. But the funding from the industrialised polluters of old to flesh out this CBDR principle is very slow in coming. After 29 years of the United Nations climate summits \u00e2\u20ac\u201d officially known as the Conference of Parties (COP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d only US$200 billion was provided for climate adaptation and mitigation when what is needed is US$3 trillion. Small wonder, COPs are labelled cop-outs.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Newly installed United States President Donald Trump has got emissions right and wrong at the same time. Call it the Trump paradox. Signing the executive order to withdraw the US from the Paris climate treaty, he is reported by The Guardian to have told his supporters on his first day as president thus: \"The United States will not sabotage its own industries while China pollutes with impunity. China uses a lot of dirty energy, but they produce a lot of energy. When that stuff goes up in the air, it doesn't stay there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It floats into the United States of America after three and a half to five and half days.\" Similarly, Mr President, the stuff that goes up in the air in the US doesn't stay there either. It floats into Mexico, Canada and the rest of the world, may be not in so many days, but in weeks for sure. But the first victims of the \"dirty energy\" will be Americans. In this sense, what is not good for the US is also not good for the rest of the world.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Knowing that dirty energy doesn't stay where it originates, Trump shouldn't shred the world's climate agenda as he did. Energy transition will suffer. Developed and developing countries have invested a lot in renewable energy to stabilise the climate. More funding is needed to transition from \"dirty energy\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to continue the Trumpian phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to clean energy. Wildfires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts and other climate calamities are no longer country- or continent-specific. And they would only get worse if the Paris treaty target is ignored. Adverse weather has its own momentum. No country can afford to be caught unprepared. Being prepared means investing a lot in stabilising the climate, not less. Vulnerable countries, like those in Southeast Asia, are not at an economic development stage like the industrialised ones to self-fund climate stabilising measures.

Interest in SMRs is rising among governments and energy companies in the rest of the region too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand have all expressed interest in SMRs - both floating and land-based. In Indonesia, the first application for hosting a floating SMR, a demonstration project to be located near an island in Central Bangka close to South Sumatra, was submitted in February after about two years of pre-licensing consultations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russia has been operating a commercial floating nuclear power plant with two SMRs, the Akademik Lomonosov, in Arctic waters since 2020. China started up a land-based SMR in Shandong province in 2023, with another expected in Hainan by 2026.</p><p>Other countries, including the United States, Argentina, Canada and South Korea, are actively developing SMRs, with companies like Core Power, Kepco E&amp;S, NuScale, Seaborg Technologies, Thorcon, Westinghouse and others leading efforts in floating designs.</p><p>Tech companies are also racing to secure nuclear energy. In October 2024, Google inked a deal to buy electricity from at least six SMRs to power its data centres. Oracle is designing a data centre to be powered by three SMRs. Many energy-intensive industries, including mining and chemicals, are also interested in such options. Unlike conventional nuclear plants that often generate over 1 gigawatt (GW) of electricity, SMRs typically produce up to 300 megawatts but have shorter construction times, lower upfront costs, enhanced safety features and smaller safety zones. They are also scalable: Adding additional SMRs is much more feasible than expanding a conventional plant.</p><p>Given Singapore's current generation capacity of over 13 GW, a single SMR's contribution would be so small that it can be constantly fed into the grid as baseload. In the long term, this raises the question of how many SMRs could safely be accommodated.</p><p>Still, nuclear power is one of the options for reducing Singapore's carbon emissions and achieving its net-zero target in 2050. A domestic power plant would also enhance energy security, given Singapore's heavy reliance on fuel imports of natural gas, its future demand for hydrogen and ammonia, and its growing energy demands.</p><p>CONSIDERATIONS FOR A TROPICAL ISLAND</p><p>For Singapore's green energy transition and climate adaptation efforts, comparing floating and land-based SMRs in the country's specific context is essential.</p><p>The Akademik Lomonosov operates in a very cold climate, which enhances its cooling efficiency. It serves as a cogeneration plant, generating electricity and utilising much of the heat created in the process for district warming. Singapore's tropical climate means that air cooling would be less efficient than heat release into comparatively colder waters. The country's small water reservoirs and rivers do not encourage a location inland. Additionally, such a nuclear cogeneration plant using heat for seawater desalination is another reason why an efficient SMR would have to be located either at the coastline or on the sea surface. It could also provide steam for industrial purposes, as Singapore's existing natural gas cogeneration plants already do to Jurong Island's chemical industry.</p><p>A floating SMR can be built in a shipyard - as was the case in Russia - and towed by tugboats to its destination, facilitating installation and eliminating the need for landscaping. Breakwaters and some seabed preparation for mooring would be required to keep it safely in place. It would likely be available faster than a land-based version. Similarly, maintenance, decommissioning, and refuelling - whether by delivering and switching out modular reactor cores or by towing the plant to a site for radioactive waste disposal - or even potential resale to another country would be easier.</p><p>Floating nuclear plants face vulnerabilities such as typhoons and icebergs, but those are no concerns in Singapore's waters. However, a marine environment still brings challenges, particularly cost increases. The wear caused by continuous wave motions, corrosion, and the demand for efficient filtration systems to prevent marine organisms from colonising water intake systems add to construction and maintenance costs.</p><p>In the Akademik Lomonosov's case, the official budget quadrupled from an estimated 9 billion roubles to approximately 37 billion roubles. In the US, a land-based SMR project in Idaho was stopped because of cost overruns. A detailed environmental impact assessment and a rigorous affordability study will be essential. LEARNING FROM RUSSIA'S EXPERIENCE</p><p>Whether on land or at sea, SMRs raise well-known questions, similar to conventional nuclear plants. Public concerns about radioactive waste storage and disposal, and the risks associated with potential accidents, like release of radioactive materials into the air or water, are understandable.</p><p>The Russian nuclear plant's first refuelling - performed over 2023 and 2024 by delivering and switching modular reactor cores - was successful. Given Russian experience in refuelling and operating nuclear-powered icebreakers and power plants, there is no reason why it would have encountered major accidents.</p><p>However, even if Russia chose not to be transparent and make any incidents public, accidents causing releases of radioactive materials into the air would have been detected. The radioactive materials, or a strong heat increase in the plant, would have been spotted by US and other satellites or by ground-based radiation sensors and monitoring systems located in other countries, as has happened in the past, even for concentrations that posed no threat to human health.</p><p>Large-scale accidental releases into the water would also be quickly detected by other countries. International attention is high and Norway, for example, conducted a detailed study on how hypothetical accidents at Akademik Lomonosov could affect its territory. In any case, nuclear power requires strict safety and regulatory oversight, involving multiple organisations.</p><p>Classification societies evaluate the safety of new vessels and have begun issuing comprehensive rules for floating SMRs.</p><p>Together with industry stakeholders, they established the Nuclear Energy Maritime Organisation last year to support national and international regulatory efforts. The International Maritime Organization, responsible for marine pollution prevention and vessel safety, and the International Atomic Energy Agency are also working on floating SMRs and nuclear-powered ships, given the increasing climate change-driven interest in them.</p><p>WORTH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION</p><p>Selecting a safe and economically viable site would be crucial.</p><p>Deeper waters are preferable for cooling purposes and limited environmental impacts, but a site like Changi could pose risks due to its proximity to the airport and potential airplane accidents affecting the plant. Marine traffic restrictions and protective measures, such as security protocols, would be necessary.</p><p>Proximity to industrial plants on Jurong Island in demand of heat or steam could enhance economic viability, making the nuclear cogeneration plant(s) more cost competitive, and desalination is another option.</p><p>If Singapore decides to pursue nuclear power, floating SMRs warrant serious consideration. They offer distinct advantages in location selection, deployment flexibility, absence of landscaping requirements, and potential integration with industrial processes. However, economic feasibility, safety, regulatory requirements, and environmental impacts must be thoroughly evaluated to determine whether they align with Singapore's long-term energy strategy.</p><p>Stefan Huebner is President of the Society of Floating Solutions (Singapore) and Senior Research Fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore.

For the first time in 29 years of COP history, delegations from small island states and least developed nations did just that in Baku, Azerbaijan, when rich nations fell billions of dollars short of the climate finance pledge demanded by 134 developing countries. A cop-out doesn't come in any worse shape than that. </p><p>Developed nations did agree to the climate finance target of US$1.3 trillion per year by 2035, as demanded by the 134 nations, but with an unwelcome twist. They will contribute only US$300 billion per year by 2035, with the rest to come from private financial sources. Developing nations are rightly concerned about climate finance being sourced from private entities. They come with strings attached. We saw how the \"strings\" became a \"noose\" around developing nations' necks during the Covid-19 vaccination programme sponsored by Big Pharma. Similarly, climate finance by private sources would be bad \"noose\" for developing nations. Call it sleight of hand by rich nations. They not only don't want to pay for the loss they caused, but are making the poorer ones pick up the tab. One delegate from an island state, overcome by the bitterness of the COP29 outcome, put it to the BBC thus: Baku will be remembered for its betrayal. We don't blame him for his harsh judgment. Delegates from island states and other vulnerable nations travel thousands of kilometres to have their needs heard. To leave Baku unheard certainly qualifies as a betrayal.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps it was a misstep for Azerbaijan's climate presidency to badge COP29 as a 'climate finance COP'. Yes, there is some applause for Baku for increasing the US$100 billion commitment to US$300 billion, but the sum isn't enough to pay for climate adaptation, let alone for loss and damage caused by extreme weather. Developed nations are missing a moral principle, if not a legal one, here: those who cause loss must pay for it. There are enough metrics, grounded in climate science, to show that developed nations, by virtue of their industrial development, are the greatest contributors to climate change. Put differently, those most responsible for warming the Earth most must contribute the most. Some developed nations claim that there isn't enough money in their coffers that developing nations require to weather climate change. COP29 appears to have been easily convinced. Not so quick, we say. Not that they don't have enough money; they do. But they are channelling it to wars and weapons. Last year, the global military expenditure was US$2.4 trillion, according to a tally by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. If only this money could be diverted to finance climate action, the planet would be a more livable one for all. The largest spenders are the United States, China and Russia.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>COP29 was problematic in another crucial way. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy agreed at COP28 in Dubai didn't quite make it to the final text, except as a weak reference \"to contribute to global efforts\" in that regard.

They are places where people forge connections, cultivate identities, and envision their futures. Yet, as urbanisation accelerates, cities face mounting challenges, from climate impacts to issues of social equity. Tackling these requires visionary leadership, collaborative efforts, and solutions that make urban environments not just liveable but also lovable.</p><p>At a recent Think City lecture, held in conjunction with our 15th anniversary, Dato' Seri TPr. Dr. Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Mayor of Kuala Lumpur, shared insights that underscore these very needs. Her talk, titled \"Creative Solutions Today for a Liveable Tomorrow\", resonated as a call to action for sustainable urban transformation. The principles she outlined are rooted in the KL 2040 Structure Plan, which champions transparency, accountability, and public trust - values essential to any thriving urban landscape and ones that align closely with Think City's mission.</p><p>Central to the Mayor's address was climate resilience - a critical theme in urban development. Cities today are at a crossroads: they generate 80 per cent of global GDP while contributing roughly 70 per cent of carbon emissions. The paradox is stark, yet the potential to reverse this is immense. With initiatives like Malaysia's first urban nature-based climate adaptation programme in Penang, we are demonstrating how green infrastructure can reduce urban heat, promote biodiversity, and improve overall quality of life. It is a commitment to environmental stewardship that demonstrates how local actions can set a precedent for global change.</p><p>Equally important was her emphasis on social equity and inclusion. Our Kita-untuk-Kita (K2K) programme exemplifies this, empowering communities through community-led projects, public housing support, and accessible green spaces. As Dato' Seri Tpr. Dr. Maimunah noted, prioritising vulnerable groups is not just an ideal but an imperative for cities that aspire to inclusivity. For Think City, this is about ensuring that growth benefits all, fostering a sense of pride and belonging in each neighbourhood we serve.</p><p>Reflecting on her message, it is clear that the work we are doing is part of a broader movement. Think City's role is to support this vision in Malaysia, a vision closely tied to the themes of the current World Urban Forum in Cairo which emphasises the importance of inclusive, sustainable, and resilient cities,</p><p>In these 15 years, Think City's journey has been about catalysing a movement, one built on collaborative urban solutions, cultural-based economic development, community and environmental resilience. Working alongside inspiring changemakers and leaders like the Mayor, we look forward to continuing this work, bringing Malaysian cities to the forefront of sustainable urban transformation.</p><p>With a shared commitment, we can shape cities across Malaysia and beyond that are not only functional but deeply cherished places where resilience, inclusivity, and hope to form the foundation of a sustainable, vibrant future.</p><p>*Datuk Hamdan Abdul Majeed is the managing director of Think City.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writers or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Would it? Many developments point in that direction, but two will suffice. Both have to do with preparatory work for COP29, one in Bonn, Germany, and the other in Baku. Start with Bonn. There, the 60th session of the mouthful Subsidiaries Bodies to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in June with the hope to land on ideas to advance decisions at COP29. After days of meetings, the Bonn gathering was one of unadvanced hope. So was the last round of technical talks that ended on Sept 12 in Baku, with rich nations staying silent on future climate finance, according to a statement released by the Climate Action Network International, a non-governmental organisation.</p><p>Does the world have the luxury of many more failed hopes? Extreme weather events everywhere clearly say \"no\". But world leaders, even as they are surrounded by killer fires, floods and landslides, refuse to act. Perhaps the floods in Poland and the forest fires in Portugal may help erode such recalcitrance. Call it a Strasbourg realisation, with the crisis management commissioner, Janez Lenarcic, acknowledging to the media there that the calamities were proof of climate breakdown. But still, this acknowledgement is a little late in the day. World leaders could have acted, even as late as 2000, when the Earth's temperature was just under 1\u00c2\u00baC above the pre-industrial level.</p><p>Put simply, there are only two things to be done to make the Earth liveable. One, bring greenhouse gas emissions down and two, fund climate resilience. But both are moving at a snail's pace. Begin with emissions. Meeting in Paris in 2015, COP members promised to limit global warming to 1.5\u00c2\u00baC. Here is the bad news from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service: the Earth warmed 1.52\u00c2\u00baC from February 2023 to January 2024, the first-ever year-long breach of the Paris target that Pacific island nations fought hard for. Does this mean that a post-industrial 1.5\u00c2\u00baC Earth is a thing of the past? No, say climate scientists. The Paris promise can still be fulfilled, but the window of time is short. This is why COP29 must be the conference to settle on a phase-out of fossil fuels that previous COPs have shied away from. If Baku wants to be known for a good COP, it must make sure that fossil fuel phase out happens. After all, fossil fuel use is the primary source of global carbon emissions. Phase them out and you would have phased out emissions.</p><p>In the event we are faced with a 2\u00c2\u00baC Earth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a likely scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the world must be made resilient to extreme weather events. This requires a huge amount of money (US$400 billion annually), our second thing that needs to get done. COP28 in Dubai came up with a novel idea of a Loss and Damage Fund to finance climate adaptation efforts in developing countries. There, the fund was filled with commitments, but that, too, not to the brim. Can Baku do it? It better, if it wants to live up to its billing as \"COP finance\".</p><p>( END )</p>", "publisher": "New Straits Times (Malaysia)", "instances": ["In the event we are faced with a 2\u00c2\u00baC Earth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a likely scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the world must be made resilient to extreme weather events.

Resources are going to defence budgets and attention is anywhere but climate,\" said Dr Allan.</p><p>Upcoming negotiations in Baku face more headwinds created by war than ever before since the multilateral process began in 1992, analysts said.</p><p>That year, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) - the process the world uses to come up with climate agreements - was formed in the turbulent aftermath of the Cold War.</p><p>Earlier, while that conflict was ongoing in 1987, countries signed the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty to protect the Ozone layer and the first universally ratified treaty in UN history, showing what was possible with global cooperation.</p><p>COP29 will be centred on mobilising vast amounts of finances, both public and private, to especially address the growing needs of developing nations being ravaged by climate impacts.</p><p>Lead negotiators say the funding needs are in the trillions of dollars every year. Since 2020 though, developed countries have already struggled to come up with yearly US$100 billion in climate-financing for poorer nations, first pledged at the 2009 COP15.</p><p>A new financial framework called the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) is mooted to replace that US$100 billion pledge, and will be the central agenda item in Baku.</p><p>However, Ms Nazanine Moshiri, a senior analyst at Crisis Group - an independent, non-profit committed to preventing and resolving deadly conflict - says the \"heavy shadow\" of conflict means countries are having difficulty focusing on climate issues altogether, instead choosing to prioritise their own security and energy needs.</p><p>\"This makes it difficult to take meaningful action on climate change in such a complicated and fractured geopolitical environment,\" she said.</p><p>The result is likely to be growing deficits between the money needed for countries being hit by both conflict and climate change and what richer nations are willing to put on the table.</p><p>\"Resources and attention are directed towards immediate survival instead of long-term adaptation strategies,\" Ms Moshiri said.

COP25 in Madrid in 2019 took nearly an extra two days to complete.</p><p>At COP28 in Dubai last year, nations butted heads on topics including fossil fuels in the communique. In the end, they agreed to \"phase down\" but not \"phase out\" polluting industries like coal, oil and natural gas.</p><p>National interests, regional dynamics and alliances forged or strained through war are all at play, and the conflicts of the day will act as a \"powerful destabliser\" to progress, according to Ms Moshiri.</p><p>The interplay between conflict and climate has \"become more severe\", she said.</p><p>\"Today's polarised global landscape means that geopolitical tensions frequently derail climate efforts just when they're needed most,\" she said.</p><p>America's relations with both Russia and China remain terse, exacerbated by conflict. All three are influential leaders in the negotiating halls of COP.</p><p>\"There's a global division that is becoming quite visible with those conflicts and it's certainly a factor that doesn't help cooperation,\" said Mr Florian Krampe, a director at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p>\"To have faithful conversations and negotiations, you need that trust. And we're not really in a global situation where trust is a dominant factor,\" he said.</p><p>An energy trilemma is playing out globally - where decision-makers are having to choose to prioritise only two out of three critical elements: Energy security, affordability and sustainability.</p><p>Conflict increasingly pushes the needle away from the latter option - the clean energy systems that help to decarbonise economies - because of underlying fears especially surrounding energy security, Ms Moshiri said.</p><p>The Ukraine invasion has disrupted global energy supplies and the Middle Eastern tensions continue to create turbulence in oil and gas markets. A breakout of an expansive regional war there would be expected to cause a major uplift in energy commodity prices.</p><p>Energy security is \"the foundational and central mission\" of the International Energy Agency, which noted in its 2024 World Energy Outlook that geopolitical tensions and fragmentation were \"major risks\" for both energy security and cooperative efforts to reduce emissions.</p><p>\"The experience of the last few years shows how quickly dependencies can turn into vulnerabilities,\" it said.</p><p>Europe's reliance on Russian gas has been a leading example of this issue. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine resulted in Europe having to broaden its purchase markets for natural gas, due to disruptions in supply and in desperate need of energy security.</p><p>Azerbaijan, now in the presidential seat for COP and majorly reliant on fossil fuels exports, proved a willing partner, said Ms Kamala Mustafayeva, an independent oil and energy analyst based in Baku.</p><p>\"Europe is the main destination for Azerbaijani gas. They simply need more gas from Azerbaijan. It doesn't matter about climate change or anything. You have to survive today, not tomorrow,\" she said.</p><p>Azerbaijan is currently meeting around 5 per cent of Europe's energy needs through its Southern Gas Corridor, which transports natural gas from the Caspian basin to Europe. It has pledged to double its exports to the continent by 2027.</p><p>Dr Michael Mann, director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania told CNA that Russia is an example where domestic interests trump the broader push for a green transition.</p><p>\"Russia is a petrostate whose primary economic asset is the fossil fuels buried beneath its ground,\" he said, adding that he believed Moscow has sought to generate global instability to slow climate action that could undermine its own resources and economy.</p><p>\"We can directly connect the dots here,\" he said.</p><p>Russia's energy mix has changed little in the near quarter century that Mr Vladimir Putin has been in a leadership role in Russia and its climate targets are considered \"highly insufficient\" by Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific project tracking government pledges and action.</p><p>While in the short term, nations are focused on securing their energy supplies, the protracted and complex nature of conflict should be an ongoing spur for governments to wean away from unreliable global systems and instead be more self-sufficient by developing renewables, Dr Allan said.</p><p>The more extensive conflicts are though, the more difficult it is for them to push ahead with those plans.</p><p>\"Much of Europe has rebalanced their energy mix in the past 18 months. The Ukraine war gave new motivations for the transition to renewables. There is a long way to go, but renewables are undeniably the best business case for new energy investments,\" she said.</p><p>\"But the global markets still look to oil as the bellwether of the health of the economic system. The reliance on fossil fuels is still systematic.\" A \"PEACE\" COP?</p><p>The Baku presidency has called for its summit to be a \"truce COP\" and coincide with a one-month global ceasefire. Whether that will occur remains unclear.</p><p>COP29 will also emphasise peace as a significant theme for the first time, providing a platform to push ahead with the Relief, Recovery, and Peace (RRP) Declaration.</p><p>\"One of the main action agenda items for us is the nexus between peace and climate. We attach a lot of importance to that because Azerbaijan's presidency became possible when Azerbaijan and Armenia supported each other and we have been in conflict for over 30 years,\" said Mr Soltanov.</p><p>The two neighbours have warred frequently in recent years over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh around their shared border.</p><p>Launched at COP28, the RRP aims to enhance the climate resilience of nations impacted by conflict or humanitarian crises. It has now been signed by more than 90 countries and could help ramp up financing for many fragile nations.</p><p>\"Azerbaijan is trying to position itself as a peacemaker, and COP29 is an opportunity to bridge the divide by addressing climate impacts. There is an opportunity to steer the global conversation toward a more integrated approach to climate and security issues,\" Ms Moshiri said.</p><p>Indeed, climate change and conflict are closely intertwined, increasingly fuelling one another.</p><p>Research by the International Monetary Fund in 2023 found that GDP losses from extreme weather events can be about four times higher in fragile and conflict-affected states compared to other countries.</p><p>Mr Krampe said a positive element of emphasising peace at COP29 is linking conflict more coherently with climate adaptation.</p><p>\"You have specifically a double burden.

Their unwavering commitment to safeguarding lives and promoting the well-being of women and newborns is nothing short of heroic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indispensable in routine healthcare, midwives are evermore important during emergencies.</p><p>Amidst increasingly frequent natural disasters across Asia and the Pacific, midwives stand as lifelines, ensuring safe childbirth and maternal well-being for millions of women. In the face of adversity, they ensure health services are more accessible and can quickly reach women in need. In low resource settings, midwives as frontline workers often serve as the only source of help for a woman to give birth safely.</p><p>Consider the story of Shakila, a midwife serving in a remote village in Bangladesh prone to major flooding. Despite the looming threat of disasters, Shakila remains steadfast in her mission to help mothers and babies in her community. When non-stop rain caused flooding in her village, the maternity ward, pharmacy, and storage room were submerged by water. She still continued to deliver babies, without electricity, even supporting emergency cesarean sections as needed with the doctors on call. During disasters, Shakila is a beacon of hope, offering critical assistance to women in labor despite the chaos and destruction. Through her resilience and resourcefulness, she embodies the spirit of midwifery, serving in the most challenging of circumstances.</p><p>Wading through water or the rubble of earthquakes, midwives save lives. Standing by the side of a woman before, during, and after childbirth, midwives offer critical support and provide life-saving care during complicated deliveries. They can help prevent fistula by identifying and managing prolonged or obstructed labor promptly, and promoting timely access to emergency obstetric care when needed. Midwives also provide essential sexual and reproductive health services and information, including family planning, and often serve as the sole healthcare provider for women and girls in hard-to-reach communities. In fact, in any given setting, skilled midwives can provide 90 per cent of all essential sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn health services.</p><p>Recognising the lifesaving role of midwives is not just a moral imperative; research suggests that facilitating universal access to midwives is a strategic investment that represents the most effective and cost-efficient solution to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths.</p><p>Yet, there is a global shortage of close to 1 million midwives, including a shortage of 200,000 midwives in the Asia and Pacific region - a reflection of the systemic undervaluation of their critical role in healthcare.</p><p>With 66,000 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth every year across Asia and the Pacific, the need for more trained and qualified midwives is crucial. By closing the deficit in the number of midwives, the world could prevent two thirds of maternal and newborn deaths, saving millions of lives, especially in the face of climate disasters.</p><p>The evidence is clear. Investing in midwifery is not just a matter of healthcare; it is a cornerstone of climate and disaster adaptation and resilience. By strengthening midwifery education, training, and support systems, governments and stakeholders can bolster the resilience of communities facing the impacts of climate change. Equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate emergencies, midwives can ensure continuity of care even in the most challenging of circumstances, saving lives and mitigating the impact of disasters on maternal and newborn health.</p><p>Midwives also serve as advocates for climate justice, highlighting the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on women and girls. By amplifying the voices of midwives, we can advance gender-responsive approaches to climate adaptation and resilience, ensuring that the needs and rights of women are central to our efforts to build a sustainable future.</p><p>As we confront the realities of a changing climate, let us pay tribute to the pivotal role of midwives in safeguarding the health and well-being of communities across Asia and the Pacific, and beyond. On this International Day of Midwives, we urge for increased recognition of their contribution to society and greater investments in their education, deployment and empowerment as we celebrate their achievements.

The survey reveals that a significant<br/>63% of members are either already leveraging or planning to implement AI technologies in their business or internal<br/>processes. This shift towards AI adoption underscores the<br/>transformative impact of technology across sectors,\" revealed<br/>the survey findings.<br/>There is no doubt that the growing adoption of digital<br/>technologies has revolutionized services, making it easier and<br/>cheaper to trade across borders. Services trade has become<br/>an essential vehicle to enable digital transformation, promote<br/>access to digital communication, provide the seamless transfer<br/>of data across borders as well as the movement of skilled<br/>workers and knowledge.<br/>An encouraging development for services was the global exports<br/>of digitally delivered services, maintained its momentum<br/>reaching US$4.25 trillion in 2023, up 9% year-on-year (y-o-y),<br/>accounting for 13.8% of world exports of goods and services.<br/>The value of these services - meaning services delivered<br/>digitally across borders through computer networks<br/>encompassing everything from professional services to<br/>streaming of music and videos including remote education -<br/>surpassed pre-pandemic levels by over 50% in 2023. The 2023<br/>ICC Trade Register Summary Report projects that the dynamics<br/>of global trade prospects will also be increasingly subject to<br/>the impact of regulatory changes especially due to the new<br/>reporting requirements from the Financial Accounting Standards<br/>Board and the ongoing digitization and future of platform-based<br/>trade.<br/>Amazingly, digitally enabled services according to the OECD<br/>Services Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI), face impediments<br/>and growing fragmentation. \"On a global level,\" observed<br/>the STRI, \"barriers to digitally enabled services rose by 25%<br/>between 2014 and 2023, driven by increasing regulatory<br/>hurdles that affected communication infrastructures and data<br/>connectivity. Moreover, regulatory differences among countries<br/>have grown over the past decade. Stronger cooperation in<br/>improving the international rulebook on digital trade could help<br/>reverse this trend. In this regard, a successful conclusion of the<br/>joint initiative on e-commerce will be key as well as a lasting<br/>solution on the moratorium on customs duties for electronic transmissions would be essential to provide certainty to<br/>suppliers of digital services.\"<br/>Digitization is going from strength to strength, with most players<br/>investing heavily in their trade and supply chain infrastructure<br/>to:<br/>\u2022 Modernize the customer experience; provide new product<br/>functionalities across the full procure-to-pay value chain<br/>(e.g. pre-shipment finance, distributor finance, etc.).<br/>\u2022 Enable greater platform and ecosystem connectivity to<br/>originate transactions where customers do business (rather<br/>than customers coming direct to the bank).<br/>\u2022 Enable greater modernization to reduce cost and improve<br/>processing times.<br/>\u2022 Improve data and reporting and to enable balance sheet<br/>velocity of documentary trade through asset distribution<br/>which is expected to grow as legacy systems are replaced or<br/>upgraded and data becomes more widely available.<br/>Regulatory disparities across countries can present barriers,<br/>impeding the fluidity of international trade in services. They<br/>breed uncertainty and stifle the growth potential of businesses<br/>eager to expand beyond their borders. Heterogenous regulatory<br/>frameworks increase compliance costs and administrative<br/>burdens, deterring companies from venturing into new markets.<br/>Over the past decade, regulatory differences affecting digital<br/>trade and related sectors have increased across countries.<br/>Leveraging the benefits of digital transformation requires<br/>well-regulated services that enable fast, reliable and<br/>affordable connections across digital networks. For instance,<br/>telecommunications services are essential for networks<br/>to connect, while computer services and information and<br/>communication technology (ICT) services enable end-to-end<br/>communication. These findings are supported by those from the<br/>Digital STRI that covers cross-cutting barriers affecting digitally<br/>enabled services in more than 100 countries.<br/>Digitization has also been enabled by growth in platformbased<br/>trade, where fintechs and challengers are innovating<br/>ways to capture market share and scale. Many banks are<br/>now participating in digital trade platforms for e-invoicing,<br/>payables automation, supply chain financing and working<br/>capital management. These platforms vary by geographic reach,<br/>product and client focus and underlying technology, but the<br/>market has been bifurcated. \"While digitization supports the<br/>shift to open account through development of new products, it<br/>also improves the efficiency and security of documentary trade,<br/>underpinning its continued importance in the product mix.<br/>Moreover, digitization not only facilitates broad industry growth<br/>but also supports inclusive growth. It is seen as key to reducing<br/>the \"trade finance gap\" for SMEs, which has widened due to<br/>higher interest rates,\" maintains BCG in a recent report.<br/>Gen AI - the great disruptor<br/>There is no doubt that the great disruptor in digitalization<br/>is Gen AI. The insurance market, especially since the Gen AI<br/>explosion, has started to monitor the rise of new risks related<br/>to the development and use of AI solutions, both to anticipate<br/>the demands of the insured and to start efficiently manage<br/>exposure across existing portfolios. As far as Gen AI is concerned, the insurance market, according<br/>to Alessandra Corsi and Rossella Bollini from insurance broker,<br/>Marsh, \"is still in an observatory stage. Other than for a very<br/>few cases, specific ad hoc AI solutions are not yet available.<br/>Currently, there's only one ad hoc insurance product for AI<br/>risks, distributed by a leading player in the reinsurance market.<br/>Beyond this, clients looking for coverage can explore other<br/>established product lines such as cyber, professional indemnity,<br/>crime, intellectual property and product liability where typically<br/>claims and/or circumstances related to AI are not yet specifically<br/>excluded. Cover seems to be afforded on a 'silent' basis: not<br/>affirmatively covered and not explicitly excluded\" as cited in the<br/>DLA Piper newsletter article dated June 2024.<br/>The consensus is that insurability relating to Gen AI is a<br/>complex topic, as it depends on the exposure, on the business<br/>conducted and on the insured's risk appetite. The insurance<br/>pathway, according to Marsh, will likely be the same as for cyber<br/>risks: eventually, insurers will need to quantify and monitor AI<br/>exposure in traditional insurance policies to the extent that it<br/>could represent a significant unexpected risk to their portfolios.<br/>To do so, the reinsurance markets and Lloyds of London might<br/>start imposing AI exclusions on cyber, professional indemnity,<br/>crime and other traditional products, creating a gap that will<br/>need to be filled. By that time, we expect AI-specific insurance<br/>products to be ready to perform, supported by a defined and<br/>replicable underwriting process and a consistently predictable<br/>loss quantification mechanism.<br/>Marsh sees several trends in AI risk coverage and the evolving<br/>role of insurance in mitigating AI-related liabilities. In credit and<br/>investment insurance, these include:<br/>\u2022 Technological advances magnify deepfake risks.<br/>\u2022 Economic and cyber risks can assume new forms as<br/>deepfakes spread.<br/>\u2022 Deepfakes can also undermine traditional know-yourcustomer<br/>(KYC) processes and enable bad actors to infiltrate<br/>both traditional financial systems and decentralized finance<br/>(DeFi) ecosystems.<br/>\u2022 They can also change the nature and scope of traditional<br/>cyber threats.<br/>\u2022 Deepfakes pose risk to global sociopolitical stability and<br/>security.<br/>\u2022 Beyond elections, deepfakes can be used for propaganda<br/>and to ratchet up sentiments leading to social unrest,<br/>insurgency or even acts of terrorism.<br/>\u2022 Deepfakes can also be deployed to assist military<br/>objectives through psychological operations and targeted<br/>disinformation campaigns.<br/>\u2022 Current countermeasures are falling short.<br/>Indeed, Moody's Investor Service in a recent report warned<br/>that organizations face a delicate balancing act: rolling out<br/>AI too quickly could increase the likelihood of faulty outputs,<br/>while moving too slowly may compromise their competitive<br/>advantage.<br/>\"Small businesses will face the greatest challenges as many may<br/>lack the financial resources, datasets and know-how to integrate<br/>AI technologies while effectively mitigating risks. Additionally,<br/>their operations are often less resilient than those of their larger<br/>peers. In contrast, companies with the resources to develop AI and those with sufficiently large pools of highquality<br/>data to create bespoke applications will see material<br/>credit quality improvements,\" added Moody's.<br/>In contrast, McKinsey's latest update on 'What May Cause<br/>Insurers to Fail' did not even mention technology, digitalization<br/>and Gen AI risks instead highlighting liquidity issues, underpricing<br/>and under reserving, investment risk, management and<br/>governance, rapid growth and expansion in non-core business,<br/>and sovereign risk as key factors in insurance company failures<br/>from 1980 through the 2010s.<br/>Fintech, digitalization and electronic trade<br/>documentation in the Islamic finance space<br/>Islamic fintech can be defined as harmonising Shariah principles<br/>of investment and financial intermediation with innovative<br/>technology-based financial innovations. It is a component of<br/>the wider digitalization revolution embracing a spectrum of<br/>initiatives including digital platforms for e-commerce, payment<br/>systems and solutions, digital banks, crowdfunding, buy-nowpay-<br/>later schemes, peer-to-peer lending, insurtech, wealth<br/>management and more recently blockchain, tokenization and<br/>Gen AI.<br/>According to the Global Islamic Fintech Report 2023/24, the<br/>largest countries in terms of estimated transaction volume are<br/>Saudi Arabia, Iran, Malaysia, the UAE, Indonesia and Kuwait,<br/>although Bahrain, Pakistan, Qatar and Turkiye are rapidly<br/>growing Islamic fintech ecosystems. The report estimates the<br/>global market size of Islamic fintech transaction volume at<br/>US$138 billion in 2022/23 and \"is anticipated to reach US$306<br/>billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of<br/>17.3% compared to the overall global fintech industry, which<br/>is expected to develop at a CAGR of 12.3% over the same time<br/>period.\"<br/>The report, produced by Dinar Standard and Elipses, identifies<br/>several impediments but also opportunities in the Islamic<br/>fintech sector, conducted through a survey of Islamic fintech<br/>practitioners and industry service providers. The major hurdles include access to capital, consumer education, regulation,<br/>finding top talent and the complexity of geographic expansion.<br/>\"We have seen a proliferation of Islamic fintech despite these<br/>hurdles, with our database now including 417 firms globally, and<br/>the more mature players in the industry making significant steps<br/>to scale,\" stressed the authors of the report.<br/>The fact that the report is bereft of the terms credit and<br/>investment insurance/Takaful and with one reference to<br/>insurtech, Takaful Insurance and Family Takaful, suggests the<br/>importance of differentiation and caution when it comes to<br/>fintech application in general and in the trade and investment<br/>insurance ecosystem in particular.<br/>The reality is that post-COVID-19 pandemic, especially<br/>due to the necessary adoption of social distancing and<br/>lockdown measures, the standout takeaway has been the<br/>rise of digitalization in trade, business, banking and financing,<br/>insurance, e-commerce, vital sectors such as agricultural and<br/>food security, climate action, fintech, blockchain - in fact across<br/>the whole spectrum of human activity and societal norms.<br/>Information technology and digitalization continue to be<br/>the supreme disruptors in almost all sectors of the economy<br/>with breathtaking Gen AI advances in science, medicine, the<br/>energy sector, infrastructure, mining, logistics and transport,<br/>food security and agri-business, financial services including<br/>insurance, trade, commerce and in leisure and hospitality - the<br/>list is endless.<br/>In this respect, digitalization in credit and insurance continues<br/>to flourish concomitantly. The UAE sovereign wealth fund,<br/>Mubadala, for instance recently sold its digital trade finance<br/>bank, Anglo-Gulf Trade Bank (AGTB) to Gulf Islamic Investments<br/>(GII), a private equity, real estate and venture capital company.<br/>GII, with total assets under management exceeding US$3 billion,<br/>is a full-service Shariah compliant financial services company.<br/>AGTB has sought to differentiate itself from other lenders in the<br/>market by taking a digital, data-driven approach towards trade<br/>finance to address a growing gap in the trade finance market,<br/>which has become highly fragmented.<br/>Technology in trade and post-trade services is a key megatrend<br/>impacting global trade and investment going forward.<br/>Global trade, according to the UN Conference on Trade and<br/>Development (UNCTAD)'s latest trade update, is poised to<br/>rebound in 2024, reversing the downward trend in 2023 when<br/>overall, the value of global trade fell by 3% in 2023. For trade in<br/>goods, it dropped by 5% but grew by 8% for trade in services.<br/>In monetary terms, global trade dipped 3% to US$31 trillion in<br/>2023 after peaking in 2022. The downturn was driven by less<br/>demand in developed economies and weaker trade in East Asia<br/>and Latin America. In value terms, merchandise trade fell 5%<br/>in 2023 to US$24.01 trillion but the decline was mostly offset<br/>by a 9% increase in commercial services trade, which reached<br/>around US$ 7.54 trillion. Total goods and services trade was only<br/>down 2%.<br/>An encouraging development for services was the global exports<br/>of digitally delivered services, which reached US$4.25 trillion<br/>in 2023, up 9% y-o-y, accounting for 13.8% of world exports of<br/>goods and services.In this respect, the establishment of digital infrastructure<br/>frameworks that can support cross-border regulatory<br/>harmonization is vital for e-commerce and mitigating<br/>cybersecurity, KYC, credit history and Anti-Money Laundering<br/>(AML) issues. The regulatory environment is becoming more<br/>complex and fragmented. This has implications for digital<br/>economic growth since digital barriers could reduce GDP growth<br/>by restricting trade output and slowing productivity.<br/>As the geopolitical and global economic environment becomes<br/>more challenging, access to liquidity and risk mitigation is<br/>increasingly valued. Digitalization has accelerated innovation in<br/>the trade and supply chain finance. In trade finance, in a post-<br/>COVID dispensation, there is a continued push for digitisation,<br/>transparency and automation in an environment with increasing<br/>regulatory and compliance requirements. In September 2023,<br/>the Electronic Trade Documents Act (ETDA) 2023 in the UK<br/>received Royal Assent to make Britain's trade with partners all<br/>over the world more straightforward, efficient and sustainable<br/>which according to the British Government's initial estimate<br/>could give the UK economy a GBP1.14 billion boost over the<br/>next decade through the trade documentation digitalization.<br/>In line with AGTB's links with the UK, the adoption and<br/>acceptance of ETDA is of huge significance and could becomethe governing law for digital trade in the international market<br/>including for Islamic platform trade. It puts electronic trade<br/>documents on the same legal footing as paper documents.<br/>With English law being the very foundation of international<br/>trade, several Islamic finance contracts such as the commodity<br/>and syndicated Murabaha and Sukuk issuances, this act puts the<br/>UK ahead of not only other G7 countries, but almost all other<br/>countries in the world. The UK is widely seen as a leader in<br/>digital trade and this new act will make it easier for businesses<br/>to trade efficiently with each other, cutting costs and growing<br/>the UK economy by billions over time.<br/>Indeed, the EDTA, according to the WTO removes requirements<br/>for the majority of paper trade documentation. Varying degrees<br/>of progress are also being made towards implementation in the<br/>remaining G7 countries, with each taking unique approaches to<br/>amend and introduce legislation.<br/>Latest developments in ICIEC's digital strategy<br/>ICIEC's strategy and innovations in digital solutions like<br/>other multilateral insurers encompasses its underwriting<br/>activities, online policy applications, project guarantees,<br/>credit information and risk mitigation, general risk mitigation<br/>ecosystem, containing threats including cybersecurity, fraud and<br/>scams.For ICIEC, digital transformation and technological innovations<br/>are vital. The modernization of B2B payments and the<br/>digital transformation of global trade are pivotal. We see<br/>developments in several areas:<br/>\u2022 Blockchain and smart contracts: Streamlined transactions,<br/>reduced fraud and enhanced transparency will be realized<br/>through blockchain technology, ensuring secure and<br/>instantaneous trade settlements.<br/>\u2022 AI and machine learning: Risk assessment optimization,<br/>decision-making automation and personalized client<br/>interactions will be driven by AI, offering predictive insights<br/>into credit risks.<br/>\u2022 Digital platforms: Integrated B2B platforms will offer<br/>end-to-end solutions, from procurement to payment,<br/>revolutionizing trade processes.<br/>\u2022 Transport mobility: Shipping routes will see a significant<br/>transformation as autonomous self-driven electric container<br/>ships will be in operation. The caveat being an end to the<br/>Red Sea trade route disruption due to the tension in the<br/>Middle East, and through the Panama Canal route due to<br/>extreme climatic conditions especially severe drought and<br/>low water levels.<br/>In this respect, ICIEC is embarking on a transformative journey<br/>over the next decades. The vision entails expanding its physical<br/>presence across all member states of IsDB to deliver services<br/>effectively. A significant shift is foreseen in ICIEC's transition from being a direct insurance provider to a facilitator. This role<br/>would involve supporting other insurance entities with technical<br/>expertise, reinsurance capacity and leveraging data to enhance<br/>service delivery. The future of credit insurance is intrinsically<br/>tied to data, with the OIC Business Intelligence Center (OBIC)<br/>initiative seen as a pivotal step towards harnessing data for<br/>future endeavors.<br/>In digitalization with its instant access and global reach, there is<br/>renewed hope that the imbalances in the post-Bretton Woods<br/>dispensation can be addressed especially for low- and mediumincome<br/>countries, which form most of ICIEC's member states.<br/>But it remains a work in progress that will need to be nurtured<br/>carefully given the motley of risks. That is why proactive<br/>digitalization must be embraced as a core component of any<br/>new development agenda which multilateral institutions, too,<br/>must prioritize beyond their usual playbook. ICIEC has done<br/>so in its strategy which puts digitization at par with its other<br/>development aims such as food security, energy transition,<br/>climate adaptation and mitigation, economic empowerment<br/>and poverty alleviation.<br/>The UN Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR) 2023<br/>similarly identifies digitalization as one of the six dynamic<br/>conditions shaping the achievement of the 17 Sustainable<br/>Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 to which ICIEC is committed<br/>to helping its 49 member states progress towards achieving the<br/>goals in their development agenda through its financing, credit<br/>enhancement and risk mitigation solutions.<br/>Similarly, the introduction of ISO 20022 by the International<br/>Organization for Standardization (ISO), as \"a single<br/>standardization approach (methodology, process, repository)<br/>to be used by all financial standards initiatives,\" is a key<br/>development and challenge for the trade finance and credit<br/>insurance industry. ISO 20022 (MX), which comes into effect in<br/>November 2025, is the next generation of financial messaging<br/>standards given its key characteristics of a common language<br/>with rich and structured data.<br/>The Swift MT format has been the standard for trade finance<br/>messages for the last four decades. According to Trade Finance<br/>Global, Swift (the world's leading provider of secure financial<br/>messaging services) is already in the process of migrating<br/>payment and cash management messages from the legacy MT<br/>format to MX. In November 2025, when the current MT and<br/>MX coexistence period is set to end, all Swift traffic for crossborder<br/>payments and reporting will be based on an ISO 20022<br/>Standard. As the payments and cash management industry is<br/>finding out in real time, there are benefits, challenges and costs<br/>associated with such a wholesale transition.<br/>The importance of ongoing digitization and the future<br/>of platform-based trade cannot be ignored especially as<br/>digitization is going from strength to strength, with most players<br/>investing heavily in their trade and supply chain infrastructure.<br/>Swiss Re Institute in a recent paper stressed these<br/>developments are vital to modernize the customer experience,<br/>provide new product functionalities across the full procure-topay<br/>value chain (e.g. pre-shipment finance, distributor finance,<br/>etc.), enable greater platform and ecosystem connectivity in<br/>order to originate transactions where customers do business rather than customers coming direct to bank), facilitate greater<br/>modernisation to reduce cost and improve processing times<br/>and improve data and reporting and to enable balance sheet<br/>velocity of documentary trade through asset distribution which<br/>is expected to grow as legacy systems are replaced or upgraded<br/>and data becomes more widely available.<br/>The global trading landscape keeps evolving with advances in<br/>technology and science. Trade of tomorrow will be green and<br/>digital, and we need to make sure that our member states are<br/>able to transition smoothly to this new reality. ICIEC's various<br/>policies, services and programs offer an opportunity to build<br/>stronger partnerships for food security, digital connectivity,<br/>just transition to clean energy and mainstreaming trade and<br/>investment.<br/>For multilateral insurers such as ICIEC, global trade should also<br/>be considered in the context of food security, nutrition and<br/>global hunger - helping to alleviate it in member states, some<br/>of which are among the poorest, being a core mandate. The<br/>latest State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report<br/>published jointly by five UN specialized agencies, revealed that<br/>735 million people are currently facing hunger, compared to<br/>613 million in 2019. This represents an increase of 122 million<br/>people compared to 2019, before the pandemic.<br/>IsDB and ICIEC cutting edge ITAP<br/>One key development in the IsDB's and ICIEC's playbook, is<br/>the digitalization of investment promotion services, especially<br/>through its Investment Promotion Technical Assistance<br/>Program (ITAP) - one of the IsDB's flagship programs and most<br/>successful capacity development initiatives aimed at promoting<br/>investments in IsDB member states.<br/>ITAP's objectives include enhancing the technical capacity of<br/>IsDB member states' investment promotion agencies (IPAs)<br/>and intermediaries to improve their investment climate and<br/>to attract domestic and foreign investment to contribute to<br/>sustainable development.<br/>Its focus areas are:<br/>\u2022 Investment promotion capacity development programs.<br/>\u2022 Country technical assistance (TA) programs.<br/>\u2022 Sharing experience on best practices.<br/>\u2022 IPAs knowledge transfer program through staff exchange in<br/>the field of investment promotion.<br/>\u2022 Investment knowledge and promotional events<br/>(publications, conferences, webinars and seminars).<br/>\u2022 Knowledge products and research in the field of investment<br/>promotion.<br/>The achievements of the IsDB's ITAP is impressive - the<br/>development to date of 40 capacity development programs,<br/>over 2,000 investment promotion professionals benefiting from<br/>ITAP, a joint IIA program with UNCTAD, the publication of the<br/>Annual Report on Investment Climate and Opportunities in OIC<br/>member states, hosting several investment promotion events<br/>including the IPAs Policy Dialogue Forum with the Islamic Center<br/>for Development of Trade, the World Investment Forum with<br/>UNCTAD, the WAIPA World Investment Conference as well as<br/>a Business Forum with AIM, the completion of over 15 longand<br/>short-term TA programs, joint TA projects in Sierra Leone<br/>with the World Bank, in Uganda and in Guinea with UNIDO, aTurkiye Investment Climate Program and a Malaysia Investment<br/>Promotion Program.<br/>Importance of digitalizing investment promotion services<br/>Digitalization is one of the trending investment opportunities<br/>in the post-pandemic era which has a great impact on the labor<br/>market, talent creation and encompasses almost all sectors.<br/>The main mission of IPAs in OIC member states is to attract<br/>inward investment to boost productivity, enhance overall<br/>competitiveness across all sectors and support sustainable<br/>economic growth and development through job creation, trade<br/>integration and transfer of technology and know-how.<br/>Many IPAs reflected that the pandemic accelerated the use of<br/>digital tools to conduct both investment promotion (to target<br/>and attract investors) and investment facilitation and aftercare<br/>services. The majority use social media campaigns, video<br/>conferencing and internal e-communication.<br/>Digitalization is influencing the way IPAs operate and conduct<br/>their activities; it can lead to strategic internal decisions and<br/>reforms. It also helps IPAs to implement new technologies and<br/>new business models to become more efficient and improve<br/>their performance<br/>The development of digital tools can prompt IPAs to raise<br/>awareness of investment opportunities, share experiences and<br/>best practices through digital platforms, adopt new techniques<br/>for investor outreach and targeting, reduce the number of<br/>overseas trips and adjust their monitoring and evaluation tools<br/>as well as their investor servicing and facilitation tools.<br/>ITAP should also be seen in conjunction with the development<br/>of the OIC Business Intelligence Centre (OBIC) led by ICIEC (see<br/>below). The aim now is to collaborate with other partners for<br/>the establishment of pilot hubs in Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and<br/>Indonesia to achieve:<br/>\u2022 Advisory services and information sharing in coordination<br/>with IPAs.<br/>\u2022 Organization of capacity development programs related to<br/>digitalization and business intelligence.<br/>The aim is also to promote long-term and sustained support<br/>for the digital transformation in investment promotion services<br/>through expanding the existing network of partnerships and<br/>forging new partnerships with external stakeholders.<br/>OBIC - The power and challenges of digital<br/>intelligence transformation<br/>Policy, trade, finance, investment, market, credit as well as<br/>consumer information and analysis are as vital for enhancing<br/>economic cooperation and development among OIC member<br/>states as any other sustainability metric. At the same time, the<br/>landscape of trade and investment is continuously evolving and<br/>information sharing as well as digital intelligence stand as its<br/>bedrock.<br/>Data abundance and information overload, together with<br/>incessant advancements in technology, can however be a<br/>double-edged sword, offering both huge opportunities but also potential pitfalls in new risks, deepfake disruptions,<br/>disinformation, fraud, scams and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.<br/>The inevitable progress and adoption of various disclosure<br/>and compliance standards as well as directives led by the<br/>European Commission, OECD, WTO, UNCTAD and other<br/>industry gatekeepers and the requirements implicit in the AML<br/>and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) measures<br/>adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FTAF) which is the<br/>intergovernmental organization mandated by the G7 to develop<br/>policies to combat money laundering and terrorism financing,<br/>are now increasingly also in e-commerce, trade finance and<br/>insurance as well as payments systems, the importance of<br/>building robust information-sharing platforms which incorporate<br/>monitoring and harnessing AML/CFT measures becomes<br/>imperative.<br/>FATF works closely with the US Treasury's Office of Foreign<br/>Assets Control, which has sanctioned several countries and their<br/>agencies, individuals, institutions and even products such as<br/>shadow banking.<br/>In May 2024, for instance, FATF closed its latest consultation<br/>on payment transparency. According to Ted Datta, senior<br/>director of financial crime industry practice at Moody's Investor<br/>Services, \"the proposed revisions to FATF's official guidance<br/>aim to close loopholes such as the current exemption for<br/>transactions related to purchasing goods using credit or debit<br/>cards. Criminals can exploit this exemption to move illicit funds<br/>without providing complete information about the originator<br/>and beneficiary, making it harder for authorities to detect<br/>suspicious activities.\"<br/>In real terms, this means that businesses could face increased<br/>compliance obligations such as collecting and sharing<br/>information on the originators and ultimate beneficiaries of<br/>cross-border transactions. This focus on transparency aligns<br/>with recent regulatory efforts to combat money laundering,<br/>such as the European Union's AML package \"The revisions also seek to level the playing field by ensuring<br/>that all payment service providers, regardless of their business<br/>model, are subject to the same rules and standards, allowing<br/>for the flow of money to be more easily traced. Businesses<br/>that fail to adapt to the new reality, risk not only regulatory<br/>penalties, but also damage to their reputation. Investing in agile<br/>compliance tools and technologies will be critical to navigating<br/>these challenges and maintaining the integrity of the global<br/>financial system,\" added Datta.<br/>Digital technology adoption as the game changer<br/>The game changer especially in the aftermath of COVID-19,<br/>the supply chain disruptions of the conflict in Ukraine, the<br/>geopolitical tensions in the Middle East which have adversely<br/>affected container shipping transport on the Red Sea trade<br/>route and similarly the severe climatic conditions especially<br/>drought which has impacted water levels in the Panama Canal<br/>route - with their resultant impact on the global economic<br/>recovery which, in turn, led to a universal cost of living crisis<br/>driven by rising food and fuel prices, is the role of and migration<br/>to digitalization.<br/>That process with the emergence of Gen AI, blockchain and<br/>tokenization is still evolving. Its precariousness is underlined by<br/>the fact that the pace of innovation is so rapid and fragmented<br/>that regulators are left behind. The truism that \"regulation<br/>is driven by innovation\" could not be more relevant as today<br/>given the sheer scope and breadth of potential impact in almost<br/>every human activity including business, e-commerce, financial<br/>services and payments, credit and investment insurance.<br/>The application of digitalization is very diverse, complex, initially<br/>costly and challenging. However, the rewards with the caveat of<br/>managing the manifold risks of which online fraud, scams and<br/>cybersecurity are paramount, are potentially huge. Creating<br/>awareness and safeguarding markets through appropriate<br/>business and credit intelligence and data in member states is<br/>a prerequisite in the OIC, IsDB Group and ICIEC's strategies to<br/>boost intra-OIC trade and investment, and trade and investment<br/>insurance culture and market penetration to the desired levels,<br/>which currently are grossly underutilized and served.<br/>As such, processes including the role of digitalization and<br/>business intelligence in supporting trade and investment, credit<br/>information and the importance of information sharing and<br/>efficient utilization of statistical sources of information on credit,<br/>trade, and investment assume a much greater importance.<br/>Their transformative potential for economic growth and<br/>investment promotion is defining and largely proven, through<br/>insights into the fundamentals of business intelligence,<br/>digital transformation roadmaps for SMEs, the digitalization<br/>of investment promotion services, the significance of credit<br/>reporting, information sharing and digital IDs in fostering<br/>financial inclusion and trade promotion, the importance of data<br/>collation and analysis, the investment outlook in OIC member<br/>states and the efficient utilization of statistical resources for<br/>trade and investment information.<br/>These processes form the core mandate of the OBIC, a joint<br/>capacity building program (CBP) of the OIC, IsDB and ICIEC,<br/>aimed at utilizers of OBIC's services, targeted at supporting credit and investment decisions. OBIC is essentially an<br/>innovative platform initiated by ICIEC aimed at providing<br/>accessible and affordable business and credit information across<br/>OIC member states and seeks to bridge the business intelligence<br/>gap within the OIC, enhancing economic transformation by<br/>enabling informed credit and investment decisions.<br/>The history, rationale and business case<br/>The OBIC aims to provide accessible and affordable information<br/>and credit data on businesses across the OIC member state<br/>markets.<br/>OBIC is the brainchild of ICIEC initiated by the lived business<br/>experience of its underwriters and officials visiting member<br/>states during their business activities and operations. In 2017,<br/>ICIEC presented the First Concept Note on the initiative to<br/>the 33rd Ministerial Session of the Standing Committee for<br/>Economic and Commercial Cooperation of the OIC (COMCEC),<br/>which was endorsed by the session. Furthermore, the 34th<br/>COMCEC Ministerial Meeting held on 29 November 2018<br/>adopted a Resolution appreciating the 'OBIC Initiative' led by<br/>the ICIEC and mandated ICIEC to start operationalization of the<br/>OBIC initiative as an OIC Program, in close partnership with The<br/>Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Centre<br/>for Islamic Countries and other relevant OIC institutions as<br/>required.<br/>The OBIC objective is simple - to create a shared platform<br/>throughout the OIC member states, provide a cross-border<br/>credit registry and linked credit bureau services, compile and<br/>coordinate data in the process and offer advisory and capacity<br/>building program services while efficiently adopting modern<br/>systems of credit reporting.<br/>The vision is clear - for the OBIC to help facilitate OIC member<br/>states with best-in-class business growth and risk management<br/>intelligence ecosystem, to coordinate with private and<br/>public stakeholders to ensure the legal framework governing<br/>the collection, treatment and sharing of business data are<br/>formulated and adopted.<br/>The aim is strategic - to accelerate trade with and investment<br/>into OIC countries by providing businesses with a detailed<br/>picture of OIC business performance and creditworthiness,<br/>helping them make informed decisions and allocate capital with<br/>confidence.<br/>The OBIC strategic pillars encompass:<br/>\u2022 Country development by driving credit maturity within each<br/>member state.<br/>\u2022 Cross-country implications by driving pan-OIC credit<br/>accountability and trade.<br/>\u2022 Operational excellence by creating a leading operational<br/>model capability building.<br/>\u2022 Creating best practice tools for effective self-governance.<br/>State of business intelligence and credit information in OIC<br/>states<br/>The business intelligence gap in the OIC states is at best underdeveloped<br/>and fragmented, and at worst rudimentary if not<br/>non-existent. There is a strong need to build an OIC credit<br/>intelligence ecosystem, and capabilities. A recent joint SWOT study on OBIC titled 'A Cutting-Edge<br/>Platform to Drive Economic Transformation' by ICIEC (the credit<br/>and investment insurance pillar of the OIC), COMCEC, and<br/>SESRIC highlighted the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities<br/>and threats in building this ecosystem.<br/>The strengths included the economic linkages between the<br/>Islamic finance and Halal economy, the existence of strong<br/>sector clusters especially energy, food and agriculture,<br/>electronics, travel, petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, textiles, and<br/>construction, demographically young and growing economies<br/>and intra-OIC linkages.<br/>The opportunities include intra-OIC trade and investment<br/>momentum, the promise of digitalization and technology<br/>including generative AI, blockchain and tokenization<br/>applications, the economic diversification of the GCC,<br/>international initiatives such as the Chinese One Belt, One Road<br/>Initiative, the BRICS bloc which now includes the UAE, Saudi<br/>Arabia and Iran, supporting crime prevention initiatives such as<br/>the FATF's AML/CFT convention.<br/>The weaknesses are implicit - a low business sector reporting<br/>and disclosure culture, and a weak credit intelligence supporting<br/>regulations framework and architecture in select OIC markets.<br/>The two main threats identified are other regional block<br/>initiatives and technology and digitalization further disrupting<br/>the current business playbook and investment flows into OIC<br/>economics.<br/>Going forward, its conclusions are not surprising if not alarming:<br/>\u2022 The OIC market of credit information remains generally<br/>under-developed with the lowest levels of credit<br/>penetration in the world.<br/>\u2022 In the majority of OIC economies, many companies are<br/>not registered formally or properly, which may lead to<br/>inaccurate credit records.<br/>\u2022 Most OIC member states do recognize they have an<br/>inadequate credit reporting system or none. Thus, the<br/>need for reliable, innovative business intelligence centers<br/>supersedes the need for basic credit reporting systems.<br/>\u2022 The cross-OIC database credit registry and infrastructure<br/>aims to be a hallmark of the centre's offerings, providing<br/>both the technology platform as well as credit data<br/>infrastructure that can be leveraged at a country level, and<br/>building on the Aman Union success story, as an important<br/>first step in establishing an OIC-wide business intelligence<br/>ecosystem, established for the benefit of national export<br/>credit insurance agencies (ECAs) in the region.<br/>\u2022 As such, the OBIC project will enable member state ECA to<br/>obtain valid, timely and cost-effective credit information.<br/>The rationale for business intelligence and credit information is<br/>simply based on the truism that access to accurate and reliable<br/>business information is a prerequisite of trade and investment.<br/>'In an increasingly data-driven world, business intelligence is the<br/>technology that allows businesses to turn data into actionable<br/>insights that inform business decisions and credit information<br/>central to doing business. The availability of business and<br/>credit information is crucial for ensuring that credit and capital<br/>markets, as well as financial systems more generally, are efficient and robust. From the perspective of a trade partner,<br/>company or investor, uncertainty is the enemy of commerce,<br/>resulting from a lack of information,\" maintained the joint OBIC<br/>SWOT study.<br/>Furthermore, robust credit reporting reduces information<br/>asymmetries between lenders and borrowers. This asymmetry<br/>is particularly prominent in countries with limited credit<br/>and business information. In these environments, business<br/>intelligence and credit data act as a compass in the deal-making<br/>process and fuel economic growth.<br/>Without the necessary data to make informed decisions, many<br/>potential trade partners, companies and investors may not have<br/>the confidence to do business in a region with a perception of<br/>geopolitical risk. Credit data on companies, particularly MSMEs,<br/>or industries can help drive trade, boost revenues and drive<br/>foreign companies to invest and set up operations abroad.<br/>The reality is that for the banking and insurance industries,<br/>precise and available data is required for such institutions to<br/>minimize risk and operate effectively. Without a solid financial<br/>and insurance industry, access to financing is impaired, cutting<br/>off a much-needed ingredient<br/>for growth in affected regions.<br/>In addition, modern business intelligence and credit reporting<br/>ecosystems play an integral role in fortifying financial systems<br/>by reducing transaction costs, enhancing portfolio quality and<br/>increasing competition. By extension, this allows financial<br/>systems to manage risk better and for the demand side of the<br/>credit equation to gain access to capital. A robust business<br/>intelligence ecosystem and access to reliable credit information<br/>are crucial for a strong economy and give companies, lenders<br/>and trade partners alike a clearer roadmap for allocating their<br/>assets<br/>Strategic objectives<br/>OBIC's strategic objectives include the development of a<br/>business intelligence ecosystem and the provision of advisory<br/>and capacity-building services across OIC member states,<br/>designed to drive business growth, managing risk effectively and<br/>enhancing the overall economic investment landscape of the 57<br/>member states of OIC.<br/>Under the leadership of ICIEC, two such CBPs have to date been<br/>organized, which have proven to be very popular and successful.<br/>The first one convened on 20-22nd March 2023 in Jeddah,<br/>Saudi Arabia, titled: 'The Role of Credit Information Sharing<br/>and Business Intelligence in Supporting Trade and Investment<br/>Decisions,' with the participation of 32 representatives from<br/>10 OIC member states aimed at increasing knowledge and<br/>understanding about OBIC, its core business areas, its services,<br/>including how to effectively use the OBIC platform as an<br/>improved credit risk management tool that will facilitate access<br/>to finance for trade and investment, as well as the mitigation of<br/>risks related to those activities.<br/>The session leaders also highlighted the importance of the<br/>role of business intelligence and digital transformation in<br/>supporting business decisions, credit information and data<br/>sharing when it comes to decision-making concerning the evaluation of government investment incentive packages,<br/>regulatory and legal environments for potential investments,<br/>recourse to law, repatriation of profits especially where the<br/>private sector is involved, de-risking solutions, in addition to<br/>the efficient utilization of statistical sources of information on<br/>credit, trade and investment, supporting member states in their<br/>development plans and the implementation of their business<br/>intelligence strategies.<br/>This initial CBP was followed by a second one on 26-28th<br/>September 2023 in Istanbul, Turkiye, on the theme: 'Role of<br/>Information Sharing &amp; Business Intelligence in Supporting<br/>Trade &amp; Investment Decisions.' The carefully curated program,<br/>complete with immersive real economy case studies, was a<br/>deep dive into the significance of digitalization and business<br/>intelligence in bolstering trade and investment.<br/>In addition to the speakers from ICIEC, and IsDB, some technical<br/>sessions of the programme were delivered by experts from<br/>two OIC-affiliated institutions i.e. the Islamic Chamber of<br/>Commerce and Development (ICCD) and the Islamic Centre for<br/>Development of Trade (ICDT), with valuable participation from<br/>the African Export-Import Bank by presenting on the bank's<br/>experience in developing credit information databases. The second CBP attracted the participation of more than 80<br/>attendees from various IsDB member states. It was organized<br/>by ICIEC, the IsDB's Cooperation and Capacity Development<br/>(CCD) Department, and the IsDB Regional Hub in Istanbul.<br/>Additionally, the event was co-sponsored by The Participation<br/>Banks Association of Turkiye (TKBB) and Turk Eximbank, a longstanding<br/>and valued partner of ICIEC.<br/>More CBPs with even more targeted components across the<br/>digital finance and insurance spectrum are planned over<br/>the near- to medium-term future. The CBPs to date have<br/>led to enhanced understanding and utilization of business<br/>intelligence and credit information among participants. These<br/>initiatives have strengthened the overall credit ecosystem in the<br/>participating states, fostering a more transparent and efficient<br/>economic environment. Building on the response and success of the previous program,<br/>OBIC is currently preparing for its next CBP scheduled for Q4<br/>2024 in Indonesia, focusing on:<br/>\u2022 Advanced credit reporting techniques: In-depth sessions<br/>on advanced credit reporting methods including the latest<br/>technological advancements in credit data collection,<br/>systems, harnessing and analysis.<br/>\u2022 Digital transformation for SMEs: Practical guidance on<br/>leveraging digital tools and platforms to enhance the<br/>competitiveness and operational efficiency of SMEs.<br/>\u2022 Regional collaboration: Promoting regional cooperation and<br/>knowledge sharing among OIC member states to support<br/>collective economic growth and stability.<br/>The expectation is that all the CBP proceedings would be<br/>translated into tangible actions that contribute to the economic<br/>development of OIC member states, further strengthening their<br/>role on the global economic development stage.<br/>The collaborative efforts of the CBPs, according to the<br/>promoters, hold the transformative potential to usher in a new<br/>era in which information sharing and business intelligence will<br/>play a pivotal role in bolstering trade and investment within the<br/>OIC member states. They stand as defining milestones in the<br/>IsDB Group and ICIEC's relentless journey in their unwavering<br/>commitment to nurturing economic cooperation and igniting<br/>the flames of sustainable development throughout the OIC<br/>cohort of member states.<br/>The joint SWOT study on OBIC also concluded that information<br/>systems boost credit and investment by up to 50% of GDP,<br/>reduce costs substantially and can financially assimilate the<br/>US$2 billion unbanked, with an observable impact on FDI.<br/>However, its other conclusion that OBIC once fully operational<br/>could boost private-sector lending in the least developed OIC<br/>member states by an estimated US$670 billion a year may be an<br/>ambition too premature, at least in the near- to medium-term.<br/>But optimism is good. The recent developments and future of<br/>OBIC underscore its commitment to enhancing financial<br/>technology, digitalization and the overall fintech landscape in<br/>the OIC countries pertinent especially to the global Islamic<br/>finance and insurance industry. Through these CBPs and<br/>strategic initiatives, OBIC continues to play a pivotal role in<br/>transforming the business intelligence and credit information<br/>ecosystems within the OIC, paving the way for sustainable<br/>economic development and growth which leaves nobody<br/>behind!</p>", "publisher": "Islamic Finance News Supplements", "instances": ["But it remains a work in progress that will need to be nurturedcarefully given the motley of risks.

The icy continent is located at the southernmost point on Earth's surface, encircled by the vast and rough Southern Ocean while Malaysia lies smack in the equatorial region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But surprisingly, the White Continent's polar climate has direct implications for a tropical region such as Malaysia. It is important to understand the connections between Antarctica and Malaysia in terms of climate change which is causing the ice in the Antarctic to melt.</p><p>The global sea level rise due to the melting ice poses a serious threat to low-lying coastal areas including Malaysia. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified Antarctic ice melt as a major driver of future sea level rise.</p><p>For Malaysia, this may potentially cause more severe flooding, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion which could have devastating impact on coastal communities, agriculture and freshwater resources.</p><p>It should be no surprise then that Antarctic research has grown in interest among Malaysian researchers in order to understand and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p><p>International research has been ongoing in Antarctica to understand the dynamics of Antarctica's climate and its implications for sea level rise.</p><p>Malaysian researchers have also contributed to this scientific effort to understand the behaviour of subglacial rivers and lakes and their influence on Antarctic ice melting.</p><p>This information is vital for developing effective coastal management strategies and climate adaptation plans in Malaysia, ensuring the protection of vulnerable areas and communities.</p><p>Antarctica also holds vital clues to the intricate processes of our planet and it is often described as a natural laboratory.</p><p>The Southern Ocean is home to diverse species that form the foundation of the marine food web. Changes in sea ice extent and ocean temperatures directly affect these species, influencing their distribution and abundance.</p><p>This ocean that encircles Antarctica is the most powerful carbon sink and absorbs about 30 percent of human-caused carbon dioxide output. The destruction of the Antarctic ecosystem and biodiversity will reduce its ability to capture carbon, hence increasing the Earth's temperature.</p><p>Malaysian researchers contribute significantly to studying Antarctic biodiversity by monitoring key species and assessing the impacts of climate change on these populations.</p><p>One crucial area of research is the study of blue carbon, especially in the marine environments that support carbon sequestration, such as seabed habitat. By understanding how Antarctic benthic (seabed) communities capture and store carbon, scientists can better appreciate the role of these ecosystems in mitigating climate change.</p><p>This research not only enhances our knowledge of Antarctic ecosystems but informs conservation strategies that can be applied to similar environments in Malaysia.</p><p>Malaysia acutely realises the importance of Antarctica in regulating Earth's climate as well as the importance of a collective effort to preserve Antarctica. In 1999, Malaysia initiated its Antarctic Research Programme which then led to Malaysia's first involvement in Antarctic research through a collaborative scientific expedition with New Zealand.</p><p>Three years later, the National Antarctic Research Centre was established to coordinate the research and researchers from various local universities. The inauguration of the Sultan Mizan Antarctica Research Foundation in July 2012, marked Malaysia's commitment to advance scientific works in this hostile yet important continent.</p><p>The involvement of Malaysia in Antarctic research is relatively recent and for now, it is accepted as a non-consultative member of the Antarctic Treaty. This status limits Malaysia's role in decision-making processes.</p><p>Being accepted as a consultative member will fulfil Malaysia's aspiration to play a greater role in safeguarding the environment through Antarctic and climate change research. To achieve this, Malaysia must first show its commitment to Antarctic research, especially through sustained funding and the involvement of various stakeholders to support this agenda.</p><p>This aspiration reflects Malaysia's dedication to safeguarding the Earth from the adverse impacts of climate change. Malaysia is among the 196 countries that ratified the Paris Agreement with the main objective being keeping the rise in mean global temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Malaysia's decision to ratify the agreement is praiseworthy as this means Malaysia is committed to an effort to minimise the rising temperature.</p><p>Likewise, monitoring Antarctica's characteristics is equally important in tackling climate issues. Among the targets of the Paris Agreement is to slow or stop the onset of Antarctic Ice Sheet loss and its effect on increasing sea levels.</p><p>The majority of the surface of this continent is in the form of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, a vast contiguous mass of glacial ice. The Antarctic Ice Sheet contains around 70 percent of the Earth's freshwater. This immense ice mass helps regulate global temperatures by reflecting solar radiation back into space.</p><p>However, rising global temperatures are causing the Antarctic ice sheets to melt at an accelerating rate, contributing to sea level rise. As Antarctica is encircled by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, the world's strongest ocean current, the heat from rising temperatures may be distributed around the planet, affecting weather and climate systems worldwide.</p><p>The melting of the entire Antarctic ice sheet is projected to contribute to the rise of sea level to almost a catastrophic 60 metres. This may seem unthinkable but the melting ice sheet in West Antarctica, which could cause an almost six-metre sea level rise, is relatively possible.</p><p>The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet is considered vulnerable to irreversible collapse under future climate trajectories and its tipping point may lie within the mitigated warming scenarios of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 2 degrees Celsius of the United Nations Paris Agreement.</p><p>Considering the grave impacts Antarctica may pose should there be no preventive and mitigation measures, the need for Malaysia to commit to preserving Antarctica's nature is well justified.

In 1971, a catastrophic flood swept through various parts of the country, particularly impacting Pahang with significant losses. </p><p>The Department of Irrigation and Drainage identified several causes of flooding, including increased runoff rates due to urbanisation, the loss of flood storage due to development encroaching on flood plains, inadequate drainage systems, constriction at bridges and culverts, siltation in waterway channels, local heavy rainfall, tidal backwater effect and inadequate river capacity. </p><p>Hence, addressing these issues is essential for effective flood management and mitigation strategies in the country. </p><p>Learning From the Netherlands</p><p>Addressing the water crisis, particularly in the context of both droughts and floods, requires strategic measures to ensure a reliable water supply for Malaysia. </p><p>Drawing insights from the Netherlands, a country below sea level with a rich history of water management spanning over 1,000 years, there are valuable lessons to consider. </p><p>\"I think the first lesson to be learned is not only to invest in new infrastructure, but to really make sure you maintain the infrastructure that you have. </p><p>\"Water infrastructure can last for decades, so if you operate and maintain it properly, you do not have to keep spending money in building new infrastructure,\" van Ginneken told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR) in a recorded video interview. </p><p>During the 6th Malaysia-the Netherlands Water Dialogue in November 2023, Natural Resources, and Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said Malaysia is keen on expanding its collaboration with the Netherlands to develop pilot projects focused on flood mitigation and climate resilience. </p><p>The ministry and the Netherlands Embassy have been involved in various collaborations, including assistance from the Dutch Surge Support (DSS) scheme to address water disasters. </p><p>The collaboration aims to strengthen Malaysia's response to future flood risks and related climate change impacts. </p><p>Nik Nazmi also expressed hope in learning from the Netherlands' experiences, especially in water management, considering its success in handling water-related challenges. </p><p>The annual dialogue serves as a platform for experts to discuss a range of waterrelated topics such as wastewater treatment, water pollution, non-revenue water, flood mitigation and technological solutions. </p><p>Malaysia's Flood Management Adaptation </p><p>According to the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs (Sustainable Development), Malaysia employs a holistic strategy for flood mitigation, incorporating both structural and non-structural measures. </p><p>The comprehensive approach includes nature-based solutions, short-term preparedness through infrastructure maintenance and long-term strategies like early warning systems. </p><p>Furthermore, Malaysia emphasises the integration of adaptation into water management, regulatory interventions for climate change and effective community engagement. </p><p>This is evident through the increase of budget allocation for flood mitigation projects in the 11th (2016- 2020) and 12th Malaysia (2021-2025) Plans, amounting to RM19 billion for flood mitigation and RM5 billion for coastal protection. </p><p>Apart from that, the non-structural measures involve nature-based solutions, integrated water resources management and resettlement programmes. </p><p>Malaysia's proactive stance incorporates climate change considerations into infrastructure design and promotes resilience through shared hazard maps with relevant agencies. </p><p>However, the UN foresees that the end-of-century projections anticipate a rise in the average annual surface temperature (1.9\u00b0C to 2.1\u00b0C) and an increase in average annual precipitation (14% to 25%) in Malaysia. </p><p>The sea level is also expected to rise by approximately 0.7m. </p><p>These changes pose a risk of increased vulnerability to floods, impacting various sectors such as agriculture, industry, tourism and energy, potentially affecting the economy and population. </p><p>The December 2021 flood alone resulted in estimated losses and damages of RM6.2 billion across 11 states. </p><p>In response, Malaysia is enhancing flood mitigation and integrating climate change adaptation, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 13, with broader benefits for SDGs 1.5, 2.4, 6.5 and 9.1. </p><p>Discussions at COP28 </p><p>At COP28, the discussions centred on both climate mitigation, primarily focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions like CO2, and climate adaptation, with a particular emphasis on water. </p><p>The importance of water extends beyond being viewed merely as a sector; it serves as a critical element linking climate change to various sectors. </p><p>This includes its role as a connector between climate change and agriculture, its influence on cities and its impact on ecosystems. </p><p>The key proposal is to position water as the engine driving climate adaptation. </p><p>Achieving this involves a combination of robust engineering and technology, emphasising the safeguarding of freshwater ecosystems, which serve as primary reservoirs for water. </p><p>Furthermore, it underscores the necessity to integrate water considerations into spatial urban planning, recognising the intricate interplay between water and diverse sectors affected by climate change. </p><p>In order to position Malaysia on a path toward resilient and sustainable water management in the face of evolving environmental challenges, m u l t i f a c - eted strategy is crucial - drawing from international collaborations and regional experiences.  </p>", "publisher": "The Malaysian Reserve", "instances": ["5 and 9. 1.

We\u00e2  ve fostered stronger partnerships and community involvement, utilising a community-first, evidence-based approach to tailor solutions to the unique needs of Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru city dwellers as well as our work to connect small towns and cities in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>The ongoing projects that Think City is involved in include the continuous efforts to revitalise downtown KL using the RM15 million allocated under Budget 2023. It has provided the Creative KL Grants Programme and Creative KL Urban Challenge to support innovative projects and solutions to transform the city into a liveable, sustainable and inclusive hub that celebrates arts and culture in all forms. In addition, it organised Pentas Seni Merdeka and Arts on the Move, featuring arts and culture programmes such as traditional arts performances, art installations and workshops.</p><p>Then there is the Kita-Untuk-Kita (K2K) programme to alleviate poverty and reverse the social, economic and physical deterioration in public housing schemes. The programme covers 10 public housing settlements in KL and Selangor, which have a total of 50,000 residents.</p><p>There is also the Heritage Railway Rejuvenation Programme, which involves a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Transport\u00e2  s Railway Assets Corporation to acknowledge and appreciate the rich railway heritage and promote best practices in placemaking and adaptive reuse of the stations in Kluang, Penang and KL.</p><p>With the RM10 million in funding granted to Think City in 2022, the Northern Region Archaeotourism Network Programme (NRAN) was set up to promote culture-based economies in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia by connecting small towns and cities to historical and heritage sites in the country that date back 1.83 million years. The programme was given a boost with the Cultural Economy Catalytic Grants Programme (CECG).</p><p>Monetary support</p><p>The recent announcement of Budget 2024 saw Think City receiving an allocation of RM20 million. Hamdan already has plans to put this money to good use.</p><p>\u00e2  With an allocation of RM20 million, Think City will further develop downtown KL as a creative and cultural district, focusing on flagship projects around Masjid Jamek and its surrounding areas. We will deepen our partnerships with the downtown KL community to jointly preserve, innovate and activate the historical city centre,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>\u00e2  Think City, in cooperation with the Penang state government and Aga Khan Trust for Culture, is leading a comprehensive restoration project for Fort Cornwallis, Peninsular Malaysia\u00e2  s largest fort. This initiative is part of the larger North Seafront Improvement Programme and is set to conclude in 2025. Our primary goals are to authentically restore Fort Cornwallis to its historical significance and improve its accessibility and appeal to visitors.\u00e2 </p><p>Hamdan also points to the activities carried out under the Penang Nature-Based Climate Adaptation Programme, which was launched in 2022 by UN-Habitat in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Water, the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, the Penang Island City Council and Think City.</p><p>\u00e2  This programme involves a diversified set of components, addressing both the environmental and social aspects of climate change in Penang\u00e2  s urban areas through nature-based solutions. Think City will focus on inculcating more urban greening measures as well as community-based initiatives in building resilience in anticipation of climate change among public housing and B40 communities, as well as non-governmental organisations through awareness raising and capacity building,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>World Cities Day</p><p>World Cities Day will be celebrated on Oct 31 and Think City will acknowledge it by continuing to bring awareness to its efforts.</p><p>\u00e2  In alignment with this year\u00e2  s theme, \u00e2  Financing a Sustainable Urban Future for All\u00e2  , our unwavering commitment is to foster enhanced participation and continuous engagement with the rakyat,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>\u00e2  This dedication extends to ensuring that the funding mechanisms underpinning our flagship projects and initiatives are not only sustainable but also inclusive and centred around the needs and aspirations of the rakyat. This approach empowers them to instigate impactful change and elevate the overall quality of urban living.</p><p>\u00e2  Elevating our advocacy efforts to promote increased collaboration between the public and private sectors for the financing and management of urban projects and solutions is of paramount importance too. We are intensifying these efforts, particularly within our flagship programmes like the Kuala Lumpur Creative and Cultural District, aiming to foster a holistic, community-driven approach.\u00e2 </p><p>He adds that Think City will continue to forge close collaborations with its stakeholders to achieve a sustainable urban future for all.</p><p>Creating liveable city spaces</p><p>Think City is focused on providing solutions to urban issues that plague cities as urbanisation grows. One of the initiatives is to create sustainable and liveable public housing in the city so as to develop a more vibrant cityscape and sustainable lifestyle for its residents.</p><p>\u00e2  Think City has been involved in a variety of research and interventions over a decade surrounding housing and residential communities in Malaysia, primarily through its extensive research and intervention efforts spanning over a decade. Our involvement in public housing initiatives began in 2016, with a notable project in Program Perumahan Rakyat (PPR) Kota Damansara. In this instance, we took an underutilised space and reimagined it as a communal area, with a primary goal of fostering social cohesion and improving the quality of life for residents,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>\u00e2  The Right to the City (R2C) is an overarching platform that forms the foundation for our efforts in improving public housing, where Think City collaborates with experts and practitioners to develop and implement effective policy recommendations aimed at enhancing public housing and strengthening the resilience of vulnerable communities.</p><p>\u00e2  From the learnings of R2C as well as on-the-ground research and engagements, the K2K initiative was designed and has been particularly instrumental in addressing the challenges faced by public housing communities, focusing on four critical areas \u00e2 \" community empowerment, community co-management, improved income generation and policy reform. It was conceived to help people weather the pandemic storm and has evolved into a more extensive, long-term effort, with support from private and non-profit organisations.\u00e2 </p><p>To further enhance this initiative, certain programmes were launched against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was the \u00e2  K2K INDAH\u00e2  study, which looked at aspects such as childhood nutrition, quality of life and governance in more than 200 households. The \u00e2  K2K Aktif Bersama\u00e2  a health and well-being programme designed to address various needs during the pandemic, including mental health consultations, entrepreneurship support and grant writing workshops. It also fostered community engagement through activities such as walking groups and composting workshops.</p><p>There was also the \u00e2  Bakul K2K\u00e2  pilot programme, which provided access to affordable fresh produce while promoting the R2C programme\u00e2  s principles of inclusivity and equitable access to resources.</p><p>Hamdan points to the equipping and empowering of community leaders to take charge and responsibility in driving change in their communities. To enhance youth engagement, Think City initiated a youth-centric programme led by dedicated coaches, further enhancing community cohesion and promoting healthy and active lifestyles.</p><p>Long-term view</p><p>When Think City was formed, it realised that changing mindsets would take time, and while it has achieved significant milestones, the transformation journey is ongoing. Hamdan explains that as 75% of Malaysians reside in urban environments, the prosperity of the nation will be determined by how cities and towns perform \u00e2  in achieving global socioeconomic competitiveness, resiliency and high quality of life\u00e2 .</p><p>He says Think City is committed to accelerating its efforts in driving urban rejuvenation nationwide to deepen its work in existing networks in the peninsula and to explore opportunities in Borneo alongside efforts to rejuvenate important cultural sites.</p><p>\u00e2  The momentum extends as we broaden our initiatives to rejuvenate essential heritage assets across various cities and towns in Malaysia. This includes revitalising local heritage and cultural offerings, thereby boosting local economies through culture-focused economic development while extending nature-based climate adaptation programmes across other cities in Malaysia, preparing them for future challenges,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>He adds that on the international front, Think City will expand its network and nurture existing partnerships such as with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, UN-Habitat and ICCN (Indonesia Creative Cities Network). It will also continue projects like restoring historical heritage in Hyderabad, India.</p><p>\u00e2  As we forge ahead, we are set on contributing to making cities that are not only sustainable and liveable but also vibrant hubs of cultural and creative expression, resonating with global urban development and sustainable goals,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>[END]</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Malaysia", "instances": ["This initiative is part of the larger North Seafront Improvement Programme and is set to conclude in 2025.

In Kelantan, we just cannot live without at least one rice meal a day. The state is known for its many rice specialties, such as nasi dagang, nasi kerabu, nasi berlauk, and more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was no surprise that the recent hike in world rice prices caused a stir in Kelantan. Changing global weather patterns, attributed to the climate crisis, has wreaked havoc on rice harvests.</p><p>Inadequate rain or rainfall arriving at the wrong time has created a major upset among rice growers. Yields in many of the major producer countries have been badly affected.</p><p>The reduced harvests have forced many major rice producing nations to cut exports, including India, the world's largest exporter of white rice. Their priority is domestic needs.</p><p>Since world demand is high, the inevitable result is the rise in prices to a level that affects affordability, especially for the poor. As a net importer of rice, we will feel the effects of the crisis.</p><p>It has been reported that rice prices surged to their highest in almost 12 years. The\u00c2\u00a0Food and Agriculture Organisation All Rice Price Index\u00c2\u00a0for July rose 2.8 per cent to 129.7 points. The figure is up 19.7 per cent compared with a year ago, and the highest nominal value since September 2011.</p><p>The sharpest increase in price came from Thailand. The report stated that concerns over the potential impacts of El Nino on production among some suppliers further underpinned price hikes, as did rain-induced interruptions and quality variability in Vietnam's ongoing summer-autumn harvest.</p><p>El Nino is a climate phenomenon marked by extreme temperatures and weather conditions that could interrupt lives and livelihoods.</p><p>India's \u00c2\u00a0ban on exports of non-basmati white rice\u00c2\u00a0on July 20 come as the government seeks to cap soaring food prices at home, and ensure enough affordable supplies domestically.\u00c2\u00a0The country accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global rice trade.</p><p>Even if it affects a portion of India's overall rice shipments, FAO noted that India's export restriction raises substantial food security concerns for a large swathe of the world population. El Nino could further exacerbate risks on global production.</p><p>Thailand, the world's second largest exporter of rice, is now encouraging farmers to plant less of the crop in a bid to save water as a result of low rainfall.\u00c2\u00a0The irony of it all is that most rice farmers are poor.</p><p>The high world price does not trickle down much to them. Such economic gains mainly go to the processors and the people involved in logistics. It is a real dilemma.</p><p>Experts watching such a dichotomy have long proposed the need to structurally reform the sector. Much of these warnings have fallen on deaf ears.</p><p>One suggestion is rice farmers form cooperatives and undertake the milling and marketing themselves. In this age of e-commerce, that is not impossible. Despite many years of research and development to improve rice yields, Malaysia's national average harvest remains low and stagnating.</p><p>There are many reasons for this. One is the low-quality planting materials used by farmers. The supply of high-quality planting materials has not been properly supervised.</p><p>Next, the fertilisation of the crops has been largely compromised. The common explanation is that the government-subsidised fertilisers have not been properly applied. There have been claims of fertilisers being sold on the black market.</p><p>Farmers have also complained of poor irrigation infrastructure. Many blame the poor adoption of the latest technology for the low yields.</p><p>It is time to address this supply chain deficiency. We cannot forever blame the climate. Adaptation measures must be developed to help farmers cope with climate related problems.</p><p>More importantly, there should be serious study on the compensation received at each level of the value chain. There should be structural reform to put in place a more equitable distribution of the returns.</p><p>Now, it is lopsided. Processors, distributors and marketers are better compensated than farmers. We must not forget that farmers form the most critical part of the value chain.

While Indonesia is still enjoying resilient economic growth, its long-term prospects are not as rosy as it may seem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Immediate policy action is direly required to address long-term developmental challenges as Indonesia's demographic window of opportunity will close soon. Presidential candidates should reflect this urgency in their election manifesto but a farsighted economic agenda is at odds with the short election cycles of the candidates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In less than 15 years but possibly as early as seven, Indonesia's population will start to age, with an increasing number of dependents per working age person.</p><p>Its total dependency ratio (the number of people below 15 years old plus those aged 65 years and older, divided by those aged 15 to 64 years) was 47.2 per cent in 2022. This ratio is expected to reach its lowest level, or the inflection point, between 2030 and 2040 before it will start to increase.</p><p>There is no turning back: Very few societies and countries where the data have been tracked in the last 50 years have become younger once they start to age. Even if Indonesia should become younger again, it will not happen anytime soon. As a country's population ages, economic growth starts to decline. The rate and the extent of the decline will depend on the foundation that the earlier, younger high-growth economy was able to lay, including for human capital, physical infrastructure and governance.</p><p>Although an imploding working age population may be attenuated by a higher labour force participation rate, especially of elder workers (that is, those aged 65 or above), on average, older workers are not as productive and innovative as younger ones. This usually translates to lower labour productivity growth and a slower rate of innovation.</p><p>The natural growth rate of a country's economy, which is the rate of economic growth that could be sustained over the long term and is determined by demographic changes and technical progress, will also decline. This results in a lower appetite for corporate investment and consequently, lower firm productivity.</p><p>GET DEVELOPMENT ON TRACK, THEN GET RICH</p><p>What seems to be preoccupying policymakers now is how to \"get rich before getting old\", as touted in the Grand Strategy for Indonesia's 2045 Vision. This mindset must change: Indonesia should close its development gap by getting its foundations right, then get rich, not vice versa. The sequence of reforms matters.</p><p>President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, in his two terms has made tremendous progress in building certain structural foundations for the country - including in transportation, electricity generation, irrigation systems, regulatory reforms aiding investment, the financial and health sectors, and tax harmonisation.</p><p>This is his legacy in improving the welfare of Indonesians. However, there are big development gaps that Indonesia's next president still needs to close in the next critical 10 to 15 years, primarily laggard human capital and the eroding quality of governance. NEXT GOVERNMENT'S TO-DO LIST</p><p>According to the World Bank's Human Capital Index 2020, which quantifies the contribution of health and education to the next generation of workers' productivity, Indonesian children will live up to only 54 per cent of their full productivity potential, compared to 88 per cent for Singaporean children and 69 per cent of Vietnamese children.</p><p>Human capital challenges, including scarring effects from the high albeit declining stunting rate (21.6 per cent in 2022), have dragged down Indonesia's long-term potential growth since the 2000s.</p><p>Besides mobilising domestic resources and stakeholders, including identifying student learning levels that often fall short of student education levels and making up for significant learning losses during the pandemic, the key to improving Indonesia's human capital will be allowing more foreign investment in education and health.</p><p>Indonesia has started taking steps in the right direction. For example, its Omnibus Law on Job Creation allows more foreign investment in hospitals. The next administration should continue such efforts.</p><p>Yet, the quality of governance in Indonesia has been deteriorating. According to the Corruption Perception Index, the fight against endemic corruption has backtracked since Jokowi's second term, with its worst decline in 2022. The Worldwide Governance Indicator portrays a similarly disappointing picture. Indonesia's full membership to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), expected to be completed by 2026, could help difficult domestic reforms along, including in the areas of judicial reform, fighting corruption, upholding the rule of law and the values of democracy, as well as human rights protection. Indonesia's next president could continue to push for Indonesia's full membership to OECD.</p><p>Indonesia is currently obsessed with its so-called downstreaming strategy, for not one but 21 commodities in the next two decades. However, it needs to take a more rigorous cost-benefit analysis of such policies to ensure that the economic rents from the export boom accrue to the whole of society.</p><p>Importantly, this strategy must be executed under good governance while upholding multilateral trading rules. The idea of becoming rich from downstreaming and expecting economic rents to automatically trickle down for the betterment of Indonesians by closing development gaps is simply naive.</p><p>Good governance is key to a just transition for Indonesia towards a greener economy, as there are power asymmetries between the winners and losers in this transition.</p><p>Globally, climate change impacts on the economy and populations are becoming more palpable: Indonesia is no exception.

It can also be achieved by draining submerged wetlands or similar biomes.</p><p>Stephen Beng, the chairperson of the Friends of the Marine Park ground-led initiative, concurred that reclamation works on Long Island will \"most definitely\" disrupt ecosystems and lead to a loss of habitat and biodiversity.</p><p>He noted that Singapore lost 60 per cent of its coral reefs, which \"support a greater diversity of life than any place on earth\", over the past few decades due to reclamation and development works.</p><p>A vast majority of these reclamation works have happened along the eastern coast, such as the East Coast Reclamation Scheme that was launched in 1966. It was completed 20 years later with a total of 1,525ha of land reclaimed.</p><p>With the Long Island project slated to be a similarly decades-long one, more sediment and pollutants could end up in the waters. This could smother corals and seagrasses and impact the Southern Islands, which is home to most of Singapore's remaining coral reefs, said Dr Jani Tanzil, facility director of St John's Island National Marine Laboratory.</p><p>Aside from the past loss of coral reefs, she noted that reefs in Singapore already exist \"in marginal conditions where light penetration is limited\".</p><p>\"I'm worried that if the land reclamation works are not managed properly, we may see our reefs having to endure even lower light conditions for decades to come, and further truncation of our reefs to even shallower vertical distribution,\" Dr Jani added.</p><p>NUS biological scientist N Sivasothi also pointed out that the Long Island project will eliminate existing marine habitats, given the plans to create an enclosed waterbody - eventually, a freshwater reservoir - in front of East Coast Park.</p><p>Nevertheless, he said these marine communities are not as mature as those on Chek Jawa Wetlands or Pulau Ubin.</p><p>Mr Beng added: \"We've ... seen that life on our reefs and shores does return when given a chance, though some changes and losses cannot be reversed such as predator-prey relationships, invasive species, resource competition.</p><p>\"Our remaining reefs and living shores could disappear within a generation under the threats of climate change and coastal development.\"</p><p>DESIGN WITH NATURE FIRST IN MIND</p><p>The experts championed the idea of designing structures at Long Island with a nature-first approach, including artificial reef structures that can beef up coastal defence and biodiversity protection.</p><p>Mr Beng further suggested providing sufficient depth for mangroves, slopes of reefs, and allowing the natural accumulation of sediment for sandy beaches and rocky shores.</p><p>Professor Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, also pointed to \"working with nature\" concepts where developments are designed based on natural principles that mimic nature.</p><p>Marine forces - such as waves and tides - should be used to maintain high-quality developments like artificial beaches, lagoons, wetlands and mangroves, rather than being viewed as something to protect against during extreme events, he added.</p><p>\"Coastal environments are transient, continuously reshaped by the natural forces of waves, tides, surges, erosion and deposition. To be sustainable, the Long Island developments must be designed and implemented with a clear understanding and respect for local natural processes,\" Prof Horton noted. Mr Beng cautioned that Singapore must not \"become comfortable with the ability to reclaim and restore\", despite coming far to include conservation considerations in development plans.</p><p>Time must be given between work phases for the environment to recover, and the government must also continuously monitor environmental and social impacts over a wider area, he said.</p><p>This is especially because the Sisters' Islands Marine Park - part of the Southern Islands - will be exposed to much of the risks during reclamation and construction works, and may also face changes in water quality and flow.</p><p>\"Nature is most resilient to disturbances when it's left natural,\" Mr Beng noted.</p><p>\"If climate adaptation and future development come at a greater cost to nature, then that could also mean an unrecoverable expense for all of us.\"</p><p>Whether or not Singapore's environment will benefit from having another island, where flora and fauna can flourish, is up in the air for now.</p><p>Assoc Prof Huang said a comprehensive environmental impact assessment is needed to determine the biodiversity costs.</p><p>He added: \"An artificially created land area with additional coastal space is not the same as natural ecosystems that have been around for thousands of years in terms of biodiversity and their natural functions and services, even if the island might be designed to host biodiversity with an abundance of greening efforts.\" \"URGENT RESPONSIBILITY\" TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE</p><p>Mr Sivasothi pointed out some key differences in the preparations and design for the Long Island project compared to reclamation works from decades ago.</p><p>For example, there is a desire to integrate relevant terrestrial and marine nature areas with the project. Much more is also known about the restoration ecology of terrestrial and marine environments from both local and global studies, which means Singapore can \"ensure the facilitated establishment of nature areas unlike before\", added Mr Sivasothi.</p><p>He also spoke of being heartened to see during a recent engagement that the push to protect and integrate biodiversity in the Long Island project not only came from members of nature groups, but from many other participants.</p><p>\"The responsibility to address sea level rise is a critical and urgent responsibility of this time,\" Mr Sivasothi pointed out.</p><p>\"An island state like Singapore with high population density and no hinterland is much more vulnerable than most other countries, and global action to address global warming deadlines is always behind schedule.
