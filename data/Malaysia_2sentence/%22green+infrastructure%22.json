Named after the hornbill, the official bird of Sarawak, this catalytic development is set to boost the state\u00e2  s economic growth and bring in investment and business opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Teo Ah Khing, founder and chairman of TAK Group, is a proud Sarawakian with more than 30 years of experience in architecture and urban design. He will lead the team in realising the KSC master plan, which will offer medical, commercial, leisure and educational facilities for future generations of Malaysians, as well as interested parties from around the globe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Teo, who spent many years plying his trade abroad, has decided to contribute to the economic development of Sarawak, a place he holds close to his heart. Born in Kuching, but grew up in Miri, he is the youngest of 10 siblings. Both his father, a fisherman, and his mother, a homemaker, were from Putian in China.</p><p>Teo studied architecture at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture (Honours) in 1986. He then worked for one year with John Andrews, a prolific and internationally known Australian architect who had made a name for himself with projects in the US and Canada.</p><p>\u00e2  They handled big projects in Australia. I got experience doing the whole infrastructure \u00e2 \" roads, drains and urban design,\u00e2  he recalls.</p><p>Andrews advised him to go to Harvard University if he wanted to go further in urban design. So, Teo applied for the Master of Architecture in Urban Design at the university. His application was accepted in 1987. At Harvard, he learnt everything about the built environment, from basic drainage to weather, flooding, traffic flow and beyond.</p><p>After graduating from Harvard in 1989, he was headhunted and moved to Tokyo, Japan, to work for Nikken Sekkei Ltd. He worked there for four years and helped to open the firm\u00e2  s Singapore office.</p><p>In 1993, he ventured out on his own at the age of 33 to start Teo A. Khing Design Consultants. One of his first clients was DBSLand, a subsidiary of DBS Bank. He worked in the Asean region in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p><p>Teo and his team have designed master plans for various projects, including Putrajaya, the Federal Administrative Centre in Kuching and the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in Johor Bahru. Overseas, he was involved in the masterplans for Dubai\u00e2  s Palm Deira, Palm Jebel Ali, Madinat Al Arab, the Meydan Racecourse &amp; Grandstand and Meydan City, which was designed around the racecourse.</p><p>While it may seem that he only takes on big projects, Teo says, \u00e2  Building big is not an intention, like I want to build big. It is a comprehensive understanding of the entire project. Like a general practitioner understands the human body, a specialist understands the function of a specific organ and how to treat it.</p><p>\u00e2  In a built environment, architects are very specific about certain needs. It can be a house or a condominium. But for an urban designer, he is first a specialist, but he is also a generalist. Urban design is not about being big, it is about being complete.\u00e2 </p><p>A smart city development</p><p>Teo\u00e2  s body of work had prepared him to design the KSC master plan. Situated on 543 acres of land, almost similar to the size of Desa ParkCity in Kuala Lumpur and about half the size of Bandar Utama in Selangor, the new smart city will be built in three phases.</p><p>Phase 1 will be built between 2025 and 2028. It will comprise the Fudan University Joint Research Center for Innovative Drug Development in Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, including a residential component; Kenyalang Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre (KCEC); Nexus Hotel &amp; Shopping Mall; the commercial KCEC Square and accommodation at KSC Lagoon Park, which targets the tourism sector.</p><p>Phase 2 will be developed between 2027 and 2035, with the establishment of Fudan Healthcare City and Fudan University SEA Campus. There will also be the AI &amp; Technology Centre, KCEC Plaza, KCEC Avenue, Lagoon Park, Lagoon Villas and a solar farm.</p><p>Phase 3, scheduled from 2030 to 2038, will feature Kenyalang Square, a clean energy industrial park, data centres and Kenyalang Lake.</p><p>According to Teo, the development of the KSC land, which is owned by Imasa Dinasti, will be financed through a hybrid funding model comprising private investments, internal capital and targeted government funding injections. \u00e2  This multi-stream approach ensures financial resilience while enabling impactful, long-term development,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>One of the land challenges Teo and his team have to deal with is the area\u00e2  s susceptibility to flooding. To counter this, they carved out 200 acres of retention and holding ponds to contain and hold all forms of excess water from the rain and sea before safely releasing the water when the time is right.</p><p>The team did a 100-year forecast on tidal behaviour and rainfall to ensure the master plan\u00e2  s designs and infrastructure will be able to withstand such incidents. According to Teo, people normally conduct a 50-year study. \u00e2  I don\u00e2  t want investors who invest billions of dollars to come in and later have to use a boat to get to work,\u00e2  he smiles.</p><p>Teo reveals that one of the key components of KSC \u00e2 \" Fudan University Joint Research Center for Innovative Drug Development in Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine \u00e2 \" got off to a good start on June 11 with the signing of an agreement between Imasa Dinasti and Fudan University to jointly establish the centre.</p><p>He says, \u00e2  This university is considered Ivy League in China. It immediately wanted to set up the research institute. So, the local government offered the Miri old council building downtown to Fudan for its administrative office and classrooms for its certificate courses.</p><p>\u00e2  Hopefully, by the end of this year or before Chinese New Year, we can launch the Fudan programme in Southeast Asia. The only Fudan University Joint Research Center for Innovative Drug Development in Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine will be in Miri.\u00e2 </p><p>The centre will be its flagship biomedical facility, and a strategic partnership has been set up between Fudan University, Imasa Dinasti and the Sarawak Biodiversity Centre for it to be a regional hub for integrative medicine. It will integrate research, education, training and product commercialisation. The campus will have three blocks of 2-storey research and teaching facilities, with a capacity of 200 researchers and PhD students.</p><p>There are plans for specialised laboratories for pharmaceutical sciences, traditional medicine, biotechnology, biodiversity and ethnobotany, as well as facilities for phytochemical analysis, bioassays, molecular biology and tissue culture.</p><p>Moreover, it will have training infrastructure with classrooms, lecture halls, teaching labs and demonstration gardens. It will also have specimen handling and storage facilities, a specialised showroom and a visitors\u00e2   interpretation gallery to engage with stakeholders and the community.</p><p>In addition to the centre, a purpose-built accommodation called The One KSC Residence Serviced Apartment and Fudan House will also be built. It will house medical doctors, researchers, healthcare professionals and visiting academics.</p><p>The serviced apartments will have modern conveniences and co-living suites with flexible layouts to cater for short-term stays and long-term residence. The project, which will have an estimated gross development value (GDV) of RM130 million, will be launched in 4Q2025. The selling price has not been finalised.</p><p>\u00e2  This mixed-use module promotes synergy between academia, commerce and the community, ensuring that innovation spills beyond the labs into everyday life,\u00e2  says Teo.</p><p>Another component to be built concurrently with the research centre is the KCEC.</p><p>\u00e2  The Sarawak government is expected to play a strategic role through equity participation in selected catalytic components under Phase 1, namely the KCEC and the Nexus Hotel &amp; Shopping Mall. These partnerships underscore the state\u00e2  s commitment to advancing public-private collaboration in urban innovation,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>The KCEC is positioned as an integrated transit-oriented development (TOD) that embodies the principles of sustainable urbanism, human-centric design and intelligent architecture, to deliver a synergised business event ecosystem with a walkable, connected and high-performance area. It will comprise a convention and exhibition hall, business hotel, retail galleria, performance art centre, Sarawak Heritage &amp; Cultural Museum and a technology centre gallery \u00e2 \" all within a 300m radius.</p><p>Anchored by a proposed inter-region bus terminal, this will form a central hub of a multi-nodal transport network, supporting regional accessibility and urban densification. Teo explains that the terminal will possibly foster cross-border business events, tourism and talent exchange.</p><p>\u00e2  [The terminal] will be based on a PPP [public\u00e2 \"private partnership] model, where the government will fund it and the private sector will drive it to completion. The government will be anticipated to run the operations and maintenance. These are considered public infrastructure.</p><p>\u00e2  This urban design framework is further reinforced through axial visual corridors and green linkages, notably the linear spine known as the Knowledge Axis, which links the Fudan University main campus with Kenyalang Lake, encouraging civic vitality and socio-academic exchange.\u00e2 </p><p>He explains that the KCEC will be built sustainably using prefabricated construction methods to reduce its carbon footprint and enhance building efficiency. Green materials will be used to maximise life-cycle performance, while solar roofing and smart energy systems will contribute to renewable energy use. The design also includes rainwater harvesting infrastructure, expanded shaded zones, urban greening and thermal comfort strategies to improve environmental resilience and occupant well-being.</p><p>\u00e2  KCEC is more than a venue \u00e2 \" it is a dynamic engine for knowledge exchange, creative economy and smart living reflecting a new paradigm of resilient, connected and human-scaled urbanism in East Malaysia. Through its urban-intelligent integration, it sets a benchmark for future-ready city making in the region and beyond,\u00e2  says Teo.</p><p>Commercial activities will be centred at KCEC Square, located adjacent to Fudan University Joint Research Center for Innovative Drug Development in Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, that will serve as a vibrant commercial precinct. It will comprise shopoffices, pedestrian-priority streets and shaded colonnades to foster social interaction in climate comfort and integration with smart mobility modes such as e-scooters, bike-sharing docks and electric vehicle (EV) drop-off bays. With an estimated GDV of RM70 million, it is scheduled for launch in 4Q2025. The details will be revealed at a later date.</p><p>Lastly, tourism and accommodation will be anchored at KSC Lagoon Park, the smart city\u00e2  s dedicated leisure and tourism hub. At its heart will be a nine-acre waterbody surrounded by smart resort villas equipped with Internet of Things-enabled energy and security systems. The precinct will also feature mixed-use podiums combining F&amp;B outlets, retail spaces and co-living suites; hotels and serviced apartments to support tourists and medical visitors; and public waterfront plazas and boardwalks designed for recreation and community engagement.</p><p>\u00e2  This waterfront district is an example of blue-green infrastructure, blending ecological water management with placemaking and wellness-focused tourism. The Lagoon also functions as a climate buffer, enhancing biodiversity and passive cooling within the urban core,\u00e2  says Teo.</p><p>Phase 2 and 3 highlights</p><p>While the details of the Phase 2 and 3 components are still being planned, Teo is able to provide a glimpse into what some components have to offer. For Phase 2, he highlights Fudan Healthcare City, Fudan University SEA Campus and the solar farm.</p><p>He explains that the future healthcare facility will provide an ecosystem for medical care and senior living, while promoting medical tourism. The healthcare city will feature the doughnut-shaped Fudan Huashan Specialist Hospital, which will offer a 450-bed tertiary medical facility with an oncology specialisation, elder care complex, a special wards block and premier patient hotel for high-care and medical tourism, and a medical education and teaching centre.</p><p>The Fudan Huashan Specialist Hospital will incorporate Medical Technology 6.0, a proprietary system developed under Fudan IP to help provide AI-assisted diagnostics and treatment planning, autonomous medicine delivery and telehealth robotics and precision patient monitoring, and cloud-integrated electronic medical records.</p><p>\u00e2  The Fudan Huashan Specialist Hospital is a keystone infrastructure in KSC\u00e2  s ambition to become a healthcare innovation cluster. It creates a transdisciplinary synergy between education, clinical application, wellness tourism and biotechnology incubation,\u00e2  says Teo.</p><p>He explains that the design of the healthcare city will help promote recovery and a sense of well-being. It will have a ground level public plaza with a therapeutic urban garden, a central plaza for community engagement, wellness education and health outreach as well as commercial activities like F&amp;B outlets, pharmacies and health-related retail.</p><p>The podium level will have a patient-centric garden with green recovery terraces, physiotherapy pathways and sensory gardens in a semi-private area. It will also provide wellness caf\u00c3\u00a9s, rehabilitation zones and resting courtyards for families and caretakers.</p><p>In a first, the Fudan University SEA Campus will be established in KSC. It will be the first international campus of a top-tier Chinese university \u00e2 \" top three in China, No 1 in healthcare and medical sciences and No 36 globally. Teo reveals its historical significance as the Chinese government endorses and supports Fudan University to establish a fully fledged postgraduate and research-oriented branch outside of China.</p><p>\u00e2  Positioned as one of the main anchors of KSC, the university functions as a driver of the K-economy, bio-economy and healthcare innovation. Through its strategic partnership with the Sarawak government and FIIM Education (Malaysia), a subsidiary of TAK Group, the university is envisioned to catalyse regional talent development, high-value innovation and cross-border academic exchange,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>He adds that the university will train students in both Western and traditional medicine, which will help alleviate the shortage of doctors in the state.</p><p>\u00e2  The Fudan University SEA Campus is more than an academic institution. It is a city-building instrument shaping the knowledge, health and innovation economy of Miri, Sarawak, and the wider Asean region,\u00e2  says Teo.</p><p>To provide renewable energy to KSC, a solar farm is planned. It will have a 200MW facility to provide energy resilience for mission-critical facilities like hospitals and data centres. It will be integrated with smart metering, building-integrated photovoltaics and district energy management platforms as well as provide real-time carbon monitoring and ESG performance dashboards.</p><p>\u00e2  This sustainable energy loop supports Sarawak\u00e2  s green economic transition, while enhancing energy security and cost competitiveness for investors and residents alike,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>As for Phase 3, the only details provided are for the data centre, which supports KSC\u00e2  s goal of being a data-driven intelligent city. Phase 1 of the data centre component will deliver 50MW of Tier III+ capacity and will support healthcare analytics, university research and fintech and governance systems.</p><p>Collaboration strategies</p><p>Besides the physical components, KSC will offer technologically advanced services and products, as well as various other conveniences that will enhance lifestyles and quality of life. Moreover, support from neighbour Brunei will benefit the smart city.</p><p>\u00e2  Brunei has an undersea cable and it has agreed to open up. The cable\u00e2  s high-speed network will come right through Miri to KSC \u00e2 \" zero lag time,\u00e2  says Teo.</p><p>He reveals that Sungai Tujuh on the border of Brunei and Sarawak will become a land port. Discussions have been made with Brunei\u00e2  s Muara Port Company Sdn Bhd, which controls the operations at Muara Port, to allow cargo to be offloaded there before being transported to KSC.</p><p>Teo and his team are busy engaging with various interested parties, both local and international, and they are confident KSC\u00e2  s offerings will be realised. He highlights how Sarawak\u00e2  s government is stable and fully committed to elevating the state\u00e2  s economic level to be an attractive investment destination.</p><p>Moreover, Brunei is looking to participate in KSC\u00e2  s growth and development, allowing for cross-border partnerships and business relationships that will be a win-win for both countries. The fact that Miri is only a five-hour flight to countries like India, China, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia, with a total population of 3.8 billion, is another opportunity.</p><p>Teo is currently in discussions with other Malaysian developers regarding their potential participation in the development of KSC, although no formal agreements have been confirmed yet. Nevertheless, he says several people have offered to buy property in KSC even before anything is built or confirmed.</p><p>With so much at stake, Teo is mindful of the objective of KSC. \u00e2  We\u00e2  re here to build a city, build a hometown and build a legacy. It\u00e2  s not about how many dollars and cents you\u00e2  ll make. Of course, we don\u00e2  t want to lose money because the government puts a lot of trust in us. Once value is established, the brand is there, people will come,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>\u00e2  The integrated mixed-use components of KSC serve as urban amplifiers \u00e2 \" intensifying land use efficiency, economic productivity and social interaction across the city\u00e2  s innovation landscape.

This move, posted not only threatens our US$80 billion annual trade relationship with the US, but risks undercutting the financial and industrial scaffolding needed to meet our net-zero ambitions by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a country that has pledged a 45 per cent reduction in carbon intensity by 2030, this is not just an economic setback but also a stress test of our climate governance, resilience, and readiness.</p><p>The potential impact is immense. Sectors like electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) which comprise nearly 40 per cent of our exports stand particularly exposed. With the Green Technology Master Plan relying heavily on E&amp;E to drive decarbonised manufacturing, this development places our climate-linked industrial strategy in jeopardy.</p><p>At the same time, Malaysia's expanded Sales and Service Tax (SST) which came into effect July 1, 2025 adds pressure from within. Over 4,800 previously exempt items, including industrial equipment and low-emission machinery, are now taxed at 8 per cent, up from the previous 6 per cent. While the SST expansion is projected to yield RM3 billion in additional revenue, its timing couldn't be worse. The Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) warns that these cascading tax burdens will inflate costs, shrink margins, and deter future investment especially in capital-intensive green infrastructure.</p><p>The National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), launched in 2023, sets ambitious targets: increasing renewable energy in the national mix to 70 per cent by 2050, developing CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilisation &amp; Storage), and attracting RM435 billion in investment. But these goals rely on a strong private sector, foreign direct investment, and investor confidence.</p><p>Reduced export earnings due to tariffs, paired with higher domestic operating costs from the SST, could stall clean energy adoption, battery storage scaling, and smart grid investments. Small and medium green-tech enterprises already navigating tight financing margins may pivot to survival mode, postponing R&amp;D or abandoning green upgrades entirely.</p><p>This fiscal constriction directly threatens the creation of 23,000 green jobs forecasted under NETR, and it risks reducing Malaysia's contribution to global clean energy supply chains at a time when demand is rising.</p><p>On the other hand, Malaysia's Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM), launched via the Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) in late 2022, was one of Southeast Asia's most promising climate finance innovations. With a projected market value of US$237 million by 2030, it was expected to fund reforestation, conservation, and industrial decarbonisation projects.</p><p>However, the VCM and the upcoming carbon tax and Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) under the National Climate Change Bill (Ruupin) are all sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Historically, economic downturns or trade disruptions often lead governments to delay carbon pricing reforms in the name of economic recovery. Malaysia is no exception.</p><p>Unless insulated, our carbon governance mechanisms may stall or regress under fiscal and political pressure just when they're needed to drive long-term decarbonisation and attract green capital.</p><p>Climate change disproportionately affects the poorest and most vulnerable communities in Malaysia from coastal erosion in Sabah to urban flooding in KL. But so too will economic instability.</p><p>Tariff-related export losses could result in job cuts in key industrial areas, while SST inflation will raise living costs. When people are forced to choose between short-term survival and long-term sustainability, the environment always loses.</p><p>Without targeted support, our vision of a \"just transition\" risks becoming rhetorical. The Ruupin framework, which emphasizes equity and protection for vulnerable populations, must be backed by resilient fiscal policy and progressive social safety nets not sacrificed in budget cuts driven by external shocks.</p><p>In this regard, what can Malaysia do? Firstly, Malaysia must demand clarity on the tariff scope and seek exclusions for clean technology, solar components, and environmental goods, aligning with WTO environmental exceptions.</p><p>Next, allocate funds from the new SST intake to fund VCM capacity-building, CCUS pilots, and green job retraining programs. SST exemptions or rebates for low-emission equipment, energy-efficient machinery, and carbon audit services must also be provided to incentivise clean industrial investments.</p><p>Also, as the Chair of Asean this year, we also have an upper hand in using this moment to lead within Asean, pushing for regional carbon border adjustments and green mutual recognition agreements that support decarbonised exports.</p><p>Lastly, fast-track funding for climate policy education, especially in carbon markets, climate law, and environmental economics, to prepare the next generation of climate experts.</p><p>In conclusion, economic shocks will come and go. But the climate crisis is permanent and intensifying. As floods grow more frequent, air pollution worsens, and biodiversity collapses, the cost of inaction grows steeper each year. Trade policy and tax policy must serve, not sabotage our climate goals.</p><p>Malaysia must not retreat from climate ambition in the face of tariffs or taxes. We must instead use these shocks to recalibrate our economic tools, reaffirm our global leadership in climate governance, and build a greener, more resilient Malaysia that doesn't trade short-term relief for long-term collapse.</p><p>* Mogesh Sababathy is a National Consultative Panel Member to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability of Malaysia and a PhD Candidate at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Dr. Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Mayor of Kuala Lumpur, shared insights that underscore these very needs. Her talk, titled \"Creative Solutions Today for a Liveable Tomorrow\", resonated as a call to action for sustainable urban transformation. The principles she outlined are rooted in the KL 2040 Structure Plan, which champions transparency, accountability, and public trust - values essential to any thriving urban landscape and ones that align closely with Think City's mission.</p><p>Central to the Mayor's address was climate resilience - a critical theme in urban development. Cities today are at a crossroads: they generate 80 per cent of global GDP while contributing roughly 70 per cent of carbon emissions. The paradox is stark, yet the potential to reverse this is immense. With initiatives like Malaysia's first urban nature-based climate adaptation programme in Penang, we are demonstrating how green infrastructure can reduce urban heat, promote biodiversity, and improve overall quality of life. It is a commitment to environmental stewardship that demonstrates how local actions can set a precedent for global change.</p><p>Equally important was her emphasis on social equity and inclusion. Our Kita-untuk-Kita (K2K) programme exemplifies this, empowering communities through community-led projects, public housing support, and accessible green spaces. As Dato' Seri Tpr. Dr. Maimunah noted, prioritising vulnerable groups is not just an ideal but an imperative for cities that aspire to inclusivity. For Think City, this is about ensuring that growth benefits all, fostering a sense of pride and belonging in each neighbourhood we serve.</p><p>Reflecting on her message, it is clear that the work we are doing is part of a broader movement. Think City's role is to support this vision in Malaysia, a vision closely tied to the themes of the current World Urban Forum in Cairo which emphasises the importance of inclusive, sustainable, and resilient cities,</p><p>In these 15 years, Think City's journey has been about catalysing a movement, one built on collaborative urban solutions, cultural-based economic development, community and environmental resilience. Working alongside inspiring changemakers and leaders like the Mayor, we look forward to continuing this work, bringing Malaysian cities to the forefront of sustainable urban transformation.</p><p>With a shared commitment, we can shape cities across Malaysia and beyond that are not only functional but deeply cherished places where resilience, inclusivity, and hope to form the foundation of a sustainable, vibrant future.</p><p>*Datuk Hamdan Abdul Majeed is the managing director of Think City.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writers or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Investments typically straddle<br/>a wide spectrum of policies, strategies and products, each suited to<br/>the requirements of a requisite national, bilateral and multilateral<br/>investment playbook and involving several facilitators.</p><p><br/>These may include governments, bilateral and multilateral institutional<br/>financing arrangements, domestic investors both institutional such as<br/>pension and social security funds, sovereign wealth funds, private sector<br/>capital, and more recently, the ascendancy of philanthropic capital.<br/>Investment flows, of course, could be domestic - government, institutional<br/>and private funds including through family offices and incentivized tax<br/>and guaranteed retail mobilization - or through foreign direct investment<br/>(FDI) flows through direct project financing especially in infrastructure<br/>and key economic sectors such as energy, agriculture and food security,<br/>healthcare and climate related activities, via cross-border mergers and<br/>acquisitions (M&amp;As) and through collaborative co-financing and blended<br/>financing mechanisms. This is in tandem with the risk mitigation and<br/>credit enhancement solutions offered by multilateral insurers such as the<br/>World Bank Group's MIGA, the IsDB Group's ICIEC, national export credit<br/>agencies (ECAs) and private providers of credit and investment insurance. Investment in the global context<br/>The mainstay however remains as global FDI flows, which according to the<br/>UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)'s World Investment Report 2024, decreased marginally by 2% to US$1.3 trillion in 2023.<br/>The global environment for international investment, stated the Report,<br/>remains challenging in 2024. This is due to \u201cweakening growth prospects,<br/>economic fragmentation trends, trade and geopolitical tensions, industrial<br/>policies and supply chain diversification\u201d which are reshaping FDI patterns,<br/>causing some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to adopt a cautious<br/>approach to overseas expansion.<br/>FDI observes the OECD, a group of the 20 largest economies including<br/>three ICIEC member states - Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Turkiye - lies<br/>at the heart of globalization and serves as an important conduit for the<br/>transfer of capital, goods, services and information across economies.<br/>\u201cMeasuring FDI helps us better understand how countries are<br/>interconnected and integrated into today's global economy. The OECD<br/>provides operational guidelines on how FDI activity should be measured<br/>and sets global standards for collecting FDI statistics. The OECD also<br/>disseminates comprehensive and comparable FDI data as well as in-depth<br/>insights into global FDI trends to support economic analysis and inform<br/>policy decisions and enhance investment strategies.\u201d<br/>With the global push to attract and retain financial flows, online information<br/>portals and single windows have proliferated to foster a conducive<br/>business and investment climate.<br/>According to the UNCTAD report, FDI flows to developing countries fell<br/>by 7% to US$867 billion last year, reflecting an 8% decrease in developing<br/>Asia. FDI flows to Africa fell by 3% to US$53 billion in 2023. Two of the<br/>largest recipient economies - Egypt and South Africa - drove the overall<br/>trend. Asia and Africa account for the majority of ICIEC member states,<br/>with Azerbaijan, the host country for COP29 and the Togolese Republic<br/>acceding to membership as the 49th and 50th member states. In contrast, flows to developed countries were strongly affected by<br/>financial transactions of MNEs, partly due to efforts to implement a<br/>global minimum tax rate on the profits of these corporations. Inflows to most parts of Europe and the US were down by 14% and<br/>5%, respectively. A disturbing trend in 2023 was a 10% reduction in<br/>investment in sectors linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals<br/>(SDGs) agenda, most notably impacting agrifood systems, water and<br/>sanitation power generation and renewables due to a 25% drop in<br/>investment flows in SDG-linked projects due in turn to the tight global<br/>financing and economic conditions.<br/>Similarly, according to the OECD, preliminary estimates in Q1 2024 show<br/>global FDI flows increased by 78% compared to Q4 2023, reaching<br/>US$462 billion. However, on a year-on-year basis, global FDI flows<br/>remained comparable to the level recorded in Q1 2023. The top three<br/>sources of FDI outflows worldwide were the US (US$131 billion), the<br/>Netherlands (US$71 billion) and Japan (US$45 billion).<br/>From a credit and investment insurance perspective, 2023 was an<br/>encouraging year for export credit with Berne Union (BU) members<br/>(including ICIEC) providing over US$3 trillion in new support for crossborder trade, with expansion across almost all business lines, auguring<br/>well for 2024 and beyond. The two stand out performance metrics for the industry in 2023 states the BU included a 40% increase to over US$165<br/>billion for medium- and long-term businesses, following strong growth in<br/>manufacturing, infrastructure and transport sectors alongside a continuing<br/>rapid growth in renewable energy investments. According to the BU, climate and the green transition are the main drivers<br/>of new opportunities with a record US$20.5 billion in reported new<br/>commitments for renewable energy across 68 countries in 2023.<br/>Enter ICIEC as the pioneering alternative investment<br/>insurer disruptor<br/>For a multilateral credit and investment insurer and serving effectively as<br/>the insurance pillar of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Group, ICIEC<br/>has emerged in a relatively short period of a mere 30 years with a unique<br/>new model for the global industry - the ICIEC Takaful System, which is<br/>the market standard for Shariah-based credit and investment insurance.<br/>This makes ICIEC the only dedicated Shariah-based multilateral insurer in<br/>the world, currently with 50 member states and rising with a cumulative<br/>business insured since its inception in 1994 exceeding US$108.3 billion<br/>including US$22.1 billion in investment insurance.<br/>Takaful is often described as the Islamic equivalent to conventional<br/>insurance, literally meaning solidarity or mutual support or guarantee,<br/>whereby a group of participants agree among themselves to support one<br/>another jointly for the losses arising from specified risks. The word \u2018Takaful'<br/>is derived from the Arabic word, Kafalah, which means \u2018guaranteeing each<br/>other' or \u2018joint guarantee' or \u2018solidarity', whereby a group of participants<br/>agree among themselves to support one another jointly for the losses arising from specified risks. Similarly, re-Takaful is the Islamic equivalent<br/>to conventional reinsurance where Takaful operators protect themselves<br/>against the risks they underwrite. The re-Takaful market is even smaller<br/>than the Takaful market with the major challenge being the lack of<br/>reliable data, capacity and the small number of re-Takaful providers and<br/>underwriters. In this respect, ICIEC brings a unique faith-based social<br/>finance.<br/>As the corporation marks its 30th anniversary in 2024, ICIEC has excelled<br/>despite several constraints in spreading the message of the importance<br/>of export credit and investment insurance both through its increased<br/>membership, its product suite and its business activity in line with the<br/>specificities of the development agendas of its constituent member states.<br/>As ICIEC continues to consolidate its market education and awareness<br/>as well as technical assistance functions among its member states,<br/>global partners and counterparties, it has the potential and capacity to<br/>dramatically increase its credit and investment insurance underwriting,<br/>reinsurance capacity. As in the Corporation's stated commitment to<br/>helping member states achieve their development goals including<br/>resilience, mitigation and adaptation to the threats posed by climate<br/>change and food security, so devastatingly exposed by the fuel and food<br/>supply chain disruptions caused by the conflict in Ukraine, the Red Sea and<br/>Panama Canal trade route disruptions.<br/>Noteworthy is the fact that ICIEC investment risk cover is directed toward<br/>various sectors, with US$2.35 billion in 2023 going specifically into clean<br/>energy initiatives such as solar energy systems and wind farms - assisting<br/>with their importation and use in national infrastructure projects. At COP28,<br/>IsDB President, H.E. Dr Muhammad Al Jasser also unveiled a US$1 billion<br/>group climate finance initiative for fragile and conflict-affected member<br/>countries over the next three years.<br/>As H.E. Dr Al Jasser, who is also chairman of ICIEC's board of directors,<br/>observed: \u201cThe journey of ICIEC is deeply intert twined with the vision<br/>and mission of IsDB. Our mutual commitment to fostering sustainable<br/>economic growth in member countries and Muslim communities in<br/>non-member countries has been the foundation of our collaborative<br/>endeavors.\u201d<br/>The IsDB Group's commitment to developing green infrastructure will<br/>go a long way toward addressing this issue, as well as other issues<br/>related to the quality and sustainability of member states' infrastructure.<br/>Equally important, a healthy and steady pipeline of good quality projects<br/>focusing on green and resilient infrastructure will allow the Group to be a<br/>leader in mobilizing cost-effective funds from global capital markets and<br/>private capital through green, sustainable and impact Sukuk targeting<br/>Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and SRI investor base, thus<br/>helping achieve the SDGs.<br/>Investment facilitation is well-embedded in the IsDB Group's Investment<br/>Promotion Technical Assistance Program (ITAP), an initiative by the<br/>IsDB Group, established in 2005. It was managed by ICIEC until 2016.<br/>ITAP aims at helping to unlock the developmental potential of the IsDB<br/>member states through a comprehensive and integrated program of<br/>foreign investment promotion technical assistance. Its focus areas<br/>include institutional development, sharing best practices, information<br/>dissemination on investment opportunities, needs assessment<br/>studies, specific sectors studies, capacity building of investment<br/>promotion agencies, country promotion events including g seminars and conferences as well as policy advice to improve the investment<br/>environment.<br/>Another major development which augurs well for ICIEC's future<br/>operations is the 150% increase in ICIEC's authorized capital from its<br/>current ID0.4 billion (US$0.54 billion) to ID1 billion (US$1.34 billion) and a<br/>268% increase in its subscribed capital by ID500 million (US$670 million)<br/>to ID797 million (US$1.07 billion) which has already materialised in<br/>subscription commitments by several member states. The capital increase<br/>boosts the Corporation's ability to underwrite more business and its<br/>reinsurance capacity.<br/>The capital increase also enhances ICIEC's financial strength, boosts its<br/>loss-bearing equity resources, improves its internal capital generation<br/>capacity, helps to continue its operation on a solid and stable foundation<br/>and strengthens its credit fundamentals. In addition, the Board of<br/>Governors approved a special share class comprising 20% of the increase<br/>in subscribed capital of ID100 million (US$134 million) for subscription by<br/>financial institutions owned/controlled by member states.<br/>Another important factor which ICIEC brings to the table is its ability to<br/>leverage its capital which, in turn, determines capacity through the reinsurance market. Over the last few years, ICIEC indeed has re-engineered<br/>its insurance treaty to absorb some of the capital requirements that ar needed instead of using its ordinary capital resources. In other words,<br/>ICIEC was using its insurance capacity to underwrite that business. At<br/>the same time, the corporation also initiated a study internally for the<br/>need of risk implications of recapitalization, taking in the experience of<br/>peer institutions in the multilateral development bank (MDB) domain and<br/>looking at new innovative ways to recapitalize Under its erstwhile authorized capital of ID400 million (US$556 million)<br/>for instance, ICIEC on average leveraged its capital five times from the<br/>reinsurance market over the last few years. For every dollar given to invest<br/>in a project, ICIEC could bring five dollars from the international market<br/>which is supported by its reinsurance capacity. Imagine the power of<br/>leveraging insurance can bring to the table as a major player that can<br/>release capacity to the developers.<br/>ICIEC's investment facilitation strategy<br/>The ICIEC's investment facilitation strategy is embedded through two core<br/>pathways - its business operations and its championing of the intra-OIC<br/>trade and investment and cooperation.<br/>Over three decades since its inception in 1994, ICIEC has insured US$114<br/>billion in trade and investment across the globe for its 50 member states,<br/>including US$90.7 billion in export credit and US$23.3 billion in investment<br/>insurance. The corporation has been a champion of intra-OIC businesses,<br/>supporting US$53.6 billion in trade and investment within OIC countries.<br/>The flagship investment policies include: i) Equity Investment Insurance<br/>Policy (EIIP) - a policy that provides insurance coverage for cross border<br/>equity investment by any individual or company against transfer and<br/>convertibility, expropriation, war and civil disturbance and breach of<br/>contract, ii) Financing Facility Insurance Policy (FFIP) - a policy that<br/>provides insurance coverage for cross border financing by banks and<br/>financial institutions against transfer and convertibility, expropriation, war<br/>and civil disturbance and breach of contract, and iii) Non-Honouring of Sovereign Financial Obligations (NHSFO) - a policy that provides<br/>insurance coverage for corporates against the default of governments and<br/>government-owned entities in meeting their sovereign obligations.<br/>This playbook can be further segmented into - i) Investment insurance for<br/>banks and financial institutions covering risks associated with NHSFO and<br/>political risk insurance of cross-border financing, ii) Investment insurance<br/>for corporates covering political risk insurance for equity investments and<br/>projects thus acting as a credit enhancement tool, and iii) Export credit and<br/>investment reinsurance for ECAs and insurers through a fronting exercise<br/>encompassing reinsurance and co-insurance.<br/>Furthermore, ICIEC has also pioneered a Sukuk Insurance Policy, a<br/>third-party guarantee for standard Sukuk issuance aimed especially at<br/>investment grade, sub-investment grade or unrated member states, with<br/>a focus on green Sukuk issuance projects related to renewables in power<br/>generation, food security and agri-business, climate related projects and value-added healthcare transformation programs such as the ICIEC's first<br/>public-private partnership (PPP) hospital project in 2015 - the Adana City<br/>Research and Training Hospital in Turkiye - a state-of-the-art facility with<br/>1,550 beds, which was spared any damage as a result of the devastating<br/>earthquake in southern Turkiye in February 2023 and where treatment was<br/>provided to thousands of patients who were injured in the earthquake that<br/>caused extensive damage in 11 cities. This is just one example of ICIEC's<br/>compelling success in delivering true development and life-enhancing<br/>impact investment outcomes in member states. On the commodities side,<br/>ICIEC played a key underwriting role in supporting the exports as well as<br/>imports of strategic commodities for member states.<br/>In essence, ICIEC's investment strategy and playbook are firmly embedded<br/>in its overall vision \u201cto be recognized as the preferred enabler of trade and<br/>investment for sustainable economic development in member states,\u201d in<br/>its mission \u201cto facilitate trade and investment between member states and<br/>the world through Shariah compliant risk mitigation tools,\u201d and through<br/>its mandate \u201cto promote cross-border trade and FDI in its member states.\u201d<br/>ICIEC also serves its mandate by providing alternative Shariah compliant<br/>risk mitigation and credit enhancement solutions to member states'<br/>exporters selling to buyers and to investors from across the world investing<br/>in member states. The corporation also supports international exporters<br/>selling to member states if the transactions are for capital goods or strategic<br/>commodities.<br/>In 2023, ICIEC's business insured (BI) reached US$13.3 billion, of which<br/>US$10.4 billion was for supporting exports and imports and US$2.9 billion<br/>for supporting FDI flows into member states. The major recipients were<br/>the energy sector with US$6,302 million, followed by manufacturing at<br/>US$3,340 million and services at US$2,086 million. The BI in infrastructure was only US$426 million, in healthcare US$287 million and in the agricultural sector US$67 million. BI by region was overwhelmingly in favor<br/>of Asia (including the MENA region) at US$6.2 billion, followed by subSaharan Africa (SSA) at US$3.91 billion, Europe at US$2.78 billion, the US at<br/>US$0.41 billion and Oceania at US$0.02 billion.<br/>A notable shift in 2023 for new commitments was from short-term<br/>insurance to investment insurance as the share of foreign investment<br/>insurance increased from 27% to 43%, while medium-term business<br/>declined from 13% to 8%, and short-term business decreased from 60% to<br/>49%. The significant growth in the combined medium-term and foreign<br/>investment insurance business indicates a strategic focus on more<br/>diversified and long-term investments.<br/>In terms of the three business lines in 2023, the short-term business insured<br/>increased by 7% to US$10 billion from US$9.4 billion, while the combined<br/>medium-term and foreign investment insurance business insured<br/>increased by 48% to US$3.3 billion from US$2.2 billion in the previous year.<br/>The top 10 recipients of ICIEC support in 2023 are demographically<br/>varied dominated by Turkiye, the UAE, Kazakhstan, Egypt, Algeria and<br/>Saudi Arabia. However, Senegal historically has been featured as a prime<br/>destination for ICIEC investment insurance cover for iconic impact projects<br/>with the unique ability to attract foreign private investment and project<br/>finance especially from global banking majors. Turkiye is also a major<br/>partner of ICIEC in this respect. In Turkiye, ICIEC was involved with its NHSFO Insurance Policy in the<br/>Yerkoy Kayseri High Speed Railway (HSR) project, allowing for a direct rail<br/>connection between Yerkoy and Kayseri, which will eventually connect<br/>Ankara and Kayseri with a travel time of only two hours by HSR where<br/>it is currently seven hours by conventional train. Turkiye embarked on<br/>a significant infrastructure development in 2023 with the HSR project,<br/>funded through a syndicated financing facility of U$D143.5 million, with<br/>MUFG Securities leading a syndication comprising six banks including<br/>MUFG itself, playing a pivotal role in the transaction.<br/>Another pathway for ICIEC in facilitating investment insurance is through<br/>collaboration with peer multilateral development institutions such as the<br/>African Development Bank (AfDB) Group. In a landmark collaboration<br/>between the AfDB Group and ICIEC, a strategic risk-sharing engagement<br/>was established to drive sustainable development in Cote d'Ivoire. ICIEC<br/>provided an insurance capacity of \u20ac194 million (US$212.86 million) in<br/>support of a \u20ac400 million (US$438.9 million) partial credit guarantee<br/>(PCG) issued by the AfDB. This PCG serves as protection against nonpayment risk associated with a EUR533 million (US$584,83 million facility extended by Standard Chartered Bank to the government of Cote d'Ivoire.<br/>The funds are dedicated to a diverse array of eligible environmental and<br/>social projects, aligning with Cote d'Ivoire's Sustainable Framework,<br/>encompassing areas such as renewable energy, education, pollution<br/>prevention, health infrastructure and water management.<br/>A crucial aspect of this collaboration is ICIEC's role in covering EUR184<br/>million (US$212.86 million) of the PCG, optimizing the AfDB's balance<br/>sheet and demonstrating a balanced risk-sharing approach. The bank<br/>retains a EUR206 million (US$226.03 million) stake (51.5%) in the PCG,<br/>emphasizing commitment to the project's success.<br/>The partnership enhances Cote d'Ivoire's capacity to attract long-term,<br/>competitive financing for ESG projects and highlights collaborative<br/>efforts among multilateral institutions to support common member<br/>countries' sustainable development aspirations. The transaction not only<br/>facilitates the realization of Cote d'Ivoire's National Development Plan<br/>but also improves the country's funding terms under challenging market<br/>conditions. It sets a precedent for future cooperation between ICIEC and<br/>the AfDB in common member states.<br/>In relation to the Abidjan access to clean water project, Marc Guigni,<br/>deputy CEO of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Cote d'Ivoire said, \u201cICIEC facilitated<br/>the implementation of credit at a very long maturity, which allows for<br/>smoothing repayments and reduction of the impact of debt service on<br/>the state budget. The choice of ICIEC for this project was natural and<br/>necessary for many reasons. One of them is that ICIEC was able to optimize<br/>the bank's balance sheet through its participation. Thus, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale<br/>de C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was able to participate with a much higher amount to<br/>finance this large-scale and strategic project for the state.\u201dThe ICIEC-Senegal infrastructure investment<br/>partnership<br/>The substantial infrastructure needs in Africa as elsewhere in the<br/>developing countries cannot be met unless there is a sizeable response<br/>from private sector financing. Attracting private sector investment is critical<br/>for SSA countries to make progress also towards achieving the SDGs.<br/>ICIEC has supported several landmark transactions and projects in<br/>Senegal in various sectors over the last few years through its risk mitigation<br/>and credit enhancement solutions and through its reinsurance capacity.<br/>These include the Abdoulaye Wade Stadium (the National Stadium), Dakar<br/>Expo Center, the Market of National Interest, the Dakar Truck Station. Since<br/>inception, ICIEC has supported Senegal to the tune of USD5 billion, or<br/>2.92% of its total operations.<br/>One of the iconic impact investment projects for which ICIEC provided<br/>NHSFO insurance to cover an EUR266 million (US$291.87 million)<br/>Murabahah facility extended by Standard Chartered Bank, AKA<br/>Ausfuhrkredit-Gesellschaft mbH, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale-Paris and Saudi National<br/>Bank, was the construction of Abdoulay Wade National Olympic Football<br/>Stadium.<br/>The stadium's financing model developed in the form of EPC+F<br/>(Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Financing), and based on<br/>close collaboration between public and private players, proved to be<br/>particularly innovative, according to The Public Infrastructure Management<br/>Company in the Urban Centers of Diamniado and Lac Rose. In fact, the<br/>financing model adopted for the Stadium offered more flexibility to the<br/>executing company on its choice of imports and sub-contracting.According to Selim Bora, chairman of Summa Group, Turkiye, the<br/>contractor that built the stadium \u201cThis ambitious project was also an EPC+F<br/>contract awarded in 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the<br/>world and everything stopped. Even during those months of lock- down<br/>we were able to communicate and continue our correspondence with<br/>ICIEC officials which in fact saved the project since a Standard Chartered<br/>Bank led consortium were to facilitate the credit for 100% financing<br/>provided that the political risk insurance was covered by ICIEC.\u201d<br/>Senegal embarked on an ambitious infrastructure project in November<br/>2023 involving the financing of the Dakar-Tivaouane Highway, including<br/>the construction of 37 bridges. With a total cost of EUR336 million<br/>(US$401.59 million) and a tenor of 12 years, the project represents a<br/>significant step in enhancing the country's infrastructure.<br/>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, managing the special purpose entity (SPE), sought<br/>the involvement of ICIEC, whose role was crucial, providing an NHSFO<br/>policy to cover the sovereign obligations of the government of Senegal.<br/>This coverage was pivotal for an Islamic financing facility amounting to<br/>EUR300 million (US$329.17 million) plus associated profit, as part of a<br/>larger EUR489 million (US$536.55 million) contract. The project is part of<br/>an overarching EUR1billion (US$1.1 billion) initiative, supported by the<br/>World Bank, AfDB, the Saudi Fund for Development and the Government<br/>of Senegal.<br/>Other projects of note in which ICIEC play ed similar crucial investment<br/>insurance roles to help mobilize long-term funding include: i) The new<br/>Blaise Diagne International Airport which is at the heart of Senegal's<br/>\u2018Emerging Senegal' Plan, ii) The CICAD Business Hotel, CICAD Expo<br/>Center and Diamniadio Multifunctional Sports Center (Dakar Arena) iii)<br/>The rehabilitation of a wastewater collector in Dakar, Senegal, iv) and the<br/>construction of the Dakar market of national interest and truck station.<br/>ICIEC's collaboration with Senegal was further cemented in 2023 with<br/>the signing of an MoU with APIX S.A, which is Senegal's main agency for<br/>attracting inward FDI and facilitating business creation and development,<br/>including that of SMEs. The agreement also facilitates joint efforts to<br/>promote Senegal as an FDI destination for ICIEC and IsDB Group member<br/>states.<br/>ICIEC also signed an MoU with the Sovereign Fund for Strategic<br/>Investments (FONSIS), the investment arm of the Government of Senegal.<br/>Under the agreement, ICIEC seeks to catalyze FDI flows into Senegal by<br/>promoting FONSIS among ICIEC member states and facilitating access to<br/>ICIEC's political risk insurance products and guarantees.<br/>The power of programs and partnerships<br/>It is no coincidence that the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 2030 Agenda culminates with Partnerships for the Goals. \u201cNever has there<br/>been a more critical time for strengthening cross-sectoral partnerships and<br/>securing the next 10 years of collaboration for sustainable development,\u201d<br/>says the global body, urging much greater investment in empowering<br/>solutions in attempting to achieve the other 16 goals, whose sheer scope<br/>and challenges are matched by their urgency and complexity.<br/>Estimates from the IMF/World Bank, OECD and UN put the cost of<br/>achieving the SDGs at US$3.9 trillion annually over the next 10 years.<br/>Sustainable development projects cannot be achieved by governments<br/>alone. The pressure on national budgets and scarce resources due to<br/>the impact of the pandemic and the global economic and geopoliticalICIEC's insurance policies, whether the policyholder is a financial<br/>institution, specialized company or contractor, that covers political and<br/>commercial risks, can contribute to the flow of climate action and food<br/>security related investments, specialized technology and equipment or<br/>services into member states. These projects help reduce electricity imports,<br/>lessening dependency on fossil fuels, creating jobs, supporting the local<br/>economy via local procurement of services and equipment, fostering<br/>technology transfer, empowering local people with new knowledge about<br/>renewable energy and improving local infrastructure via road construction<br/>and improvements in transmission lines and electricity distribution.<br/>PPPs, such as the Adana City Hospital Project, have emerged as a critical<br/>tool for mobilizing the necessary resources and expertise to finance<br/>infrastructure and development projects in OIC countries. PPPs involve<br/>collaboration between public and private sector entities to achieve a<br/>common goal. PPPs can help to mobilize private sector investment,<br/>expertise and innovation to support the development of infrastructure and<br/>technologies.<br/>Private sector engagement requires credit enhancement, which insurers<br/>such as ICIEC are uniquely positioned to do through their sustainabilitypolicies and access to their member country's national and subnational<br/>bodies, which engage with relevant climate action and food security<br/>projects and transactions. Indeed, private sector development is one of<br/>the main pillars of ICIEC's strategy. Embedding commercial opportunities<br/>and helping corporates and banks make a material difference to support<br/>positive development project outcomes is something that risk mitigation<br/>tools can facilitate.<br/>Innovative finance solutions and partnerships are ideal to mitigate rising<br/>project and investment costs. ICIEC has been at the forefront of several<br/>initiatives over the last few years. They include:<br/>i) The Arab Africa Guarantee Fund (AAGF), which was initiated by<br/>ICIEC under the Arab-Africa Trade Bridges Programme (AATB), of<br/>which the corporation is the insurance pillar. The AATB has been<br/>instrumental in fostering partnerships and enhancing trade and investment flows between Arab and African regions, to which ICIEC<br/>has already contributed USD25 billion. The AAGF aims to provide<br/>a scalable structure that aims at mobilizing financial resources and<br/>risk mitigation capacity to support trade and investment in Arab and<br/>African countries and ensuring that all-in pricing of transactions is<br/>optimized for the end beneficiaries through blended structures. The<br/>fund encompasses three sub-funds: the Arab Africa Green Facility,<br/>the Arab Africa Food Security Facility and the Arab Africa Health<br/>Facility.<br/>ii) The Africa Co-Guarantee Platform was established by ICIEC, AfDB,<br/>the African Trade and Investment Development Insurance (ATIDI),<br/>the multilateral African ECA, AUDA-NEPAD, and GuarantCo, part<br/>of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) which is<br/>supported by the governments of the UK, Switzerland, Sweden,<br/>Netherlands and Australia. It was set up in response to the<br/>growing need for de-risking instruments in Africa, with the focus<br/>on infrastructure development, intra-regional trade, addressing<br/>the food and fertilizer crises and enhancing coverage for various<br/>investments. Its mandate is to support trade and investment<br/>projects, to find proactive risk mitigation solutions which will help<br/>projects reach financial close by making them bankable especially<br/>relating to PPP projects, building capacity and in supporting<br/>African sovereigns respond to macro-economic challenges that<br/>may arise (e.g. food security, future pandemics, periods of extreme<br/>weather resulting from climate change, better debt management,<br/>balance sheet optimization for DFIs and commercial banks.) The<br/>CGP crucially has two in-built innovation components - a \u2018financial<br/>products incubation' pillar and a transaction-based longer-term r isk<br/>mitigation capacity building pillar. There are currently 26 projects in<br/>the CGP pipeline, with total project costs of over USD6 billion. These<br/>projects are currently seeking an estimated USD2.3 billion in risk<br/>mitigation.<br/>ICIEC leverages its already extensive network of relationships with<br/>multilaterals, regional agencies, industry bodies, ECAs and private<br/>insurance companies including the MIG, the Berne Union, the AMAN<br/>Union and DHAMAN. In August 2024, for instance, ICIEC signed its<br/>latest landmark MoU with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation<br/>(JBIC) to enhance cooperation and support the development of trade<br/>and investment flows between ICIEC's member states and Japan by<br/>leveraging ICIEC's insurance services and JBIC's financial facilities. The<br/>partnership will facilitate transactions involving Japanese companies<br/>as exporters, EPC contractors or investors in projects that promote<br/>the development of ICIEC's member states, with a particular focus on<br/>Central Asia. ICIEC's involvement in intra-OIC trade and investment is commendable -<br/>facilitating US$51 billion in intra-OIC trade and investment since inception.<br/>The latest data for FY2023 shows that there is much room for improvement<br/>despite the various barriers to boost such facilitation.<br/>Intra-OIC trade and investment has the potential to be a game-changing<br/>facilitator to lead the OIC economies into recovery from the impacts of<br/>the post-pandemic era, the subdued global economic recovery and the<br/>vagaries of geopolitical tensions and their impacts on commodities price<br/>volatility, sovereign indebtedness, a global cost of living crisis and acting<br/>as a break on reaching the SDGs and Paris Net Zero targets - all of which<br/>affect developing countries including the IsDB ones disproportionately.<br/>The OIC countries, which represent a sizeable portion of the global<br/>economy, are not immune to these global headwinds. Economic growth<br/>within the OIC, according to IMF data, is projected to follow a moderating<br/>trend, with estimates pointing to a growth rate of 5.6% in 2022, tapering to<br/>3.5% in 2023 and 3.9% in 2024.<br/>Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia's outward FDI stock, according to the<br/>UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2023, rose significantly from<br/>US$151.5 billion in 2021 to US$167.5 billion in 2022. Saudi investments within ICIEC member states are strategically placed across the Middle East,<br/>Africa and Asia. According to the Annual Report on Investment Climate and<br/>Opportunities in OIC Countries, 2022, Saudi Arabia holds the third-largest<br/>share of intra-OIC inward FDI stocks, in core investment markets including<br/>Egypt, Bahrain, the UAE, Turkiye, Pakistan and Jordan. The OIC has set a<br/>target of achieving 25% intra-Islamic trade and investment by 2025. The<br/>Kingdom is in pole position to demonstrate its role as a key investor in<br/>boosting ties with the OIC states towards achieving the 25% target.<br/>Potential of ICIEC's Sukuk insurance policy in<br/>facilitating investment<br/>Sukuk, being asset-backed or based, are particularly well-suited for raising<br/>capital for projects and other developmental initiatives. The challenge<br/>many member states have faced in issuing Sukuk is their credit rating.<br/>Given that many member states do not have an investment grade credit<br/>rating, access to the capital market on favorable terms has become<br/>challenging. The role of ICIEC is implicit. While covering non-payment<br/>risk, ICIEC, with its credit rating of \u2018Aa3' by Moody's and \u2018AA-' by S&amp;P, may<br/>provide a boost to the Sukuk issuance of most of its member states.<br/>ICIEC has over the years developed the ICIEC Sukuk Insurance Policy<br/>(SIP) to help member states to mobilize resources from international<br/>capital markets, to realize their developmental projects consistent with<br/>their declared developmental objectives, the SDGs, or other ESG factors.<br/>Some countries, especially those with credit ratings equal to or better than<br/>ICIEC's credit rating, may not need ICIEC's support to mobilize financial<br/>resources.<br/>However, the ICIEC's SIP will be very useful for member states rated below<br/>ICIEC's credit rating. It will not only assist member states rated lower than<br/>\u2018Aa3' to access the international capital markets, but it is also expecte to<br/>reduce their borrowing costs.<br/>The policy is in line with ICIEC's mandate to facilitate the flow of<br/>investments and project finance to its member states. As such, the<br/>corporation took the initiative to launch this innovative insurance product,<br/>which is the first of its kind in the market. It is the only Shariah-based Takaful<br/>product used as a credit enhancement in the Islamic capital and finance<br/>market and provided by a multilateral institution having long experience in<br/>the credit and political insurance industry.The SIP is aimed at helping member states, especially those who have<br/>difficulties to access international capital markets with reasonable cost, to<br/>raise Shariah compliant resources to finance developmental projects. SIP<br/>is a credit enhancement and third-party guarantee aimed at promoting<br/>sovereign domestic issuances by member states especially those rated<br/>below investment grade and consequently attract less private capital for<br/>sustainable development projects. The SIP would allow issuers to attract<br/>capital for green projects better including for food security.<br/>Future prospects for ICIEC investment facilitation and<br/>insurance<br/>Last year saw a growing interest in diversifying sources of liquidity, with<br/>both investment-grade and sub-investment grade borrowers in many OIC<br/>countries increasingly turning to ECA finance. This trend underscores<br/>the evolving trust in ECA-backed financial instruments. This trend is set<br/>to increase in 2024 and beyond reflecting the rise in capital projects and<br/>infrastructure, especially related to sustainable and ESG finance linked to<br/>climate-related, food security and clean energy transition projects. The<br/>post-pandemic era ushered in a wave of capital expenditure across various<br/>industries. This surge is not just a sign of economic recovery but also a<br/>testament to the mounting pressures on traditional capital sources for<br/>borrowers.<br/>For ICIEC, this trend signifies an expanded clientele base and an<br/>opportunity to further its mission. By offering tailored financial solutions<br/>that cater to this diversifying borrower landscape, ICIEC can solidify its<br/>reputation as a versatile and reliable financial partner for its member states<br/>well into the near- and medium-future.<br/>The challenge lies in navigating these amplified demands, but the<br/>opportunity is in positioning itself as the go-to entity for its member s r states of<br/>ECA-supported financing during these transformative times. ICIEC's<br/>foresight and agility in this space will determine its influence on shaping<br/>the economic and development trajectories of its member nations.</p>", "publisher": "Islamic Finance News Supplements", "instances": ["Dr Al Jasser, who is also chairman of ICIEC's board of directors,observed: \u201cThe journey of ICIEC is deeply intert twined with the visionand mission of IsDB.

enhanced support for digital transformation. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is also a strong push for initiatives to address inflation, improve market access for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and promote financial inclusion for low-income households. </p><p>South-East Asia Lead of the Global Labor Organisation and economist Prof Niaz Asadullah said Malaysia needs a fiscal system that promotes innovation in advanced sectors while supporting businesses and households at the lower end of the economic spectrum. </p><p>He said strategic fiscal measures, beyond ongoing tax and subsidy rationalisation efforts, can strengthen the economy's resilience to external shocks and support job creation by raising funds, targeting them effectively and reducing fiscal wastage. </p><p>\"Taxation efficiency must be improved to diversify revenue sources and reduce reliance on oil-related income through new taxes. </p><p>\"This could include the introduction of carbon taxes, reconsideration of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), or the implementation of other forms of progressive taxation,\" he told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR). </p><p>He added that budget allocations should be increased for green infrastructure, renewable energy (RE) and digital transformation, in line with the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR). </p><p>He noted that such sustainable investments can drive growth while positioning Malaysia for long-term resilience. </p><p>Niaz also suggested increasing budget allocations for the B40 group and the economy. </p><p>\"For SMEs and micro-SMEs (MSMEs), this means expanding financial support through grants, loans and incentives, while B40 households will benefit from enhanced social protection via cash transfers and targeted subsidies. </p><p>\"The government should focus on targeted fiscal stimulus for vulnerable sectors or low-income groups, rather than broad-based measures, to protect the purchasing power of B40 groups without overstimulating overall demand,\" he said. </p><p>He opined that fiscal initiatives that boost productivity in key sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, should be prioritised. </p><p>Additionally, Niaz suggested that the government should focus on spending for productivity-enhancing projects like infrastructure, education and skills training that yield long-term benefits, avoiding short-term cash injections that could risk overheating the economy. </p><p>\"Effective monetary-fiscal coordination is also crucial, with fiscal measures needing to align with Bank Negara Malaysia's policies to stimulate domestic consumption without driving excessive inflation,\" he said. </p><p>Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd Chief Economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said social protection, promoting private investment and enhancing productivity are the primary focuses for the upcoming budget. </p><p>He said maintaining financial discipline is equally important, as the government aims to reduce fiscal deficits to below 4% of GDP. </p><p>\"This will require measures to rationalise expenditures and improve revenue collection,\" he told TMR. </p><p>He said ensuring that qualified individuals receive financial aid, avoiding wastage and combating corruption are critical considerations for the government. </p><p>\"It is essential that every cent of expenditure and revenue collected is accounted for and all spending should generate desirable multiplier effects that benefit all citizens,\" he added. </p><p>RHB Banking Group Acting Group Chief Economist Barnabas Gan said the banking industry expects a balanced and strategic budget that addresses immediate economic needs while laying a strong foundation for future growth. </p><p>Key priorities include investments in critical infrastructure projects, particularly in transportation, utilities and digital infrastructure, which are essential for enhancing regional connectivity and stimulating economic activity across sectors. </p><p>\"These

Its impacts are now felt in the streets of Kuala Lumpur and in the homes of everyday Malaysians. With a recent Unicef analysis highlighting a fourfold increase in heatwaves and the devastating floods of 2021 and 2022 still fresh in memory, it is clear that Malaysia is at a critical juncture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The public is eager to confront this existential crisis, but a significant question remains: Can we afford it?</p><p>This question goes beyond financial concerns and touches on the structural barriers that hinder our collective action. The obstacles to sustainable living - whether financial, infrastructural, or attitudinal - risk undermining the will of the Rakyat (the people) to take meaningful steps forward.</p><p>A recent study focusing on climate literacy in Central Malaysia paints a revealing portrait of this struggle. The survey, whose respondents majorly consisted of youths aged 15 to 24, found that 68 per cent reported strong engagement in energy conservation practices, while 51 per cent demonstrated often recycling habits, reflecting a promising commitment to environmentally friendly habits. However, this willingness often collides with systemic barriers, making it difficult for these efforts to translate into large-scale change.</p><p>At the heart of the issue is the ongoing tug-of-war between convenience and climate action.</p><p>The dichotomy is evident in the behaviours of the younger generation; around 51 per cent of respondents aged 15 to 24 regularly use public transport. This is largely due to its cost-effectiveness and accessibility. However, gaps in coverage and inefficiencies limit its potential as a comprehensive solution. Similarly, many young people are reducing their energy consumption at home-an encouraging sign of eco-consciousness. But are these actions driven by genuine environmental concern, or are they primarily a response to rising electricity costs?</p><p>When it comes to more significant lifestyle changes, such as reducing plastic consumption or choosing eco-friendly products, cost and convenience still play decisive roles. Sustainable options often come with higher price tags or are harder to find, which can discourage even the most committed individuals. This underscores the gap between good intentions and real action.</p><p>That said, the solution is not simply about individual willpower. It is about creating a system where sustainable living becomes the easier, more affordable choice for all Malaysians.</p><p>Sustainability, unfortunately, often comes with a price tag that is unaffordable to many. The idea of \"going green\" is frequently associated with buying organic, reducing plastic use, or adopting renewable energy-all commendable, but often out of reach for the average person. This financial burden extends beyond individual consumption. Many Malaysians are already under pressure to meet basic living standards, making it difficult to prioritise sustainable choices without substantial support.</p><p>Here, the role of the government becomes crucial. As living costs rise, achieving widespread adoption of green practices requires thoughtful financial support. By introducing subsidies, tax incentives, and rebates for eco-friendly products and renewable energy, the government</p><p>can make sustainability more accessible to a wider population. These policy tools can empower Malaysians to make greener choices without feeling the pinch in their wallets.</p><p>Malaysia has already demonstrated its commitment to addressing climate change through international agreements and targets. The country has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, a significant step toward mitigating its environmental impact. Additionally, as a member of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Malaysia is part of a global effort to tackle climate change. These commitments lay the foundation for more ambitious domestic policies and actions.</p><p>The government's efforts should not stop at encouraging individual responsibility; they must also create conditions where sustainable living is the default. This requires a multifaceted approach; from stricter regulations on high-polluting industries to investing in green infrastructure. These steps would ensure that sustainable choices are not just available but also convenient and affordable for all.</p><p>While individual actions are vital in tackling climate change, they must be complemented by broader systemic shifts. The power of individual behaviours, when multiplied, can create a ripple effect, but lasting impact requires governments, industries, and communities working in harmony.</p><p>In this context, it is important to recognize that sustainability cannot simply be a consumer choice; it must become a societal norm. The current model, which places the burden on individuals while allowing industries to continue with \"business as usual,\" is not just unsustainable - it is profoundly unjust. The time has come for a shift in perspective, where systemic change is seen not as a luxury but as a necessity.</p><p>Malaysia needs bold and decisive action, not just from individuals but also from the government and industries. Policies that make green living the default choice - such as subsidies for eco-friendly products, stricter regulations on corporate polluters, and robust investments in infrastructure - are key steps toward building a more sustainable future.</p><p>Moreover, a cultural shift is necessary in how we view sustainability. The responsibility of addressing climate change should not disproportionately fall on individuals, particularly those already struggling financially. Corporations and industries, as the wealthiest and most influential players, have a greater obligation to lead the charge toward sustainability.</p><p>As Malaysia confronts the realities of climate change, it is imperative that we shift the narrative away from individual action as the sole remedy for environmental degradation. The rakyat are ready to do their part, but systemic support is essential for real progress. It is time for the government and industries to take responsibility, ensuring that sustainable living is both accessible and affordable.</p><p>Half-measures are no longer enough. What Malaysia needs now is bold, decisive action - action that connects individual behaviours, corporate responsibility, and government policies into a cohesive, collective effort. The rakyat are ready. Now, it is time for the system to catch up.</p><p>* Athirah Azlan and Dr Suzana Ariff Azizan are from the Department of Science and Technology Studies, Faculty of Science, Universiti Malaya.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

It will be completed in 2027, the same time as Alora Residences.</p><p>Avenue25 will have a transport hub component that is inspired by One Ayala in Makati, the Philippines, says Aw. One Ayala is developed by Avaland\u00e2  s parent company Ayala Land.</p><p>\u00e2  We were inspired by One Ayala, which is a much larger-scale development and has a complete bus hub. We have plans to learn from One Ayala and later construct a bus hub in Avenue25, as we want it to be equipped with public transport.\u00e2 </p><p>One Ayala, located in the Makati Central Business District, is a 2.8ha mixed-use development with retail, hotel and office components as well as a 20,000 sq m, three-storey transport hub for northbound and southbound buses, the future Bus Rapid Transit system and jeepneys. The transport hub also offers direct connection to the MRT (Metro Rail Transit) system.</p><p>Aw says the improved infrastructure and good connectivity around Avenue25 can lead to economic growth in the area. \u00e2  It is located near Puchong, Bandar Sunway and the Elite Highway.\u00e2 </p><p>Aw and Tanco believe that along with its retail component, which will offer a total of 100,000 sq ft of net lettable space to cater for locals and tourists alike, Avenue25 can help boost the local economy.</p><p>\u00e2  We want to [position Avenue25] with the three C\u00e2  s: connectivity, convenience and community,\u00e2  says Tanco.</p><p>Green spaces and sustainable features</p><p>Aw and Tanco highlight that the project\u00e2  s green features will make it sustainable and easy to maintain. In fact, the developer is aiming for all of its components to be GreenRE Gold certified.</p><p>Some of the sustainable elements, they explain, are based on the sponge city urban planning model, where the development will have an abundance of trees, parks and green infrastructure to absorb, store and utilise Malaysia\u00e2  s abundant rainfall in an eco-friendly manner that will also prevent floods.</p><p>\u00e2  Around 30% of outdoor floor materials will be constructed with porous materials. So all the rainwater can return naturally to the ground. There won\u00e2  t be extensive concrete surfaces. Also, we are going to plant about a thousand trees, which is equivalent to 17 tonnes of CO absorption every year,\u00e2  Aw explains, adding that about 70% of the trees will be easy-to-maintain native species.</p><p>There will also be a rainwater harvesting system that will be able to cover 90% of the irrigation requirements, he says. Eco-friendly water fittings will be used to help save water.</p><p>Another aspect of sustainability that will be incorporated into the development is resource efficiency to ensure low energy consumption. This will be achieved, according to Tanco and Aw, with passive cooling measures where 60% of indoor spaces will be naturally ventilated, using low thermal conductivity wall material, a low window-to-wall ratio and tinted glass.</p><p>These efforts will contribute to a residential envelope thermal transmittance value, which is a measure of heat entering a building, of 19.75 W/sq m, lower than the benchmark of 22 W/sq m, Aw points out.</p><p>\u00e2  We also have six acres of green [spaces] in the development, be it on the podium or ground [levels] of the entire Avenue25,\u00e2  he adds. \u00e2  Also, 50% of the outdoor area will be covered with landscaping and 80% of our common area will be naturally lit during the day, resulting in 37% of electricity savings per year.</p><p>\u00e2  And with careful selection of fittings and rainwater harvesting system investment, we will save 61% of water every year. Last but not least, 89% of the common area is naturally ventilated. So when a place is naturally ventilated and lit up, we can bring the energy consumption down. So in short, in Avenue25, a lot of focus has been to bring the energy cost down.\u00e2 </p><p>To ensure that the buildings within the master development will qualify for GreenRE Gold certification, Avaland has produced a handbook that sets the sustainability targets for all parties involved in the building and construction of Avenue25.</p><p>Despite the high initial cost of building sustainably, Tanco says there will be long-term savings in terms of lower energy consumption and maintenance of the buildings. Careful and mindful planning, he adds, has also helped ensure that the offerings are priced competitively and are suitable for the target market.</p><p>\u00e2  The target market for Avenue25 is the mid- to high-end market and new families living in this area.\u00e2 </p><p>Aw, meanwhile, says: \u00e2  All this effort has direct benefits [for the residents], be it visually or energy wise.

In response, the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) has taken proactive measures by identifying 175 high-risk trees, most of which are over 50 years old, and cutting down 147 of them. Regular inspections by certified arborists have identified 28 additional high-risk trees slated for removal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban trees are essential to urban planning, providing environmental, social, economic, psychological, and educational benefits. They improve air quality, support biodiversity, manage water resources, regulate temperatures, sequester carbon, and enhance community well-being. Trees also add aesthetic value, promote recreation, foster social cohesion, lead to energy savings, boost property values, and contribute to psychological well-being, fostering a deep connection to nature, especially for children.</p><p>Given these multifaceted benefits, municipal landscape departments must ensure proper growth and structural development, including identifying and replacing unhealthy trees when needed. Landscape architects and designers face critical tasks like addressing site availability, soil conditions, species selection, growth requirements, and maintenance to integrate street trees effectively. Despite these challenges, urban trees play a vital role in climate change adaptation by reducing temperatures by up to 8 degC, mitigating urban heat islands, and managing stormwater, crucial for preventing urban flooding during heavy rainfall events.</p><p>In response to these challenges, DBKL is enhancing its Shade Tree Management Plan and preparing new guidelines for managing old and high-risk trees, expected to be completed by July. However, there is a need for a broader enhancement of the National Plan, shifting from mere mitigation to comprehensive adaptation strategies. Globally, cities are developing innovative solutions for climate adaptation, including Paris, France; Medellin, Colombia; and Wuhan, China. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are at the forefront of globally recommended strategies. In 2020, Penang's nature-based approach to tackling climate change, led by Think City and the Penang Island City Council, won the Climathon Global Awards for the best climate project by a global city that year. This initiative has paved the way for further studies on climate-resilient urban tree species in Malaysia, and the execution of the Penang Nature-based Climate Adaptation Programme has since been launched.</p><p>Exploratory research by Think City indicated that urban tree species in Malaysia are already being affected by climate change. Understanding the resilience of different tree species to various climate impacts is critical for species selection. This study emphasised the necessity of selecting climate-resilient tree species, considering factors like habitat specialisation, saltwater intrusion, inundation tolerance, high-temperature tolerance, storm tolerance, water absence tolerance, humidity requirements, and susceptibility to predation, parasitism, and disease. Choosing the right tree for the right location is vital to ensure their longevity and functionality in urban environments, focusing on appropriate landscape typologies like urban streets, small green spaces, blue-green corridors, and seafronts.</p><p>Expanding knowledge about resilient tree species for urban planting is crucial for better-informed urban forest management decisions. Collaboration among arborists, botanists, landscape architects, urban planners, and the National Landscape Department is crucial. The government should allocate sufficient funding to enhance the effectiveness of existing tree planting campaigns, promoting more efficient tree planting and maintenance efforts. Implementing protective measures during early years, such as adequately sized tree pits with high-quality soil, root barriers, and permeable pavements, and requiring a two-year maintenance period for newly planted trees by developers or responsible parties, will contribute to a more resilient and adaptive urban forestry strategy in Malaysia, ensuring the sustainability and safety of urban environments amidst climate change challenges.</p><p>Addressing the surge of tree falls in Malaysia amidst rising climate challenges requires a comprehensive approach that balances historical preservation, environmental benefits, climate adaptation, and public safety. The proactive measures undertaken by DBKL, including the identification and removal of high-risk trees, are immediate steps. However, as climate change continues to exacerbate extreme weather conditions, a more comprehensive and national adaptive strategy is required. NbS offers a promising pathway for urban resilience. By learning from global examples and investing in local research, Malaysia can promote climate-resilient tree species through collaboration among arborists, botanists, landscape architects, and government bodies.</p><p>Ultimately, the future of Malaysia's urban landscapes hinges on our ability to adapt and innovate in the face of climate change. By prioritising both ecological sustainability and public safety, Malaysia can protect its green infrastructure, preserve its cultural heritage, and ensure the well-being of its urban populations. This holistic approach will not only reduce the risks of tree falls but also enhance the liveability and resilience of Malaysian cities for generations to come.</p><p>* Hamdan Abdul Majeed is the managing director of Think City</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

The previously unreported testimony will come at a hearing before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee titled \"The Business Case for Climate Solutions\" and will also include testimony from PG&amp;E Corp Senior Vice President Laurie Giammona, the company confirmed. The California-based electric utility has dedicated over US$400 million in programs helping customers transition to EVs. </p><p>Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat who chairs the panel, said in an interview that a massive infrastructure bill will create millions of new jobs and reduce carbon emissions and said he expects to have a bill through his committee in May. \"We're trying to make the business case - everybody else is going to go electric - you don't have to believe in climate change,\" DeFazio said. Last week, FedEx said it planned to become carbon-neutral by 2040 and will invest US$2 billion in vehicle electrification, sustainable energy, and carbon sequestration. FedEx also said its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet will be zero-emission electric vehicles by 2040. Amazon.com Inc in 2019 pledged to make the largest U.S. e-commerce company net carbon-neutral by 2040 and also to buy tens of thousands of electric delivery vans. A number of automakers and start-up companies are working to develop electric-vehicle pickups and larger delivery vehicles. Lawmakers will look at private-sector actions addressing climate change, with a focus on surface transportation, aides said. A FedEx spokeswoman declined to comment on Smith's testimony. DeFazio met with Democratic President Joe Biden and House lawmakers last week. Biden made the business case for electric vehicles, or EVs, at the meeting, DeFazio said, and raised General Motors Co's goal of ending production of gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035. \"(Biden) talked about the Chinese eating our lunch, the Chinese want to dominate the electric auto market,\" DeFazio said. Biden told lawmakers \"We can't let that happen,\" DeFazio added. Democrats want to boost electric buses, see thousands of new charging stations installed and want to facilitate the large electric trucks coming to market. DeFazio backed legislation this week to give the U.S. Postal Service US$6 billion to make its next generation of delivery vehicles nearly all EVs. DeFazio says adopting a vehicle miles-traveled fee to pay for infrastructure before a Sept. 30 highway funding deadline is not realistic. He said a gasoline tax hike could still be part of paying for infrastructure improvements. He said his \"tentative timeline\" is to have an infrastructure bill approved by his committee in May. \"It is going to be green and it is going to be big,\" he said.

Asia accounted for merely 28 per cent of global gross domestic product even as geopolitical and regional issues were becoming increasingly important to the world, but Asia was not yet seen as an engine of global growth, governance, and cooperation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three decades later, much has changed as the engines of the global economy shift Eastward. Asia now accounts for more than 35 per cent of the world's GDP and has contributed more to growth than any other region over the past decade. Asia's erstwhile regional issues are now primary global concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unprecedented challenges confront the WTO and globalisation as once steadfast ideals of multilateralism and cooperation are swept away by the rising tide of protectionism and closed alliances. Trade, investment, and the sharing of technologies have now been increasingly weaponised by world powers as they compete with each other \u00e2\u20ac\u201d largely to the detriment of developing countries.</p><p>Even as much has changed, some constants remain, such as the centrality of global economic challenges and the ever-looming spectre of uncertainty. Deep-seated anxieties that reach far into the borders and social fabric of nations continue to fester while economic disparities, rapid technological change, and environmental degradation persist to muddy our collective future.</p><p>Yet, we are confronted with novel challenges more formidable than ever before. Rapid technological change and Artificial Intelligence technologies, hold the promise of immense and unfathomable societal benefits but may well be a Faustian bargain raising the spectre of widening digital, social, and economic divides. That may be in the realm of alarmist conjecture but this much is clear: An increase in armed conflict and geopolitical tensions is already undermining international cooperation, diluting global commitments to peace, human rights, and international law.</p><p>Nevertheless, these seemingly insurmountable challenges enjoin us to seek and forge a renewed vision of Asian leadership. Indeed, as the vagaries of the world grow increasingly turbulent, and the crosswinds of economic and geopolitical shifts threaten to veer us off course, Asia would do well to steady our sails and right our ship. Unlike three decades ago, today, Asia now possesses the economic weight, the strategic capacity, and the collaborative might to navigate these challenges.</p><p>In fact, in recent years Asia has demonstrated the positive outcomes that can be achieved through connectivity, integration and cooperation, such as mega-regional trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive Partnership for Trans-Pacific Partnership. RCEP alone involves nearly a third of the world's exports, population, and GDP \u00e2\u20ac\u201d making it the largest trade bloc in the world. Meanwhile, progress with the Asean Economic Community has continued apace enabling Southeast Asian economies to deepen their economic integration, contributing to the region's role as a dynamic and open hub of economic activity.</p><p>As Malaysia prepares to assume the chairmanship of Asean next year, we are committed to continue championing these ideals. On the economic front, our focus will firstly be on strengthening economic cooperation among Asean member states.

Allow me to extend my appreciation to Nikkei, for the honour of addressing such an august gathering of captains of industry, thought leaders, and policymakers. I am truly delighted to be able to share some of my thoughts here on today\u20ac\u2122s theme of \u20ac\u0153Asian Leadership in an Uncertain World\u20ac.</p><p>2. Looking back at the inaugural Nikkei Future of Asia Conference nearly three decades ago, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had just been established, marking an era where the foundations of globalisation, multilateralism, and freer international trade seemed unshakable. Asia accounted for merely 28 per cent\u00a0of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) even as geopolitical and regional issues were becoming increasingly important to the world, but Asia was not yet seen as an engine of global growth, governance, and cooperation.</p><p>3. Three decades later, much has changed as the engines of the global economy shift Eastward. Asia now accounts for more than 35 per cent\u00a0of the world\u20ac\u2122s GDP and has contributed more to growth than any other region over the past decade. Asia\u20ac\u2122s erstwhile regional issues are now primary global concerns.</p><p>4. Unprecedented challenges confront the WTO and globalisation as once steadfast ideals of multilateralism and cooperation are swept away by the rising tide of protectionism and closed alliances. Trade, investment, and the sharing of technologies have now been increasingly weaponised by world powers as they compete with each other \u20ac\u201c largely to the detriment of developing countries.</p><p>5. Even as much has changed, some constants remain, such as the centrality of global economic challenges and the ever-looming spectre of uncertainty. Deep-seated anxieties that reach far into the borders and social fabric of nations continue to fester while economic disparities, rapid technological change, and environmental degradation persist to muddy our collective future.</p><p>6. Yet, we are confronted with novel challenges more formidable than ever before. Rapid technological change and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, hold the promise of immense and unfathomable societal benefits but may well be a Faustian bargain raising the spectre of widening digital, social, and economic divides. That may be in the realm of alarmist conjecture but this much is clear: An increase in armed conflict and geopolitical tensions is already undermining international cooperation, diluting global commitments to peace, human rights, and international law.</p><p>7. Nevertheless, these seemingly insurmountable challenges enjoin us to seek and forge a renewed vision of Asian leadership. Indeed, as the vagaries of the world grow increasingly turbulent, and the crosswinds of economic and geopolitical shifts threaten to veer us off course, Asia would do well to steady our sails and right our ship. Unlike three decades ago, today, Asia now possesses the economic weight, the strategic capacity, and the collaborative might needed to navigate these challenges.</p><p>8. In fact, in recent years Asia has already demonstrated the positive outcomes that can be achieved through connectivity, integration and cooperation, such as mega-regional trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive Partnership for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). RCEP alone involves nearly a third of the world\u20ac\u2122s exports, population, and GDP \u20ac\u201c making it the largest trade bloc in the world. Meanwhile, progress with the ASEAN Economic Community has continued apace enabling Southeast Asian economies to deepen their economic integration, contributing to the region\u20ac\u2122s role as a dynamic and open hub of economic activity.</p><p>9. As Malaysia prepares to assume the chairmanship of ASEAN next year, we are committed to continue championing these ideals. On the economic front, our focus will firstly be on strengthening economic cooperation among ASEAN member states. Recent diversification of global supply chains and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows must create tangible benefits for development while reducing disparities within ASEAN countries. Secondly, we aim to enhance our economic cooperation with our partners from across the globe on advancing technological collaboration and sustainable trade practices.</p><p>10. It has become increasingly self-evident that economic policymaking in the 2020s and beyond cannot be divorced from careful consideration of circumstances around three global megatrends: geopolitics, digitalisation and climate change. Hence, Malaysia has recently unveiled three key policy frameworks to provide greater certainty, clarity and transparency on the future of the economy.</p><p>11. The first is the Madani Economy framework, which outlines strategies to drive sustainable and inclusive development. At the core is the importance of not just raising the ceiling for real GDP growth in the range of 5.5-6 per cent\u00a0per annum, but also raising the floor to ensure the fruits of prosperity are shared equitably among all Malaysians.</p><p>12. The Madani Economy framework aligns closely with (Japan\u20ac\u2122s) Prime Minister (Fumio) Kishida-san\u20ac\u2122s New Form of Capitalism policy, underscoring the deep connection and shared aspirations between our countries.</p><p>13. The second major policy that Malaysia has introduced is the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 which represents a whole-of-government approach to industrial policy. We have hit the ground running by convening stakeholders from the public and private sectors to chart the way forward for specific strategic sectors, such as semiconductors and steel. The successful implementation of this plan will allow us to stand on the shoulders of giants in this region and bring us closer to achieving high-income status by the end of this decade.</p><p>14. Finally, the National Energy Transition Roadmap is Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s comprehensive strategy to ensure the country meets its commitment to achieving net zero emissions as early as 2050. This warrants that we operationalise initiatives in energy efficiency, renewable energy, hydrogen, green infrastructure and carbon capture, utilisation and storage to build Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s climate resilience.</p><p>15. These strategic blueprints are indicative of Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s role in building Asian leadership in the economic, digital and sustainability domains. Indeed, uncertainty abroad has only solidified our resolve to be forward-looking and proactive for the sake of domestic policy certainty and creating a prosperous future for all. Ultimately, ASEAN and its partners hold a collective responsibility to keep our region dynamic, stable and adaptable, and Malaysia supports these efforts wholeheartedly.</p><p>16. Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s vibrant semiconductor industry fortifies our role as a reliable regional partner in manufacturing, trade, and innovation. Malaysia has a robust and mature manufacturing base, especially in the global electronics and electrical industry, being the world\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest exporter of semiconductors.

I dare say that Malaysia fits the bill, thanks to our stability, skilled labour force, and our economic and geopolitical nonalignment. The proof is in the numbers: in 2023, the state of Penang \u20ac\u201c Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s semiconductor hub \u20ac\u201c attracted US$13 billion in FDI, exceeding the total for the previous seven years combined.</p><p>18. We are setting our sights on the future through an increasing strategic focus on front-end activities, such as wafer fabrication, the design of integrated circuits and advanced packaging.</p><p>19. Truth be told, this could not have been achieved without Japan and our other partners in the region. Etched in our memory is the humble beginnings in Penang during the 1970s, when companies, such as Clarion and Hitachi, were part of the \u20ac\u0153Eight Samurai\u20ac \u20ac\u201c that is the first wave of electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) manufacturing investment into the country. Active Japanese FDI has been a crucial factor in the success of Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s semiconductor industry, and this is true even today, with recent large-scale investments coming in from Kaga Electronics and Ferrotec.</p><p>20. Meanwhile, Malaysia is continuing to build its capabilities in other sectors in line with our economic complexity trajectory into chemicals, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, the digital economy, electric vehicles, advanced materials and agro-based industries.</p><p>21. Further, as the world\u20ac\u2122s foremost Islamic finance hub and centre for halal trade, Malaysia has consolidated its position as the top Islamic economy for the ninth consecutive year, serving, significantly, as a bridge between East Asia and the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>22. Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s openness to trade and investment in manufacturing, services and the primary sector alike is reflected in its FDI performance last year, during which the country successfully attracted RM188 billion in approved foreign investments, a 15 per cent\u00a0increase compared to 2022.</p><p>23. Last year, Prime Minister Kishida and I had two summit meetings in November and December, culminating in the upgrading of our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We also expanded our cooperation into the realm of security, collaborating in the maritime security sphere. All in all, Japan and Malaysia share a common vision for Asia\u20ac\u2122s future based on stability, connectivity and cooperation in support of a rules-based order, and I am confident that our relations will only grow from strength to strength from now on.</p><p>24. In reflecting about the state of the region and the world, I am drawn to a quote from Okakura Kakuz\u00c5\u20ac\u2122s &lt;em&gt;The Book of Tea&lt;/em&gt;: \u20ac\u0153The art of life lies in a constant readjustment to our surroundings\u20ac.</p><p>25. According to certain reliable accounts, Kakuz\u00c5's concept of das-in-der-Welt-sein (being-in-theworldness) as expressed in this phenomenal book, published in 1906, had actually inspired Martin Heidegger\u20ac\u2122s magnum opus \u20ac\u201c &lt;em&gt;Sein und Zeit&lt;/em&gt; (Being and Time), which was published only in 1927. Considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century, Heidegger, of course, has never mentioned or attributed this huge intellectual debt.</p><p>26. Indeed, I digress but the point about Kakuz\u00c5's quote here is that, the art of leadership and governance demands that we adapt to the shifting dynamics of global economic, political, social, and cultural forces of our time.</p><p>27. Towards this end, Malaysia will remain dedicated to fostering shared growth, bolstering regional cooperation, and maintaining our openness to trade, development and commerce.</p><p>28. To our fellow Asian nations, I extend a hand of solidarity, a pledge of support, and an open invitation for collaboration.

Allow me to extend my appreciation to Nikkei, for the honour of addressing such an august gathering of captains of industry, thought leaders, and policymakers. I am truly delighted to be able to share some of my thoughts here on today\u20ac\u2122s theme of \u20ac\u0153Asian Leadership in an Uncertain World\u20ac.</p><p>2. Looking back at the inaugural Nikkei Future of Asia Conference nearly three decades ago, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) had just been established, marking an era where the foundations of globalisation, multilateralism, and freer international trade seemed unshakable. Asia accounted for merely 28 per cent\u00a0of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) even as geopolitical and regional issues were becoming increasingly important to the world, but Asia was not yet seen as an engine of global growth, governance, and cooperation.</p><p>3. Three decades later, much has changed as the engines of the global economy shift Eastward. Asia now accounts for more than 35 per cent\u00a0of the world\u20ac\u2122s GDP and has contributed more to growth than any other region over the past decade. Asia\u20ac\u2122s erstwhile regional issues are now primary global concerns.</p><p>4. Unprecedented challenges confront the WTO and globalisation as once steadfast ideals of multilateralism and cooperation are swept away by the rising tide of protectionism and closed alliances. Trade, investment, and the sharing of technologies have now been increasingly weaponised by world powers as they compete with each other \u20ac\u201c largely to the detriment of developing countries.</p><p>5. Even as much has changed, some constants remain, such as the centrality of global economic challenges and the ever-looming spectre of uncertainty. Deep-seated anxieties that reach far into the borders and social fabric of nations continue to fester while economic disparities, rapid technological change, and environmental degradation persist to muddy our collective future.</p><p>6. Yet, we are confronted with novel challenges more formidable than ever before. Rapid technological change and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, hold the promise of immense and unfathomable societal benefits but may well be a Faustian bargain raising the spectre of widening digital, social, and economic divides. That may be in the realm of alarmist conjecture but this much is clear: An increase in armed conflict and geopolitical tensions is already undermining international cooperation, diluting global commitments to peace, human rights, and international law.</p><p>7. Nevertheless, these seemingly insurmountable challenges enjoin us to seek and forge a renewed vision of Asian leadership. Indeed, as the vagaries of the world grow increasingly turbulent, and the crosswinds of economic and geopolitical shifts threaten to veer us off course, Asia would do well to steady our sails and right our ship. Unlike three decades ago, today, Asia now possesses the economic weight, the strategic capacity, and the collaborative might needed to navigate these challenges.</p><p>8. In fact, in recent years Asia has already demonstrated the positive outcomes that can be achieved through connectivity, integration and cooperation, such as mega-regional trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive Partnership for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). RCEP alone involves nearly a third of the world\u20ac\u2122s exports, population, and GDP \u20ac\u201c making it the largest trade bloc in the world. Meanwhile, progress with the ASEAN Economic Community has continued apace enabling Southeast Asian economies to deepen their economic integration, contributing to the region\u20ac\u2122s role as a dynamic and open hub of economic activity.</p><p>9. As Malaysia prepares to assume the chairmanship of ASEAN next year, we are committed to continue championing these ideals. On the economic front, our focus will firstly be on strengthening economic cooperation among ASEAN member states. Recent diversification of global supply chains and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows must create tangible benefits for development while reducing disparities within ASEAN countries. Secondly, we aim to enhance our economic cooperation with our partners from across the globe on advancing technological collaboration and sustainable trade practices.</p><p>10. It has become increasingly self-evident that economic policymaking in the 2020s and beyond cannot be divorced from careful consideration of circumstances around three global megatrends: geopolitics, digitalisation and climate change. Hence, Malaysia has recently unveiled three key policy frameworks to provide greater certainty, clarity and transparency on the future of the economy.</p><p>11. The first is the Madani Economy framework, which outlines strategies to drive sustainable and inclusive development. At the core is the importance of not just raising the ceiling for real GDP growth in the range of 5.5-6 per cent\u00a0per annum, but also raising the floor to ensure the fruits of prosperity are shared equitably among all Malaysians.</p><p>12. The Madani Economy framework aligns closely with (Japan\u20ac\u2122s) Prime Minister (Fumio) Kishida-san\u20ac\u2122s New Form of Capitalism policy, underscoring the deep connection and shared aspirations between our countries.</p><p>13. The second major policy that Malaysia has introduced is the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 which represents a whole-of-government approach to industrial policy. We have hit the ground running by convening stakeholders from the public and private sectors to chart the way forward for specific strategic sectors, such as semiconductors and steel. The successful implementation of this plan will allow us to stand on the shoulders of giants in this region and bring us closer to achieving high-income status by the end of this decade.</p><p>14. Finally, the National Energy Transition Roadmap is Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s comprehensive strategy to ensure the country meets its commitment to achieving net zero emissions as early as 2050. This warrants that we operationalise initiatives in energy efficiency, renewable energy, hydrogen, green infrastructure and carbon capture, utilisation and storage to build Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s climate resilience.</p><p>15. These strategic blueprints are indicative of Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s role in building Asian leadership in the economic, digital and sustainability domains. Indeed, uncertainty abroad has only solidified our resolve to be forward-looking and proactive for the sake of domestic policy certainty and creating a prosperous future for all. Ultimately, ASEAN and its partners hold a collective responsibility to keep our region dynamic, stable and adaptable, and Malaysia supports these efforts wholeheartedly.</p><p>16. Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s vibrant semiconductor industry fortifies our role as a reliable regional partner in manufacturing, trade, and innovation. Malaysia has a robust and mature manufacturing base, especially in the global electronics and electrical industry, being the world\u20ac\u2122s sixth-largest exporter of semiconductors. As tensions are brewing elsewhere, especially with the imposition of trade restrictions getting more intense in microchips, investors across the world are looking for a safe haven.</p><p>17. I dare say that Malaysia fits the bill, thanks to our stability, skilled labour force, and our economic and geopolitical nonalignment. The proof is in the numbers: in 2023, the state of Penang \u20ac\u201c Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s semiconductor hub \u20ac\u201c attracted US$13 billion in FDI, exceeding the total for the previous seven years combined.</p><p>18. We are setting our sights on the future through an increasing strategic focus on front-end activities, such as wafer fabrication, the design of integrated circuits and advanced packaging.</p><p>19. Truth be told, this could not have been achieved without Japan and our other partners in the region. Etched in our memory is the humble beginnings in Penang during the 1970s, when companies, such as Clarion and Hitachi, were part of the \u20ac\u0153Eight Samurai\u20ac \u20ac\u201c that is the first wave of electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) manufacturing investment into the country. Active Japanese FDI has been a crucial factor in the success of Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s semiconductor industry, and this is true even today, with recent large-scale investments coming in from Kaga Electronics and Ferrotec.</p><p>20. Meanwhile, Malaysia is continuing to build its capabilities in other sectors in line with our economic complexity trajectory into chemicals, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, the digital economy, electric vehicles, advanced materials and agro-based industries.</p><p>21. Further, as the world\u20ac\u2122s foremost Islamic finance hub and centre for halal trade, Malaysia has consolidated its position as the top Islamic economy for the ninth consecutive year, serving, significantly, as a bridge between East Asia and the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>22. Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s openness to trade and investment in manufacturing, services and the primary sector alike is reflected in its FDI performance last year, during which the country successfully attracted RM188 billion in approved foreign investments, a 15 per cent\u00a0increase compared to 2022.</p><p>23. Last year, Prime Minister Kishida and I had two summit meetings in November and December, culminating in the upgrading of our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. We also expanded our cooperation into the realm of security, collaborating in the maritime security sphere. All in all, Japan and Malaysia share a common vision for Asia\u20ac\u2122s future based on stability, connectivity and cooperation in support of a rules-based order, and I am confident that our relations will only grow from strength to strength from now on.</p><p>24. In reflecting about the state of the region and the world, I am drawn to a quote from Okakura Kakuz\u00c5\u20ac\u2122s &lt;em&gt;The Book of Tea&lt;/em&gt;: \u20ac\u0153The art of life lies in a constant readjustment to our surroundings\u20ac.</p><p>25. According to certain reliable accounts, Kakuz\u00c5's concept of das-in-der-Welt-sein (being-in-theworldness) as expressed in this phenomenal book, published in 1906, had actually inspired Martin Heidegger\u20ac\u2122s magnum opus \u20ac\u201c &lt;em&gt;Sein und Zeit&lt;/em&gt; (Being and Time), which was published only in 1927. Considered to be among the most important and influential philosophers of the 20th century, Heidegger, of course, has never mentioned or attributed this huge intellectual debt.</p><p>26. Indeed, I digress but the point about Kakuz\u00c5's quote here is that, the art of leadership and governance demands that we adapt to the shifting dynamics of global economic, political, social, and cultural forces of our time.</p><p>27. Towards this end, Malaysia will remain dedicated to fostering shared growth, bolstering regional cooperation, and maintaining our openness to trade, development and commerce.</p><p>28. To our fellow Asian nations, I extend a hand of solidarity, a pledge of support, and an open invitation for collaboration. We must stand together, allowing neither external force nor insidious competition to pull us away from the larger goal, and that is nothing less than a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Asia.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>TAGS: Anwar Ibrahim, Nikkei Conference on the Future of Asia, Speech text, Economy, Globalisation</p>", "publisher": "Malaysia General News", "instances": ["14.

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 16) that the Government will issue green bonds on select public infrastructure projects, with up to S$19 billion of public sector green projects already identified. \"Sustainability efforts require capital. Green finances will be an important enabler,\" said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister. \"The issuance of green bonds by the Government will build on these efforts by deepening market liquidity for green bonds, attracting green issuers, capital, and investors, and anchoring Singapore as a green finance hub.\" </p><p>A green bond is a type of financial instrument designed to have environmental or climate-related benefits. They allow companies to integrate their sustainability strategies with their capital structure, analysts told CNA. Investors are also looking for more transparency in sustainable and green practices from companies they invest in and may avoid investments in non-green projects, which would impact such companies over time, said OCBC's head of debt capital markets Kenneth Yeoh. READ: Demand for green bonds expected to continue despite COVID-19 setback SPURRING PRIVATE SECTOR INTO ACTION \"There is no doubt that there is increasing interest amongst Singapore businesses in green bonds; the sector has been evolving rapidly though, with investors increasingly focused in this area,\" said Mr Sean Henderson, co-head of debt capital markets Asia Pacific at HSBC. \"We believe the Singapore Government's leadership on green bond issuance will benefit private businesses, spurring them into action,\" he added. This is because sovereign issuers are \"generally best in practice\", and will pave the way for both private issuers and investors to become well-acquainted with green financing practices, he said. Bonds issued by the Government will also encourage the development of the external reviewer market, requiring reviewing agencies to invest in expertise and grow in size. This will in turn drive down the cost and increase access for private companies to review their potential green projects, said Mr Henderson. In his Budget speech, Mr Heng said the Government's issuance of green bonds for selected public sector projects will serve as a reference for the Singapore dollar corporate green bond market, including the standards and framework applied, as well as the yields achieved. Following his statement, OCBC's Mr Yeoh said that the \"significant public sector support\" displayed by the Government is also expected to accelerate the adoption of green bond frameworks and standards, and make green bond issuances more mainstream. \"The increase in sustainability-related language used within bond documentation can help set the new industry standard, and ease companies into issuing more green bonds where possible by increasing market liquidity and consequently driving investor demand,\" he said. READ: Budget 2021: Government to issue green bonds to help enable sustainability efforts DBS global head of fixed income Clifford Lee added that the issuance of such bonds by the Singapore Government is \"well-placed\" to meet growing demand from local and international investors. \"This paves the way for a steady supply of green bonds to be issued out of Singapore, generating more secondary market activity, deepening and broadening our capital markets,\" he added. In terms of pricing, the Government-issued green infrastructure bonds are expected to be priced at a premium over Singapore Government Securities bonds, due to their novelty in the market, said Mr Lee. GREEN PROJECTS ACROSS SECTORS During his Budget speech, Mr Heng said that one of the green projects to be financed with green bonds is Tuas Nexus. The project will be Singapore's first integrated waste and water treatment facility and is set to be completed in phases from 2025. In the private sector, City Developments Limited in April 2017 issued a green bond to raise S$100 million, in what it said was the first such issuance by a Singapore company. The proceeds raised were allocated towards various initiatives to enhance energy and water efficiency at Republic Plaza. \"CDL issued the green bond amidst increased interest in responsible investment and a growing demand for relevant products,\" said a company spokesman in response to CNA queries. \"CDL's inaugural green bond which was also the first by a Singapore company, links our sustainability initiatives with the capital markets and enables us to tap on investors who are supportive of the commitment that CDL has made towards sustainability best practices.\" The National University of Singapore (NUS) issued its inaugural green bond in May last year, raising S$300 million. The funds were used to build the new SDE4 building, the first net-zero energy building in Singapore to be built from scratch. The building is among the first recipients for the Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) award, and is equipped with a hybrid cooling system and rooftop solar panels. \"The green bond helps to open up access to green financing, which is increasingly relevant and critical as lenders become more conscious about sustainability,\" said Mr Tan Kian Woo, the university's senior vice president and chief financial officer. READ: MAS debuts grant scheme to support green and sustainability-linked loans Companies in Singapore have shown increasing interest in issuing green bonds, said the analysts, adding that they are confident in the importance of this market. According to the ASEAN Green Finance Report, the issuance of green bonds across ASEAN almost doubled from US$4.1 billion in 2018 to US$7.8 billion in 2019. In 2019, Singapore contributed to 55 per cent of the ASEAN green debt issuance, up from 29 per cent in 2018, the same report showed. OCBC has seen an increase in the number of enquiries regarding the issuance of green and sustainability-linked bonds since 2019, and expects to see more Singapore companies issuing green bonds, said Mr Yeoh. There were three Singapore dollar green bond issuances in 2020 - two by Ascendas REIT and one by NUS - totalling S$700 million, he added. OCBC supported both of the green bonds issued by Ascendas REIT last year. It was the sold lead manager, bookrunner and green finance advisor for Ascendas REIT's S$100 million 10-year notes and S$300 million subordinated perpetual securities in August and September. DBS' Mr Lee said the bank underwrote S$5.3 billion worth of green bonds in 2020, an increase of about 30 per cent from the previous year. The proceeds raised were for projects across the renewable energy, green building development, clean transportation and wastewater treatment sectors across the region.

But following the launch of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, statutory boards, as well as companies from the transport, waste and water management sectors are expected to also become predominant users of green finance, said Mr Henderson. The Singaporean market for green bonds is \"at an exciting stage\" and there is demand from investors as well as government and private issuers, said Dr David Broadstock, a senior research fellow and lead energy economist at the NUS Energy Studies Institute. \"Yet placing the optimism aside, Singapore's existing market for green bonds is young, with considerable room for growth,\" he added. Adding that Singapore is in the middle of a \"truly exceptional\" period of economic activity, he said that Singapore will ultimately be defined by its resilience towards growing green finance in the face of economic adversity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The recognition by the DPM within the Budget speech is that Singapore is wanting to pursue a sustainable economic growth recovery as it emerges from the global pandemic which defined 2020, is testament alone that green bonds are a non-ignorable component of the menu of financial instruments available in Singapore, now and moving forward,\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["READ: Budget 2021: Government to issue green bonds to help enable sustainability efforts DBS global head of fixed income Clifford Lee added that the issuance of such bonds by the Singapore Government is \"well-placed\" to meet growing demand from local and international investors. \"This paves the way for a steady supply of green bonds to be issued out of Singapore, generating more secondary market activity, deepening and broadening our capital markets,\" he added.

INVESTMENTS ARE RISING, BUT SO ARE COSTS</p><p>First, the good news. By positioning themselves as neutral parties with growing middle classes and lower labour costs, Southeast Asian economies have disproportionately benefitted as companies relocate their China investments amid growing US-China tensions. The region attracted a record US$222.5 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2022 in a post-pandemic bump.</p><p>This trend continued in 2023, with the US unveiling billions of dollars in investments into Vietnam shortly after upgrading their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, including a US$1.6 billion chip factory by Amkor.</p><p>China, meanwhile, invested heavily in Southeast Asia's electric vehicle (EV) sector. Carmaker BYD is building a plant in Thailand and Geely announced a US$10 billion investment to develop Malaysia's Automotive High-Tech Valley in Perak.</p><p>If only US-China competition was all about who could invest the most into the region. Their rivalry has other serious implications.</p><p>Observers should be wary of Washington's embrace of industrial policy, or government efforts to support strategic industries by eschewing free market policies for interventionism. Even as the Inflation Reduction Act pumps over US$369 billion into the US clean energy sector, other countries might launch their own industrial policies with an arsenal of subsidies to remain competitive.</p><p>In a worst-case scenario, FDI might be drawn away from the region and towards markets with better subsidies. Washington's focus on friend-shoring, or relocating supply chains to friendly countries to address security concerns, is also likely to result in higher costs and real output losses for third countries. A working paper by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development even found that friend-shoring could cost up to 4.6 per cent of global gross domestic product.</p><p>Separately, Beijing's willingness to weaponise its dominance of the rare earth market in bilateral disputes, as Japan experienced in 2010, poses uncomfortable questions for other countries. Rare earth elements are critical for the development of green infrastructure such as photovoltaic panels, EV engines and wind turbines.</p><p>Global demand for these minerals is expected to surge by 400 per cent to 600 per cent in the next several decades. Any shortage would have knock-on effects on the price of these fixtures, making green transitions more expensive.</p><p>POLITICAL RISKS</p><p>As US-China tensions deepen, security concerns can make it difficult for firms to do business.</p><p>Beijing recently displayed suspicion of US carmaker Ford's agreement with Chinese battery maker CATL over fears that Ford may access sensitive battery technology. Washington, too, has been preoccupied with removing China-linked suppliers from its supply chains, even at the expense of US climate goals. A case in point is the 2022 US Commerce Department investigation into eight solar panel companies in Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia) accused of skirting US tariffs on Chinese-sourced materials.</p><p>That the US is heavily reliant on these four countries for photovoltaic panels - accounting for about 75 per cent on imports in 2021 - was not enough to defend against bipartisan determination to crack down on \"unfair\" Chinese trade practices.</p><p>Not only did the Commerce Department find the exporters guilty of skirting tariffs, but the US Congress voted to reinstate tariffs of up to 254 per cent on solar panels from Southeast Asia. President Joe Biden vetoed this legislative bid, but his waiver on retroactive tariffs only extends until June 2024.</p><p>In effect, Southeast Asian firms are caught between a rock and a hard place. They might be forced to choose between Chinese expertise and the lucrative US market, limiting their ability to grow and support their home country's green transition.</p><p>NAVIGATING ROUGH WATERS, WITH HELP</p><p>The costs of a failed green transition are especially stark for Southeast Asia. One model by Deloitte predicted that the region could lose US$28 trillion over the next 50 years in losses from tourism, services and manufacturing if its carbon emissions are not addressed.</p><p>While these challenges are steep, they are not insurmountable. There is still room to leverage the competition between the two superpowers to support the region's green transition. The Just Energy Transition Partnerships signed with Indonesia and Vietnam, for example, are Western initiatives that respectively pledge US$20 billion and US$15 billion to decarbonise the energy mix of the two countries.</p><p>Meanwhile, even as China's Belt and Road Initiative slows, its focus on Southeast Asia will likely remain to counter US influence. Regional governments should take the opportunity to request projects that best suit their climate needs.</p><p>Southeast Asian governments should also cast a wide net for climate partners. The recently announced Japan-led Asia Zero Emission Community, for example, included an announcement that Japan would fund US$135 billion over the next 10 years to support climate policies. There are mechanisms from Europe, such as the US$2.5 billion European Climate Foundation's Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility, that are aimed at catalysing public investments as well.</p><p>Even with a challenging road ahead, Southeast Asia should continue doing what it does best: Navigating a course between feuding superpowers to fuel its own development.</p><p>Kevin Chen is an Associate Research Fellow with the US Programme at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

However, the predominantly outdoor workforce of Singapore could only seek shelter under trees or bear the brunt of the heat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">High temperatures are not unusual in Singapore, with the inter-monsoon months of April and May usually the warmest. But the recent spell of hot weather, coupled with a new report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that global temperatures are likely to surge to record levels in the next five years, have sparked concern.</p><p>The cause of high air temperatures can be attributed to the ongoing El Nino Southern Oscillation event. In the case of 2023, it is the warmer phase of El Nino that could bring about potential heatwaves to Singapore. This, coupled with the relatively drier months outside both monsoon seasons, could have contributed to the past week of warm weather. HEAT AND THE CITY</p><p>Singapore has heated up notably since the mid-1970s when rapid urbanisation took place. According to the Meteorological ServiceSingapore, the island is warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world, at 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade.</p><p>As a city, Singapore faces the twin effects of enhanced global warming and the urban heat island effect.</p><p>In the specific case of Ang Mo Kio last week - where the 37 degrees Celsius temperature matched the 40-year record set in Tengah on Apr 17, 1983 - a factor contributing to the high temperature could be the additional energy released from vehicles and construction, which alters the urban environment by directly increasing the air temperature or indirectly influencing other parameters like surface temperature.</p><p>Where trees are cut and the ground is exposed to solar radiation, the cooling effect provided by Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park would reduce.</p><p>Additionally, more buildings and increased urbanisation efforts such as construction have caused more heat to be generated and retained in the city, ultimately leading to a surface energy imbalance, which means that more heat is stored than what can be dissipated naturally.</p><p>Coupled with slower traffic increasing exhaust heat contributions due to fewer vehicle lanes or makeshift roadside barricades, it was not entirely surprising that the estate experienced the sweltering temperatures.</p><p>As Singapore continues with its urbanisation plans, it is important to note that this can have more of an impact on warming than climate change.</p><p>Projections based off 2015 conditions from a recent local study show that already developed urban areas like Tai Seng would face less of a temperature increase than rapidly urbanising estates like Khatib (almost 0.8 degrees Celsius) or Ang Mo Kio (just below 0.5 degrees Celsius).</p><p>With both current conditions and future projections indicating a rise in temperatures across Singapore, there is no time to waste to implement solutions to mitigate urban heat. WHAT CAN BE DONE?</p><p>At the individual level, while the typical short-term solution is to blast the air-con, the excess heat from vents further contribute to the problem. Instead, consider using fans or having the air-conditioning unit turned on only for short periods of time.</p><p>Additionally, commuters can help to reduce waste heat generated from vehicles by using public transport to get to work. By reducing the number of cars on the road and subsequently easing traffic conditions, there would be less man-made heat.</p><p>For occupants in existing buildings that cannot be changed, exceptions can be made for dress codes to be less formal where possible, as seen from Henry Park Primary School's relaxed uniform guidelines.</p><p>Considering urban planning, green spaces such as forests and parks as well as blue spaces such as lakes and rivers should be preserved, and where possible, increased in size and number.</p><p>Large parks have been proven to bring about cooling effects at a macro level, and tree shading for pedestrians can lower air temperatures at the microscale.</p><p>Results from another study conducted on neighbourhood parks in Singapore reveal that having continuous shading over truncated segments can help ease temperatures.</p><p>Additionally, having extended unshaded pathways adjacent to shaded areas can result in microscale hotspots - suggesting that tree planting and park management decisions should account for foliage overlap to maximise shade provision. Outside of parks, more can be done - on new buildings. This can range from mangrove restoration to implementing green roofs and walls that reduce bare concrete surface exposure to incoming radiation.</p><p>While green roofs and walls cannot be substitutes for actual forest patches, they can help by cooling the building's exterior, which results in less heat conducted to the interior.</p><p>Moreover, these plants utilise heat to transpire, which further lowers the building temperature. Buildings can also be designed to feature a more open concept to maximise air flow while retaining ceiling shade (for example, The Star Vista shopping mall), thereby reducing the need for building-wide air conditioning systems.</p><p>Ultimately, the combination of implementing green infrastructure and nature-based solutions alongside lifestyle adjustments can double up as protection from urban heat island effects and help tackle urban heat island.</p><p>By cutting down less or strategically planting more trees, implementing smart urban design in newer buildings, choosing to take the train or bus instead of personal vehicles, we can make a concerted effect in reducing the amount of heat produced and subsequently stored within the city, thereby leaving us better prepared for potential heatwave events.</p><p>Aikeen Lim is a Postdoctoral candidate at Nanyang Technological University's Asian School of the Environment.

We were sharing our insights, and I think Malaysia is comparable with the foreign markets, as far as sustainability is concerned,\u00e2  says Koe, adding that the event was held to celebrate British East and Southeast Asian communities in the UK.</p><p>Formerly S P Setia Bhd\u00e2  s deputy president and chief operating officer, Koe had been instrumental in placing green initiatives and directions for the townships of Setia Alam, Setia Eco Templer, Setia Eco Glades, and several developments under the group. He has also been a long-time advocate of sustainability and green initiatives.</p><p>\u00e2  I brought back seeds [of plants such as Cleome, Mexican sunflower and so on] from the UK, Portugal and even Japan, and have cultivated them here at my home \u00e2 \u00a6 We are blessed with our tropical weather and should really embrace the natural surroundings and terrains here,\u00e2  says Koe, as he shares his passion for biodiversity and botany in the comfort of his home in Setia Alam.</p><p>Koe and his family take us on a brief tour of their verdant garden and backyard, which are filled with butterflies, bees and birds. This environment, he says, exemplifies \u00e2  what a sustainable township should be. It is multifaceted; sustainability is not just about offering the right, green infrastructure \u00e2 \u00a6 it also boils down to other aspects such as feature usability, connectivity, and it encompasses a lifestyle.\u00e2 </p><p>Sustainable must-haves</p><p>Koe gives an overview of the sustainability elements in the developments as they evolved. \u00e2  When we started the journey at Setia Alam about two decades ago, it was out of genuine interest. At that time, we used to call it \u00e2  ecologically designed\u00e2  , and we labelled it as such (without employing consultants).</p><p>\u00e2  There are four stages in implementing sustainable efforts. It first stems from the personal level, followed by corporate, industry and community levels. I was lucky to have overseen a few developments that wound up becoming award-winning for their sustainability \u00e2 \u00a6 It is a matter of learning and observing its impacts, and managing it in developments,\u00e2  he shares.</p><p>Koe believes that forests, waterways and natural terrains should be kept in their original form, and developments should be approached and built to co-exist with them. A good example of this would be the township of Setia Eco Templer, which has been named the Best Planning Project under the Malaysian Institute of Planners. \u00e2  The key is to maintain its topography. Engineering should be able to provide the right solutions to build upon the topography.\u00e2 </p><p>He shares his experience in building Setia Eco Glades. \u00e2  It has unique features and we have learnt how to capitalise on them without destroying nature, and transplanted about 1,500 trees (which was the biggest transplanting operation in the world). Subsequently, in 2007, we fitted solar panels. Today, Setia Eco Park produces the highest solar energy (about 2MW) in Malaysia.\u00e2 </p><p>He asserts the importance of sustainability for the future generation. \u00e2  This needs to be done for generations to come \u00e2 \u00a6 these facilities [such as the solar panels] would have to transcend time. It should be an environment where the young and old can co-exist. The older generation should be able to live with sustainable, assisted living features as well.</p><p>\u00e2  Sustainability should be attainable for the masses [be it medium-cost housing or high-end ones] and should be spread to the entire society through our education. The priority should be the concept over the cost,\u00e2  says Koe. \u00e2  It is a necessity, especially with the effects of global warming, flooding and so on, [and] it is imperative that sustainable features be included in all developments. We are running out of time.\u00e2 </p><p>It is also about placing and integrating all the features in one place, remarks Koe. \u00e2  The sustainable features at home and the workplace should be nearby for residents; hence, it\u00e2  s crucial to look at creating more job opportunities surrounding the townships. Transport should also be enhanced to ensure better connectivity \u00e2 \u00a6 When everything is in one place, one township, the lifestyles of the residents would immensely improve and, hence, be more sustainable.\u00e2 </p><p>Integrated lifestyle, and the way forward</p><p>Delving further into the subject, Koe maintains that certain sustainability compliances should be augmented and improved. \u00e2  In terms of waste segregation, it should be a standard practice in all developments.\u00e2 </p><p>At the corporate level, the infrastructure can be put in place but the attitude of maintaining its environment must come from the end-users, he asserts. \u00e2  Perhaps the government and the authorities can step in, mitigate and place more initiatives and offer incentives for builders and residents. To this day, it is not a practice at the municipal levels.\u00e2 </p><p>In terms of cost, sustainable features should ideally make up between 5% and 10% of the total cost, says Koe. \u00e2  It is a matter of changing the mindset [of all stakeholders] in the long term.\u00e2 </p><p>He opines, \u00e2  The government should run more sustainability-themed programmes, and put more emphasis on the values that are derived from green energy, which is the way forward.
