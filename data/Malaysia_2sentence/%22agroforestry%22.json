The fruit's moniker is earned by its reddish brown, scaly and slightly spiky skin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inside, the edible white pulp is crunchy, tangy, sweet and slightly acidic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The island's largest salak orchards cover nearly 1,500ha across the villages of Sibetan and Jungutan. Together, they make up the Sibetan customary village.</p><p>Cultivating the fruit requires the support of shade plants and rainwater collection areas. So, the agroforestry system combines other crops in a five-strata system.</p><p>The resulting landscape plays an important role in absorbing carbon, reducing run-off and increasing groundwater filtration.</p><p>It also serves as a crucial water catchment area for rice fields stretching some 1,000ha in surrounding villages.</p><p>The comprehensive system is the first in Indonesia to be recognised on the list of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \"People have been practising (this system) to sustain their livelihoods. At the same time, they are working together to also conserve biodiversity and protect nature,\" said Rajendra Aryal, an FAO representative for Indonesia and Timor-Leste.</p><p>\"They are also maintaining their rich cultural heritage in the way of life, which has passed from generation to generation.\"</p><p>Historical records trace the planting of the first salak palm in the 14th century to Jero Dukuh Sakti, a revered traditional healer and priest. Today, local communities continue to honour his legacy.</p><p>Traditional village customs and laws known as awig-awig also function as a guideline to practice the deeply ingrained Balinese philosophy of Tri Hita Karana - harmony and balance with God, others and nature.</p><p>\"Salak ... is a legacy from the past that is carefully preserved because it is a vital source of livelihood for the community,\" said I Made Mastiawan, secretary of the Sibetan customary village. There are at least a dozen varieties of salak and each is unique.</p><p>I Nengah Karsa Winaya, treasurer of the Dukuh Lestari Farmer Group, grows many of them in his orchards.</p><p>He soaks the seeds before planting them in polybags. After around six months, when leaves start to grow, they are transplanted to the orchards.</p><p>\"If the soil is good, it takes about four years but if the soil quality is poor, it may take up to five years to bear fruit,\" he said.</p><p>The most expensive variant in Bali is the salak gula pasir - or the sugar salak, \u200bnicknamed the primadonna. Like its name, the variety is known for its exceptional sweetness.</p><p>BEATING SEASONAL LOW PRICES</p><p>The salak has been a pride of the land for centuries, and is an essential source of income for many on the island.</p><p>However, its abundance during the main harvest seasons of January to March and August to September, leads to low prices.</p><p>Many have been forced to innovate so their crop is profitable beyond peak ripeness and availability. Agrotourism entrepreneur I Nyoman Mastra Kongking, for instance, produces and sells tea, coffee, wine and vinegar made from the fruit.</p><p>\"Very ripe salak can be processed into a product with a longer shelf life (that) can be consumed well after the season has ended. We want to ensure all salak are useful and profitable for the future,\" he told CNA.</p><p>Another local, Ni Wayan Srinik, owns a business pickling salak. Up to 16 tonnes of the fruit is processed after harvest at her processing facility, before being shipped off to Jakarta to be sold.</p><p>Wayan has been running the business with her husband for 30 years, but they only began brining the fruit in the past decade. The preservation method has not only cut down on fruit wastage but ramped up company profits by between 5 and 10 per cent.</p><p>\"Before we started brining the salak ... only the large fruits were sent to Jakarta. The smaller ones were discarded. Now that we brine the fruit, we can process all sizes,\" she said, explaining that small fruits used to be thrown out due to quality control.</p><p>Her business also provides opportunities for women in the neighbourhood to earn an income.</p><p>Putu Rustini, a neighbour, is among those recruited to peel the fruits before they are brined. She can peel up to 200kg a day, earning over US$10.</p><p>Farmers are hoping authorities would do more to ensure the price stability of the fresh fruit.</p><p>\"Hopefully, the government and other relevant parties can help facilitate this matter to ensure a better future for salak production,\" said I Wayan Wastika, head of Jungutan village. NOT A WELL-KNOWN FRUIT</p><p>Despite innovations and recent recognition from the FAO, the push to boost the competitiveness of the Balinese snake fruit has yet to transcend local borders.</p><p>Microbrewery Islands of Imagination, for instance, which uses salak as an ingredient to craft one of its beers, has been trying to increase the sale of the brew to foreigners.</p><p>Its brewery is surrounded by salak plantations in Sibetan, and it is the first beermaker in Indonesia that uses locally-sourced ingredients.</p><p>\"The sales percentage is still not that high because those from other countries are not familiar yet with salak,\" said I Komang Alit Winarsa, the brewery's supervisor. Authorities said that budget constraints, manpower shortage and a lack of awareness are slowing progress.</p><p>\"At the central level, the challenge after cultivation is marketing,\" said I Wayan Sunada, head of Bali's agriculture and food security agency.</p><p>\"From the economic, ecological, social and cultural perspectives, salak has a very high value and this is what we need to protect.\"</p><p>PROTECTING LEGACY</p><p>The island's authorities are making efforts to preserve the salak heritage for the future.</p><p>Schools in Sibetan customary village teach students how to plant snake fruit as part of a modified agriculture curriculum. I Made Berata, a teacher at the SD Negeri 5 Sibetan primary school, said he hopes the lessons will motivate students to become farmers.</p><p>\"(The curriculum) is an extra component so that the children will be proud of salak,\" he said. \"The majority of us here are salak farmers and we hope the younger generation will continue this practice and not be ashamed of being farmers.\"</p><p>Entrepreneur I Ketut Latra said making farming smarter and more profitable can entice young farmers to get onboard.</p><p>\"Providing superior seeds and good farming and cultivation methods that are in accordance with the standard operating procedures will guarantee their welfare and they can continue to be salak farmers,\" he said. He has been propagating snake fruit plants for over 20 years, cultivating variants that sell well in the market - like the primadonna sugar variant.</p><p>He sold 15,000 of the variant's seedlings last year, with each certified seedling fetching more than US$1.50.</p><p>Authorities said they are taking the necessary measures for the sustainable cultivation of salak.</p><p>\"We have tasked the agriculture agency with preparing a type of cold storage for the farmers which can help maintain the selling price,\" said I Ketut Sedana Merta, regional secretary of Karangasem Regency.</p><p>\"We have also prepared an action plan on regulations as well as how to protect, distribute and sustain local food, including salak.\" INITIAL: dn(ca)</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["Also known as snake fruit, it grows in clusters at the base of the salak palm tree, a species native to Indonesia.

There will be a massive jump in sequestration if the yield is increased.</p><p>In nature, we know that atmospheric carbon emissions are balanced by carbon uptake through sequestration that mostly occurs via photosynthesis, plus a much smaller proportion via geological processes.</p><p>Since the formation of the Earth, science has suggested that the ratio between emitted and sequestered carbon has varied considerably, with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels ranging from 100,000 ppm (parts per million) to a mere 100 ppm.</p><p>Over time, a huge amount of carbon has been sequestered due to photosynthesis and essentially removed from the cycle, being buried as fossil deposits of coal, oil and gas.</p><p>The atmospheric CO2 levels were relatively low then, averaging about 220 ppm.</p><p>However, large quantities of sequestered fossil carbon have recently been used as energy sources, resulting in a particularly rapid increase in CO2 emissions to the current value of 424 ppm.</p><p>Unless nothing changes, the prediction is that it may rises to more than 800 ppm by 2100. This is alarming for the world, threatening future food production and social stability.</p><p>Carbon sequestration is no longer keeping up with recent fossil based emissions. To address the current imbalance, it is important to reduce net emissions and promote sequestration.</p><p>Fossil fuels should be phased out to be replaced by renewables. Carbon sequestration by tropical trees and crops already removes in excess of 1,000 million tonnes of atmospheric CO2 annually but is threatened by deforestation and the drainage of carbon-rich peatland.</p><p>Improvements in carbon sequestration can be achieved by policies such as growing tropical crops as part of agroforestry systems, limiting deforestation and the use of peatland, and auditing the carbon impact of major cropping systems in order to focus on those crops that deliver both high yields and carbon efficiency.</p><p>Professor Dennis Murphy of the University of Wales, who will speak at the Oct 22 conference, has produced evidence that the oil palm is a viable candidate crop to power sequestration.</p><p>A study of the oil palm has demonstrated that it had favourable carbon sequestration potential that, under some circumstances, was comparable with tropical forests and superior to other oil crops.</p><p>The crop also has relatively untapped biomass sequestration potential in the form of its currently underutilised by-products, such as fronds and trunks.</p><p>A strategy that has proved successful in increasing carbon sequestration without using additional cropland is the development of higher yielding crop varieties. In the case of oil palm, this is possible.</p><p>As fruit yields have been increased by as much as threefold, this could more than double the crop's sequestration capacity as the new varieties are planted over the next decade.</p><p>As is always reiterated, only science can silence oil palm critics.</p><p>PROFESSOR DATUK DR AHMAD IBRAHIM</p><p>Tan Sri Omar Centre for STI Policy, UCSI University</p><p>( END )</p>", "publisher": "New Straits Times (Malaysia)", "instances": ["Fossil fuels should be phased out to be replaced by renewables.

In recent years, it has been overshadowed by developments in other sectors such as electrical and electronics, information technology and data centres.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Beset by challenges, from labour shortage to negative perception by the West, how can Malaysia\u00e2  s palm oil sector stay ahead of the competition and remain relevant?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We posed some questions to a few industry leaders and experts.</p><p>Datuk Carl Bek-Nielsen,</p><p>Chairman, Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC)</p><p>The Edge: What are the top three challenges facing the country\u00e2  s palm oil sector?</p><p>Datuk Carl Bek-Nielsen: The highest priority by far remains measures that need to be taken to reverse the stagnating yields per hectare from the present national average of 3.2 tonnes of CPO per ha.</p><p>Secondly, concerted effort should also be made to lower the industry\u00e2  s rising cost of production by, among others, raising productivity through mechanisation and automation. Thirdly, to address the acute labour shortages which periodically cripple the ability of the growers to do their job, resulting in high field losses that have run into billions of ringgit over the last few years.</p><p>How should these challenges be addressed? And does Malaysia have the solutions to address them? If not, why?</p><p>There is no fast track or quick-fix solution for reversing the low yields. What is needed is a sustained effort to do what is required, starting with accelerating a nationwide replanting programme so all old and unproductive palms can be replaced with new, high-yielding materials from reputable seed producers that have the genetic potential to yield 70%-100% more compared to now.</p><p>Raising the national yield to four to 4.5 tonnes per ha will help to improve the economic viability of the industry by lowering its cost base, which since Covid-19 has rocketed to RM2,500 to RM3,000 per tonnes. High yields are like a silver bullet and companies should dedicate more energy to this.</p><p>Thirdly, the industry needs improved policies without the bureaucracy currently encountered when recruiting guest workers. The government should urgently work on facilitating a smooth and trouble-free recruitment process, which is fast, efficient and in line with the principles of the International Labour Organization. As the quote goes, \u00e2  Give us the tools (labour) and we will complete the job (minimise losses thereby raising yields)\u00e2  .</p><p>Malaysia has the ability to solve all of the above and I remain optimistic that the first steps are finally being taken to address this.</p><p>Are planters and the industry doing enough to prepare for climate change in their daily operations on the ground?</p><p>Planters will have to be prepared for more extreme weather not just now but also in the future. In the tropics, this will very likely be felt with more extreme rainfall and intense thunderstorms with strong winds and the consequential risks of periodic flooding. Much more can be done to improve on water management, including drainage, to help facilitate the evacuation of excessive volumes of water. At the same time, growers should also start to improve their agronomic practices to mitigate more severe periods of drought \u00e2 \" by enhancing mulching and the planting of leguminous cover crops that help minimise soil evaporation. We have to adapt to the changing times.</p><p>Having been the backbone of the economy for the past 50 years, do you see the palm oil sector continuing to play a major role in the country\u00e2  s growth? With production stagnating, can the industry innovate to produce high-value consumer goods or will it remain a primary and semi-processed commodity producer?</p><p>I am very confident the palm oil industry will continue to play an important role in our country\u00e2  s future economic growth and prosperity. We must not just look at the export value that is well over RM100 billion per year at present but also at what the industry provides to Malaysia in terms of net export surplus, which is higher than most other segments in the Malaysian economy. Malaysia is indeed blessed from an agronomic point of view with good fertile soils, adequate rainfall and sunshine, good governance and first-class infrastructure, which has few equals. These are vital foundation stones to enable the Malaysian palm oil industry to race ahead of our competitors in terms of producing the highest quality and most sustainable palm oil. We must therefore not tolerate or condone any signs of complacency where we resign ourselves to the notion that \u00e2  production has stagnated\u00e2  .</p><p>Instead, we should push the notion of producing more with less and I am confident that if the right measures are put in place, Malaysia will within the near future be producing a record 23 million to 24 million tonnes of CPO per year versus the (approximately) 19 million tonnes now. The present Minister of Plantation and Commodities Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani has demonstrated enormous energy, dynamism and leadership to kick-start the transformation, which will push our industry forward, and we are all solidly behind him.</p><p>It is just a matter of time before we see some of the larger vertically integrated growers take another step up the value addition ladder, entering the sphere of consumer goods. This can happen in an evolutionary manner, but I do also believe that acquisitions will be on the horizon before too long, thereby leapfrogging into this segment.</p><p>The palm oil sector is said to be the crop that is best prepared for the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). Yet there is much opposition from Malaysia and Indonesia on account of smallholders being shut out of the European Union (EU). But Malaysia is over 80% MSPO (Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil) certified. Please explain this. How will the EUDR change the global palm oil trade? In your opinion, what will be the most significant outcome of the EUDR?</p><p>Most larger and medium-sized Malaysian oil palm growers are now compliant with the EUDR, thereby supporting the goal of ending deforestation. However, we must not forget the vulnerable smallholders who will face a gigantic uphill task in implementing the rigorous and resource-demanding requirements of the EUDR. Remember, the smallholder community makes up about 27% of Malaysia\u00e2  s palm producers, 45% of Indonesia\u00e2  s palm producers and over 80% of Thailand\u00e2  s palm producers. The same picture applies to the estimated 25 million coffee farmers around the world where 80% are smallholder producers working on plots of land less than 5ha and where the majority of production labour is provided by women.</p><p>What will happen is that when the big producers or buyers are unable to do the full traceability required by the EUDR right down to the small farmers, they will simply cut them off. This is the reality. The EUDR under the EU\u00e2  s Green Deal therefore risks pushing millions of smallholders further back into darkness \u00e2 \" instead of forward and into the light. This is wrong and it is unjust.</p><p>I believe that the policymakers in Brussels will only wake up and pull the handbrakes when they run out of caff\u00c3\u00a8 lattes in the corridors of the European Commission (EC) \u00e2 \" and this will happen if the EUDR is enforced.</p><p>In terms of palm oil trade, we must be prepared for short-term disruptions but these are temporary and will eventually even out when the policymakers come to their senses and realise they have led people down a rabbit hole with the EUDR. It will suddenly dawn on the bureaucrats that replacing palm oil with other crops will require seven to 10 times more land, thereby ending up doing more harm to the environment, climate change and biodiversity.</p><p>Datuk Carl Bek-Nielsen is also vice-chairman and chief executive director of United Plantations Bhd. His response was given prior to the EC's proposal announced last Wednesday to delay the EUDR by one year.</p><p>M R Chandran,</p><p>Adviser, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)</p><p>In your view, what are the top three challenges facing the country\u00e2  s palm oil sector?</p><p>Complacency</p><p>Complacency and a \u00e2  business as usual\u00e2   mindset are the most significant challenges facing the Malaysian palm oil industry. While the industry has shown remarkable resilience and success in overcoming many obstacles, complacency threatens its long-term sustainability. Examples of complacency in the Malaysian palm oil industry include:</p><p>Over-reliance on existing practices: The industry continues to heavily depend on traditional cultivation and processing methods, often neglecting innovation and failing to adapt to changing market and environmental conditions.</p><p>Resistance to change and slow adoption of technology: There is notable resistance to new technologies, which hampers efficiency and environmental impact reduction.</p><p>Short-term focus: The emphasis on maximising short-term profits often leads to insufficient investment in long-term sustainability goals.</p><p>A clear example of complacency is the palm oil milling process, which has seen little significant transformation over the past six decades. This has implications for the oil extraction rate (OER), which has seen a declining trend. Although incremental improvements such as enhanced machinery efficiency and automation have been made, they do not fundamentally change milling operations. For instance, while the conversion of by-products such as empty fruit bunches (EFB) and palm oil mill effluent (POME) into biomass energy is a step forward, it primarily addresses energy use rather than the core milling process itself.</p><p>Environmental pressures \u00e2 \" including waste management improvements, methane capture from POME and adherence to certification standards like MSPO, RSPO, ISCC and so on \u00e2 \" have largely been reactions to mandatory regulations or external market demands, rather than industry-driven innovations. Despite interest in digital tools like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, their widespread adoption remains lacking. Compared to other industries, such as soy or sugarcane, which have embraced mechanised and data-driven processing, the palm oil industry lags behind, reflecting its over-reliance on existing practices, resistance to change and short-term focus.</p><p>Food safety</p><p>Food safety is a critical challenge for the Malaysian palm oil industry, particularly as consumer expectations and regulatory standards evolve. Ensuring high food safety standards is essential for the industry\u00e2  s long-term sustainability and competitiveness, especially since 70% to 80% of palm oil is consumed as food. The industry cannot afford to compromise its reputation as a safe oil, particularly as technologies for detecting contaminants improve.</p><p>A significant concern is 3-MCPD, a contaminant prevalent in refined palm oil. Although technologies exist to reduce 3-MCPD levels, implementing these measures has proved challenging. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) has made efforts to address this issue, but the introduction of licensing requirements for 3-MCPD control has faced delays. The industry\u00e2  s reluctance to adopt stricter regulations stems from increased production costs, concerns about competitiveness and a lack of consumer awareness about 3-MCPD, leading to the perception that it is not a priority.</p><p>Recent proposals to implement different safety limits for domestic and export markets pose significant challenges. Allowing higher maximum limits for 3-MCPD in exports sends conflicting signals about Malaysia\u00e2  s commitment to global food safety. While industry concerns are valid, permitting less stringent standards for exports undermines consumer health and risks tarnishing its global reputation.</p><p>Investments in technology and compliance can now mitigate future costs, including potential market access losses and reputational damage. It is essential that business-to-business transactions uphold food safety standards, as maintaining high standards across all products is vital for sustaining trust in the palm oil sector. The industry\u00e2  s stance that allowable contamination levels should be market-driven is unacceptable as such a mindset could stagnate the industry and allow competitors to seize market share with superior solutions.</p><p>Stagnating yields</p><p>Stagnating yields present a critical challenge to the Malaysian palm oil industry, impacting land use efficiency, sustainability and long-term competitiveness. The national average yield has stagnated at less than 3.5 tonnes of oil per hectare annually, a low figure shared with Indonesia, among the top five producers (Khor Reports, July 27, 2024). In contrast, Thailand achieves higher crude palm oil (CPO) yields despite a smallholder-dominated sector. Factors contributing to this decline include poor agricultural management practices, labour shortages, suboptimal planting material and inefficiencies in milling operations.</p><p>Does Malaysia have the solutions and capabilities to address these challenges? If not, why?</p><p>Addressing the challenges facing the Malaysian palm oil industry necessitates a fundamental change in mindset. A shift from prioritising short-term profits to focusing on long-term viability and sustainability is essential. Embracing a culture of continuous improvement and actively adopting available technologies can enhance productivity and environmental responsibility. While Malaysia possesses the solutions to tackle these issues, implementation remains a significant hurdle due to industry reluctance.</p><p>Complacency</p><p>Overcoming complacency requires a proactive approach to embrace innovation and adapt to evolving market demands. Stakeholders must prioritise sustainable practices and recognise the importance of long-term investments in quality and environmental stewardship over immediate financial gains.</p><p>Food safety</p><p>Ensuring food safety is critical for maintaining Malaysia\u00e2  s reputation in the global market. MPOB and the relevant authorities must implement and enforce stringent regulations to address process contaminants like 3-MCPD. Establishing comprehensive safety standards aligned with international expectations is essential to safeguard consumer health and the integrity of Malaysian palm oil.</p><p>Stagnating yields</p><p>Stagnating yields are compounded by labour shortages and challenges in planting material quality assurance. To enhance productivity, the industry must address labour issues through policy reforms, including increased wages and investments in mechanisation to attract skilled workers. Improving labour conditions and creating a favourable working environment are vital to enhancing productivity.</p><p>In conclusion, the industry\u00e2  s reluctance to adopt technologies highlights the need for proactive intervention through policy and regulatory mandates. Strengthening regulatory frameworks is vital. MPOB and other authorities should recognise the palm oil industry as a cornerstone of Malaysia\u00e2  s economy. The government should appreciate the industry\u00e2  s contributions and provide necessary incentives and subsidies to sustain its growth. By addressing these interconnected challenges \u00e2 \" complacency, food safety and stagnating yields \u00e2 \" Malaysia can enhance the resilience and sustainability of its palm oil industry, ensuring competitiveness in the global market.</p><p>Having been the backbone of the Malaysian economy for the past 50 years, do you see the palm oil sector continuing to play a major role in the country\u00e2  s growth? With production stagnating, can the industry innovate?</p><p>The palm oil sector has been a cornerstone of the Malaysian economy for over five decades, and its continued relevance will depend on the industry\u00e2  s ability to innovate and adapt to changing global dynamics. While production has stagnated, there is substantial potential for growth through technological advancements, improved practices and strategic investments.</p><p>The palm oil industry can draw valuable lessons from the rubber and cocoa sectors, once major commodities whose diminished importance offers crucial insights for the palm oil industry. The volatility of the commodity market was a major issue. Both cocoa and rubber faced agricultural challenges, including pest and disease issues that negatively impacted yields and farmers\u00e2   incomes. A lack of sustainable solutions contributed to their decline. As palm oil became increasingly lucrative, investments shifted away from these crops, leading to their decline. To avoid a similar fate, the palm oil industry must embrace sustainable practices, placing a strong emphasis on environmental stewardship.</p><p>By adopting sustainable agricultural techniques, the industry can maintain soil health, protect biodiversity and comply with evolving environmental regulations, ensuring its long-term viability. Moreover, staying attuned to global market trends and consumer preferences is essential. The industry must be agile, adapting production strategies to meet changing demands and capitalise on opportunities for high-value consumer goods.</p><p>The importance of the oil palm industry to Malaysia\u00e2  s economy compared to other sectors cannot be overstated. For example, although the electronics sector contributes significantly to gross doemstic product through exports, it relies heavily on imported raw materials and technology, resulting in high research and operational costs. This diminishes its net income compared to the palm oil industry, which benefits from lower input costs and local resource control. Similarly, the oil and gas sector, while generating substantial revenue, faces high capital investments, compliance costs and market volatility, which can affect profitability.</p><p>Palm oil, being an agriculture-based commodity, offers a more stable and reliable income stream, making it an essential component of Malaysia\u00e2  s economic landscape. Overall, the efficiency, local revenue retention and stability of the palm oil sector position it as a vital player in the country\u00e2  s economic growth and sustainability. Reinforcing the significance of this sector will be key to securing Malaysia\u00e2  s prosperous economic future.</p><p>While the palm oil sector faces significant challenges, its potential for growth remains strong. It is a well-known fact that we cannot compete with Indonesia in terms of land and labour availability. However, where we can excel is by branding ourselves for quality and focusing on technology development and adoption, holding the intellectual property rights. For instance, Indonesia has developed a government-funded DNA facility mainly for Shell testing, which is based on a Malaysian innovation. By learning from the past and taking proactive steps towards sustainability, market adaptability, innovation and enhanced support systems, the industry can secure its place as a major contributor to Malaysia\u00e2  s economic future. The government must fully appreciate the importance of this golden crop and strengthening support systems through robust government policies is paramount.</p><p>Are planters and the industry doing enough in their operations on the ground to prepare for climate change?</p><p>The upcoming RSPO Principles &amp; Criteria (P&amp;C) standard [expected to be ratified by year end] has been revised to allow planters stronger pathways to address and mitigate climate change concerns by improving practices and operations on the ground, including clear prohibitions on major components linked to climate change, such as deforestation, conservation of peatlands, no open burning; clearer implementation and interpretation of guidelines with direct connection to climate-related market expectations and reporting requirements; better assessment of the climate change impact of operations, such as sourcing of petroleum-based fertiliser or reducing fossil fuel usage in favour of renewable energy, among others.</p><p>The revised P&amp;C will also require the palm oil processing units to report their water consumption per unit of production and water withdrawal from surface/ground water sources. This will allow the processing plants to better optimise their water usage/footprint and encourage practices such as rainwater collection or grey water usage to reduce the impact of its water footprint. This is important given that weather patterns are changing because of warmer oceans, which could disrupt the monsoon cycle.</p><p>Climate change impacts on sea level rise is another conundrum that needs to be addressed, because of the risk of increased soil salinity and seawater infiltration. Any low-lying area near the coastlines would become vulnerable. Indicators in the RSPO P&amp;C do indirectly address this, by way of restoration of mangroves and peatlands as coastal buffers. But the direct risk of salinisation rendering arable land unusable will pose a high risk.</p><p>The integration of sustainability and circular economy principles offers a transformative pathway to mitigate environmental impact while ensuring economic resilience. In contrast to the linear \u00e2  take, make, use, dispose\u00e2  approach typical of traditional economies, the circular economy model presents a paradigm shift, emphasising a \u00e2  take, make, use, reuse\u00e2  approach aimed at minimising waste and maximising resource efficiency. By viewing waste and pollution as flaws in the chain rather than inevitabilities, the circular economy promotes optimal production technologies, renewable energy utilisation and recovery of waste by recycling or giving it a second life as value-added goods.</p><p>On average, palm product yield is about 25% of the fresh fruit bunches (FFB), with the remaining 75% being waste thus providing an immense opportunity for integrating circular economy principles into the entire palm oil supply chain.</p><p>However, despite the promise, the implementation of circularity in the oil palm sector faces technological and cost-related challenges. Concerted efforts by both industry players and government stakeholders are essential for overcoming these challenges.</p><p>The oil palm industry has all the ingredients to power a circular economy revolution but the question remains: Will it embrace this opportunity wholeheartedly, or will it content itself with mere lip service to sustainability?</p><p>The EC-proposed 12-month delay in implementing the EUDR is welcome news for palm oil producer nations. However, it is also incumbent upon the EC to revisit the burdensome and complex due diligence requirements for it creates technical barriers for the export of our palm products.</p><p>Roslin Azmy Hassan,</p><p>Chief Executive, Malaysian Palm Oil Association</p><p>On the top three challenges facing the country\u00e2  s palm oil sector</p><p>Labour shortages</p><p>The ongoing shortage of labour, particularly foreign workers, is a critical issue. The palm oil sector, like other agricultural industries, depends heavily on manual labour for planting, harvesting and processing. Due to stringent immigration policies, delays in worker approvals and the pandemic-induced restrictions, the industry has struggled to maintain an adequate labour force. As a result, productivity and efficiency have been severely impacted.</p><p>Sustainability and environmental pressures</p><p>Increasing scrutiny from international markets, environmental groups and consumers regarding the sector\u00e2  s environmental footprint has led to rising concerns over deforestation, biodiversity loss and carbon emissions. Certifications like RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) are becoming mandatory to access key export markets, especially in Europe. Malaysia must continually address these issues, balancing its economic growth with its commitment to sustainable practices.</p><p>Global market dynamics and trade barriers</p><p>The palm oil sector is heavily influenced by global geopolitical tensions and trade barriers. Anti-palm oil campaigns, tariffs and restrictions in major markets, particularly the EUDR, present hurdles for Malaysia\u00e2  s exports. Additionally, competition from other vegetable oils, such as soybean and sunflower oil, means that Malaysia must stay competitive in terms of pricing, quality and sustainability.</p><p>On addressing these challenges</p><p>Labour shortages</p><p>To address labour shortages, the industry must expedite the modernisation of plantation operations through mechanisation and automation. Technologies like drones for monitoring, precision agriculture and automated harvesting tools can help reduce reliance on manual labour. Additionally, the Malaysian government and the industry must streamline the foreign worker registration process and improve incentives to attract local workers by enhancing wages and working conditions.</p><p>Sustainability and environmental pressures</p><p>Malaysia is already a leader in sustainable palm oil production, with initiatives like MSPO (Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil) certification covering 98% of the country\u00e2  s palm oil plantations. However, further efforts are required to enhance transparency and accountability. Promoting agroforestry, strengthening biodiversity conservation practices and leveraging data-driven techniques such as satellite monitoring will bolster sustainability efforts. It\u00e2  s also vital to engage more effectively with international stakeholders to counteract negative perceptions.</p><p>Global market dynamics and trade barriers</p><p>In navigating global market challenges, Malaysia must continue diplomatic efforts to counter trade barriers. At the same time, the industry must diversify its markets to reduce dependence on traditional buyers. Strengthening ties with emerging markets like the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia is crucial. Furthermore, Malaysia can focus on value addition \u00e2 \" producing higher-end products such as nutraceuticals, bioplastics and biodiesel \u00e2 \" to maintain competitiveness.</p><p>Malaysia has the technical expertise, policy frameworks and capacity to address these challenges. The widespread adoption of sustainable practices and investment in technology will be crucial. However, collaboration between the government, industry players and international organisations is needed to implement these solutions effectively. In some cases, such as labour shortages, addressing the challenge requires structural changes that go beyond the industry\u00e2  s direct control.</p><p>On industry preparation for climate change</p><p>While the Malaysian palm oil industry has made significant strides in addressing climate-related concerns, more can be done to future-proof the sector. Climate change impacts, such as unpredictable weather patterns, droughts and floods, directly affect crop yields and productivity. To mitigate these risks, planters are increasingly adopting climate-resilient practices, including:</p><p>Diversifying crop varieties: New hybrid varieties of oil palm that are more resistant to extreme weather conditions and pests are being developed.</p><p>Agroforestry and soil conservation: Some planters are integrating agroforestry practices, which combine crops with trees to improve soil health and biodiversity, while reducing the sector\u00e2  s carbon footprint.</p><p>Water management systems: Efficient irrigation and water retention systems are essential to adapt to erratic rainfall patterns.</p><p>However, to further prepare for climate change, the industry needs to scale up research into adaptive agronomic practices, implement climate-smart technologies more broadly, and ensure that reforestation and conservation programmes are expanded across the sector.</p><p>On the future of palm oil in Malaysia</p><p>Palm oil has been an integral part of Malaysia\u00e2  s economy for over five decades and will continue to play a vital role. The sector contributes significantly to employment, rural development and export revenue. While production has plateaued, especially due to land constraints, palm oil still holds enormous potential as a sustainable source of income for Malaysia.</p><p>The future of the palm oil sector will hinge on its ability to transition from a primarily commodity-based industry to a more diversified, value-added industry. There is a growing emphasis on downstream activities, including the development of bio-based products such as oleochemicals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and innovation, Malaysia can explore higher-value palm-based derivatives. For instance:</p><p>Nutraceuticals and food ingredients: Palm oil is increasingly used in health supplements, functional foods and fortified food products. These products have higher profit margins and growing demand globally.</p><p>Renewable energy and biodiesel: As the world moves towards greener energy, palm oil can be an important component of Malaysia\u00e2  s renewable energy sector through the production of biodiesel and biomass.</p><p>For Malaysia to remain competitive, continued investment in research and development, innovation and human capital is required. The government and industry stakeholders must collaborate to foster an ecosystem that supports technological advancement, value addition and compliance with international standards.</p><p>In conclusion, while challenges persist, the Malaysian palm oil sector has demonstrated resilience and adaptability. The future success of the industry will depend on how effectively it can innovate, embrace sustainable practices and respond to evolving global market conditions. With the right strategies, the palm oil sector can continue to be a key driver of Malaysia\u00e2  s economic growth while also contributing positively to environmental and social outcomes.</p><p>Roslin was previously CEO of Upstream Malaysia, SD Guthrie Bhd</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Malaysia", "instances": ["Sustainability and environmental pressuresMalaysia is already a leader in sustainable palm oil production, with initiatives like MSPO (Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil) certification covering 98% of the country\u00e2  s palm oil plantations.

Said to be the bottled iced tea with the highest amount of antioxidants in Singapore, the range comes in six flavours, including Lady Lavender green tea and White Peach black tea.</p><p>Tea is particularly rich in a type of antioxidant called polyphenols, which promotes youthful, glowing skin.

In the interest of tea drinkers and the crop that his country so lovingly produced, Merrill made it his lifelong purpose to pursue a more sustainable and ethical approach to the cultivation and production of tea by starting his own company. This would in turn ensure the sustainability and the security of Sri Lanka's workers.</p><p>\"Dilmah is actually the world's first genuinely ethical tea that is offered to tea drinkers around the world directly by a tea grower,\" said Fernando.

We were discussing the matter of shared prosperity and poverty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The minister and I are on the same page, that is, we are trying to figure out how to increase income for smallholders and farmers and how to achieve shared prosperity so that we can try to eradicate poverty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prices of commodities are low, yet essential food items are beyond their reach. We must solve the problems of smallholders, fishermen and farmers if we want to eradicate poverty.</p><p>So far, the policies formulated have failed to lift this group of people out of poverty. Subsidies do help but are not the answer in the long term. For sustainable, meaningful change, we need to increase their incomes. This can be done by educating them on the use and benefits of technology and precise agriculture.</p><p>The oil palm industry must innovate and change if it is to survive in the future. There must be a constant drive for improvement, and none of the players in the industry can afford to stagnate.</p><p>What do we do with waste from agricultural activities, such as the leaves and trunks of palm trees? Much research is needed and there must be a change in mentality to adopt a circular-economy approach, or what many call \u00e2  zero waste\u00e2 .</p><p>What we currently view as waste should be kept within the economy and used to produce other products, for instance, people are using empty fruit bunches to create biofuel pellets, an alternative to charcoal, or to produce plywood and fibre mats.</p><p>More downstream activities (value-added products) are required, then there is a future. We need more companies that are able to produce products for Saji, Adela, Seri Pelangi and others to market. As productivity increases, income will increase as well. This will lead to a reduction in the poverty rate.</p><p>Currently, Malaysia remains as one of the top 10 coconut-producing countries in the world. Coconut is the fourth-most-important industrial crop in Malaysia after oil palm, rubber and rice. As I have highlighted before, coconut can be used in F&amp;B, beauty products, handicraft, health products and others. Even the leaves, lidi, shell (tempurung) and coconut fibre (sabut kelapa) are in demand. Then, there is a new variety of dwarf coconut that produces more coconuts in a shorter period.</p><p>There is no single crop that is the answer to all our country\u00e2  s issues. Rather, my point is that we should be looking at diversifying our crops and avoiding a national dependency on any one single crop. What the entire industry should be doing, regardless of whether it is commodities agriculture or agri-food production, is to be continually innovating and improving such that less and less resources are required and less waste is produced.</p><p>What will the next decade look like for the country\u00e2  s agricultural sector? Let us look at the sector as a whole in the region.According to \u00e2  The Asia Food Challenge: Harvesting the Future\u00e2 , a report jointly produced by PwC, Robobank and Temasek recently, by 2030, Asia will have an additional 250 million people to feed (the equivalent of another Indonesia) and there will be a need for nutritious, fresh, safe and sustainably produced food to be delivered conveniently and on demand. As it is today, Asia struggles to feed itself. It is also too dependent on other regions for tech and food. It is a problem we can no longer ignore.</p><p>Asia\u00e2  s current expenditure on food alone is projected to more than double to US$8 trillion by 2030. To meet the region\u00e2  s agri needs for the future, it is estimated that an US$800 billion cumulative investment above existing levels will be required over the next decade. New and emerging technology will be needed to increase agricultural yields and nutritional value, while addressing the effects of climate change.</p><p>Coming back home, our food import bill is more than RM50 billion. In 2018, Malaysia ranked 40th among 113 countries in the Global Food Security Index. We need to address this and one way is through agriculture, more specifically, through agritech.</p><p>Agritech has also been identified as one of the key segments to uplift the livelihood of farmers and smallholders, who mostly are in the low-income household category, or B40. There is a positive correlation between an increase in agricultural productivity and economic growth.</p><p>If we can increase production to the point of increasing exports, we can also strengthen the ringgit and our economy in general. We will increase the incomes of farmers. We can decrease the cost of living and improve the quality of life.</p><p>Investment in innovation and technology is key for this sector.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 Modern and precise agriculture that holds the potential for these positive changes.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 Increase the productivity of the agriculture sector through technology, and thus reduce dependency on foreign labour.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 Malaysians are doing many exciting things here \u00e2 \" there are drone manufacturers; students creating algorithms that help sort vegetables by quality and weight; and start-ups creating apps that help farmers move their vegetables quickly and efficiently along the supply chain. There needs to be some level of coordination from the government and its agencies to encourage and facilitate growth.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 It is also imperative that government agencies keep up with technological changes in the agri industry so that better policies can be formulated.</p><p>Our key advantage is the abundance of land, including idle agriculture land.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 The Department of Agriculture is making a good effort with its Idle Land Development Programme, but more people need to get involved and make use of the incentives available.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 I have also received feedback that getting access to idle land is quite difficult. Information on the Idle Land Development Fund must be made more easily accessible (that is, how to apply for funds); information on available idle land should be simplified \u00e2 \" just as you can easily search for land to buy, there should be a clear directory for leasing/purchasing idle land.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 There is plenty of agricultural land available in Malaysia such that we do not need to clear any forests for the agricultural sector to move forward. However, the red tape involved in getting access to such land must be reduced and the process simplified if we wish for more people to take part in this industry.</p><p>\u00e2 \u00a2 Furthermore, access to land must take into consideration the tenets of justice and equity \u00e2 \" there are many issues surrounding the land rights of the Orang Asli. This is an issue that crops up throughout the developing world, and one that Malaysia must be proactive in addressing.</p><p>These are the reasons why I said that we need to make agri sexy \u00e2 \" sexy through tech, sexy in the sense that money is made. We need to attract not just talent but investors to put their ideas and money in this sector.</p><p>Agri sector in the new decade</p><p>We want more people to get involved in agriculture, but to make this happen, the authorities must ensure that access to resources is equitable, and some long-standing practices may need to be reviewed. For instance, land rights, access to financing, and access to information and technical advice must be democraticised.</p><p>At the moment, Lembaga Pertubuhan Peladang (Farmers\u00e2   Organisation Authority) does a very good job providing technical advice, financing and even seedlings, but this will need to be holistically reviewed to ensure that it can keep up with demand as the sector expands. Furthermore, there may be a need for an \u00e2  incubator\u00e2  approach to encourage some smaller-scale farmers to engage with modern and precise farming practices, as usually costs are prohibitive to smallholders.</p><p>Water security will be a major issue, as agriculture is currently the single biggest user of national water resources. The sector must research and implement new methods of reducing water use, but at the same time, the government must plan ahead for increased water requirements in the future. Water is essential for citizens\u00e2   daily life, for manufacturing, for tourism, for businesses and, of course, for agriculture. We experienced many water cuts last year and, of course, in pockets of Malaysia, particularly for rural and indigenous communities, many still do not have consistent access to clean water. This must change.</p><p>Conservation will be another big issue. As we all know, monocropping can lead to massive biodiversity loss, and we have seen vast areas of forest land cleared, burnt or pillaged for the purpose of obtaining forest products or planting new crops. What we must bear in mind is that plenty of agricultural land is already available and both federal and state governments must make it easier to access designated agricultural land. No further forest land should be cleared for the purpose of agriculture.</p><p>In fact, there should be a clear plan for reforestation and restoration of agricultural land that is no longer productive. Forests are important carbon sinks and Malaysia as a megadiverse nation must have clear guidelines on sustainable practices to protect this natural resource. Rainforest and peatland areas should be gazetted, while ensuring that access to readily available agricultural land is made easier and less complicated for those who want to work it. There are already various policies and guidelines in place, but implementation will require further cooperation between the various agencies and ministries involved.</p><p>We should also be looking into carbon farming as it may be the industry of the future. It is the process of changing agricultural practices or land use to increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil and vegetation (sequestration) and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, soil or vegetation (avoidance). Carbon farming potentially offers landowners/farmers financial incentives to reduce carbon pollution. For example, Australian carbon farmers are now earning income for cutting greenhouse gas emissions or sequestering carbon.</p><p>The Australian government has created the Emission Reduction Fund to provide businesses with the opportunity to earn Australian carbon credit units for every tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent a business stores or avoids emitting through adopting new practices and technologies. In the private sector, a US-based start-up is also offering financial incentives of US$15 per tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered.</p><p>In addition to earning additional income, farmers also find a lot of extra benefits from this process, such as better animal production, improved soil health, water management and biodiversity. Carbon farming is under the umbrella of regenerative farming, which also includes practices such as agroforestry, crop rotation, permaculture and the principles of holistic agriculture management. These practices are intertwined and should be studied in the context of the Malaysian agricultural industry to ensure that the best practices are implemented here, for the benefit of our farmers and Malaysians as a whole.</p><p>The local agriculture sector is too convoluted owing to bureacracy. It is hard to break into the sector unless you have experience and contacts, which holds back many aspiring young farmers. I hope the relevant authorities will review their practices to ensure a simpler and more efficient process. Sometimes, people tend to forget that time is also a resource, and agriculture in Malaysia currently demands far too much time to jump through various hoops.</p><p>On the commercial side, farmers big and small will need to embrace a change in techniques and learn new things. Traditional knowledge is of course still important, and practitioners should find a way to create synergy between old and new techniques to get the best out of them. I said this before and I will say it again: We must embrace technology as, without it, we will be left behind.</p><p>On a larger scale, I would like to see more focus on data protection. As I said, information must be easily accessible and understood; however, there must also be stringent protection in matters of national security as well as individual privacy. Some data points related to agriculture are issues of national security, for instance, protecting our nation against threats of bioterrorism, climate change and food scarcity, and the data is therefore highly sensitive and must be treated as such.</p><p>The European Union has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs data protection and privacy for all European citizens, affecting any business offering services to users in the region. In May 2019, Thailand came up with its own version, the Personal Data Protection Act, which means that if we wish to access that market, we will need to enhance our data protection practices as well.</p><p>Tun Daim Zainuddin is a former finance minister and member of the Council of Eminent Persons</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Malaysia", "instances": ["In the private sector, a US-based start-up is also offering financial incentives of US$15 per tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered.

Besides timber, non-timber species such as bamboo, rattan and<br/>even medicinal plants will be in short supply.</p><p>Recognising the need to sustain future supply of timber, Malaysia has,<br/>since 1980, developed forest plantations as an alternate source of wood<br/>supply. Being new, the development of forest plantations is constrained by<br/>many factors and the pertinent ones are land, finance, labour and long<br/>gestation period.</p><p>As a measure to reduce the financial burden and thereby attract the<br/>private sector to invest in forest plantation, the Government introduced<br/>several incentives.</p><p>These incentives, which include pioneer status and investment tax<br/>allowance, have of late shown to be inadequate.</p><p>In view of the need to increase domestic food and timber production, the<br/>Government has emphasised, among others, the agroforestry approach.</p><p>Agroforestry can increase land productivity and hence minimise some of<br/>the above-mentioned issues. Being able to be implemented on either<br/>existing agricultural land and forest plantation as well as on idle and<br/>damaged forest, it will certainly avoid having to search for new land,<br/>thus relieving pressure on the natural forest.</p><p>It will also improve income and provide early returns of investment,<br/>thereby sustain productivity of both agriculture and forest plantations.</p><p>If successfully implemented countrywide, it will go a long way towards<br/>enhancing national timber and food production.</p><p>In view of the attractive benefits of agroforestry, it has been made as<br/>one of the strategic action plans of the National Agriculture Policy.</p><p>Agroforestry has important roles to the forest environment and social<br/>activities of the forest dwellers. It improves biodiversity, increases<br/>biomass production and provides better microclimate. Where agroforestry is<br/>developed on damaged forest or land area resulting from shifting<br/>cultivation, it will lead to the development of permanent resettlement<br/>centres.</p><p>This, among others, will discourage collections of items such as bamboo,<br/>herbal plants and rattan over wide areas and hence leave the forest<br/>undisturbed.</p><p>In essence, agroforestry has the potential to transform \"wasteland\" or<br/>disturbed forest into an integrated productive-protective system.</p><p>Commercial agroforestry has been well adopted by many countries.

This was announced on Thursday (Apr 6) by SIIA chairman Simon Tay at the fourth Sustainable World Resources dialogue held in Singapore. For Singapore-listed companies, they will be asked whether they have published their sustainability reports to the Singapore Exchange under its   comply or explain  rule. </p><p>This will set the standard for smaller investors, said Associate Professor Tay, adding that it will also signal a shift from blacklisting errant companies to greening the whole value chain.   In our region, banks have traditionally lent purely for commercial reasons. They  re not lending maliciously, but some of them may be lending with a blind eye,  said Assoc Prof Tay. To start the ball rolling, the Association of Banks in Singapore is helping local banks understand the issue better. \"How do you screen loans? How do you ask questions of companies involved so that you go beyond just simply the normal commercial issues to asking questions like fire (protection practices) and certification?  Assoc Prof Tay added. The framework will also look at how to better finance companies that are doing the   right thing  through incentives like green bonds to encourage them to stay on the right track.   We are a very large financial hub. If we can use and leverage that strength, it will have a larger impact - not only in Singapore but across the region,  he said. ROLE OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR Speaking at the dialogue, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli agreed that private sector financing will play an increasingly important role in promoting green practices.   If private capital can be directed to projects that take environmental factors into account, projects that engage in unsustainable business practices will be starved of credit,\" he said.   This will help to gradually shift the business landscape towards more sustainable practices. B  However, the minister said getting the buy-in of companies and the banking sector is not enough. This year  s dialogue also looked at how other stakeholders in the supply chain, like smallholders and small- and medium-sized enterprises, can manage their plantations in a more sustainable manner to ensure that the skies stay haze-free. Mr Masagos said that governments and civil society which are able to foster greater environmental consciousness in people while pushing businesses for more transparency must continue to chip in.   Major buyers should insist on purchasing from producers who subscribe to higher and more sustainable standards,  he said.   Finally, enlightened buyers who make the right choice can help to create added incentives, by encouraging producers to move towards sustainable practices.

Wealthy governments and other donors need to invest more to reduce carbon emissions stemming from agriculture, said a study issued ahead of U.N. climate talks in Paris next week. Researchers analysed 160 national climate action plans submitted ahead of the summit, which is due to agree a new deal to curb global warming, and found 80 percent included agriculture in their efforts to cut emissions. Nearly two-thirds noted agriculture's importance in strategies to adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas, despite being short on detail, the study added. </p><p>But agriculture is absent from the main draft text for a new U.N. climate deal, signalling a major disconnect between country planning and global-level policymaking, according to the international CGIAR research programme on climate change, agriculture and food security. \"Countries have made it clear that agriculture is a priority in their climate plans,\" said programme director Bruce Campbell. \"The question is where the support to implement these plans will come from, as there has been exceptionally slow progress on these issues.\" Nearly a third of countries included targets for mitigating emissions from farming in their plans, but those are conditional on receiving international financial support, said the study. Central African Republic, for example, will need US$2.5 million to reduce slash-and-burn farming, while Senegal is seeking US$1.8 billion to cut emissions from rice, introduce biodigesters to recycle waste and expand agroforestry systems. \"Major climate finance organisations need to include agriculture in their portfolios,\" said Eva Wollenberg of the University of Vermont, who leads the CGIAR programme's research on low-emission farming. FOOD SECURITY FEARS A 2015 study from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization found that emissions from agriculture are growing, accounting for around 11 percent of global emissions in 2010. Reducing those emissions is seen as crucial for curbing climate change. But some developing nations worry that including agriculture in emissions reduction targets could hurt their ability to feed hungry people, researchers said. \"At the global level, certain countries - India in particular - have lead a movement that agriculture is crucial for food security and shouldn't be involved in (climate) mitigation (targets),\" said Wollenberg. But if donors invested more in farm technologies to reduce emissions and adapt methods to shifting climate patterns, it might help persuade reluctant developing nations. \"We know which technologies can be used - we're using many of them already. It's just a matter of expanding them,\" Wollenberg told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In Mexico, for example, a project teaching farmers to use nitrogen fertiliser more efficiently is reducing emissions by an equivalent of 700,000 barrels of oil annually, while cutting costs. In India's northeastern Haryana state, growers are using laser censors linked to mechanised plows to flatten farmland. This stops water forming puddles in areas of uneven land, using it more effectively. The programme led to an increase in wheat and rice production, while cutting water use and carbon emissions. Such efforts need to be expanded to other poor countries so that the climate-change impacts of farming do not worsen, scientists say.

When she was young, life was simple but enriched by the abundance of the sea. Fish were everywhere - tonnes and tonnes of them, she said, from the shore where the island kids would dangle bait above the sea floor to catch their dinner. \"If we could catch one and I didn't like it, then I'd throw it back to the sea and catch fish that I wanted for my dinner, just like that,\" said Ann, now 38. Her tan face lit up with a bright smile at the thought of those old days. \"It's a good childhood memory,\" she added. </p><p>\"My kids don't have the experience I had before.\" The idea of food security is in the distant past for many residents of El Nido in Palawan - a coastal municipality on the Philippines' remote western border. Fish catches are in decline. Crops struggle to grow. Their lands are dry and barren from years of slash-and-burn farming and prolonged drought. Dry spells are a big problem, especially for residents on islands with limited freshwater resources. Three years ago, Ann experienced the worst drought she can remember. \"Oh my goodness,\" she said. \"In my kitchen, we had to take water from the sea for the first and second rinses, and then used fresh water for the last. Even the toilets, we converted them into salt water but then it depleted the soil.\" That year, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported about 102,000 farmers in the Philippines had suffered from dry spells. Their farmlands of 194,000 hectares bore the brunt of the extreme weather - one-third of which had no chance of recovery. The Philippines is among the most vulnerable in the world to climate hazards. According to the Global Peace Index of 2019, which analyses the potential impact of climate change on peace around the world, the Southeast Asian nation is at the highest risk of multiple climate hazards. Nearly half of its 106 million population live in exposure to natural disasters such as tropical cyclones and drought, which the report said \"are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change\". In El Nido, islanders work hard for food. Their life very much depends on fishing. But as catches dwindle, many people have to find an alternative to ensure they have enough to eat. For Ann, it is permaculture farming, where agriculture is integrated into the natural ecosystem in a way that benefits both humans and the environment. Working with a local community-based travel company TAOPhilippines, the mother-of-three has tasked herself with transforming coastal villages into a climate-resilient and self-reliant community, where locals can grow their own food, live in harmony with nature and thrive in the fluctuating climate conditions. It is work in progress and any change takes time. Ann and her company currently work with 17 coastal communities between El Nido and Busuanga. The heart of their operation is a secluded complex behind a row of palm trees in Sitio Parangaycayan, where she is in charge of food production. Unlike most coastal areas nearby, her workplace is brimming with food - sweet basil, mustard, spinach, coconut, pineapple, papaya, turkeys, ducks, pigs, and the list goes on. Somehow they all thrive in defiance of the searing heat and tropical storms. \"Here in our community, we have a lot of food. Everybody grows their own,\" Ann said. Behind her, a mountain is thick with bamboo, banana trees and various kinds of plants whose long roots help absorb rainwater and prevent soil erosion. Its lush green colour paints a striking contrast to the stunning shades of blues of the Darocotan Bay. Seven years ago, when Ann first came to this exact same place, it was bleak and hopeless, \"like a bald mountain,\" she said, pointing at the green forest behind. \"Slash and burn, that's the traditional way of farming here - slash the forest, get it dry and then burn. They burn because of the charcoal; it's a really good fertiliser. But if you keep on doing that, the soil gets depleted. Then you don't have trees and then we experience drought.\" 'ANG TUBIG AY BUHAY': WATER IS LIFE Through community outreach, education and examples, TAOPhilippines has built a growing community of islanders who are passionate about improving local livelihoods a natural and sustainable way. Challenged by limited freshwater supply and drought, the community is committed to conserving and increasing the amount of spring water on the island. Years of hard work, experiments, research and failures have resulted in a remarkable transformation of Sitio Parangaycayan. The key to their success is soil. \"Soil gives life,\" Ann said. She strolled past a stream that zigzags through the farm. Reflected in the water, a large wooden sign in local Tagalog hung from a tree branch. It reads 'Ang Tubig ay Buhay'. Water is life. For several years, Ann has been working with local farmers to improve soil so it can retain water and nourish plants. They use organic fertiliser in cultivation to avoid polluting soil. Plants such as beans are also grown to feed the soil nitrogen - one of the most essential nutrients for plants - while climate-resilient Vetiver grass is used to restore degraded soil, prevent landslides and catch sediment from storm water runoff. \"Vetiver is an amazing plant. We grow it everywhere. We also use it to filter water,\" Ann said. \"We also do mulching to protect the soil from strong winds and strong sun.\" The result is tangible. The soil in the community has improved over the years and so has its water situation. Today the well in the farm is full of spring water from the mountain, rich with minerals, soft and sweet in taste. Up there, a furrow has also been created to harvest rainwater. Its base is covered with mulch made of decayed leaves and bark, organic fertiliser and seeds of various trees. When it rains, the soil gets soaked with water and remains moist underneath the mulch, allowing the plants to grow. \"If there is no tree, the water will just flow down. But while you have the furrow here, the water is just there and slowly, we plant trees,\" Ann said. \"It has changed a lot three years after that drought. Now we have a good source of water.\" Reforestation is an annual ritual for the TAO community. It is also Ann's most favourite activity in the rainy season. In fact, she is thinking of planting hundreds of flame trees on the mountain so it turns red in summer. Down in the farm, 'Talinum' sprouts flourish in the hot sun. The tropical plant, also known as Philippine spinach, is often used in salads and increasingly grown around the community. Its climate-resilient nature means it can grow and survive on its own without much water or care. \"We plant them everywhere. Even if you take off the leaves and throw away the stalks behind the kitchen, next week they sprout. In the dry season, maybe you don't see them but once the rain comes, even overnight, in the morning they sprout. So why waste your water? There are a lot of plants that grow crazily everywhere,\" Ann said. A 'PARADISE' CLASSROOM Today, a variety of plants and animals have replaced the once barren land in Sitio Parangaycayan. They are grown and raised in a natural system that conserves and improves the environment while supporting the local livelihoods. The farm and forest is now the main source of food for some 300 locals in the TAO community - farmers, boat drivers, fishermen, cooks, women and young islanders. Their abundance is living proof that people can live in harmony with nature if they get to know it, work with it and be part of it. \"The idea is that we don't have to buy stuff from the market - that's the goal,\" Ann said. \"We're slowly teaching people on the islands.\" One of them is Melanie Jacob. The 35-year-old farmer with a degree in agroforestry was born in Sitio Parangaycayan, where her family owned a traditional paddy field. When she joined the TAO community, she learnt a new way of farming - more organic and sustainable - as well as how to minimise climate impacts on plants. \"The weather changes a lot. There are typhoons and drought. I've learnt that in the dry season, we must use a greenhouse, where moisture is better maintained. The roof also helps shield the plants from the sun,\" she said. Melanie works in the TAO farm with Ann. Every school break, she said students would come to visit and learn farming techniques such as how to make compost and organic pesticides. \"We teach those kids and they apply what they've learnt at home.\" \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b Besides plants, pigs, ducks and turkeys are also bred at the farm for protein. Two years after the breeding programme began, there were more than 100 pigs. According to Ann, piglets were then distributed to several coastal communities. \"Now people on the islands, apart from fishing, they also raise the animals for food,\" she said. \"We don't stop learning or experimenting. The big thing is you work with the communities and the kids. They don't go to school but they learn something else here, like the real life. If there is a typhoon, they can climb coconut trees. They can grow crops. They know how to prepare fish and everything.

Forests are cleared to make way for oil palm plantations. To save on clearing costs, farmers resort to burning. While frameworks to stop haze are being established at the regional level as well as in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, the challenge remains to get on board the actors who presently benefit from drained peatlands - the farmers, companies and investors profiting from oil palm. </p><p>Could a long-term solution to preventing forest fires in the region lie in promoting alternative commodities that can grow in wet peatlands? DRY PEATLANDS THE ROOT CAUSES OF PEAT FIRES The sine qua non, or the condition without which fires can start and spread, is the presence of dry peatlands. Peatlands are naturally wet swamps of decomposed matter. They are nutrient-rich, but extremely flammable when dry. Yet, farmers resort to draining these swamps because oil palm can only grow in dry soil. The initiative of restoring peatlands to their naturally wet state has been emphasised by Indonesia. However, unless the practice of draining peatlands is addressed, haze will continue to be a challenge. At the root of the issue, is the choice of oil palm as the dominant crop. This happens for two key reasons. First, oil palm is highly profitable and offers higher wages than other crops. The World Agroforestry Centre reports that oil palm in Indonesia yields profits of up to IDR44 million to IDR295 million (S$4,600 to S$30,760) per hectare per annum and wages in oil palm are two to seven times greater than average agricultural wages in the country. The other reason is the short lead time in growing oil palm, which takes three to four years before bearing fruit, with some gestation period before harvesting. This short lead time reduces the risks to investors who wish to invest in oil palm, in comparison to plants such as sago, which takes 10 to 15 years to grow before they can be harvested. SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CROPS To prevent farmers and private companies from draining peatlands, it must be economically sustainable to keep these peatlands wet. Alternative commodities that can be grown in peatlands while meeting three key conditions need to be leveraged. First, they must be able to grow in natural wet peat conditions. Second, they must be able to compete with oil palm in profitability, to translate into equivalent or higher wages to farmers and returns to investors. Third, they must be able to reduce investor risk by having shorter lead-time periods before harvest. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has already identified commodities that can grow in naturally wet peat conditions. These include sago, papyrus, wild rice, wetland taro, water celery, water spinach and Chinese water chestnut. Apart from these, there are also plants that can grow in moderately drained peatlands, such as rice, bananas, beans, carrots, celery, corn, lettuce, mint, onions, potatoes, parsley, radish, pasture-sod, sugar cane, chilli, soya bean, tobacco and a few horticultural crops. The challenge, however, is that there is limited information on which of these commodities meet the second and third conditions of comparable profitability and time taken before investors start getting net positive returns on their investments. Among the limited studies available, one shows that if sago was chosen as alternative crop to explore, it takes sago 10 to 15 years before it can start bearing fruit. Its internal rate of return is up to 8.06 per cent, still low compared to 20 per cent if oil palm was planted. Alternatively, some crops can be grown in less than a year, like radish or celery, but it is not known if there will be sufficient demand for these. Additional preparations may also be needed, including undertakings to reduce the acidity of the soil, prevent pests and diseases, or increase the value-add of producers through additional processing. ALTERNATIVE CROPS MAY HOLD THE KEY There is a need for more research and institutional support in improving the desirability of producing alternative commodities, on both the demand and supply sides. These need to be considered in developing and implementing long-term rehabilitation plans. Demand-side interventions include research to identify alternative commodities that are in demand, who the buyers are, what qualities and traits they desire and what prices they are sold at. Buyers may include domestic buyers within Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as importers from higher income countries. In Japan, for instance, youths are leaving the agricultural sector, creating opportunities for countries like Indonesia to provide select crops. Supply-side interventions require identifying technologies that can help meet buyer requirements, while at the same time be cost effective to producers. Research will be needed in boosting yields in producing commodities, such as through increasing crop resistance to submergence or flooding, pests and diseases. For instance, if heavy research led to growth in the productivity of cassava production, from just six tonnes per hectare to up to 30 tonnes per hectare, can this not be done in the case of the crops identified by FAO? Along with boosting yields, it will also be important to hasten the time before crops can be harvested. Research at the National Institute of Education, Singapore, for instance, shows that certain planting systems and growing environments can shorten grow-out periods. Agricultural transformation will have an important part to play in addressing haze, but this requires farmers, businesses, investors, academia, and governments to play their parts.

First, oil palm is highly profitable and offers higher wages than other crops. The other reason is the short lead time in growing oil palm, which takes three to four years before bearing fruit, with some gestation period before harvesting. This short lead time reduces the risks to investors who wish to invest in oil palm, in comparison to plants such as sago, which takes 10 to 15 years to grow before they can be harvested."]}, {"relevance_score": 84, "title": "Malaysia's palm oil growers fall on hard times", "published": "2019-05-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">KUALA LUMPUR: It has not been a particularly good year for Malaysia's palm oil industry, hammered first by dwindling demand from its traditional markets, and then in March, the European Commission (EC) concluded that palm oil would be phased out from use in transport fuels by 2030 due to environmental concerns. As the world's second largest producer of palm oil, Malaysia has hit back, with politicians calling the EC's decision protectionist and threatening retaliation. On the ground, low palm prices and sustainability are only part of the problems faced by smallholders. They also have to deal with pests and low yield; some are considering whether to repurpose their plantations. Mr Ibrahim Manap, 58, a smallholder in HuluSelangor, said the declaration by the EC that palm oil is \"unsustainable\" is only a political excuse. </p><p>\"They can chop their forests down, but we are (supposed to be) oxygen suppliers. This is not fair,\" Mr Ibrahim said. Mr Ibrahim made the switch from bananas to oil palm seven years ago, after disease wiped out his crops, as well as other banana plantations in the area. READ: Commentary - Palm oil for fighter jets? The illusion of defence in Malaysia \"That time, a tonne of oil palm fruits sold for about RM450 (US$108) to RM540, now it's just above RM320. I still have to deduct labour costs and transport costs, which can come up to RM75 a tonne,\" he said. He harvests about 2.5 to 3.5 tonnes of palm fruits every 20 days from his 1.8ha land. To manage costs, chemical fertiliser - which helps boost the ripening time for oil palm fruits - is made to last three months instead of the usual two. He also uses chicken manure, a cheaper option, to keep the trees healthy. As of December 2018, the total oil palm cultivation area in Malaysia stood at 5.849 million hectares. About half - 2.7 million hectares - are in peninsula Malaysia, while the Bornean states of Sabah and Sarawak has 3.12 million hectares of oil palm plantations. READ: Malaysian minister takes aim at 'sensationalised displays' on palm oil at Singapore Zoo Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said the government has capped the total oil palm plantation area at 6.5 million hectares, adding that no new permanent forest areas or peatland would be allowed to convert to oil palm cultivation. Oil palm production in Malaysia involves several players: private and public-listed companies, government agencies and private smallholders. Independent smallholders manage 16.8 per cent of total oil palm area cultivation (979,892ha), while smallholders organised under the federal government's Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) take up another 12.3 per cent of oil palm land measuring at 717,512ha. It is important for the government to revive the fortunes of the palm oil industry, as it impacts on the livelihoods of many rural voters. HEYDAYS ARE GONE In towns such as Yong Peng in central Johor - the state with the largest area of palm plantation in the peninsula - much of the economy revolves around agriculture. This is evidenced by the number of seedling dealers, repair shops catering for harvesting, and middlemen who collect the harvested fruit and then transport them in multi-tonne lorries to oil processing factories. Local village chief and smallholder Chung Kee Wa said he feels helpless. \"It's not that we don't keep an eye on on the international market, we do, but we know that we can't do much, Malaysia is not the only player on the market,\" he said. The heady days when smallholders could get RM800 a tonne for their harvest are gone, but Mr Chung and other smallholders feel they could still carry on for as long as prices stay above RM300 a tonne. Mr Kong Hwee Chin, 51, said: \"We've also lived through times when the price went below RM70 a tonne. At that point, my father told me to leave the ripe fruits on the trees. We'd lose more money harvesting them.\" A more pressing issue is pests and diseases, which can affect acres of trees and a plantation's productivity for years to come. Mr Chung showed CNA part of his 16ha holding that had been affected by ganoderma fungi. Commonly called \"lingzhi disease\", the fungi is the cause of basal stem rot for palm trees, which will eventually topple the plant. Other pests include bagworms, where one such infestation back in 2012 defoliated some 3,100ha of oil palm plantation in the area. \"Low prices, we can recover from, but if we lose a tree, or a whole acre of trees, it takes a few years again before that piece of land gives any income again, as oil palm seedlings take about three years to mature,\" Mr Chung said. On the other side of the smallholder equation are 112,635 FELDA settlers who come under the Ministry of Economic Affairs. FELDA settlers, many of whom were allotted 4ha of land to carry out cash crop planting in the 1980s, face separate long-standing issues. Settler organisations such as Suara Generasi Kedua FELDA (Voice of the Second Generation of FELDA, SGK2F) and Kami Anak FELDA (We are FELDA Children) have long highlighted how some settlers had gone into debt over late payments and poor land management. This stems from the fact that settlers can choose to have their land managed by FELDA subsidiary FELDA Technoplant, or manage the smallholding themselves. In the case of Mr Rashid Ridha Muhamad, 40, a member of SGK2F, he returned to Terengganu to help manage his father's FELDA allotment. \"Previously, the 4ha land was only able to yield something like five tonnes of harvest at best, under the old management. \"So we decided to run the plantation ourselves. With proper management, it is actually possible to hit 1 tonne per acre. Some can even get over 10 tonnes of harvest for the 4ha lot,\" Mr Rashid said. READ: Malaysia to 'take advantage' of ECRL deal to sell more palm oil to China: Mahathir EU BAN DAMPENS SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS Mr Peter Chang, a director at Wild Asia, said the legislation to phase palm oil out from the EU's pool of transport fuels does hurt efforts to have oil palm grown sustainably. Wild Asia is a sustainability social entreprise that works with plantations to provide sustainability audits and environmental consultation. \"Why bother getting sustainability certification if no one is going to recognise the efforts and what benefits would they get from being certified? But unless there are really clear indications and support from the government, and what would the potential benefits be, such extension efforts (on sustainability) at best would not be welcomed at village level,\" he said. Mr Chang pointed out that to ensure smallholders' livelihoods and at the same time work towards sustainably grown palm oil, cultivation should not be a mono-crop system. Farmers are encouraged to move into integrating other crops such as timber, cocoa, vanilla, coffee and similar cash crops, or even livestock, he said. \"Agroforestry practices will have to be introduced, and the move away from commercial pesticides and weed killers should be encouraged on all fronts,\" said Mr Chang. REPURPOSING AGRICULTURAL LAND The woes are so unsettling that some growers are contemplating giving up palm cultivation. Former IT department head Leslie Ikon, 37, is one of those who are repurposing his agricultural land in Kampung Kiabau in Telupid, Sabah. \"Twenty years ago, setting up your own oil palm plantation was easier for kampong folk. They decide where to plant, start a fire and burn off whatever was on that land and then tanam (grow), some might be more considerate and use their hoe and parang,\" Mr Leslie said. Now, there are regulations barring open burning, while heavy equipment required to level the plot is costly, he said. \"To plant oil palm in a new plot, you need to calculate the cost of manual labour, depending on how many trees you want to cultivate. And then then you need to buy the 'bibit sawit' (saplings) and transport them to your plot, which costs more money,\" he added. Mr Leslie is now looking at replanting his land as a fruit orchard, and stocking a fish pond. \"To me, having a palm plantation is not viable anymore... too much work and money. Plus, there are too many rules and regulations, like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification which also cost money,\" he said. Issues such human-wildlife conflict, sometimes with fatal results, are not uncommon in oil palm estates, where wild boars often come to feed on fallen ripe palm fruit, and elephants also pass through oil palm estates on their way between their familiar grazing grounds. In Sabah, it was revealed last year that 115 Bornean pygmy elephants had been killed between 2010 to 2018, with most of the deaths occured on palm plantations or forest reserves close to such. It was reported in March that the state, after discussions with government bodies, local wildlife scientific community and smallholders, agreed to set up a \"green food corridor\" for the megafauna to forage. PUTRAJAYA SEEKS TO CHANGE MINDSETS Such measures are among the stories Ms Kok aimed to tell during a lobbying trip to Europe to demonstrate that Malaysian palm oil is not the environmental menace its detractors make it out to be. It is important, she said, to see palm oil detractors' point-of-view and also relook at the country's communication strategies. Her ministry planned to open up maps to properly show where Malaysia's oil palm plantations are located so as to counter accusations of forest destruction. On the smallholder front, separate from FELDA's smallholders, Ms Kok said her ministry is pushing for full sustainability in their palm oil supply chain. The government will pay the full costs for auditing and certification for those owning land below 40.46ha. The aim is to achieve 100 per cent certification for the entire value chain under the MSPO certification scheme by 2019, including all palm oil mills, she added. \"If we want to continue selling our oil to the EU market, we must understand what people are thinking. \"The main accusations are deforestation and killing off biodiversity. Now we have to show our side of story to the Western countries,\" Ms Kok said.</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["Mr Chang pointed out that to ensure smallholders' livelihoods and at the same time work towards sustainably grown palm oil, cultivation should not be a mono-crop system.

Between 1990 and 2005, Indonesia lost 28 million hectares of forest.</p><p>Its rainforest cover fell to 49 per cent, from 82 per cent in the 1960s. This sort of alarmism is essential if we are serious about protecting Earth.</p><p>Our ecology involves interaction between humans and the environment, which is not without its political dimensions. There are a number of central problems confronting the ecology of Southeast Asia. One is that environmental problems such as smog are intricately bound up with politics.</p><p>Secondly, the solutions are no less political than technical.</p><p>Politics has to take some of the blame for the smog, to the extent that greed and forest mismanagement resulted in the forest fires of Sumatra and Kalimantan.</p><p>In the 1990s, an estimated 80 per cent of the fires began in oil palm plantations and spread to adjacent wooded areas. These areas had been intensively logged over the years and, as a result, burned very easily.</p><p>In addition, the conversion of forest to cash crops meant that cheap slash-and-burn techniques were used to clear land, increasing the risk of uncontrollable fires.</p><p>The firms said to be involved in the land-clearing responsible for the fires blame the traditional slash-and-burn methods of small farmers. But that method is used to clear very small parcels of land in a way that respects and preserves the environment.</p><p>Rather, it is the large forestry firms that are blamed by ecologists for burning the forests instead of resorting to the more expensive alternatives of machine or manual clearance, or the use of chemicals.</p><p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) points the finger at large logging firms and plantations.</p><p>Many forest fires in Indonesia are started deliberately as \"a weapon in social conflict\", used by large companies to drive out smallholders and by smallholders to retaliate against what they see as injustice, according to a report by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry in Bogor, West Java.</p><p>All this suggests that the problem is far from being a \"natural\" disaster. Far be it for nature to inflict such harm upon herself.</p><p>To the extent that this political dimension of the smog involves a role for civil society, we are then confronted with two other problems.</p><p>One is the lack of alarmism over the short- and long-term seriousness of health damage by the smog. The regional media have generally not discussed the smog as a regional health disaster, although experts have been warning us to this effect.</p><p>Dangerous elements in the smog include lethal substances such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and lead. Short-term effects include dizzy spells, memory disturbances, irregular heartbeat and damage to the nervous system. Long-term effects include low birth weight offspring, infant death, and lowered fertility.</p><p>The effects of sulphur dioxide and lead were also reported, some of which can be very alarming. Hong Kong University pollution expert Prof Anthony Hedley likens the effect of the smog to millions of people in Southeast Asia taking up smoking and predicted tens of thousands of illnesses, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, diseases of blood vessels, and lung and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The other is the problem of anthropocentrism. There is a lack of interest in the broader ecological dimensions of the smog.</p><p>Media coverage of the haze tends to be restricted to its effects on human beings.</p><p>Even after several years of the smog, there is little public awareness of the scale of environmental degradation caused by the forest fires, or the long-term consequences on Southeast Asia's ecosystem and on global climate.</p><p>The massive amounts of carbon dioxide released by the forest and peat fires of Indonesia will contribute to global warming by increasing the rate of \"greenhouse gas\" emissions.</p><p>It was reported that bees and plants were adversely affected by the smog in Malaysia. Several years ago, agriculturalist Zakbah Mian of the National Apiary Centre in Johor discussed how the lack of sunlight during hazy periods affected the ability of bees to feed themselves. The bees usually leave their hives at dawn. During the smog, they wait till the afternoon when visibility is better. With fewer hours to look for food, their growth is affected.</p><p>The smog reveals to us the dark side of industrialisation, development and the so-called \"Asian miracle\". To the extent that there is a political dimension to it, it follows that the solution is also partly political.</p><p>Southeast Asian governments and peoples must go beyond merely admitting that the haze is man-made. It must be seen to be an international ecological disaster.</p><p>The region must bear collective responsibility for it so that governments, the media and citizens can work towards preventing this.

From the economic<br/>perspective, the cost of production of coffee in other countries, for<br/>example Indonesia, is very low, which Malaysian farmers may not be able to<br/>compete against.</p><p>We can encourage the smallholders to plant coffee now, but with Asean<br/>Free Trade Area (Afta) and World Trade Organisation (WTO), our coffee<br/>farmers will face severe competition from imports.</p><p>Hence, we should still place our bets on something that we know best,<br/>namely oil palm.</p><p>The current low price of palm oil is cyclical in nature. We experienced<br/>low prices in 1986 when it went down to below RM600 per tonne and again<br/>this year when the price touched below RM700 per tonne.</p><p>The average prices of palm oil have been hovering between RM800 and<br/>RM1,200 per tonne.</p><p>The year 1998/1999 was an exceptional year when it shot up to RM2,300<br/>per tonne arising from a number of reasons, namely the exchange rate of US<br/>dollar to the ringgit and the relatively tight supply situation then.</p><p>We envisage that the price of palm oil will recover next year as a<br/>result of intensification of efforts to diversify the use and demand for<br/>palm oil, such as for biofuel and the application of biomass. These<br/>efforts will enhance the net return from palm oil.</p><p>The recent announcement by Deputy Primary Industries Minister Datuk<br/>Anifah Aman that the Government has allocated RM350 million for<br/>smallholders to replant their oil palm holdings is good news.</p><p>This is because approximately 300,000 hectares of oil palm plantations<br/>in Malaysia are over 25 years old and are due for replanting. Replanting<br/>is necessary in order for the Malaysian palm oil industry to remain<br/>competitive in the global oils and fats market.</p><p>Malaysia needs to upgrade its oil palm yield level from the present 19.3<br/>tonnes of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) per hectare to 30 tonnes of FFB/ha,<br/>while the oil extraction rate (OER) will need to be increased from 18.6<br/>per cent to more than 20 per cent to improve productivity of the sector.</p><p>This can be achieved by rehabilitating (replanting) the present old palm<br/>areas with new high-yielding clones. With the anticipated higher yield and<br/>extraction rate, together with improved agronomic practices, the oil palm<br/>industry will be able to sustain stiff competition in terms of prices in<br/>the future.</p><p>Although one can argue that the replanting of high yielding clones will<br/>increase the supply of palm oil, thus depressing prices in the future, it<br/>is forecast that with the application of palm oil for alternative purposes<br/>such as for biofuel and other derivatives, other than for the oil and fats<br/>market, oversupply in the future will be addressed. Thus prices can be<br/>maintained at a remunerative level.</p><p>Besides replanting oil palm, the Government is also encouraging<br/>smallholders to undertake agroforestry and cultivate other crops and tree<br/>species to diversity their income sources.</p><p>This includes the cultivation of cash crops (such as vegetables, fruits<br/>and cocoa), medicinal herbs and plants, rubber wood for timber and other<br/>tree species (such as sentang, teak and acacia mangium).</p><p>The author of the letter suggested that teak is a better alternative to<br/>oil palm replanting by the smallholders. However, it has to be noted that<br/>while teak wood can fetch high prices, it nevertheless requires a long<br/>gestation period (more than 30 years) before the wood can be harvested and<br/>sold at these high prices.</p><p>Oil palm, on the other hand, can be harvested within 3 1/2 to four<br/>years, bringing income faster to the smallholders.</p><p>In the final analysis, a detailed study on coffee and teak cultivation<br/>should be undertaken, before recommending that the combination of coffee<br/>and teak be used as an alternative industrial or commercial crop.</p><p>The recommendation should not be based on RM1,000 per month plus<br/>RM300,000 after 25 years for coffee and teak integration only, but should<br/>also be based on returns on investment and sustainable level of income for<br/>both the smallholders and the plantations for a reasonable period of time.<br/></p><p>Hasmah Ahmad<br/>Public Relations Officer<br/>Ministry of Primary Industries<br/>Kuala Lumpur<br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "New Straits Times (Malaysia)", "instances": ["Although one can argue that the replanting of high yielding clones willincrease the supply of palm oil, thus depressing prices in the future, itis forecast that with the application of palm oil for alternative purposessuch as for biofuel and other derivatives, other than for the oil and fatsmarket, oversupply in the future will be addressed.

This feast<br/>or famine cycle reminds one of the days when every other youngster was<br/>directed by their parents or career adviser to go into engineering when<br/>this sector was booming, followed by a bust when there were no more jobs<br/>for them on graduating.</p><p>This time around, if they (or their parents) ignore the job realities,<br/>they have no one to blame but themselves. The Government is doing all it<br/>can to ease the way to more reliable, if less glamorous, careers based on<br/>our own natural resources.</p><p>Nine satellite agricultural centres have been planned around selected<br/>towns to lure city folk and tourists to make day trips there to sample the<br/>good life in a healthful \"rurban\" environment.</p><p>The Sabah Agriculture Park in Tenom has a similar objective. With a<br/>plant museum, recreational lake, a bee centre and animal sanctuary besides<br/>other exhibits, it aims to bring the people closer to agricultural<br/>pursuits.</p><p>In October this year, there will be an important exhibition in Kuala<br/>Lumpur to show investors the economic potential of a new-look agricultural<br/>industry based on modern technology.</p><p>So the face of agriculture is changing rapidly, and for the better. It<br/>is no longer a matter of tickling the soil for a precarious living, but of<br/>modern farm management built on scientific agronomy, as well as synergy to<br/>maximise returns, benefiting from the latest advances in planting,<br/>harvesting and marketing technique.</p><p>Processing of end-products derived from the land is steadily being<br/>extended. Much of it again is through technology. Rubberwood used to be<br/>burnt as fuel. Today, it is the basis of a multimillion dollar industry,<br/>made possible by a breakthrough in Sri Lanka, so one news magazine<br/>reported years back.</p><p>Before then, it had not been possible to cure it properly in kilns on<br/>account of the sap. Other discoveries have been more serendipitous.</p><p>Like the nesting swifts in a few houses in Penang, and now many more in<br/>Sitiawan, where empty houses have been remodelled or built from scratch<br/>for them, complete with alcoves, little nooks and corners, to attract new<br/>migrations for their edible birds nests.</p><p>Fish farming has also had its own fair share of successes, often based<br/>on technological transfer from Taiwan, which is noted for its aquaculture.<br/>Some farmers on their own have thus learned to raise fish fry for export.</p><p>Falling stocks of marine fish everywhere are directing peoples'<br/>attention to inland fisheries as a cheap, and readily accessible source of<br/>food protein.</p><p>Even in America, catfish fillets are beginning to replace salmon in<br/>their fish and chips. A choice dish in many of our seafood restaurants is<br/>the udang galah (giant freshwater prawn). Tilapia (African bream) is also<br/>popular. Both are exported fresh-frozen, tilapia also in salted, smoked<br/>and fillet form.</p><p>When one looks at what has been done with breakfast cereals like corn<br/>flakes and rice puffs, also potato chips, multiplying their intrinsic<br/>value a hundredfold, one is surely justified in thinking that our own food<br/>processing should aim higher, not be content to remain a cottage industry<br/>as much of it is at present.</p><p>My own private gripe is the missed opportunity to launch tapai as a<br/>choice beverage, like Japanese rice wine. The technical and marketing<br/>challenges are of course immense, but so will be the profits, which ought<br/>at least to merit a feasibility study to attract investors.</p><p>Jamaican rum has made the grade; why not our own tipple?

Self-sustenance in food can provide security and extra comfort to<br/>the nation.</p><p>This is why Islam puts a high value on efforts to consolidate<br/>agriculture. Some Muslim scholars have decreed that agriculture take<br/>precedence over other fields of economy.</p><p>Thus, it is not surprising to find ample evidence of a strong emphasis<br/>on agriculture in the history of Islamic civilisation. In fact, a unique<br/>character of the spread of Islam across three continents in the seventh<br/>and eighth centuries was the concomitant diffusion of new crops.</p><p>Diffusion of rice, sorghum, hard wheat (used for pasta), sugar cane,<br/>cotton, watermelon and egg plant meant that these plants came to be grown<br/>throughout the Islamic world. Some proved to be of great economic<br/>importance.</p><p>Moreover, most of these plants were of tropical origin and not easy to<br/>grow in cooler and drier regions, so that their introduction had<br/>revolutionary effects on the whole agricultural system.</p><p>For one thing, farming practices changed. The traditional growing season<br/>had always been winter, with land mostly lying fallow during the summer.</p><p>But now a virtually new agricultural season was opened because many of<br/>the new crops required heat to flourish. Most of the plants referred to<br/>earlier became summer crops.</p><p>Summer crops radically altered the rhythm of the planting seasons.<br/>Previously idle land and labour became more productive. The introduction<br/>of a summer season also saw the emergence of crop rotation. Under the<br/>Roman Byzantine system, the normal practice had been to cultivate the<br/>ground once every two years.</p><p>However, the Muslim-inspired agricultural revolution made it possible to<br/>cultivate the land four times or more, instead of once during every 24-<br/>month period.</p><p>It is true that multiple harvesting reduces the fertility of the land.<br/>To combat this, Muslim manuals on agriculture recommended all kinds of<br/>manure, each with its own special qualities and applications, as well as<br/>the use of ashes, marl and various other materials.</p><p>More ploughing, digging, and hoeing became necessary. Al-Marqrizi, a<br/>15th century scholar, stated that before sugar cane was planted in Egypt<br/>the land had to be ploughed six times.</p><p>Ibn Bassal recommended that ploughing and manuring be done up to 10<br/>times before cotton seed was sown.</p><p>The new crops and their rotation around the seasons meant that more<br/>water was needed.</p><p>Before the rise of Islam the old irrigation systems had already fallen<br/>into decay and irrigated areas had shrunk. In any case, pre-Islamic<br/>methods were inadequate for the new agricultural revolution.</p><p>So the Muslim-led agricultural revolution was accompanied by a complete<br/>review of the whole system. Old irrigation systems were repaired and<br/>extended, and new ones built.</p><p>The technology of water-raising devices and methods of storing,<br/>conveying and distributing water were developed and diffused. Techniques<br/>for prospecting hidden resources, and underground systems or qanats, for<br/>collecting and conveying such water were devised.</p><p>So huge were the strides made by Muslims in agriculture that by the 11th<br/>century there was hardly a river, stream, oasis, spring, aquifer or<br/>predictable flood in the region that went unused.</p><p>This agricultural revolution was not confined to irrigated or fertile<br/>areas, for virtually all categories of land were farmed more intensively.</p><p>Muslim farming manuals had identified more types of soil than the<br/>ancients had done, and by considering not only the types but also its<br/>moisture and temperature, Islamic agriculturists were able to see their<br/>potential more clearly.</p><p>Thus, the novel crops and the new specialised knowledge allowed the<br/>margins of farming to be pushed back into near-desert land which<br/>previously had been used only for sporadic grazing, if at all.</p><p>Such significant activity could not escape the attention of Muslim<br/>scientists, who set about developing the science of agriculture. Important<br/>agricultural manuals were written, among them Kitab al-filaha al-Nabatiyya<br/>of Ibn Wahshiyya.</p><p>Leading books on agricultural science were published in Muslim Spain<br/>during the 11th and 12th centuries and among these were the works of Ibn<br/>al-Hassal and Ibn al-Awwam. Some of these books were translated into<br/>Spanish and Latin and became the inspiration for writings that appeared<br/>later in the West.</p><p>During the 11th century Muslim agronomists in Spain carried out part of<br/>their research in the royal botanical gardens in Toledo and Seville. These<br/>experimental gardens were the first of their kind and were not copied in<br/>the West until the 16th century where they first appeared in the<br/>university cities of northern Italy.</p><p>The Muslims of the past worked hard at agriculture, perhaps inspired by<br/>some of the verses of the Quran, one of which is translated thus:</p><p>\"And in the Earth are tracts diverse though neighbouring and gardens of<br/>vines and fields sown rich with corns, and palm trees growing out of<br/>single roots or otherwise, watered with the same water, yet some of them<br/>We (God) make more excellent than others to eat. Behold, verily, in these<br/>things as they are signs for those who understand.\"</p><p>Thus, in times of either prosperity or hardship, we should not lose<br/>sight of the vital role that the agricultural sector plays. It proved to<br/>be vital to the progress and success of medieval Muslims.

The agricultural sector lags far<br/>behind, at merely 10 per cent.</p><p>Every Malaysian knows that the country aims to achieve fully developed<br/>nation status by the year 2020. But won't 2020 bring about an evergreater<br/>food import bill than before - something that we are have become quite<br/>familiar with, year after year?</p><p>The irony is that manufacturing continues to be an important component<br/>of the national economy, and we continue to be strong in food<br/>manufacturing. Major products targeted for export include sugar, wheat,<br/>flour and baked products, beverages, edible oil, dairy products,<br/>confectionery, fish and seafood products, canned products and processed<br/>meat.</p><p>Yet, while we have made tremendous strides in food processing, we still<br/>lag behind in our agriculture. We are still not able to grow enough food<br/>to meet our consumption needs.</p><p>Little wonder then that the sector plays only a minor role in the<br/>nation's economy.</p><p>After all, it employs only about 16 per cent of the workforce and<br/>accounts for a mere 10 per cent of the national GDP.</p><p>We are constantly reminded that less than six per cent of our land is<br/>arable, with land under irrigation accounting for only 3,500sq km. It is<br/>now almost 50 years since we attained political independence, but we have<br/>yet to attain independence from food imports.</p><p>Our food import bill in 2002 exceeded US$6.5 billion (RM24.7 billion).<br/>We continue to depend on New Zealand for our dairy products, Australia<br/>for our meat, China and Thailand for fresh fruits, Denmark and the United<br/>States for chicken products and Thailand and Indonesia for seafood. The<br/>list does not end there.</p><p>Everybody agrees that we must increase our \"competitive capabilities\"<br/>in food production, but yet we continue to face acute labour shortage,<br/>limited land for agriculture (which we continuously lose to runaway<br/>development) and increasing cost of food production.</p><p>We are told that the country has charted out some strategic moves under<br/>the Third National Agricultural Policy (NAP3, 1998 to 2010). Under this,<br/>ways will be devised to increase agricultural productivity and<br/>competitiveness, expand into new areas and at the same time, maintain the<br/>ability to conserve and utilise natural resources.</p><p>The 12-year plan calls for the development of new growth areas in<br/>agriculture, such as agroforestry, biotechnology, speciality natural<br/>products, floriculture and aquarium fish. Strange as it might seem,<br/>although increased labour productivity is planned for, there is no<br/>definite plan - as far as I am aware - to expand the land base for<br/>agriculture.</p><p>It is here that, to my mind, the global interest in urban agriculture<br/>becomes relevant for our leaders to consider. This idea of integrating or<br/>inserting agriculture with the city, which means changing the urban<br/>landscape, has merit and deserves serious consideration.</p><p>Detractors and skeptics might ask why agriculture should be considered<br/>an urban function? The answer is simple: Urban agriculture is like any<br/>other productive activity that uses space in the city and generates<br/>output.</p><p>Not only does urban agriculture inter-relate with other city functions,<br/>for example housing, promotion of commerce and local Government, it also<br/>improves quality of life by guaranteeing food security, enhancing the<br/>city's image and improving the urban environment.</p><p>Advocates of urban agriculture want it to be considered a permanent<br/>function, not temporary activity. The State should act proactively by<br/>encouraging and generating investments by facilitating and not merely<br/>regulating, while local authorities should act as co-ordinators and<br/>catalysts.</p><p>Obviously, it is necessary to distinguish the different forms of urban<br/>agriculture so they can't fit in with the different zones of the city<br/>landscape - from most developed area in the city centre to the least<br/>developed on the fringes.</p><p>Urban agriculture requires a specific design, adapted to the particular<br/>urban space and environment. Alternative solutions to various problems<br/>that could probably arise, such as water supply, will have to be worked<br/>out in advance.</p><p>Likewise, it is necessary to look at urban agriculture as part of the<br/>physical planning system. Nothing can be done within the city centre<br/>unless and until planning permission has been obtained.</p><p>According to Professor Vikram Bhatt of McGill Univeristy in Montreal,<br/>Canada, modern cities have in the past been regarded merely as \"centres<br/>of food consumption\", with the rural areas perceived as \"centres of food<br/>production\".</p><p>Therefore, the past trend, he said, had been to design and create city<br/>landscapes for their beauty, not utility. However, this should not be<br/>allowed to go on indefinitely.</p><p>Today, Bhatt said, many kinds of urban agriculture exist around the<br/>world, from balcony gardens to poultry farms.</p><p>At a World Urban Forum held recently in Barcelona, Spain, McGill<br/>University and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC)<br/>announced the launch of a new global research initiative that may very<br/>well have major impact on how leaders and planners design and create<br/>cities of the future.</p><p>When completed, this three-year old collaborative project called<br/>\"Making the Edible Landscape\" will, hopefully, demonstrate the value of<br/>including urban agriculture as a permanent feature in city planning and<br/>housing design. The research will be undertaken in Colombo (Sri Lanka),<br/>Kampala (Uganda) and Rosario (Argentina).</p><p>The sites were chosen by a competitive process to reflect global<br/>biodiversity as well as different ways of combining living, working and<br/>growing food within the city. The lessons from the three test sites,<br/>Bhatt said, will \"enrich cityscapes of the future, both in the North and<br/>South\".</p><p>In each of the sites, city officials, architects and urban planners<br/>will form a collaborative team that will work closely with local<br/>communities. Researchers will test housing designs that incorporate<br/>food-producing gardens to demonstrate the potential of urban agriculture.</p><p>The results of this research initiative will be made known at the 2006<br/>UN-Habitat World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada.</p><p>If you have not made any holiday plans for next year, make a note of it<br/>in your diary.</p><p>Salleh Buang is senior advisor of a company specialising in competitive<br/>intelligence.

Industrial-strength rubber<br/>trees and the dainty misai kuching herb plants don't cut it as a pair.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But an experiment to make brave bed-fellows of them and create seemingly<br/>incongruous green scenarios may rewrite the fortunes of suffering<br/>smallholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Sungai Buloh, researchers of the Rubber Research Institute of<br/>Malaysia (RRIM) and the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development<br/>Institute (Mardi) are having a go at agro-forestry - the science of<br/>blending agriculture and forestry to make the best use of land, enhance<br/>environmental resilience and offer people like rubber smallholders a<br/>second income.</p><p>In the experiment, they have planted assorted indigenous herbs - like<br/>tongkat ali, hempudu bumi, kacip fatimah, misai kuching and mengkudu -<br/>between rows of rubber trees. Their quest is to create a system which<br/>smallholders can profit from, no matter what rubber prices are. Why herbs?<br/>Because they are non-traditional crops with potential.</p><p>Agro-forestry is like intercropping - combining two or more crops in a<br/>single field - which farmers do traditionally.</p><p>Intercropping in rubber smallholdings has been done before with oil<br/>palm, fruit trees, cocoa, coffee, fish and livestock. Some have worked.<br/>For the most part, these were informal arrangements which could not be<br/>sustained.</p><p>Neither the concept of agro-forestry nor its practice is new, except<br/>that around the world, researchers are developing this ancient art into a<br/>science.</p><p>\"It began with the consciousness that agriculture needs biodiversity,\"<br/>says plant physiologist Mohamad Senawi Mohamad Tamin, deputy director at<br/>Mardi's Strategic Resources Research Centre. \"Scientists now agree that<br/>every hectare needs a well-balanced ecosystem with enough biological<br/>controls to make agriculture sustainable.\"</p><p>In other parts of the world, two decades of environmental awareness and<br/>calls for sustainable agriculture led to programmes that encouraged crop<br/>farmers to introduce trees to their fields.</p><p>Agro-forestry's primary argument is that billions of trees on millions<br/>of small-scale farms would be a sustainable solution to a variety of<br/>environmental problems.</p><p>These trees could produce fruit, nuts, oils, resins, cosmetics, even<br/>timber, and do things like sequester carbon, stabilise watersheds and<br/>conserve soils.</p><p>In Malaysia, it is the other way around. We already have huge tracts of<br/>land occupied by plantation trees, most of it on our best soils.</p><p>If rubber is viewed as the forestry component, then it would be a matter<br/>of introducing the \"agro\" part into plantations. Separately, researchers<br/>at the Forest Research Institute in Kepong are experimenting with oil palm<br/>trees.</p><p>But it isn't as simple as it sounds. That's why intercropping by<br/>traditional farmers has never been sustainable.</p><p>Ideally, a hectare of rubber should have about 450 trees, the rows<br/>typically six metres apart. This figure is derived from a tapper's ability<br/>to work the trees. This means that as much as 80 per cent of that hectare<br/>is idle because it's not occupied by rubber trees. The Third National<br/>Agriculture Policy pointed out such \"idle\" land when it called for optimum<br/>land use, and agro-forestry fell into place.</p><p>\"But in narrow channels of six metres, the competition for light, water<br/>and nutrients would be severe,\" says Abdul Ghani Ibrahim, a plant<br/>physiologist at the Malaysian Rubber Board.</p><p>Rubber trees' big canopies create a lot of shade which rules out sun-<br/>loving crop plants. When rubber trees start wintering (leaf shedding),<br/>shade-loving plants below would be scorched.</p><p>\"Space can be created by changing the layout of the rows,\" says Abdul<br/>Ghani. \"We have developed several planting systems to suit intercropping<br/>or agro-forestry. Many smallholders have already planted this way.\"</p><p>Among the layout styles are rubber trees only on the perimeter of the<br/>plot with a huge area in the middle available for other plants. Or<br/>hedgerows of two or three rows of rubber, then a gap of 20 metres or more<br/>for the crop plant, and repeat that. That would solve the sunlight<br/>problem.</p><p>\"Having created the airspace, we need to see what happens underground,\"<br/>says soil scientist Zainol Eusof, head of crop management at the Malaysian<br/>Rubber Board.</p><p>\"Rubber roots spread prolifically and gobble up soil nutrients. In this<br/>shared space, we need to know exactly how much the second crop plant will<br/>need to thrive profitably. It's likely that fertilisers will still be<br/>needed, the question is how and how much.\"</p><p>It doesn't stop there. \"There's also crop interaction,\" says Mohamad<br/>Yusof Abdullah, a plant ecophysiologist at Mardi.</p><p>\"Would one plant actually pose a danger to the other, or be enough of a<br/>hindrance to affect profit?\"</p><p>These are important questions because the answers lie at the heart of<br/>intercropping's poor history: Would the chemical cues emitted by one plant<br/>disorientate the other? Would one plant be the breeding ground of the pest<br/>that will devastate the other crop?</p><p>The questions can get deeper: Would a fungus hanging around a non-food<br/>crop, say rubber, be toxic to consumers of the other crop, say tomatoes,<br/>which people eat? Would the useful pollinating insect of one plant be the<br/>locust of the other?</p><p>Mardi entomologist Mohamad Rani Mat Yusoh, who studies the ecology of<br/>bugs, is looking at precisely that.</p><p>\"Ideally, the insects should be working for us,\" he says. \"I think there<br/>is real scope for that in agro-forestry. After years of mono-culture, this<br/>drive will break up the gangs of pests.\"</p><p>In monoculture, a single pest (insects, fungi, viruses and bacteria) can<br/>wipe out an entire farming belt because all the plants have the same<br/>anatomy, same chemical cues and same resistance profile. In such a uniform<br/>environment, bugs multiply prolifically.</p><p>But most pests are crop and species specific. Plant a different species<br/>in the next row and the bug stops there.</p><p>\"Agro-forestry brings farming closer to nature,\" says Mohamad Rani, \"and<br/>that means diversity. A complex community of bugs and plants creates a<br/>hierarchy. You could say that insects get a little distracted by so many<br/>smells and chemical cues that they can barely recognise their target<br/>plant. Besides, bugs have wars amongst themselves.\"</p><p>That's one idea. Another, to create deliberate pesticide-free refuges<br/>within a field, may be easier to do.</p><p>In these zones, insects gather in concentrations. While it's true that<br/>those few square metres are a write-off, the rest of the field is bug-<br/>free.</p><p>\"Once a balance is struck, you can gradually reduce pesticide use,\" says<br/>Mohamad Rani. \"Agro-forestry encourages big picture thinking.

Other<br/>than the capital investment, he says, all it needs is good marketing and<br/>some entrepreneurial derring-do. The conditions are ripe - the expertise<br/>is readily available, the technology can be developed, the land is begging<br/>to be cultivated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Azmy is a senior research officer at the Forest Research Institute of<br/>Malaysia (FRIM) in Kepong, Kuala Lumpur. He has done extensive work on<br/>bamboo silviculture and management for nearly 15 years. He is convinced<br/>that, from the commercial standpoint alone, it has a great future in the<br/>country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Azmy, there is more to bamboo than just commerce. It can be<br/>made into high-value wood-substitute products. With greater awareness of<br/>forest conservation and in view of depleting timber resources, Azmy feels<br/>that now is the time to fully exploit this ubiquitous Malaysian plant.</p><p>It's a fact that bamboo is the fastest growing and most productive<br/>forest resource in the world. The 70 species found in Malaysia thrive<br/>anywhere and everywhere - in deep and jungle fringes and along sandy<br/>lowland river banks; anywhere not water-logged.</p><p>Bamboo shoots are also a source of great nutritious value in the diets<br/>of the rural populace. Its demand has grown such that Malaysia has had to<br/>import them from China, Thailand and Taiwan for over 30 years now.</p><p>The magic of the bamboo is in its versatility. In the days of yore, a<br/>bamboo clump could provide everything needed to build a rural house -<br/>bamboo stilts, matted bamboo splits for floors and walls, roof rafters,<br/>etc.</p><p>It also provided the material for fencing, bridges, chicken coops,<br/>animal traps, baskets, water conduits and kitchen utensils - effectively<br/>almost everything required for daily use by rural folk. It even provided<br/>for recreational uses, from musical instruments like the bamboo flute and<br/>angklung, to the frame for the Kelantanese kite.</p><p>But today the humble bamboo has gone on to greater things. By virtue of<br/>its physical and mechanical properties, bamboo can be made into high-value<br/>building products such as floor boards, panels, parquet and laminates.</p><p>In China, bamboo pulp has even been converted into paper. China has a<br/>thriving bamboo industry with a reported export earning (in 1995) of<br/>US$439 million (RM1.67 billion).</p><p>India has already launched a 15-year plan to develop a bamboo industry<br/>with a vision to attain its \"rightful place in the world bamboo scenario\".<br/>It hopes to achieve this through carefully planned promotion strategies,<br/>attracting investments, increasing bamboo productivity and enhancement of<br/>new products.</p><p>Even the European Community has gotten into the bamboo act. It is<br/>funding a body called the Bamboo Thematic Network to \"integrate the goals<br/>of research and industry\u2026 for the sustainable development of bamboo<br/>resources and industries\".</p><p>It's a shame that in Malaysia the vast economic potential of bamboo<br/>cultivation has not been explored. Small- and medium-sized bamboo<br/>enterprises, with low capital investments, could be set up to produce<br/>industrial, commercial and household goods for the domestic as well as the<br/>export markets. This is an untapped area where FRIM can step in.</p><p>Based on FRIM's research and experience, bamboo can be exploited as a<br/>potential plant for cultivation either on a small scale or large<br/>plantation basis. This can be done by rehabilitating Malaysian forests<br/>that have been scarred by timber logging.</p><p>Azmy reveals some pertinent facts about Malaysian forests: about 19.4<br/>million hectares (59 per cent) of the country's total land area are under<br/>forests. Approximately 11.2 million hectares of the permanent forest<br/>reserves are earmarked as \"production forests\", that is, areas that are<br/>commercially logged on a rotational cycle under the sustained-yield<br/>management system.</p><p>\"Timber has been an important export earner for decades. But due to<br/>continuous logging, and without concerted reafforestation efforts, timber<br/>supply has dwindled to such an extent that it is now hardpressed to meet<br/>the growing demands of the wood-based industry,\" claims Azmy.</p><p>He further adds: \"With greater appreciation of the protective roles of<br/>natural forests, there is now tremendous pressure to conserve them. For<br/>example, the authorities have reduced the logging quota while more forests<br/>have been gazetted as permanent areas.\"</p><p>Hence the reason why Azmy is all for bamboo replacing timber in the<br/>manufacture of higher-end products like furniture and building components.<br/>This can indirectly save forest areas from heavy timber extraction.</p><p>\"It is timely to introduce bamboo as a timber substitute. Even the<br/>supply of rubber wood for furniture-making is decreasing,\" he says.</p><p>Azmy points to the abundance of natural stand bamboos in former logging<br/>areas. The total estimated area of bamboo in forest compartments is<br/>421,722ha, accounting for 6.9 per cent of Malaysia's forested land.<br/>Pahang, Kelantan and Perak have the largest number of natural bamboo<br/>stands, covering 278,000ha between them.</p><p>\"If natural bamboo stands exceed more than 70 per cent of other<br/>vegetations such as secondary growth timber in exlogging areas, then it is<br/>wiser to exploit the bamboo instead of timber for second felling,\" he<br/>asserts.</p><p>\"There are also forest areas where the natural timber stand is of poor<br/>quality. Such areas can be rehabilitated with bamboo as a means to<br/>optimise land productivity.\"</p><p>Towards that end, Azmy highlights the suitability of bamboo as a plant<br/>that could be introduced as one of the priority species in agroforestry.<br/>He says that by intercropping bamboo with forest trees, for both its shoot<br/>and culm (stem), land yield can be maximised.</p><p>\"Bamboo shoots and culms can be harvested at about three to four years<br/>following planting. The production continues for about 20 years or more if<br/>properly maintained. It would make an ideal crop during the period of 30<br/>years or more before timber tree species could be harvested,\" says Azmy.</p><p>Bamboo is also excellent for soil conservation and erosion control.<br/>According to Azmy, its net-like root system creates an effective mechanism<br/>for watershed protection, stitching soil particles together along fragile<br/>riverbanks and deforested areas.</p><p>Furthermore, its uniquely shaped leaves and dense litter on the ground<br/>suggest it can greatly reduce rainfall runoff, thus preventing massive<br/>soil erosion. So what can be done to enhance the bamboo sector<br/>economically?</p><p>Azmy is confident that bamboo cultivation in Malaysia can be successful<br/>if there is proper planning and co-ordinated efforts from the very<br/>beginning, especially since one is dealing with large hectares of land.</p><p>\"Existing land policies and procedures pertaining to forest lands need<br/>to be reviewed to enable bamboo cultivation by private concerns on<br/>unproductive forest lands.\"</p><p>Azmy suggests that existing bamboo stands in the forests can be leased<br/>to private entrepreneurs for say, 30 years, subject to a fiveyear period<br/>lease renewal.</p><p>\"There must be greater promotion of bamboo as a commercial plant in the<br/>country. This could be more effective with the help of the agrobased<br/>industries. Various quality product designs should be introduced.</p><p>\"Government incentives to encourage the rehabilitation of forests with<br/>bamboo will go a long way to develop the local bamboo industry. Rural<br/>community forestry, supervised by an agro-based agency, can also be<br/>instituted in such rehabilitations. In the process, it provides some<br/>employment opportunities.\"</p><p>Azmy reveals that FRIM is ever ready to assist in technical consultancy.<br/>\"We're open to joint ventures with the private sector. So far we've had<br/>some enquiries. Most want to adopt a 'wait-and-see' attitude\".</p><p>\"We must seize the opportunity. There are billions of dollars going<br/>round the global bamboo market.

Still, more and<br/>more Malaysians are appreciating the rationale for growing most of their<br/>food.</p><p>Even so, the agricultural sector must deal with several challenges if it<br/>is to play a meaningful role in national development. They include labour<br/>shortage, rising wage rate, competition in the use of land and water<br/>resources and the high food import bill.</p><p>With the globalisation of trade, agriculture cannot be viewed solely as<br/>a national sector and Malaysia must be able to compete with other<br/>countries.</p><p>\"The Third NAP seeks to address these issues with a view to transforming<br/>the agricultural sector into a vibrant component of the national economy,\"<br/>says Agriculture Department director of planning Abdul Kadir Abdul Hadi.</p><p>The food sector contributed about RM4.34 billion to the gross domestic<br/>product in 1995.

Hamid Zakri, former deputy<br/>vice-chancellor of Universiti KebangsaanMalaysia, as co-chairman of the<br/>MA Board.</p><p>Hamid, currently head of the Institute of Advanced Studies at United<br/>Nations University, Tokyo, recalls the misgivings that were expressed when<br/>the MA idea was first mooted in Malaysia.</p><p>\"The MA is not only a scientific, technical exercise; it affects the<br/>very essence of our social, political and economic life,\" he says.</p><p>Hamid points to the haze in 1997 that engulfed the ASEAN skies due to<br/>forest fires in Indonesia to illustrate the consequences of ecosystem<br/>damage by injudicious slash-and-burn agricultural practices. Airplanes<br/>were grounded, schools closed and a state of emergency declared in<br/>Sarawak.</p><p>\"Malaysia is one of the world's mega biodiversity areas. But no<br/>comprehensive, integrated assessment of her rich and varied ecosystems has<br/>yet been conducted.\"</p><p>\"This MA now presents a unique opportunity for us to take stock of our<br/>ecosystem, its current condition and what we need to do to arrest its<br/>decline, if not enhance it, in our pursuit for development. The MA is<br/>certainly relevant and there are lots that Malaysia and its neighbours can<br/>contribute vis-a-vis the assessment,\" says Hamid.</p><p>\"In addition, the MA process will eventually involve local experts,<br/>especially at sub-global or national assessment level,\" says Hamid.</p><p>\"Ultimately the exercise is something that we hope countries want to<br/>replicate on their own; to periodically assess the health of ecosystems in<br/>their respective national spheres,\" he says.</p><p>The importance of the MA is further emphasised by Dr Klaus Topfer,<br/>executive director of the UN Environment Programme, who likened it to an<br/>inventory check.</p><p>\"At the beginning of this new millennium, we need to take stock of the<br/>condition of the earth's ecosystems and to the goods and services it<br/>provides for mankind,\" says Topfer, in reference to the water, food,<br/>timber and other resources ecosystems provide to sustain human existence,<br/>on top of functions such as climate and erosion control that they perform.</p><p>Topfer echoes the warning by PAGE of the \"declining capacity of<br/>ecosystems to produce many of the goods and services we depend on\".</p><p>\"With increased baseline knowledge, and conscious of the need for<br/>sustainable development, policy makers are informed of what has changed,<br/>or is changing, in the ecosystem; have the changes been for the better or<br/>worse; what to change and how much, in order to sustain those goods and<br/>services the ecosystems provide.\"</p><p>Topfer feels it is crucial governments are drawn into the MA process for<br/>a successful integration of science and politics. The MA would just be an<br/>academic exercise if governments were not active participants.</p><p>Hamid agrees. \"There is already a direct government involvement in the<br/>MA process via the conventions on biodiversity, desertification and<br/>wetlands, through which governments have voiced support.\"</p><p>In Malaysia's case, Hamid hopes to engage the newly-constituted National<br/>Biodiversity Council into the national level of the MA process.<br/>Ultimately, the sustainability of ecosystems is everyone's responsibility.</p><p>As Topfer puts it: \"It is extremely important to have a sense of<br/>ownership of ecosystems by the people. We cannot protect Nature against<br/>people; we can integrate Nature with and for the people. Integrating<br/>people is just as crucial as it is to integrate governments into the MA<br/>process.\"</p><p>The crunch, however, will be when the MA is completed in 2004 and the<br/>adoption and implementation phases begin.

Azmi was but a young boy then, living in Batu Pahat. It was<br/>an exciting time for villagers in the area. The World Bank had approved a<br/>large sum of money for a massive agricultural project in southwest Johor -<br/>and many villagers became smallholders. Development was moving in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"At that time, all the good land had been taken up by the colonialists,\"<br/>says Azmi. \"The only land around us that was suitable for agriculture were<br/>the peat swamps.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peat swamp forests are water-logged areas so the Department of<br/>Irrigation and Drainage had to drain them to make it possible to plant<br/>rubber, pineapple and other cash crops.</p><p>The villagers put in many hours sowing seeds and tending to the young<br/>plants. The rubber trees grew and grew.</p><p>Then a funny thing happened.</p><p>The peat soil began to subside and the roots of the rubber trees became<br/>exposed. When the winds came, the trees ended up in a slant because the<br/>roots had no grip in the soil.</p><p>Other strange phenomena were observed.</p><p>The water in the pond and drains became hard because of the acid<br/>sulphate content in some of the peat areas.</p><p>Fish don't like hard water and the villagers lost a cheap and reliable<br/>source of protein.</p><p>The people had difficulty bathing and washing clothes because hard water<br/>does not make suds out of soap.</p><p>The village wells were contaminated, too. Azmi had to travel to town in<br/>a taxi, with his mother, to buy drinking water. For bathing and other<br/>uses, huge clay jars were used to collect rain water. However, during the<br/>dry season, villagers had to travel far to get clean water.</p><p>\"On weekends, I would travel by bicycle for three to four kilometres to<br/>get water from the Semenung River. It was a difficult journey - we had to<br/>travel through estates and there were lots of big drains to cross. The<br/>bridge over the drains was just a narrow slab. We had to balance our<br/>bicycles, loaded with water cans.\"</p><p>Azmi says that many years later, even after piped water was installed,<br/>there were still traces of hardness in the water.</p><p>Crop yield was low in the areas where there was acid sulphate in the<br/>soil and trees were uprooting easily. Houses sank and drains cracked. A<br/>school built on piles needed a ladder to get in the front door as the peat<br/>soil subsided. Then, because the drainage caused the peat to become dry,<br/>there was one raging peat fire during a particularly dry season that<br/>turned out to be a nightmare for many smallholders, including Azmi's<br/>father.</p><p>\"I remember we had to wake up at night to stop the fires spreading,\"<br/>says Azmi. \"Because the fire was deep in the ground (in peat fires, the<br/>burning takes place deep in the ground), we had to dig a trench around the<br/>fire to stop it. Then we hoped and prayed that there would be no winds.\"</p><p>Azmi says many smallholders lost their crops which were then replanted.</p><p>The drama went on for a good 10-12 years in what was the West Johor<br/>Integrated Agricultural Development Project. The first phase of the<br/>project involved the drainage of various pockets of peat swamps, starting<br/>from the south of Muar all the way to Pontian.</p><p>\"Back then the two important and natural functions of peat swamp forests<br/>- storing of floodwaters and preventing saline intrusion - were not<br/>recognised,\" says Faizal Parish of the Global Environment Facility.</p><p>Such forests are formed in areas where litter (like leaves, twigs and<br/>branches) fall to the ground but do not decay because the ground is<br/>waterlogged, salty or contains crystals of ion sulphide. Layer upon layer<br/>of litter builds upon each other until a deep organic, yet infertile mass<br/>is formed.</p><p>Such areas help reduce floods, are a storehouse for water supply as in<br/>most wetlands and make a home for many plants and animals.</p><p>When peat swamps are drained of their water, the area will become flood<br/>prone or if it is already a flood-prone area, it could become more<br/>extreme.</p><p>\"There are two reasons for this,\" says Parish. \"The land surface,<br/>already low, when drained, will drop lower, to below sea level. Secondly,<br/>it has lost its water storing capacity and as such its function in<br/>absorbing excess water.\"</p><p>In some areas, there is a high content of sulphide, particularly in clay<br/>soil. All is well as long as this soil remains covered with water.<br/>However, when the peat is removed, it is replaced by mud which contains a<br/>lot of oxygen. The sulphide then reacts with the oxygen to produce<br/>hydrogen sulphide, which is basically a watered-down version of battery<br/>water.</p><p>\"This means the quality of the water is destroyed and the crops and<br/>plants will die with the new pH,\" Parish says.</p><p>When peat swamps are first drained, they will drop about one metre<br/>because the swamp is made up of 95 per cent organic material which is very<br/>porous and the water flows out of it very quickly. \"After this initial<br/>consolidation, oxidisation and mineralisation will take place and the<br/>surface of the peat will continue to subside 3.5cm to 6cm a year,\" says Dr<br/>Salmah Zakaria, director for corporate development at the Department of<br/>Irrigation and Drainage. Having done her doctorate thesis on peat swamp<br/>forests in Pontian, she is an authority on the subject.</p><p>This is why, as in the case of Azmi's village, structures built on peat<br/>swamps ended up hanging in the air and tree crops became uprooted.</p><p>When drained, peat swamp forests are also a fire hazard because of their<br/>high organic content of well-preserved wood chips, leaves and twigs.<br/>During the dry season, the organic material which goes many metres into<br/>the ground becomes fuel for fire. This is why it takes time to put out a<br/>peat fire.</p><p>Peat swamps are also not suited for agriculture if you are going to<br/>drain it too much. \"For optimal yield, you need to keep the water table<br/>50-70cm below the surface where the roots are,\" says Parish. \"Otherwise,<br/>the crops don't get enough water.\"</p><p>In Johor, big drains were built in anticipation of floods, resulting in<br/>a lot of water being removed from the peat swamp forests. In the dry<br/>season, many areas became water stressed.</p><p>Salmah explains that the West Johor project was a pilot one in many<br/>aspects. This is why there were some trial-and-error problems. However,<br/>the DID was able to take stock of the problems and mitigate them, learning<br/>as it went along the best practices for managing reclaimed peat swamp<br/>forests.</p><p>The DID built an embankment with a tidal gate to prevent sea water<br/>intrusion. It built a structure on every one of the previous drains to<br/>control water so that only part of the water drained out. With this, it<br/>was able to keep the peat wet and this prevented the surface from<br/>subsiding further.</p><p>What happened in West Johor ended up being a lesson for many of the<br/>stakeholders and agencies involved. A study was carried out by Mardi which<br/>concluded that forestry and agroforestry be the priority for land use.<br/>After that, there was no large- scale land conversion of peat swamps in<br/>Peninsular Malaysia.</p><p>In fact, the Government has taken steps to protect such areas. For<br/>instance, in 2001, the Government signed an agreement with the United<br/>Nations Development Programme, the Global Environment Facility and the<br/>Danish International Development Agency to start the \"Conservation and<br/>Sustainable Use of Tropical Peat Swamp Forests and Associated Wetland<br/>Ecosystems\" project.</p><p>The five-year project is aimed at ensuring conservation and sustainable<br/>use of peat swamp forests. It is currently being demonstrated at three<br/>sites: the Loagan Bunut National Park in Sarawak, the Klias Peninsula in<br/>Sabah and the South-East Pahang Peat Swamp Forest.</p><p>This proactive move was perhaps due to the realisation that reclaiming<br/>peat swamps in an unsustainable way had more negative impacts than<br/>positive ones.</p><p>\"To reclaim peat swamp forests requires substantial investments, both in<br/>capital and maintenance,\" says Salmah. Instead, she recommends that the<br/>drainage of peatland be approached prudently, in the manner that offshore<br/>land reclamation has been approached, It must also be accompanied with<br/>assessments of environmental impacts, which unless properly identified and<br/>mitigated, will be very costly.</p><p>Parish, too, feels that it is more expensive to develop and manage peat<br/>swamps than to conserve them. There are just too many repercussions, he<br/>says, from reclaiming them.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is the farmers who suffer from floods and<br/>fire, \"and nobody subsidises them when this happens. They also don't have<br/>the scientific knowledge to deal with the problems that may arise.\"</p><p>And as the forest fires in 1997/98 showed, the rest of Malaysia will not<br/>be immune to the negative consequences of developing peat swamps.</p><p>On the other hand, maintaining peat swamp forests is highly rewarding in<br/>the long term. \"It helps mitigate climate change on a global level,\" says<br/>Parish. One hectare of peat stores 10-20 times more carbon dioxide<br/>compared to one hectare of dry land forest. If converted and drained, 50-<br/>100 tonnes of CO2 per year per hectare is released.</p><p>A protected or sustainably used peat swamp forest has potential for<br/>ecotourism, acts as a flood control mechanism, stores water and preserves<br/>the biodiversity there. Horrid peat fires can also be prevented.</p><p>However, Salmah says that while conserving peat swamps is important, we<br/>also have to be pragmatic. Some areas need to be developed and there are<br/>ways of developing them sustainably.</p><p>While it is possible to do that, she cautions that any development of a<br/>peatland should be integrated and holistic. Peat swamp forests are usually<br/>formed in clusters of basins, and if one part of it is to be developed,<br/>the whole should be drained. One should also take into consideration all<br/>activities taking place in the basin before considering it for<br/>development.</p><p>For instance, within the North Langat River Basin lies the Paya Indah<br/>Wetlands which is due to be gazetted as a protected reserve. Any draining<br/>of any part of the basin will affect the wetland or even destroy it. \"This<br/>is because it is contiguous with the other peat deposit in North Langat.<br/>Draining one part will affect the whole,\" Salmah says.</p><p>She says land authorities need to be more careful when they alienate<br/>land for development. \"We cannot alienate land without knowing the<br/>physical and chemical properties of the soil. Peat land is different from<br/>the mineral soil around it and thus needs to be managed differently.\"</p><p>Consideration also needs to be given to the fact that peat land cannot<br/>be rehabilitated, at least there is no scientific evidence currently to<br/>say it can be done.</p><p>After all, one metre of peat takes 6,000 years to form.</p><p>Salmah says that at the end of the day, any thought of developing a peat<br/>swamp forest should involve all the stakeholders, who need to work<br/>together within a common platform. Then, with the right input, the<br/>authorities can proceed, making an informed decision.</p><p>Meanwhile, Azmi acknowledges that the livelihood of the people in the<br/>West Johor project was jeopardised by the lack of knowledge of the impact<br/>of draining a peat swamp.</p><p>However, he said the development was necessary at that time, to improve<br/>the livelihood of the people. \"This stopped them from migrating in search<br/>of a better life. It allowed townships to grow and economic opportunities<br/>were made available for them.\"</p><p>In this, Salmah agrees. She says it's all a matter of how you do it and<br/>where you do it.<br/>The writer can be contacted at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sarah_s@nstp.com.my\">sarah_s@nstp.com.my</email><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "New Straits Times (Malaysia)", "instances": ["With this, itwas able to keep the peat wet and this prevented the surface fromsubsiding further.
