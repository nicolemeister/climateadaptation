Yet in practice, many struggle to recover swiftly or comprehensively.</p><p>While 72 per cent of respondents believe they can resume operations within five days of a cyber incident, nearly a quarter expect full recovery within just 24 hours. In contrast, IT leaders reported that a minimum level of business operation typically takes at least three to four weeks to restore.</p><p>Worse still, only 30 per cent of organisations test all mission-critical workloads as part of their incident response plans (IRPs), leaving large gaps in cyber recovery readiness.

Or has it been more of a boutique advisory institution, heard selectively and conveniently by policymakers when alignment suits?</p><p>The challenges that linger</p><p>Despite its achievements, ASM faces several structural and operational challenges if it is to claim - and sustain - the mantle of a true change maker.</p><p>One is about maintaining independence in a politicised environment. The Malaysian policy ecosystem has, for decades, been characterised by the politicisation of expertise.</p><p>The risk for any government-linked body is the temptation to play it safe.</p><p>ASM must guard its independence vigorously, ensuring its advice remains evidence-based, candid, and unafraid to challenge the status quo - even when politically inconvenient.</p><p>Bridging science and society is a challenge. While ASM has been relatively successful in engaging the government, its footprint among the Malaysian public remains modest.</p><p>In an era where misinformation and pseudoscience spread rapidly, a thought leader must also be a public educator. ASM must broaden its outreach, becoming a household name associated with credible, accessible science communication, especially on controversial issues like climate change, vaccines, and emerging technologies.</p><p>Funding and talent sustainability continue to be a concern. Sustainable, apolitical funding remains a chronic issue for most academies in developing countries.</p><p>ASM must diversify its revenue base, perhaps through partnerships, endowments, and commissioned studies, to maintain operational independence and attract top-tier, diverse expertise beyond the conventional academic establishment.</p><p>Reinventing for the next generation remains an important agenda. The Academy's Fellow demographic still skews towards senior academics, many of whom have spent careers in public universities.</p><p>While their experience is invaluable, ASM must actively create pathways for young, diverse voices - including social scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs, and civic scientists - to shape national discourse.</p><p>Many agree ASM should become a convenor of difficult conversations.</p><p>Moving forward, Malaysia's biggest challenges - from energy transition to artificial intelligence ethics to food security - demand interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral deliberations.</p><p>ASM is uniquely positioned to convene these difficult, and often contentious, conversations. But it must be prepared to navigate political sensitivities, institutional inertia, and public scepticism.</p><p>The path forward</p><p>The time is ripe for ASM to reimagine its role not just as an advisor, but as a national conscience for science, technology, and innovation.</p><p>Its next chapter should see it adopting a more activist stance: proactively setting national agendas, identifying blind spots in policy, and mobilising scientific communities towards socially inclusive outcomes.</p><p>ASM must also invest in storytelling - framing science not as abstract, elite knowledge, but as a lived, daily experience that touches livelihoods, aspirations, and fears of ordinary Malaysians.</p><p>Only then can it earn the trust capital needed to be a genuine change maker.</p><p>In marking its 30th year, ASM stands at a strategic crossroads. It has history, credibility, and a platform.</p><p>Whether it evolves into a bold, independent, and people-centred academy, or remains a polite policy appendage, depends on its willingness to embrace discomfort, dissent, and diversity in pursuit of national progress.</p><p>That, ultimately, will decide if ASM will shape Malaysia's future - or merely comment on it. At the end of the day, ASM must strive to deliver its tagline, Think Science, Celebrate Technology and Inspire Innovation.</p><p>* Prof Datuk Dr Ahmad Ibrahim is affiliated with the Tan Sri Omar Centre for STI Policy Studies at UCSI University and is an associate fellow at the Ungku Aziz Centre for Development Studies, Universiti Malaya.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

The region is not just weary of increased militarization-it is actively rejecting Washington's insistence that defense budgets be inflated at the expense of economic recovery and long-term stability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is an inherent contradiction in Trump's demands.</p><p>A president who places tariffs on allies-from Japan to South Korea to even Southeast Asian nations-cannot reasonably expect those same countries to increase military procurement from the United States. The message from Washington is one of transactional loyalty, not strategic partnership. And in Asia, where historical memory is long and national budgets are tight, such coercive diplomacy rarely works.</p><p>Strategic Mistrust Cloaked as Defense Diplomacy</p><p>The push for higher defense spending has long been a hallmark of US foreign policy, particularly under Republican administrations that view military preponderance as a symbol of leadership. Trump's doctrine-though lacking a coherent strategy-is clear in its intent: to boost American arms exports and reduce the US security burden by compelling others to foot the bill. However, the underlying tone of Washington's approach under Trump is steeped in mistrust.</p><p>By questioning the reliability of alliances and imposing punitive tariffs even on long-standing partners, Trump has eroded the very strategic trust necessary for such defense cooperation.</p><p>Asian states are acutely aware that accepting US weapons often comes with strings attached-operational constraints, technology limitations, political conditionality, and long-term maintenance dependencies. Moreover, many of these nations are engaged in delicate balancing acts between China and the United States. A sudden uptick in American arms purchases could be seen not as deterrence but as provocation.</p><p>The Regional Response: Prioritizing Growth and Stability</p><p>In Southeast Asia and beyond, national budgets are being reoriented toward post-pandemic recovery, climate resilience, digital infrastructure, and education reform. There is little appetite-public or political-for ballooning defense outlays.</p><p>Countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and even Thailand have publicly emphasized the need for economic investments, not military escalation. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Domestic Direct Investment (DDI) are seen as stabilizing forces, offering job creation, technology transfer, and revenue generation. Arms deals, in contrast, represent capital outflows with limited downstream benefits.</p><p>Indeed, even where defense procurement is on the agenda, the priority is on affordability, multilateral interoperability, and reduced dependency on any single supplier.</p><p>This explains why Asian countries have diversified their sources-turning to Turkiye, South Korea, France, and even indigenous defense development-rather than doubling down on American options.</p><p>Moreover, there is growing recognition that security in Asia is not only military.</p><p>Non-traditional threats-such as cyberattacks, piracy, human trafficking, illegal fishing, and climate-related disasters-require a broader toolkit than fighter jets and missile systems.</p><p>In forums such as the Asean Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), the emphasis is on capacity building, joint training, and regional resilience. Arms races are anathema to these priorities.</p><p>The Trump Tariff Trap</p><p>The irony is that Trump's own economic policies undercut his strategic objectives. By erecting tariff walls against Asian exports-often under the pretext of \"national security\"-Trump has undermined regional confidence in US economic leadership. Countries like South Korea and Japan have had to endure hostile tariff actions despite hosting major US bases. Asean member states, particularly those with growing manufacturing sectors, find themselves penalized even as they are asked to bolster America's geostrategic posture.</p><p>The result is a transactional model of diplomacy that few in Asia are willing to accept.</p><p>Nations across the Indo-Pacific see the US demand for greater defense spending not as a shared responsibility but as an imposition-one that prioritizes America's arms industry over regional economic needs. The message from Washington is clear: buy our weapons or risk being labeled unreliable. But the response from Asia is equally clear: we will spend where it matters most-for our people and our future.</p><p>The Myth of Free Riding</p><p>It is fashionable in Washington to accuse Asian partners of free riding-benefitting from American security guarantees without proportionate contributions.</p><p>Yet this narrative ignores the reality on the ground. South Korea contributes billions to the upkeep of US forces, Japan provides extensive basing support, and the Philippines, despite its domestic constraints, allows rotational US deployments. These are not passive beneficiaries but active participants in regional security architecture.</p><p>In Southeast Asia, countries have consistently engaged in multilateral peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and maritime cooperation. Their contributions may not be measured in F-35 purchases, but in the daily grind of maintaining regional peace and order.</p><p>The call for 5 per cent of GDP on defense-echoed by voices like US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth-is simply out of step with the fiscal realities of the region. Asean alone is short of at least US$1.5 trillion in development expenditure with Indonesia needing at least a third of this figure.</p><p>Such a benchmark, if adopted, would severely hamper development goals and spark unnecessary regional tensions.</p><p>The Path Ahead: Economic Security First</p><p>As the region looks ahead to the next decade, it is clear that economic security will remain paramount.</p><p>The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur and Asean Summits in Kuala Lumpur this year and Manila the next, must provide platforms for frank dialogue.</p><p>Trump may once again present a tough case for American arms purchases. But Asia's answer, if rooted in pragmatism and sovereignty, will be a firm \"No.\"</p><p>The way forward lies in deeper economic integration, industrial upgrading, and human capital development.</p><p>Strategic autonomy does not require blind purchases of US weaponry. It requires building national capabilities in science, technology, and innovation.</p><p>It requires policy consistency-not shifting tariff threats. And it requires mutual respect-not coercive diplomacy dressed as alliance-building.</p><p>Washington must come to terms with a changing Asia-one that is no longer beholden to Cold War mentalities or dependent on unilateral guarantees. The region seeks cooperation, not compliance.</p><p>In the face of Trump's renewed pressure, Asian capitals are likely to stand their ground, not out of defiance, but out of necessity. After all, the most enduring security lies not in missiles and tanks, but in resilient economies and empowered societies.</p><p>* Phar Kim Beng is Professor of Asean Studies at the International Islamic University Malaysia and Senior Visiting Fellow at the University of Cambridge.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

T5C will have more boarding gates, but it will be in a separate building from T5A and T5B. This is to allow for a taxiway between the buildings, so planes can taxi to gates on the opposite side of T5 without having to make a detour.</p><p>T5C will have 22 contact stands, about the same number as Terminal 4.</p><p>The different parts of T5 will be connected via a train system dubbed the \"automated people mover system\". The trains will primarily travel above ground, but with T5C being in a separate building from the other T5 parts, the train will go underground under the taxiway when travelling to T5C.</p><p>The distance between T5A and T5C is about 2km. The distance that passengers have to walk, however, will still be comparable to what they would cover in the current terminals, given the network of travellators and trains.</p><p>Most passengers arriving in Singapore will be able to hop onto a taxi or MRT within 30 minutes after leaving their aircraft, said CAG chief executive officer Yam Kum Weng during his speech at the groundbreaking ceremony.</p><p>He added that transfer passengers in T5 can connect to another flight in under an hour, faster than the current transfer times.</p><p>There will be a separate train service from Terminal 5 to Terminal 2 via a 2.5km underground link between the terminals, which began construction in 2024.</p><p>The roof of T5 will feature overlapping \"roof leaves\" with varying heights, which will create \"a variety of spaces that are more human scale\", said CAG in material provided to the media.</p><p>The baggage claim hall will feature \"vertical gardens\", while the departure pick-up point will feature a roof that allows natural light to filter through.</p><p>\"Combined with natural light and landscaping at appropriate spaces, the terminal will have the familiar cosy, yet uplifting feel that Changi is known for,\" said CAG.</p><p>The Changi East development that T5 is located in will also feature the future Changi East Urban District, which will serve as a \"vibrant business and lifestyle destination\" and the future Changi East Industrial Zone, said CAG.</p><p>The entire Changi East development, which includes T5, is expected to run into \"tens of billions\", it was reported in 2018.</p><p>The Changi Airport Development Fund will be topped up by S$5 billion to support this. AIR-SEA LINK, CLIMATE RESILIENCE, HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY</p><p>T5's proximity to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal also allows for the possibility of facilitating seamless air-sea transfers to neighbouring destinations, said CAG.</p><p>One airport that currently has air-sea transfers is Hong Kong International Airport, which has a SkyPier Terminal that facilitates direct flight-to-ferry connections</p><p>New roads will also be built to connect T5 to Tanah Merah Coast Road, East Coast Parkway and the Pan Island Expressway.</p><p>T5 will also be connected to the rest of Singapore through a ground transportation centre at the terminal where passengers can access train, bus, taxi and other transportation services.</p><p>There are plans for the Thomson-East Coast Line and the future Cross Island Line to be connected to T5. The terminal will also be designed to withstand extreme weather and climate change effects, with an airfield that is 5.5m above sea level, and taxiways that are sloped to allow rainwater to drain off.</p><p>The terminal will also be designed to deploy automation at scale, with technology currently being trialled at the existing terminals.</p><p>For instance, video analytics and artificial intelligence used to actively track flight activity can predict potential delays for ground handlers to better deploy resources at the terminal.</p><p>Baggage robots will also be tested under rain and lightning conditions to enable continuous delivery of baggage for passengers at the terminal.

At the same time, demand surged due to demographic shifts and pandemic-related factors, driving up resale prices after years of stagnation.</p><p>Almost five years on, Mr Lee said the government has resolved many of these issues, including clearing the backlog of delayed projects. The last batch of pandemic-delayed flats will be handed over to home owners within weeks, he said.</p><p>The ramp-up in supply has also lowered the average application rate for first-time buyers.

Starting mid-2025, singles will be included in schemes that prioritise those applying for flats to live with or near family.</p><p>The new Family Care Scheme (FCS) will be rolled out in two phases to replace the existing schemes that reserve priority access for married couples and their parents.</p><p>\"We expect this will be a second driver in demand from singles and that's why we are committed to launching more two-room flats,\" the minister said.</p><p>Additionally, more two-room flats will be offered, with one in four units in February's launch catering to the growing demand from singles. February's BTO exercise will also see a reduction in queue numbers issued - from three times to two times the number of flats available - due to a decline in applicants failing to select a flat.</p><p>The introduction of stricter penalties in October 2023 has reduced the non-selection rate from 40 per cent to about 19 per cent.</p><p>The latest adjustment is expected to give buyers \"more certainty\" when planning their next steps, Mr Lee said.</p><p>\"The aim is to help genuine home buyers, particularly first-timers, to be able to get their flats,\" the minister told reporters.</p><p>\"Will there be further tweaks and changes along the way?

In February 2023, O'Sullivan embarked on an expedition to the Antarctic as part of a 120-member team finding ways to mitigate climate change. She was the youngest member of that expedition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few months later, in October, O'Sullivan was invited to perform at Bhutan's Royal Highland Festival where she captivated attendees with a piano recital of Belgian composer Eric Bettens' Rhapsody Of A Changing Antarctic. Her performance even touched Bhutan's King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck who hugged her afterwards. Produced by Singapore-based studio White Room Studio, The Girl And Her Piano is a short film that documents O'Sullivan's journey in Bhutan as well as the environmental issues affecting the Himalayan region which include melting glaciers and rising temperatures. The documentary is set to be released online in 2025 with plans for a screening in Bhutan.</p><p>In an interview with CNA Lifestyle, O'Sullivan and her mother Elaine Lim - who directed the documentary - spoke about how the opportunity to perform in Bhutan came about and how they're still fighting against global warming. Rhapsody Of A Changing Antarctic was actually composed specially for O'Sullivan's Antarctic expedition. According to Lim, the piece aimed to \"convey the dire straits our planet is in due to global warming and plastic pollution\" through music.</p><p>Upon learning that the theme of Bhutan's Royal Highland Festival in 2023 was going to be climate resilience and highland sustainability, Lim had the idea to \"bring the music from the icy expanses of the South Pole to the towering heights of the Himalayas\".</p><p>Lim and her team then submitted a proposal to the organisers to have O'Sullivan perform Rhapsody Of A Changing Antarctic and collaborate with the children of Laya village on a Bhutanese song to \"emphasise the need for climate resilience\".</p><p>Lim said: \"To our joy, our proposal was accepted, and Hillary was invited to perform and participate in the festival...Hillary also prepared a 20-minute piano recital just for the children as a gesture of thanks and appreciation.\" When asked about her team's decision to shoot a documentary on climate change in the Himalayan region, Lim said: \"The Himalayas faces enormous threats from the changes in seasons, melting glaciers, weather patterns, and warming temperatures. Directly and indirectly, 2 billion people's lives and livelihoods depend on these mountains.</p><p>\"The Royal Highland Festival is particularly special...It felt like something extraordinary was on the horizon, prompting us to document the journey. By using music to address climate change while highlighting the beauty of Bhutan's landscapes and its people, we believed we could craft a powerful message.\" Filming The Girl And Her Piano was no easy feat. To get to Laya, the team embarked on a full day's drive from Paro, where Bhutan's airport is, to the town of Punakha.</p><p>The next day, the team drove for five hours to reach the start of their trek where they then hiked for seven hours in thin air before finally arriving in Laya.</p><p>There was also the issue of carrying O'Sullivan's 41kg piano.</p><p>Lim said: \"It was too bulky and long for the mules to carry, so ultimately, two dedicated men took turns hiking it up, strapping it to their backs. Their determination and effort truly touched our hearts, highlighting the spirit and kindness of the Bhutanese that we met along the way.\"</p><p>In the lead-up to the Royal Highland Festival, Hillary O'Sullivan had to practise outdoors in chilly temperatures and biting wind. She tried to warm her hands with hot water bottles. However, because they lost their heat quickly, she resorted to wearing ski gloves whenever she wasn't practising. Despite the challenges, O'Sullivan's performance was a success and even prompted King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck to hug her.</p><p>O'Sullivan recounted: \"I was trying to remember the proper way to bow. I had to hold the ends of my scarf with both hands, bow down, touch the scarf to the ground, and then take three steps back. I think I was moving slowly because it was all so new to me.</p><p>\"Just as I was finishing, I heard the King's voice saying 'Bravo! Bravo!' I looked up and saw him approaching with his arms open wide. I was a bit confused, but his warm smile encouraged me to run to him, and he embraced me. I felt really happy knowing the King appreciated my performance! It truly made my day and made everything worth it.\" For O'Sullivan, who has been an environmental advocate since she was seven years old, music will continue being a tool in her fight against climate change.</p><p>\"As a youth climate ambassador, I feel a deep responsibility to use my music for this purpose. It seems like we need to know so much more urgently.</p><p>\"It also feels like there's not much time left, and we need to change our choices in our daily life, individually and collectively.

Cities today are at a crossroads: they generate 80 per cent of global GDP while contributing roughly 70 per cent of carbon emissions. The paradox is stark, yet the potential to reverse this is immense. With initiatives like Malaysia's first urban nature-based climate adaptation programme in Penang, we are demonstrating how green infrastructure can reduce urban heat, promote biodiversity, and improve overall quality of life.

Our Kita-untuk-Kita (K2K) programme exemplifies this, empowering communities through community-led projects, public housing support, and accessible green spaces. As Dato' Seri Tpr. Dr. Maimunah noted, prioritising vulnerable groups is not just an ideal but an imperative for cities that aspire to inclusivity. For Think City, this is about ensuring that growth benefits all, fostering a sense of pride and belonging in each neighbourhood we serve.</p><p>Reflecting on her message, it is clear that the work we are doing is part of a broader movement. Think City's role is to support this vision in Malaysia, a vision closely tied to the themes of the current World Urban Forum in Cairo which emphasises the importance of inclusive, sustainable, and resilient cities,</p><p>In these 15 years, Think City's journey has been about catalysing a movement, one built on collaborative urban solutions, cultural-based economic development, community and environmental resilience. Working alongside inspiring changemakers and leaders like the Mayor, we look forward to continuing this work, bringing Malaysian cities to the forefront of sustainable urban transformation.</p><p>With a shared commitment, we can shape cities across Malaysia and beyond that are not only functional but deeply cherished places where resilience, inclusivity, and hope to form the foundation of a sustainable, vibrant future.</p><p>*Datuk Hamdan Abdul Majeed is the managing director of Think City.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writers or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Malaysia should stop second-guessing itself - Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz", "published": "2025-01-04", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kuala Lampur, Jan. 4 -- Malaysia has come a long way since the Madani Government took office in December 2022. The numbers back this: from the 2023-2024 missions abroad (many personally led by our Prime Minister), we managed to attract total potential investments valued at RM448 billion, and potential exports valued at over RM65 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This did not happen by chance. The political stability as well as policy reforms, clarity and consistency of the Government have been highly encouraging to investors and trading partners alike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To support broad-based reforms, the Ministry of Investment, Trade &amp; Industry (Miti) launched and immediately executed many mission based industrial reform projects under the New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) in 2023, followed up by sector-specific sub-policies like the National Semiconductor Strategy (NSS), and the Green Investment Strategy (GIS) in 2024. These business-friendly and pro-growth policies have provided clear guidance to investors on Malaysia's priorities and future expansion opportunities.</p><p>It is this clarity, as well as disciplined execution of policies that will ultimately deliver the sustainable growth that Malaysia needs.</p><p>The proof is clear in how 2024 became a rebound year for our economy. Growth from January-September 2024 was at 5.2 per cent (cf. 3.8 per cent for 2023). The ringgit stabilised and ended 2024 as one of the best performing currencies in Asia. Unemployment was contained at 3.2 per cent, while inflation was below 2 per cent for most of the year.</p><p>Meanwhile, January-September 2024 saw some RM254.7 billion in approved investments, a 10.7 per cent increase year-on-year, which included some of the commitments garnered from 2023. Malaysia's electrical and electronics (E&amp;E) sector - supporting 1.3 million jobs - received RM37 billion in investments in the first half of 2024. The importance of this sector to our economy and the global supply chain is the reason we came up with the NSS to ensure its sustainable growth. In fact, our industrial policies have seen global tech giants such as Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, Infineon and Oracle (to name a few) invest or expand their footprint here.</p><p>Trade, likewise, soared in 2024. January-November 2024 trade grew 8.7 per cent to RM2.621 trillion year-on-year, the highest trade value ever recorded for the period, thanks to recovering external demand and positive spillover effects from the global technology cycle. As an open trading nation in an uncertain geopolitical landscape, Malaysia must also explored new markets and partnerships - like we did in Central Asia and Latin America in 2024.</p><p>Maintaining the momentum</p><p>So, how do we keep this momentum going? 2025 will be challenging, not least because of the US-China geopolitical tensions (including the policy uncertainties over Donald Trump's presidency), as well as the conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere. But rather than be paralysed by fear, we should leverage on our clear strengths. Besides the clarity of our policy and purpose, we should capitalise on Malaysia's strategic position, geopolitical neutrality and strong human capital.</p><p>We need to also leverage on our 2025 Asean Chairmanship (although it is only one part of the government's long to-do list next year) because this is a crucial, once-in-a-decade opportunity. Much attention will naturally gravitate towards Asean's Economic Pillar, which Miti is leading and whose agenda will be finalised together with several other key ministries. We must make the Asean Chairmanship work to Malaysia's economic advantage.</p><p>Many of our industrial reforms are interlinked with initiatives across various key ministries, so there is a lot on our plate to forward agendas such as financing access for climate resilience and just transition, especially for MSMEs; and an Asean EV Roadmap.</p><p>Besides Asean, Miti's industrial reforms to achieve sustainable growth will continue apace. As outlined by our GIS, this includes attracting much needed FDIs in green technology, and in regulating the power, water and carbon usage effectiveness (PUE, WUE, CUE) guidelines for data centre investments that wish to access tax incentives under the Digital Ecosystem Acceleration Scheme (DESAC). MITI wants to prove that we can achieve both sustainability and attract high-ticket investments!</p><p>The year 2025 will also see more tangible progress for various NIMP related projects - such as the start of NIMP's crucial industrial supply chain mapping project (to better prepare for another Covid-like crisis); enabling MSMEs to begin their sustainability reporting; as well as advancing initiatives like Perak's Kerian Integrated Green Industrial Park (KIGIP) and the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ).</p><p>As mentioned, the Madani Government's all-corners approach prioritises industrial reforms to ultimately strengthen Malaysia's investment and trade numbers. This, coupled with our fiscal and labour reforms, are what will move our macroeconomic needles, by driving jobs, productive capacity and social mobility for our rakyat and businesses. In short, Miti is driving industrial reforms in earnest, while also pulling up our trade and investment numbers to boost the economy and improve the lives of ordinary Malaysians.</p><p>Driving inclusive and sustainable growth</p><p>All these efforts are crucial in the face of global headwinds, which have torn many less resilient countries apart. This is why I feel that Malaysia's 2025 Asean theme, \"Inclusivity and Sustainability\", is on point. To achieve this, we must harness the strength of all our peoples, whatever their nationality, race or religion, not only across Malaysia, but also Asean.</p><p>Meaningful economic growth must be inclusive and create more quality job opportunities for our youth across all regions. It must enable fair access to opportunities for MSMEs and women, as well as macro-stability for big corporates, but with wealth that is equitably shared with the workers, and not at the expense of the environment.</p><p>This is the vision of the government I am part of, and one which Miti is working hard to realise. Many of our initiatives - like enabling MSMEs to begin their sustainable journey; and the Women in Trade and Industry (WITI) to support female entrepreneurs - might not be highly visible yet, but they create a stronger foundation for the nation in the long-run.</p><p>While much has been accomplished, keeping Malaysia on this reform plus-growth trajectory is what will uplift our nation sustainably. Just see how Malaysia is firmly back on the global investors' radar, generating positive international headlines by winning big-ticket investments after only two years of concerted effort. Imagine what we could achieve by staying the course and persisting with this laser-focused mindset in the years ahead.</p><p>Let the sceptics remain sceptical. Our sincerity and efforts will show in the trade and investments we pull in. One thing I am sure of: Miti and its agencies will do our best to make 2025 a year where Malaysia shines brightly as a more confident player in the new global order.</p><p>Here's to a more productive and fruitful 2025 for all Malaysians.</p><p>* Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Abdul Aziz Malaysia's Investment, Trade and Industry Minister.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Would it? Many developments point in that direction, but two will suffice. Both have to do with preparatory work for COP29, one in Bonn, Germany, and the other in Baku. Start with Bonn. There, the 60th session of the mouthful Subsidiaries Bodies to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in June with the hope to land on ideas to advance decisions at COP29. After days of meetings, the Bonn gathering was one of unadvanced hope. So was the last round of technical talks that ended on Sept 12 in Baku, with rich nations staying silent on future climate finance, according to a statement released by the Climate Action Network International, a non-governmental organisation.</p><p>Does the world have the luxury of many more failed hopes? Extreme weather events everywhere clearly say \"no\". But world leaders, even as they are surrounded by killer fires, floods and landslides, refuse to act. Perhaps the floods in Poland and the forest fires in Portugal may help erode such recalcitrance. Call it a Strasbourg realisation, with the crisis management commissioner, Janez Lenarcic, acknowledging to the media there that the calamities were proof of climate breakdown. But still, this acknowledgement is a little late in the day. World leaders could have acted, even as late as 2000, when the Earth's temperature was just under 1\u00c2\u00baC above the pre-industrial level.</p><p>Put simply, there are only two things to be done to make the Earth liveable. One, bring greenhouse gas emissions down and two, fund climate resilience. But both are moving at a snail's pace. Begin with emissions. Meeting in Paris in 2015, COP members promised to limit global warming to 1.5\u00c2\u00baC. Here is the bad news from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service: the Earth warmed 1.52\u00c2\u00baC from February 2023 to January 2024, the first-ever year-long breach of the Paris target that Pacific island nations fought hard for. Does this mean that a post-industrial 1.5\u00c2\u00baC Earth is a thing of the past? No, say climate scientists. The Paris promise can still be fulfilled, but the window of time is short. This is why COP29 must be the conference to settle on a phase-out of fossil fuels that previous COPs have shied away from. If Baku wants to be known for a good COP, it must make sure that fossil fuel phase out happens. After all, fossil fuel use is the primary source of global carbon emissions. Phase them out and you would have phased out emissions.</p><p>In the event we are faced with a 2\u00c2\u00baC Earth \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a likely scenario \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the world must be made resilient to extreme weather events. This requires a huge amount of money (US$400 billion annually), our second thing that needs to get done. COP28 in Dubai came up with a novel idea of a Loss and Damage Fund to finance climate adaptation efforts in developing countries. There, the fund was filled with commitments, but that, too, not to the brim. Can Baku do it? It better, if it wants to live up to its billing as \"COP finance\".</p><p>( END )</p>", "publisher": "New Straits Times (Malaysia)", "instances": ["World leaders could have acted, even as late as 2000, when the Earth's temperature was just under 1\u00c2\u00baC above the pre-industrial level.
