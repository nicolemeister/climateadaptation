In Mentougou, the number reached around 14,000, including many from Wang Ping, a town of roughly 9,000 residents situated along the Yongding River.</p><p>Once crucial to the capital's reservoir system, the waterway is now known for swelling rapidly during storms, fed by rain rushing down steep hillsides.</p><p>It was along these riverbanks that Hu moved through the narrow lanes of his neighbourhood on Monday, knocking on doors and urging residents to evacuate. The head of the local emergency response group had contacted Hu directly. With a precautionary flood alert issued, his role was to inform every household to evacuate to the nearby shelter, a kindergarten-turned-safehouse atop the hill, less than a 10-minute walk away.</p><p>Most families left without hesitation, Hu said. \"Everyone cooperated. We told each other: 'We'll meet at the shelter,'\" he added with a soft chuckle.</p><p>\"It almost felt routine by now.\"</p><p>According to Hu, the shelter was already stocked when residents arrived. Bedding had been laid out, bottled water stacked against the wall and packets of bread and dried snacks arranged in plastic bins.</p><p>\"The local government takes care of everything ... they don't just shelter us from the danger, they make sure we're comfortable too,\" He said.</p><p>\"That's why (most) don't hesitate when it's time to leave. There's nothing to worry about.\"</p><p>Residents spent the night in the shelter, waiting for a storm that never came. By Tuesday, with no sign of worsening weather, authorities lifted the alert and families began returning home.</p><p>AS WARNINGS RETURN, SO DO OLD WOUNDS</p><p>Beijing had good reason to err on the side of caution.</p><p>Late last month, deadly floods swept through districts across the capital and beyond, claiming 44 lives. Many of the victims were in a nursing home in northeastern Miyun district, where rising waters reportedly overwhelmed rescue efforts. The storms triggered Beijing's most severe flooding in over a decade, drawing public scrutiny to the challenges of responding to increasingly extreme weather.</p><p>Further south in Guangdong province, at least five more people died in the past week after being swept away by floodwaters. Just days earlier, on Jul 27, three people were killed when surging waters overran a riverside wellness retreat in Chengde city, Hebei province.</p><p>In Mentougou's Wang Ping, rain once brought devastation - and the memory lingers.</p><p>The town is still haunted by the memory of the 2023 disaster, when record-breaking downpours driven by Typhoon Doksuri turned roads into rivers and swept away homes, vehicles and lives.</p><p>Bridges collapsed, power was knocked out and entire neighbourhoods were submerged in thigh-deep water. According to media reports, at least 20 people died in Beijing's hardest-hit suburban districts.</p><p>Among them was Mentougou, the epicentre of the storm. The district recorded up to 580mm of rainfall over just a few days - nearly its average annual rainfall compressed into less than a week.</p><p>It wasn't the first time a disaster had struck. In 2012, Beijing was hit by what was then the heaviest rainfall in six decades. The deluge killed at least 79 people across the city and overwhelmed many of the same flood-prone areas in Mentougou. The trauma of past floods has taught Wang Ping's residents that when the rain comes, it can arrive swiftly and with little mercy.</p><p>Zhao, a soft-spoken woman in her seventies who declined to give her full name, lived through the 2023 disaster.</p><p>When the latest warning came on Monday, she moved to a relative's apartment on higher ground. A member of the estate committee had gone door to door, alerting residents that the city had entered its highest level of flood preparedness.</p><p>\"People listened and left the estate ... after a day, we were told it was safe to go home,\" she told CNA.</p><p>Asked whether she was worried about leaving behind her home and valuables, she replied simply: \"Safety is more important. As for the rest, we just hope for the best.\"</p><p>SOME STAYED, OTHERS REMEMBERED</p><p>Not everyone needed to leave their homes.</p><p>Liu Haijie, who operates a small provision store along the town's main road, chose to stay. Her apartment is located in a high-rise building on elevated ground, safely away from the flood-prone areas.</p><p>While she didn't evacuate, Liu felt the disruption immediately: streets emptied, public transportation halted, and customers vanished.</p><p>\"The town went quiet. No buses, no one coming in, no one going out,\" she said.</p><p>\"Business was gone for the day. But what can we do? These days, we follow nature's lead.\" At a nearby hair salon, the owner, who has lived in Wang Ping for about a year, said she stayed through the storm warning as well. Unlike Liu and Zhao, she didn't experience the devastating floods of 2023 firsthand.</p><p>\"I heard the stories - how the water came so fast, how people lost their (belongings),\" she told CNA.</p><p>\"This time, I didn't think it would get that bad again. And in the end, it didn't.\"</p><p>She admitted she wasn't sure what the conditions at the temporary shelter were like, or whether going there was truly necessary.</p><p>\"I suppose I'd rather just wait and see.\"</p><p>But for those who lived through the 2023 floods, waiting was never an option.</p><p>When asked about that episode, Liu, the provision store operator, paused before responding.</p><p>\"It felt like yesterday,\" she said. \"The water reached up to my thighs. The whole street was underwater in just a few hours. We didn't evacuate in time.\"</p><p>With electricity cut and goods in her shop ruined, she recalled neighbours hauling furniture up stairwells and using torches to navigate darkened corridors.</p><p>Aid teams eventually arrived with bottled water and basic supplies, but the memory of those first few hours has stayed with her. Hu, the local community leader, remembers it too - the moment floodwaters broke past the riverbank and swept through the main road. He pointed out where the debris had piled up and where vehicles had been swept away.</p><p>\"It came like a wall ... we didn't have time to react,\" he said.</p><p>TURNING LESSONS INTO ACTION</p><p>Since the devastating floods of 2023, local authorities in Mentougou have rolled out a series of upgrades aimed at better preparing Wang Ping and other villages along the Yongding River for future storms.</p><p>Many of these new protective measures were already in place by the time the latest warnings were issued. Walking slowly through his neighbourhood, Hu pointed them out - visible signs of a community better equipped to face what nature might bring. Along the riverside stood a series of sleek, solar-powered flood detection sensors, each mounted high above the waterline.</p><p>Hu explained that the sensors monitor water levels in real time and relay the data instantly to the local government, providing an early warning even before any visible threat emerges.</p><p>The riverbank itself has been reinforced and carefully reshaped. Sturdy concrete barriers have been extended deeper and higher, their slopes fortified with stone.</p><p>Nearby, freshly widened drainage channels lined the roadside, their smooth, clean concrete designed to carry stormwater away swiftly rather than allowing it to pool dangerously in the street.</p><p>\"Before this was done, the water had nowhere to go,\" Hu remarked quietly. \"Now, it drains out quickly, and the roads stay clear.\"</p><p>Every few meters along the main street, poles fitted with sirens stood ready. \"Once these sirens sound, everyone knows to move immediately,\" he said.</p><p>Local authorities had personally briefed Hu and other community leaders about how each new system functioned, and what steps to take if warnings sounded. Hu took out his mobile phone, showing messages from the village committee that clearly outlined evacuation procedures, emergency contacts, and maps to shelters. The level of preparedness was a stark contrast to the confusion and panic two years earlier, he noted.</p><p>\"Back then, we were caught unprepared, and we paid a price for it,\" Hu said, his voice firm but quiet. \"Now, we're not just responding to danger - we're ready for it.\" BALANCING WARNINGS AND PUBLIC TRUST</p><p>Climate experts note that the increasingly erratic and intense rainfall patterns experienced in Beijing and elsewhere are closely linked to a combination of climate change and changing meteorological conditions.</p><p>Increasingly erratic weather is the new normal, said Yang Jiguo, deputy chief at the China Meteorological Administration's (CMA) Public Meteorological Service Center. He added that the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are directly linked to rising global temperatures.</p><p>\"When the atmosphere heats up, it behaves like boiling water - steam rises, convection intensifies, and weather systems become more unstable,\" Yang told CNA.</p><p>\"That's why we're seeing heavier rains in shorter bursts, and in places where we didn't expect them before.\"</p><p>To cope with these shifts, China has developed an early warning system designed not only to alert, but to trigger action, Yang said, describing it as \"progressively layered\". This includes real-time satellite monitoring, short-term radar projections, and a comprehensive notification chain that reaches not just officials but also local grid managers, emergency responders and residents.</p><p>Once a warning is issued, a chain of pre-assigned actions is activated, from school closures to the deployment of grassroots volunteers, Yang said.</p><p>\"In some disasters, the response time is just minutes. That's why we say early warnings are not just about notice. They are about action.\"</p><p>Yang emphasised that these protocols are continuously reviewed and updated to keep pace with changing climate patterns, to ensure \"no one is caught off guard\".</p><p>\"Pre-warning is about efficiency,\" Yang said. \"Sometimes, when a flash flood hits, there are only seconds to act. That's why protocols must already be in place, and everyone must know exactly what to do.\"</p><p>Dimitri de Boer, director and chief representative in China at environmental consultancy ClientEarth, said that investing in sophisticated forecasting technologies and improved early warning systems is crucial, noting that such advanced systems would not only protect China but also benefit other vulnerable countries in the region.</p><p>Beyond advanced forecasting methods, de Boer said communities could also benefit greatly from nature-based solutions, such as widening riverbanks to create more room for rivers to safely absorb floodwaters during heavy rains.</p><p>\"It's a very effective way to combine ecological benefits with flood prevention,\" he told CNA, highlighting similar approaches adopted in his native Netherlands, known globally for its sophisticated flood management systems.</p><p>\"This isn't just about engineering solutions, but using nature as an ally in adapting to climate risks.\" At the same time, climate experts say a key challenge lies in striking a balance between caution and credibility - issuing alerts early enough to protect lives, without dulling the public response when storms prove milder or never arrive.</p><p>CMA's Yang acknowledged that not every warning will lead to severe outcomes, noting that forecasts are \"always evolving\", based on radar and observation data that can shift \"by the hour, even by the minute\".</p><p>While some residents may feel the impact didn't match the severity of the warning, this doesn't mean the alert was misplaced, he said.</p><p>\"There's a misconception that if it doesn't rain in your area, the warning was wrong. But often, neighbouring areas are hit hard. Forecasts are issued by district-level stations and aim to protect entire zones, not individual blocks,\" he said.</p><p>Authorities are aware of the risk of public complacency and are stepping up education alongside improvements in forecasting systems, Yang said.</p><p>Yin Yizhou, deputy director of the Meteorological Disaster Risk Management Office at the CMA's National Climate Center, said authorities are stepping up efforts nationwide to embed disaster literacy into schools, neighbourhoods, factories, and rural areas.</p><p>\"Science communication is not just about explaining forecasts. It's about building a culture where people act early and don't gamble with risk,\" he told CNA.</p><p>Ultimately, climate experts agree that it's better to err on the side of caution.</p><p>\"We're moving into a climate where 'false alarms' are a necessary part of keeping people safe. The alternative is waiting too long - and then it's too late,\" Yin said.</p><p>CMA's Yang echoed these sentiments, stressing that the overriding goal is to keep people safe.</p><p>\"If the system works, lives will be saved even when the rain never comes.\" INITIAL: lg(ws)</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["That's why protocols must already be in place, and everyone must know exactly what to do.

Not long ago, Pakistan succumbed to the worst-ever flood in its history.</p><p>The devastation, almost unexpected by the population, resulted in heavy casualties.</p><p>What has become clear is that recent floods around the world are increasingly described as extreme and abnormal, with scientists pointing to the changing global climate as a major factor.</p><p>Global warming has raised the earth's temperatures, leading to higher levels of moisture in the air, particularly above the seas.</p><p>Depending on which way the wind blows, this excess water is deposited on land, and when heavy rainfall cannot be drained away quickly enough, flooding occurs.</p><p>Efficient drainage is crucial in combating floods, but the challenge lies in designing systems that are both effective and cost-efficient.</p><p>Predicting the intensity of rain with precision is nearly impossible, and while over-designing drains might seem like a solution, it comes at a significant financial cost.</p><p>Some have suggested flexible drainage systems that can expand during extreme conditions, but even this concept remains largely unexplored.</p><p>So far, no country, not even those with advanced technologies, has developed a foolproof solution to mitigate floods.</p><p>Most efforts have focused on early warning systems and adaptation measures to minimize their impact.</p><p>While no single technology can fully prevent floods, various strategies have emerged to reduce risks and lessen their effects.</p><p>Flood forecasting and early warning systems now rely on advanced meteorological models, including AI-driven weather prediction and IoT-based sensors.</p><p>Satellite imaging combined with AI has shown promise in predicting rainfall intensity and river overflow.</p><p>Such early warnings not only save lives but also provide communities with crucial time for evacuation and preparation.</p><p>Beyond prediction, innovative infrastructure is being developed to adapt to flood risks.</p><p>In flood-prone regions like the Netherlands, buildings are designed with elevated foundations, water-resistant materials, and even floating structures.</p><p>Similarly, green infrastructure, such as parks, wetlands, and permeable pavements, absorbs rainwater, reducing surface runoff and easing urban flooding.</p><p>Retention ponds and detention basins offer temporary storage for excess rainwater, while smart drainage systems, such as Singapore's Marina Barrage, use sensors to monitor water levels and redirect flow as needed.</p><p>Countries have also implemented flood barriers to protect vulnerable areas.</p><p>The Thames Barrier in London and the Maeslantkering in the Netherlands are prime examples of large-scale solutions designed to hold back storm surges and rising sea levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, innovations like movable flood gates and automated levees demonstrate how technology can adapt to the ever-changing threats posed by nature.</p><p>At the same time, nature-based solutions, such as mangroves and coral reefs, form natural barriers that reduce wave energy and storm surges, while reforestation improves water absorption and stabilizes soil to prevent erosion.</p><p>In Malaysia, ecosystem restoration has been employed as a strategy to mitigate flood risks.</p><p>Low-cost community-level innovations are equally important. Simple measures such as community flood walls, rainwater harvesting systems, and elevated homes have proven effective in flood-prone areas.</p><p>Technology also plays a role, with data-sharing platforms and mobile apps offering real-time flood alerts and evacuation plans. However, these efforts</p><p>are only part of the solution.</p><p>The challenges of flood mitigation are exacerbated by climate change, rapid urbanization, and poor planning.</p><p>As these risks grow, collaboration between governments, scientists, and communities becomes increasingly critical.</p><p>Public education is also essential. Raising awareness about flood risks and preparedness can save lives and empower individuals to take proactive measures.</p><p>Adaptation and resilience remain our most effective tools, underscoring the importance of investing in technologies and strategies that acknowledge the inevitability of some flooding while planning to minimize its impact.</p><p>* Professor Datuk Dr Ahmad Ibrahim is an Associate Fellow, Ungku Aziz Centre for Development Studies (UAC), Universiti Malaya.

Around 3,200ha of the land then was vulnerable to flooding.</p><p>While these areas have shrunk as Singapore moved to beef up its drainage network, heavy rains and the resultant floods still plagued some parts of the island into the 21st century. Today, less than 25ha of Singapore is prone to flooding.</p><p>Mr Xu's old home, for instance, has since made way for one of the tallest public housing flats in Singapore, Skyville at Dawson.</p><p>He still stays in the area, in a flat not far from Margaret Drive, and told CNA he hardly sees floods anymore. Mr Xu believes the nearby Alexandra Canal, which has been upgraded over the years, has solved the issue.</p><p>Elsewhere in Singapore, however, flash floods continue to occur during periods of high rainfall. DRAIN NETWORK</p><p>Key to Singapore's battle against floods has been massive investments in drainage works over the years.</p><p>Since 2011, the country has spent about S$2.5 billion (US$1.85 billion) upgrading infrastructure and will be injecting another approximately S$150 million for the 2025 financial year.</p><p>There is now an 8,000km network of interconnected drains, canals and rivers, capturing rainwater landing on two-thirds of the land and conveying it to 16 reservoirs on the mainland.</p><p>The remaining one-third of Singapore not served by reservoirs is along its coasts, where rainwater is directed to the sea. \"(The drains) all have a gradient, and a lot of these drains are following the natural topography,\" Ms Joanne Siew, a senior principal engineer at national water agency PUB, told CNA.</p><p>\"The drains convey stormwater towards the reservoirs, which then becomes the raw water stock for our water supply treatment.\"</p><p>Parts of this network require the capacity to cope with the volume of rainwater during storms. In 2011, design standards were raised so that drains can handle up to 50 per cent higher rainfall intensities depending on the catchment size. SPACE CONSTRAINTS</p><p>To alleviate flooding, there have also been major projects over time such as Marina Barrage, which Ms Siew said helps in particular low-lying areas like Chinatown.</p><p>As Singapore's population grows, however, less land is available for such infrastructure.</p><p>Professor Vladan Babovic from the National University of Singapore's (NUS) civil and environmental engineering department pointed out that there are around 9,000 people per square kilometre here.</p><p>\"We need land for roads, for buildings, for schools. So widening and increasing drains is just going to be prohibitively expensive and will take useful land space away.\"</p><p>An expert panel reviewing Singapore's protection measures in the wake of the 2010 Orchard Road floods also said a wholescale upsizing of the drainage system would be disruptive.</p><p>\"The whole country will develop (into) something not necessarily nice to live in. Would you like to live in a watertight bunker?\" said Prof Babovic.</p><p>Associate Professor Tay Zhi Yung of the Singapore Institute of Technology's (SIT) engineering cluster said that instead of \"total flood prevention\", the focus should be on risk management to minimise damage and disruption.</p><p>\"In urban areas, constructing detention tanks, increasing the height of retention walls ... might be more practical solutions,\" he noted.</p><p>\"In locations where space allows for innovative approaches, nature-based solutions integrated with engineering methods may be more sustainable than relying solely on infrastructure, such as widening canals and drains.\" Authorities in Singapore recognise that upgrading drains is just one part of the puzzle, said PUB's Ms Siew.</p><p>For example, a code of practice dictates the minimum platform levels for buildings and infrastructure.</p><p>Buildings in the northern and southern areas require respective platform levels of 4.5m and 4m Singapore height datum, or what used to be referred to as above mean sea level.</p><p>Underground MRT stations also need to have entrances that are 1.3m above adjacent ground. Those that fall short of this requirement are equipped with flood barriers. Singapore has also looked to underground spaces to manage floods, with two subterranean detention tanks - Stamford Detention Tank under Botanic Gardens and Opera Estate Detention Tank near Bedok - designed to capture rainwater during storms.</p><p>The larger Stamford tank, stores up to 38,000 cubic metres of rainwater before pumping it back into drains that flow to Stamford Diversion Canal when storms subside.</p><p>This system is the reason why Orchard Road no longer sees severe flooding.</p><p>Near Syed Alwi Road, a pumping station is being built to reduce flooding in Jalan Besar. This differs from a detention tank in that it will continuously draw water in and pump it out downstream even as it continues to rain.</p><p>PUB continues to study the feasibility of a more extensive underground system to combat both inland and coastal flooding. SO WHY ARE THERE STILL FLOODS?</p><p>Experts say it comes down to a combination of factors.</p><p>For coastal areas, they flood when rainy weather coincides with a high tide.</p><p>This was the case in Jalan Seaview, which is close to the east coast. The area flooded in January during a monsoon surge which saw higher than average monthly rainfall.</p><p>Some parts there remain vulnerable as road levels are only marginally above high tide level.</p><p>\"If the tidal level is high, stormwater will not be able to flow into the sea, (which) will result in backflow and cause the water level in the canals and drains to rise, which may lead to flash floods,\" said Mr David Ng, who chairs the civil and structural engineering technical committee at the Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES). In fact, much of Singapore's coast lies less than 5m above mean sea level, making it susceptible to floods when high tides occur alongside extreme weather events.</p><p>To tackle sea level rise, authorities are conducting studies to assess the measures best-suited to specific sites. This was how the idea of a reclaimed \"Long Island\" at east coast came about. For inland areas, flooding can occur due to low elevation combined with a high intensity or long duration of rainfall as well as inadequacy of drainage channels, engineers said.</p><p>Ms Siew also cited increased construction or built-up infrastructure as a factor.</p><p>Forested environments are able to absorb and filter rainwater through vegetation and soil.</p><p>With urbanisation, nature is replaced by hard and impervious surfaces like buildings and roads. As a result, rainwater runs off these surfaces into drains, instead of filtering into the ground. Stormwater runoff could flood the area if not properly channelled, or overwhelm existing channels.</p><p>Urban planners thus need to calculate and account for the volume of runoff when an area undergoes development.</p><p>Since 2014, new developments or redevelopments in Singapore that are 0.2ha or larger have needed to implement on-site measures like stormwater detention tanks, said Ms Siew.</p><p>PUB also keeps a list of 36 flood-prone areas in Singapore. These are low-lying zones with a history of flooding, including Margaret Drive and Stevens Road in Bukit Timah.</p><p>A separate list keeps track of hotspots that flood more than twice a year. As of end-2024, this contains 22 locations, including Dunearn Road and a portion of Bukit Timah Road. THE BUKIT TIMAH CASE</p><p>PUB currently has 19 ongoing drainage upgrading projects, with six more slated to start this year.</p><p>One ongoing project is at Bukit Timah, an area well-documented for flooding despite constant upgrades over the years.</p><p>The main Bukit Timah Canal runs between Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road.</p><p>The first diversion canal to help with floods there was built in 1972. It uses a gate to divert water from the main canal to flow to a reservoir. A second diversion canal was completed in 1990, stretching from Robin Road to Kallang River.</p><p>The two diversion canals help split a load that would otherwise overwhelm the main canal, and effectively divide the Bukit Timah precinct into three catchment areas. Upgrading works to the first diversion canal began in 2012 and concluded seven years later to the tune of S$300 million. It can now convey 30 per cent more rainwater than before.</p><p>In 2013, a stretch of the main Bukit Timah Canal - from Jalan Kampong Chantek to Maple Avenue - was also expanded.</p><p>But floods have persisted. Only weeks ago, swathes of Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road were filled with murky waters rising high enough to cover car tyres. PUB is now working to widen and deepen a 900m-stretch of the main canal - from Rifle Range Road to Jalan Kampong Chantek - to increase its rainwater capacity by 30 per cent.</p><p>This was supposed to be completed in 2024, but has been delayed until 2026 to sync with the development of a green corridor.</p><p>The project is about 70 per cent complete, PUB senior engineer and project officer Matthew Tan told CNA at a worksite near 913 Bukit Timah Road.</p><p>He added that there was insufficient land to further expand the capacity of the main canal. Roads on each side limit how much it can be widened; and the maximum possible depth has already been reached due to underground infrastructure like MRT tunnels.</p><p>Separately, the team is also upgrading six adjoining culverts - covered drains that can take vehicle loads - that connect to developments from under Bukit Timah Road and Dunearn Road. This will help them smoothly channel water to the main canal. \"At times ... intense rainfall temporarily overwhelms the system,\" said Mr Tan.</p><p>Increased urbanisation and development has also resulted in more water flowing into the drains, hence upgrades are needed to cater to more runoff, he added.</p><p>While not all of Bukit Timah is low-lying, certain pockets - such as the road outside of Coronation Shopping Plaza - are valleys where waters pool. Authorities are still reviewing ways to mitigate flooding in such areas. Mr Tan also took CNA through the work involved in upgrading a canal in a busy, populated area.</p><p>The team often has to eat into adjacent roads to carry out works, but workers are constrained by the number of lanes they can close due to heavy traffic, especially on Bukit Timah Road. Working within a residential area also limits the number of hours they can be onsite.</p><p>Builders also have to contend with existing infrastructure both above- and underground.</p><p>For instance, they had to construct an entirely new overhead bridge for pedestrians, just metres away from its original location, when it became clear that the wall of the upgraded canal would come up against a structural support component of the old bridge. Under the canal, where cables and pipes jostle for space, the team has to coordinate with different agencies to ensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity and gas before they start any demolition works.</p><p>Rainy weather itself also impedes efforts, as workers have to evacuate canals when water levels rise.</p><p>\"We will always make sure that ... as a result of our works, we don't cause any flooding,\" said Mr Tan. \"So a lot of that is making sure that the existing connections from the road into the canal are clear and water still flows freely.\" WHAT'S BEING DONE AT NEWER DEVELOPMENTS</p><p>PUB works with other authorities like the Housing and Development Board (HDB) to parcel out waterways within new housing estates.</p><p>Drainage schemes are developed depending on how much land there is to work with; the land topography; and alignment with existing waterways. Topography refers to the terrain and elevation of the land, which give a sense of how water would flow when it rains.</p><p>Due to land scarcity, planners also factor in multi-functionality where possible, said PUB engineer Ms Siew.</p><p>One example is the relatively recent Bidadari estate in central Singapore. The authorities had to account for an increase in stormwater runoff due to the development of the estate.</p><p>As certain drains there cannot be widened, authorities had to think of other ways to handle large volumes of rainwater in the event of storms.</p><p>They came up with Alkaff Lake in Bidadari Park, which doubles as a recreational spot.</p><p>Pedestrians can stroll along footpaths by the lake during dry weather, but these paths will be submerged when the lake fills with stormwater during rain. Water running off from half of the estate will be diverted into the 1.8ha lake, as it's the lowest point in the area.</p><p>During a storm, the lake can hold four times the amount of water it normally does. Outlet points control the amount of stormwater flowing into a downstream drainage system. Over at Singapore's newest town, Tengah, HDB is exploring the possibility of a water body that can similarly manage stormwater.</p><p>In June last year, the housing board said this water body, which it referred to as a pond, will temporarily hold stormwater runoff from the southern part of Tengah during storms, thus slowing the discharge of stormwater to public drains.</p><p>\"For undeveloped sites, there could be more space to create a water body, (it) depends on the opportunities that arise because you have a large greenfield site to work with,\" said Ms Siew. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE</p><p>Looming over all these efforts is the spectre of a warming climate and the expectation of heavier rainfall, in turn exacerbating the risk of floods.</p><p>\"A 1 degree (Celsius) increase in temperature atmosphere has a possibility to store 7.5 per cent more of humidity,\" NUS' Prof Babovic said.</p><p>\"So if theoretically, the temperature were to increase by 4 degree Celsius we would get, theoretically, 30 per cent more vapour in the atmosphere. This extra will need to come down in rainfall.\"</p><p>Climate scientist Koh Tieh-Yong however said tropical rain formation was a more complicated process.</p><p>\"For example, in Singapore, relative humidity is lower when it is hotter during daytime, so the water vapour content of air stays about the same,\" said Dr Koh, who co-chairs the World Climate Research Programme's Asian-Australian Monsoon working group.</p><p>\"The fact is that different computer models generate rainfall at higher or lower intensity, duration or frequency depending on microphysical details of cloud and rain formation in the tropics. This leads to disparate projections for tropical rainfall.\"</p><p>Past rainfall statistics have become unreliable for future predictions, Dr Koh added.</p><p>\"This makes it hard for urban planners to prepare for future floods or dry spells as they need to balance stronger protection against higher costs.\"</p><p>Policymakers across the world have thus settled on deploying affordable protective measures while waiting for research to advance, he said. In the present day, PUB relies on a rainfall monitoring and prediction system to keep an eye out for flash floods.</p><p>This is among measures that guide the agency in its deployment of Quick Response Teams to potential flood areas.</p><p>It is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to enhance these capabilities.</p><p>In 2022, water management consultancy Hydroinformatics Institute and telco StarHub announced a pilot collaboration to use the latter's network of mobile base stations as rainfall sensors. This would provide PUB with an additional source of rainfall intensity.</p><p>But further down the line, Singapore will have to turn to increasingly innovative solutions to deal with floods, engineers said.</p><p>SIT's Dr Tay suggested that flood barriers be installed along canals or drains. Under normal conditions, these barriers are deactivated, retracted and \"hidden\" underground; during flash floods, they can be self- or manually-activated.</p><p>\"This solution minimises space requirements and reduces the cost of raising canal embankments while keeping the canal accessible to the public, as the barriers remain concealed during normal conditions,\" Dr Tay said. IES' Mr Ng proposed the use of a modular block system that can be built underneath roads, car parks and parks to collect stormwater. Australia and the US currently employ similar models.</p><p>Same as a detention tank, this system would temporarily store rainwater during storms for up to four hours, and discharge the water to the nearest public drain after the storm has passed - via a pump or by gravity.</p><p>But unlike a detention tank, this modular system would only need to be at least 1m underground, Mr Ng said.</p><p>They are made of durable and light materials that can be easily installed after excavation, and can withstand traffic loading, he added.</p><p>Prof Babovic meanwhile pointed to nature-based measures to help slow down stormwater flowing into drains. For instance, green roofs - covered with plants - or rain gardens - a depressed area in the ground could absorb, collect and filter rain during storms.</p><p>Downstream, research is underway to study the possibility of redistributing stormwater from drains that are filled from a localised storm, to drains outside of the affected area, said Prof Babovic.</p><p>\"There's a range of measures that are implemented across the country, not only drains,\" he noted. \"Over the years, a number of measures have been introduced systematically.</p><p>\"It's not something that you can (use) a magic wand and have it fixed overnight. This is years of effort.\" INITIAL: wt(jo)</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": [". might be more practical solutions,\" he noted.

In 2021, the country's CO2 emissions were approximately 298.5 million metric tons, largely attributed to energy production and consumption. Over the past decade, the country has seen a steady increase in carbon intensity, with an annual increase of about 1.3%.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rise in carbon emissions has led to significant environmental impacts in Malaysia. The country is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, including more frequent heatwaves and rising sea levels, which pose substantial threats to its coastal regions.</p><p>Deforestation is another pressing issue. In 2023, Malaysia lost about 133,000 hectares of natural forest, leading to biodiversity loss and contributing to the release of significant amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere, thereby intensifying climate change.</p><p>These environmental changes have serious economic implications, with climate change potentially shrinking Malaysia's GDP by 20% by 2050. This puts vital sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and fisheries at risk, along with potential impacts on public health and labor productivity.</p><p>However, addressing climate change also presents significant opportunities for Southeast Asia. A study by BCG and Fairatmos titled \"Climate Technology in Southeast Asia: Key to Unlocking the World's Carbon Sink\" highlights that nature-based solutions (NbS) could supply approximately 30% of the global carbon offset by 2030, despite Southeast Asia covering less than 1% of the world's total landmass. Critical sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and fishing can thrive by focusing on sustainable practices while enhancing human health and labor productivity.</p><p>To successfully harness nature-based solutions, collaboration between multiple stakeholders is needed, especially in technological advancement, private-public partnerships, and green investment. While technology plays a crucial role in NbS implementation through advancements like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence, big data, remote sensing, and quantum computing, more green investment and political will are needed to overcome barriers to NbS uptake.</p><p>In Indonesia, the impact of collaboration and investment to develop NbS is already underway with support for Fairatmos, an organisation working on high-quality carbon offset projects across Southeast Asia.</p><p>Fairatmos founder and CEO Natalia Rialucky said, \"Indonesia hosts 15% of the world's potential nature-based carbon sinks. Fairatmos seeks to simplify the process, enabling anyone, regardless of size, to initiate nature-based projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions without excessive costs. Overcoming hurdles like limited technical expertise, lengthy certification processes, and high capital investment is vital to ensure everyone can participate in restoring the atmosphere.\"</p><p>Fairatmos has received support for its product, Atmoswatch, from ANGIN, an early-stage investment platform and development advisory consulting company in Indonesia, through its Product Market Fit Programme powered by Official Development Assistance. This initiative aims to refine startups' products to better meet market needs by providing funding, tailored mentorship, and networking opportunities.</p><p>Ursula Toding, ANGIN business development senior associate, said, \"We were impressed by Fairatmos' alignment with government priorities, especially in carbon offset initiatives amid Indonesia's focus on carbon regulation. Startups like Fairatmos are crucial in leveraging business to address environmental challenges, aligning impact with commercial viability. Through the organisation, we can become more strategic in our approach, achieving both meaningful impact and sustainable growth.\"</p><p>Fairatmos also received investment from Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India (VVSEAI), a regional venture capital firm. VVSEAI's partner, Puiyan Leung, said, \"Innovators like Fairatmos play a vital role in supporting these efforts.

And compared to stone and concrete, mangroves would provide more than coastal protection by conserving biodiversity and helping to reduce carbon emissions. Mangrove forests, which once lined much of Singapore's coastline, are able to store carbon more efficiently than other ecosystems such as tropical rainforests. \"I think in Singapore, the focus has traditionally been on human-engineered solutions - sea walls and breakers and so on. </p><p>I think there is also scope to use mangroves or sea grasses and other natural coastal habitats to help with reducing the erosion effects,\" said Professor Koh Lian Pin, who heads the new Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Nature-based solutions include protecting natural ecosystems, restoring them and improving the management of agricultural lands to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that result from deforestation. \"We want to remove emissions from the atmosphere from the air, by making use of the forest's natural ability to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon that will be stored in the biomass above ground as well as in the soil below ground,\" said Prof Koh. However, he added that these solutions may not be suitable everywhere as that depends on many factors. In the case of planting mangroves, factors include where the coastline is, the waves, weather events and more. READ: How Singapore's mangroves can contribute in the battle against climate change Such complications are part of what he and his colleagues study in order to inform the strategies, policies and actions on climate change in Singapore and the region. A prominent researcher in the field of sustainability and environmental science, Prof Koh has worked in institutions across Switzerland, Australia and the United States over the last 16 years. He is the sixth Singaporean scientist who returned under the National Research Foundation's Returning Singaporean Scientists Scheme to lead research in areas important to the country. The Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions was announced by NUS in March and is due to officially open by the end of the year, but it has already been active, publishing one research study in August and another one soon. The first paper, on the potential and constraints of reforestation, found that 121 million ha of land across Southeast Asia are suitable for reforestation, and could potentially contribute to climate mitigation at a rate of 3.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year. In contrast, Singapore generated 52.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2017. One gigatonne is equivalent to 1 billion tonnes. READ: 52.5m tonnes of greenhouse gases generated by Singapore in 2017: MTI READ: New technologies, continuous innovation key as world moves towards low-carbon future, say experts But when \"layers of constraints\" are taken into consideration, such as how much of the land may be used by local farmers, as well as the manpower and resources required to manage these reforestation projects, the area of land available for reforestation can quickly shrink. The study estimated it could be as little as 33 million ha instead, which would provide only 0.9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide sequestration potential a year. While barriers to reforestation can be overcome, studying both the potential and limits of such nature-based climate solutions is needed for climate policies that are workable. For example, if a company or the government were interested in a reforestation project somewhere in Kalimantan, and if the land is being used by local communities for growing food crops, then there will be the risk of impact on the land users' rights, security and livelihoods, he explained. \"Understanding both these kinds of opportunities and risks can help decision-makers policymakers prioritise what, when, and how these solutions should be implemented, to help them maximise the benefits of distributions and minimise the conflicts and negative impacts,\" Prof Koh said. READ: Caught by deluges and droughts, India's cities look to become climate smarter The second research study, which the centre has just completed, is a carbon prospecting map showing where the highest, investable carbon is stored around the world in the biomass and soil of forests. Interest in such information is growing as global demand for nature-based carbon credits is outpacing their supply. Carbon credits are traded by governments, companies and other entities to offset their emissions, and nature-based credits can be generated by funding forest conservation and restoration projects. This year, the Trillion Tree Campaign was announced at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos - aiming to plant one trillion trees worldwide by the end of the decade. Singapore is doing its part by pledging to plant a million trees by 2030. READ: Look beyond forests for cost-effective nature restoration, governments urged It has been estimated that nature-based solutions can provide up to a third of the mitigation needed to hold global average temperature rise to below the 2 degree Celsius target in the Paris Climate Agreement. \"Even if we managed to decarbonise through energy transitions or improving our energy efficiency, we still may not meet the targets, unless we also act on the nature-based part of the solution,\" Prof Koh said. Singapore can also invest in better understanding the less obvious and insidious impact of climate change, he said. This includes its effect on the security of its regional food supply, its water resources, as well as the impact on the regional economy and political stability. \"Because whatever happens to our neighbours, because of climate change, the impacts will eventually trickle down to Singapore,\" he said. Commentary: Reaching net-zero emissions will be 'very challenging'. But watch Singapore try anyway The centre's role is to provide the science that can help show where the trade-offs are when implementing climate solutions. \"That's why science is important to inform decisions on where we should be focusing or prioritising the implementation solutions to maximise the benefits ...

Secondly, we don't need to take land back and there's no impact during the construction, which will take over 10 years because humongous structures will be built.\"</p><p>The types of infrastructure he means could include railways, an airport, a shipping port, residential areas within a \"green city\", entertainment complexes, factories, water gates and communication lines all stretching across the overall span of the gulf - some 100km.</p><p>Mr Plodprasop has for many years championed the bold vision that is not unlike Singapore's Long Island.

Here too, grand ideas of engineering swirl around the heads of local residents just trying to keep their feet dry.</p><p>Each night, Madam Fatimah listens anxiously to the waves crashing on the 10m tall concrete wall protecting her sinking neighbourhood, Muara Baru, from the rising sea.</p><p>During full and new moons when the tides are at their peak or during the monsoon season when the seas are rough, she barely sleeps at all.</p><p>The coastal floods sometimes come unexpectedly and without warning. Last month, the sea rose so quickly it almost reached the top of the wall. Salt water was seeping through the structure's cracks, inundating her congested neighbourhood, which is already around 5m below sea level, under ankle-deep water.</p><p>\"I am scared that the wall might collapse one day. I can't imagine what it will be like if that happens,\" the 45-year-old said.</p><p>Because in Muara Baru water has nowhere to go but to be absorbed by the soil, Mdm Fatimah said her neighbourhood was not completely dry until five days later.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, Jakarta has been sinking at a rate of up to 25 cm per year, particularly in coastal areas like Muara Baru, which lie on loose and unconsolidated soil and sediment.</p><p>According to some studies, around 20 per cent of Jakarta is already below sea level, including the estuaries of the city's 13 rivers.</p><p>This makes the city more susceptible to fluvial floods - rivers overflowing and inundating nearby lower lying areas - as the waterways lose their natural ability to drain themselves to the sea. During the rainy season, Jakarta has to rely on more than 200 pumping stations along the coastal areas to flush out to sea the influx of water coming in from these rivers.</p><p>With some studies suggesting that the whole of Jakarta could be below sea level by 2050, Indonesia is moving its capital from Jakarta to Nusantara, a city built from scratch some 1,200km away in Borneo.</p><p>The Nusantara move aside, Indonesia has been mulling the idea of building a 30km long giant sea wall around 4km off the coast of Jakarta, where the ground is not sinking.</p><p>The plan, first proposed in 2014, promised to serve as a permanent solution to Jakarta's land subsidence as well as rising sea level brought by climate change.</p><p>The US$3.7 billion wall is designed to have multiple purposes: A toll road connecting Jakarta and its suburbs; and a pond where water fed by Jakarta's 13 rivers are collected and treated as a source of drinking water.</p><p>\"The question is: Who is going to finance this sea wall?\" Dr Yayat Supriyatna, an urban planning expert from Jakarta's Trisakti University, told CNA.</p><p>\"Is there anyone interested in investing? Even if it serves as a toll road and a fresh water source, and we can make money off of it, will (the project) be profitable?\" The plan was later shelved because of a lack of investment as well as criticisms that it could damage Jakarta's delicate mangrove ecosystem - which requires a mixture of fresh and saltwater - and make it harder for fishermen to sail out of Jakarta Bay and catch fish in the Java Sea.</p><p>However, Indonesia's new president Prabowo Subianto is considering not only reviving the Jakarta sea wall project but also extending it all the way to Gresik, some 650km away.</p><p>A spokesman from the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works said on Oct 10 that the ministry will soon get to work on the design of the 650km long wall.</p><p>Dr Heri Andreas, a researcher at the Bandung Institute of Technology, said building a giant sea wall, no matter the length, does not address the root cause of the problem: The over-extraction of groundwater.</p><p>\"Finding new sources of clean water and expanding the municipal water network will be much more effective and cheaper than building a giant sea wall,\" he told CNA, adding that as Jakarta's population grows by around 100,000 every year, the city will need more drinking water.</p><p>And ironically, that is the main reason why Jakarta is sinking in the first place. WATER EVERYWHERE IN JAKARTA BUT NOTHING TO DRINK</p><p>According to a 2021 study conducted by the Jakarta Environmental Agency, 74 per cent of the water from Jakarta's rivers are severely contaminated by solid waste, heavy metals and bacteria. These rivers also feed the city's flood retention ponds and basins.</p><p>To make things worse, only around 940,000 homes, offices and factories have access to municipal water, according to data from the city's piped water distribution company PAM Jaya.</p><p>This leaves little choice for the rest of Jakarta's 11.3 million population but to rely on groundwater.</p><p>However, over-extracting groundwater from underground aquifers can cause the soil above them to compact and sink.</p><p>Dr Heri, an expert on geodesy - the study of how the Earth's geometry changes over time - said it is hard to get people to understand the consequences of extracting groundwater because land subsidence happens gradually over a long period of time.</p><p>\"Which is why people keep digging deeper and deeper for water without realising that their neighbourhoods are sinking,\" he said.</p><p>Today, Jakarta relies on walls and dikes built along the capital's coast lines to keep sea water at bay.</p><p>But because these structures sit close to areas affected by land subsidence, the dikes are also sinking and need to be raised and reinforced regularly. As bodies of water in Jakarta are polluted, the city relies on fresh water piped from dozens of kilometres away in neighbouring West Java and Banten provinces.</p><p>\"Jakarta has too much water during the rainy season but not enough during the dry season,\" Mr Nirwono Joga, executive director of think-tank Centre for Urban Studies, told CNA.</p><p>To mitigate this, Jakarta needs more places to store water such as open green spaces and reservoirs.</p><p>The government, he said, must also ensure that water from the hilly upstream areas, around 50km south of Jakarta, stays clean by the time it reaches the city.</p><p>\"The problem is illegal settlements and factories along the riverbanks. (Does the government) have the courage to enforce their zoning laws and relocate these settlements (and) shut down industries polluting the environment?,\" Mr Nirwono said.</p><p>This requires Jakarta to work together with two provinces, four cities and five regencies surrounding the metropolis.</p><p>But Dr Yayat of Trisakti University said this is hard because each government has its own priorities and interests. The urban planning expert said Bogor, a mountainous regency where most of Jakarta's 13 rivers originate, needs to stop issuing permits for more villas and resorts in order to preserve the upstream area, improve the soil's ability to absorb rain and prevent flood prone rivers to overflow by the time they reach Jakarta.</p><p>\"But for Bogor, these villas, hotels and restaurants are sources of revenue. What compensation can Jakarta give if Bogor were to dismantle these villas and restore the forest?\" he said.</p><p>KL: DARK HORIZONS, TUNNELS OF SAFETY</p><p>Across in neighbouring Malaysia, in the capital Kuala Lumpur, authorities and residents alike have learnt in recent years that they too cannot outrun or ignore the water around them.</p><p>Whenever Mr Muarif Matrawi observes black skies in the horizon from his home in Kampung Chubadak in Kuala Lumpur, he gets worried.</p><p>He knows that even a short spell of rain can result in the river near his home rising quickly.</p><p>In the past one and half years, he has seen his one-storey home inundated by flood waters twice, the first time resulting in him having to get rid of his belongings such as mattresses and some electrical devices.</p><p>He has taken his own measures to prevent flood waters from entering his home by building a small concrete barrier at the front door of his home.</p><p>\"It is very worrisome for us living in this area every time there is heavy rain. It doesn't have to be for very long before the water rises,\" said the 61-year-old contractor.</p><p>He is not alone. As Kuala Lumpur continues to grow and develop rapidly, the threat of flash floods looms every time there are heavy downpours. Several rivers run through Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley, with two of the biggest rivers - the Klang River and the Gombak river - converging in the city centre.</p><p>Authorities and experts say that changing weather patterns have resulted in the country experiencing more frequent and heavier rainfall events in recent years as existing infrastructure is not able to cope with the deluge of rain.</p><p>So much so that in August of this year, the authorities declared 14 new flash flood hotspots in the city, bringing the total number to 39 hotspots.</p><p>\"Climate change is a challenge in overcoming this problem. Previously, August wasn't the rainy season, but now it's all changed,\" Kuala Lumpur mayor Maimunah Mohd Sharif was quoted as saying by state media agency Bernama back in August.</p><p>Ms Maimunah said the city was looking at speeding up mitigation projects to overcome the issue, including to intensify periodic maintenance of the Onsite Stormwater Detention Ponds, rivers and main drains.</p><p>She added that deepening work at the nine detention ponds is being carried out, along with the upgrading of roadside drainage systems.</p><p>In a statement on Oct 19 - a few days after flash floods hit parts of the city - Ms Maimunah said that three flood mitigation projects have been completed, three projects were being carried out while another eight projects were to be implemented.</p><p>All the projects were slated to be completed by the first quarter of next year, she said.</p><p>Ms Maimunah also said that the city hall had installed water level sensors at 30 flood risk areas including rivers and drains that would alert authorities of rising water levels that could cause flooding.</p><p>The Institute of Engineers Malaysia vice-president Nor Hisham Mohd Ghazalli told CNA that the current infrastructure has not been able to keep up with the rapid rate of urbanisation.</p><p>He said that some of the existing systems were not built for high-intensity rainfall.</p><p>\"There seems to be a change in weather patterns where we are getting high-intensity rainfall more frequently. Because of that, existing systems get overloaded and cannot cope, causing flash floods to occur,\" said the former Director-General of the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia from Feb 2020 to Nov 2021.</p><p>Grey infrastructure has been central to the capital's adaptation strategy. The Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel (SMART) - a project under the Federal Government initiated to alleviate the flooding problem in the city - was opened in 2007.</p><p>The 9.7km tunnel, which cost about RM1.9 billion (US$443 million) to construct, runs from the southern part of Kuala Lumpur to the city centre.</p><p>Its purpose is twofold - to relieve traffic congestion and for flood management.</p><p>When it rains heavily, the SMART system can divert large volumes of flood water via two holding ponds, a bypass tunnel and a storage reservoir.</p><p>\"The tunnel was purposefully built to divert flows away from the area where two rivers meet in the city. From the upstream of the confluence, the flow is diverted into the tunnel that bypasses the city centre altogether,\" Mr Nor Hisham said, adding that there have been no major floods in the city centre since the tunnel came into operation.</p><p>The tunnel alone addresses about 45 per cent of Klang Valley's major floods, SMART's chief operating officer Mohd Noor Mohd Ali said in an interview with the Star in 2022. Mr Nor Hisham said that the flash floods such as those in early October are known as nuisance floods caused by blockages and damage to existing structures.</p><p>He said that the rapid pace of urbanisation has caused green areas to be paved over, with the ability of the land to absorb rainfall drastically reduced.</p><p>\"Maybe it is time to reverse the process and purposefully create more green areas from existing pavements. For example, if we are looking at parking lots which were tarred over, we must go back to something more permeable,\" he said. GREY VS GREEN</p><p>The situation in all three cities is an example of the contest of ideas between building more grey infrastructure versus harnessing nature instead to solve water issues.</p><p>In Thailand, as the Pearl Necklace concept emerged from the depths and onto the desks of decision-makers, a debate has been further ignited about the role of nature as a complement - or even a substitution - to those works.</p><p>Ms Kotchakorn Voraakhom, an internationally acclaimed landscape architect who collaborates closely with the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration to design and implement visionary water management projects in the city, says the co-benefits that nature provides for cities are often overlooked.</p><p>The chief executive of the Porous City Network and founder of Bangkok-based firm Landprocess has been behind projects like the Chulalongkorn University Centenary Park and Chong Nonsi Canal Park, which are leading examples of nature-based solutions at work.</p><p>She is still battling to push this philosophy more broadly, to have it incorporated into everything the city does in the future. Resistance and inertia remain, she said.</p><p>\"Living with water hasn't been a strategy for Bangkok. It seems like Bangkok is actually trying to live without water and it's impossible because we are talking about a delta city.</p><p>\"The city actually is on top of this natural dynamic. And when we're not putting nature at the centre and we only think about human-centric development, we are losing the balance of how the city can be resilient and how it can be sustained,\" she said.</p><p>\"Nature can be part of great infrastructure, and great infrastructure has to prioritise the regeneration of the nature that we have destroyed. Living with nature is the only way to survive.\" Her concerns extend to the Gulf of Thailand, where she would prefer to see the natural dynamics of mangrove forests restored and local communities empowered as protectors, rather than a vast project that could do more harm than good if not fairly considered.</p><p>\"I hope that the Pearl Necklace project won't choke our neck as a nation,\" she said, expressing concern that blocking the sea could exacerbate challenges around the vast amounts of water from the country's north draining into the sea, year-round.</p><p>\"If we have more structures that are actually going to make this water flow in the opposite direction, that means we're going to create a flooded Bangkok forever. We're going to create the biggest stagnant water in the world,\" she said.</p><p>\"For me it's actually showing how we still want to fight against nature rather than live with it.\"</p><p>Mr Nirwono of Indonesia's Centre for Urban Studies said that nature can also provide a solution for Jakarta's land subsidence and coastal erosion problems.</p><p>\"Instead of a giant sea wall, why not build a giant wall of mangroves?\" he told CNA, arguing that reforesting the coastal areas will not only be a more ecological friendly solution but be economically beneficial.</p><p>\"Fish and other marine life can also thrive and serve as a source of income for our fishermen.\" And for some Malaysian experts, Kuala Lumpur should further explore and adopt the \"Sponge City\" concept, which has been substantially adopted in China to overcome the urban flood issues in recent years.</p><p>It too is an example of harnessing nature to improve urban defences.</p><p>A \"sponge city\" would include permeable roads, rooftop gardens, the building of wetlands and man-made lakes, the construction of community gardens and planting of trees, said Dr Mohd Fairullazi Ayob of the Department of Architecture and Environmental Design of the International Islamic University Malaysia.</p><p>Through nature-focused landscaping, cities are more able to absorb and retain water, reducing surface run-off and reducing the risk of floods, he said.</p><p>\"The Sponge City is a city with a water system that is highly adaptable to environmental changes and natural disasters that acts like a sponge, absorbing, storing, infiltrating, cleaning and purifying rainwater before releasing it for reuse.\"</p><p>He pointed out that the Malaysia government had announced in 2022 to conduct a feasibility study in developing the proposed SMART 2 tunnel, a new flood mitigation measure for the city of Shah Alam in Selangor, which was devastated by flooding in December, 2021.</p><p>The 22km underground tunnel proposed by Gamuda, the company behind SMART, would embed the \"sponge city\" concept within it, Dr Mohd Fairullazi Ayob noted.</p><p>The system would absorb rainwater and surface runoff through interception and infiltration, storing water underground for regulated release to the sea later. WORKING TOGETHER AMID COMPLEXITIES</p><p>Each of the three capitals - and many other cities facing similar water challenges - have complex problems to contend with.</p><p>Mr Nirwono in Indonesia said Jakarta's issues require multiple ministries and local governments at various levels to work together.</p><p>To overcome this bureaucratic mess, Indonesia must look at other cities like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur in how they manage their water and mitigate disaster, he argued.</p><p>\"Bangkok for example has the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration which manages not only the Thai capital itself but also the surrounding areas,\" he said.</p><p>The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration too also has limits to what it can achieve, when flooding issues are so systemic and incorporate national infrastructure across the expanse of the country.</p><p>Indonesia is forming the so-called Jakarta Agglomeration Area Council, with the country's newly inaugurated vice-president Gibran Rakabuming Raka - former President Joko Widodo's son - among the names touted to head it.</p><p>The council is tasked with coming up with a blueprint to solve problems such as transportation, flooding, spatial planning and environmental degradation in Jakarta and its suburbs, and coordinate its implementation with related ministries, provinces, cities and regencies.</p><p>But the formation of the new council raises many questions over its effectiveness.</p><p>\"How powerful will this new body be? If the body has no power to force different municipalities and regencies to follow its masterplan, if the body does not manage its own budgets needed to finance various infrastructure projects then the body is doomed to fail,\" Mr Nirwono said. Within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the policy framework under Article 7 encourages member states to share strategies, resources and knowledge to better respond to events like flooding.</p><p>It should be leaned upon more readily, according to Mr Decharut Sukkumnoed, director of the Think Forward Center in Thailand.</p><p>\"It's very necessary to coordinate this. We can invest together. We can share together and we can prepare better together,\" he told a panel event in Bangkok this month.</p><p>Finding commonalities in nature-based solutions, and looking to the past for solutions are both ways that regional cities could also help each other going forward, said Mr Pakkasem Tongchai, programme officer on water and wetlands at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</p><p>\"Every city has its own problems and their own systems. But the same problem is the water,\" he said.</p><p>\"Nature-based solutions actually connect everyone. People always think about the new thing or the new technology. But to me, I think the things that we have in the past can guide us to something that we can help in the future.</p><p>\"Because people in the past knew how to live with water,\" he said.</p><p>While planning continues on paper and strategies get developed, affected locals live a strained reality.</p><p>With the sea already higher than the second storey of her home, Jakarta resident Fatimah said she is worried about the future of her neighbourhood, Muara Baru.</p><p>\"Maybe this whole area will become one with the sea some day,\" she said as she gazed emptily at a swampy wasteland where her childhood home used to be.</p><p>In her years living here, Mdm Fatimah has had to move houses twice because the Jakarta government needed her land: First to build a retainer wall in 2009 and later a pumping station in 2014.</p><p>\"When city officials told me to move, I did so without making a fuss,\" she said. \"I have done my bit. I just need the government to do theirs.\" The residents of Bang Khun Thian have been moving too, as the water has bitten away at their land on the coast.</p><p>\"I am scared because there's nothing that can fend it off. When the waves come, they come a lot. And all the villagers are in trouble,\" said Mr Sinsamut Phuttameephol, a 64-year-old fisherman.</p><p>Their livelihoods - their very future in shrinking ancestral grounds - are at stake. Their space is being enveloped on two fronts, by the sprawl of the city growing around them and from coastal erosion.</p><p>Soon, a mega project might land on their horizon. Some locals along the coast are already mobilising against it.</p><p>Yet Mr Plodprasop - behind the Pearl Necklace vision - has little patience for protest, another reminder of the often stark split between those living the impacts of flooding and those wielding the power of change.</p><p>\"Instead of thanking us for saving their lives, they disagree,\" he said. \"You're the first to be underwater.

In response, the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) has taken proactive measures by identifying 175 high-risk trees, most of which are over 50 years old, and cutting down 147 of them. Regular inspections by certified arborists have identified 28 additional high-risk trees slated for removal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban trees are essential to urban planning, providing environmental, social, economic, psychological, and educational benefits. They improve air quality, support biodiversity, manage water resources, regulate temperatures, sequester carbon, and enhance community well-being. Trees also add aesthetic value, promote recreation, foster social cohesion, lead to energy savings, boost property values, and contribute to psychological well-being, fostering a deep connection to nature, especially for children.</p><p>Given these multifaceted benefits, municipal landscape departments must ensure proper growth and structural development, including identifying and replacing unhealthy trees when needed. Landscape architects and designers face critical tasks like addressing site availability, soil conditions, species selection, growth requirements, and maintenance to integrate street trees effectively. Despite these challenges, urban trees play a vital role in climate change adaptation by reducing temperatures by up to 8 degC, mitigating urban heat islands, and managing stormwater, crucial for preventing urban flooding during heavy rainfall events.</p><p>In response to these challenges, DBKL is enhancing its Shade Tree Management Plan and preparing new guidelines for managing old and high-risk trees, expected to be completed by July. However, there is a need for a broader enhancement of the National Plan, shifting from mere mitigation to comprehensive adaptation strategies. Globally, cities are developing innovative solutions for climate adaptation, including Paris, France; Medellin, Colombia; and Wuhan, China. Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are at the forefront of globally recommended strategies. In 2020, Penang's nature-based approach to tackling climate change, led by Think City and the Penang Island City Council, won the Climathon Global Awards for the best climate project by a global city that year. This initiative has paved the way for further studies on climate-resilient urban tree species in Malaysia, and the execution of the Penang Nature-based Climate Adaptation Programme has since been launched.</p><p>Exploratory research by Think City indicated that urban tree species in Malaysia are already being affected by climate change. Understanding the resilience of different tree species to various climate impacts is critical for species selection. This study emphasised the necessity of selecting climate-resilient tree species, considering factors like habitat specialisation, saltwater intrusion, inundation tolerance, high-temperature tolerance, storm tolerance, water absence tolerance, humidity requirements, and susceptibility to predation, parasitism, and disease. Choosing the right tree for the right location is vital to ensure their longevity and functionality in urban environments, focusing on appropriate landscape typologies like urban streets, small green spaces, blue-green corridors, and seafronts.</p><p>Expanding knowledge about resilient tree species for urban planting is crucial for better-informed urban forest management decisions. Collaboration among arborists, botanists, landscape architects, urban planners, and the National Landscape Department is crucial. The government should allocate sufficient funding to enhance the effectiveness of existing tree planting campaigns, promoting more efficient tree planting and maintenance efforts. Implementing protective measures during early years, such as adequately sized tree pits with high-quality soil, root barriers, and permeable pavements, and requiring a two-year maintenance period for newly planted trees by developers or responsible parties, will contribute to a more resilient and adaptive urban forestry strategy in Malaysia, ensuring the sustainability and safety of urban environments amidst climate change challenges.</p><p>Addressing the surge of tree falls in Malaysia amidst rising climate challenges requires a comprehensive approach that balances historical preservation, environmental benefits, climate adaptation, and public safety. The proactive measures undertaken by DBKL, including the identification and removal of high-risk trees, are immediate steps. However, as climate change continues to exacerbate extreme weather conditions, a more comprehensive and national adaptive strategy is required. NbS offers a promising pathway for urban resilience. By learning from global examples and investing in local research, Malaysia can promote climate-resilient tree species through collaboration among arborists, botanists, landscape architects, and government bodies.</p><p>Ultimately, the future of Malaysia's urban landscapes hinges on our ability to adapt and innovate in the face of climate change. By prioritising both ecological sustainability and public safety, Malaysia can protect its green infrastructure, preserve its cultural heritage, and ensure the well-being of its urban populations. This holistic approach will not only reduce the risks of tree falls but also enhance the liveability and resilience of Malaysian cities for generations to come.</p><p>* Hamdan Abdul Majeed is the managing director of Think City</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

In 1971, a catastrophic flood swept through various parts of the country, particularly impacting Pahang with significant losses. </p><p>The Department of Irrigation and Drainage identified several causes of flooding, including increased runoff rates due to urbanisation, the loss of flood storage due to development encroaching on flood plains, inadequate drainage systems, constriction at bridges and culverts, siltation in waterway channels, local heavy rainfall, tidal backwater effect and inadequate river capacity. </p><p>Hence, addressing these issues is essential for effective flood management and mitigation strategies in the country. </p><p>Learning From the Netherlands</p><p>Addressing the water crisis, particularly in the context of both droughts and floods, requires strategic measures to ensure a reliable water supply for Malaysia. </p><p>Drawing insights from the Netherlands, a country below sea level with a rich history of water management spanning over 1,000 years, there are valuable lessons to consider. </p><p>\"I think the first lesson to be learned is not only to invest in new infrastructure, but to really make sure you maintain the infrastructure that you have. </p><p>\"Water infrastructure can last for decades, so if you operate and maintain it properly, you do not have to keep spending money in building new infrastructure,\" van Ginneken told The Malaysian Reserve (TMR) in a recorded video interview. </p><p>During the 6th Malaysia-the Netherlands Water Dialogue in November 2023, Natural Resources, and Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said Malaysia is keen on expanding its collaboration with the Netherlands to develop pilot projects focused on flood mitigation and climate resilience. </p><p>The ministry and the Netherlands Embassy have been involved in various collaborations, including assistance from the Dutch Surge Support (DSS) scheme to address water disasters. </p><p>The collaboration aims to strengthen Malaysia's response to future flood risks and related climate change impacts. </p><p>Nik Nazmi also expressed hope in learning from the Netherlands' experiences, especially in water management, considering its success in handling water-related challenges. </p><p>The annual dialogue serves as a platform for experts to discuss a range of waterrelated topics such as wastewater treatment, water pollution, non-revenue water, flood mitigation and technological solutions. </p><p>Malaysia's Flood Management Adaptation </p><p>According to the UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs (Sustainable Development), Malaysia employs a holistic strategy for flood mitigation, incorporating both structural and non-structural measures. </p><p>The comprehensive approach includes nature-based solutions, short-term preparedness through infrastructure maintenance and long-term strategies like early warning systems. </p><p>Furthermore, Malaysia emphasises the integration of adaptation into water management, regulatory interventions for climate change and effective community engagement. </p><p>This is evident through the increase of budget allocation for flood mitigation projects in the 11th (2016- 2020) and 12th Malaysia (2021-2025) Plans, amounting to RM19 billion for flood mitigation and RM5 billion for coastal protection. </p><p>Apart from that, the non-structural measures involve nature-based solutions, integrated water resources management and resettlement programmes. </p><p>Malaysia's proactive stance incorporates climate change considerations into infrastructure design and promotes resilience through shared hazard maps with relevant agencies. </p><p>However, the UN foresees that the end-of-century projections anticipate a rise in the average annual surface temperature (1.9\u00b0C to 2.1\u00b0C) and an increase in average annual precipitation (14% to 25%) in Malaysia. </p><p>The sea level is also expected to rise by approximately 0.7m. </p><p>These changes pose a risk of increased vulnerability to floods, impacting various sectors such as agriculture, industry, tourism and energy, potentially affecting the economy and population. </p><p>The December 2021 flood alone resulted in estimated losses and damages of RM6.2 billion across 11 states. </p><p>In response, Malaysia is enhancing flood mitigation and integrating climate change adaptation, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 13, with broader benefits for SDGs 1.5, 2.4, 6.5 and 9.1. </p><p>Discussions at COP28 </p><p>At COP28, the discussions centred on both climate mitigation, primarily focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions like CO2, and climate adaptation, with a particular emphasis on water. </p><p>The importance of water extends beyond being viewed merely as a sector;

He warned that the nation's mangroves could potentially drown if the sea level rises by just one metre - a scenario that could become a reality by the year 2100, according to the latest National Climate Change Study.</p><p>Updated projections from the report, which was released last Friday (Jan 5), said the mean sea level around Singapore will rise even higher than previous estimates.</p><p>The findings from the Center of Climate Research Singapore are based on three climate change scenarios of low, medium and high carbon emissions. In the worst case scenario, the increase in mean sea level is projected at between 0.54m and 1.15m, which could spell trouble for mangroves and other coastal habitats.</p><p>\"Sandy shores, mudflats, coral reefs, seagrass meadows - they will be largely affected... and these act as a nursery for many fishes and marine organisms ... This means future generations may not be able to enjoy our nature reserve areas like Sungei Buloh,\" said Mr Tan.</p><p>SPECIES AT RISK</p><p>The mangroves' demise would also affect native species like the mangrove horseshoe crab, which is already listed as vulnerable. The encroaching sea could also wipe out their coastal cousin - the coastal horseshoe crab - that is already endangered largely from habitat loss.</p><p>These prehistoric horseshoe crabs have been around for the past 400 million years, and used to be found in abundance in Singapore until urbanisation drove down their numbers.</p><p>\"We have already started losing sight of these horseshoe crabs and they have diminished all the way to the northwestern part of Singapore,\" said Mr Tan, who is the chairman of the NSS' Marine Conservation Group.</p><p>\"Small pockets (can still be found), but with the constant sea level rise, warming waters, loss in sedimentation ... we will perhaps get less and less of these horseshoe crabs in our shorelines.\"</p><p>The freshwater crab, a critically endangered crab found only in Singapore, faces the risk of extinction if temperatures continue to rise and their habitats dry up. \"It's difficult for freshwater crabs to swim across the sea to Malaysia or Indonesia, so they are stuck here,\" said NSS President Dr Yeo Seng Beng.</p><p>As the species does not exist anywhere else, it is also critically endangered globally and hence could easily go extinct.</p><p>\"History won't be kind to Singapore if we allow endemic species which only exist here to disappear,\" he added.</p><p>Losing these habitats also puts other wildlife at risk of losing shorelines to breed, nest and feed, including the endangered hawksbill turtles that come in on the tides.</p><p>Migratory birds flying in for the summer, which make up about half of all birds found in Singapore, will also be affected.</p><p>They include the Eurasian Whimbrel, the Common Redshank and the Pacific Golden Plover, which are common visitors to the nation's mudflats and coastal areas. Diminishing nature means they will lose their foraging ground along their migratory routes, said Dr Yeo.</p><p>\"In ecosystems, every species is interconnected. You can't affect one species without affecting the other. We should look at how (entire) habitats are affected by climate change,\" he said.</p><p>EFFECTS ON HUMANS</p><p>Disappearing nature could also cause substantial problems for humans as well.</p><p>\"Apart from losing our scenic views and natural heritage, we lose ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration. We have less nurseries for fishes to grow, and we lose nature-based solutions to erosion and coastal issues,\" said Mr Tan.</p><p>Mangroves can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere four times more efficiently than other forest types, and store that carbon for thousands of years in their waterlogged soils.</p><p>They also protect coastlines by breaking sea waves during storm surges and help shield seagrass beds and coral reefs from the effects of siltation. Animals who have lost their homes could also venture into human spaces, leading to forced interactions and increasing the risk of the spread of diseases, said Dr Yeo.</p><p>A NATIONAL EFFORT</p><p>The National Parks Board (NParks) is putting in place measures to protect some of these critically endangered species.</p><p>For instance, the agency last year successfully bred freshwater crabs in captivity and released them into the wild in hopes of establishing more colonies in nature sites around the island. Aside from government initiatives, Singaporeans must also do their part, said advocates.</p><p>\"For everyday folks, the basic rules of conservation such as reducing waste, using public transport and minimising the use of air conditioning could help to reduce carbon emissions and help to mitigate the effects,\" said Mr Tan.</p><p>The study also projects best-case scenarios in which countries around the world meet their net zero targets. With a low emissions setting, mean sea level is set to increase up to 0.74m at the end of the century and temperatures are expected to rise 1.8 degrees Celsius.</p><p>Dr Yeo said it is the only scenario to strive for.</p><p>\"It's a document that not only warns us about the future, but also tells us which direction we should go. We should take it quite seriously if we want to change the future,\" he said.</p><p>\"For the good of our future generations, there has to be a change in mindset and everybody has to be involved.

This will allow us to retain the existing East Coast Park, largely as it is,\" said Mr Lee, noting that people wanted to retain the unimpeded access to the waterfront.</p><p>The minister said Long Island would create opportunities for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>\"They could build homes, create jobs, develop services and amenities that they need, and add around 20km of new coastal and reservoir parks, extending from the current East Coast Park. This will triple the length of the existing waterfront area along East Coast Park today.\" Studies have projected a rise in mean sea level of up to 1m by 2100. Combined with the possible high tides and storm surges, the sea level could rise by 4m to 5m, threatening Singapore's shorelines.</p><p>Since 2021, Singapore has progressively conducted site-specific studies for different segments of its coastline. In September, it launched its first research centre dedicated to strengthening local capabilities and expertise in coastal protection and flood management.</p><p>Around one-third of Singapore is less than 5m above mean sea level including East Coast Park, a recreational area around the size of 180ha which sees 7.5 million visits annually, according to the National Parks Board.</p><p>The effects of high sea levels at the park - Singapore's largest park with a span of about 13km - are already being felt. In 2018 and in January this year, swathes of the park were flooded due to rain and high tide. The authorities had studied the possibility of a 3m-high sea wall along the entire waterfront of East Coast Park, from Marina East to Tanah Merah.</p><p>These would be accompanied by 12 tidal gates and pumping stations along each of the existing outlet drains to keep the sea out and to pump rainwater out when heavy rain coincides with high tide. Given the current use of East Coast Park for recreational activities, however, these measures would limit the current access to the beach and cause disruption to park users during constructions, noted Mr Lee.</p><p>The number of tidal gates and pumping stations needed would come at the expense of a substantial portion of existing park space - around 15 football fields if the 12 tidal gates and pumping stations were installed, said Mr Lee.</p><p>\"In essence, this approach means that we implement coastal protection along the existing East Coast Park, but lose significant portions of the park and recreational use of the coastline,\" said the minister.</p><p>The authorities settled on Long Island as a more optimal solution.

It can also be \"intermittent\", depending on factors such as the changing weather, he noted.</p><p>\"Hence, AI is being used in the development of energy storage solutions such as batteries for facilitating this transition towards electrification and green energy for a decentralised grid of the future,\" he said.</p><p>\"Similarly, better forecasting of the availability of intermittent renewable energy such as solar, and the optimisation of these systems can allow us to move towards a net-zero future.\"</p><p>AI can also be used in \"greening building operations\", added Prof Tsang, pointing to \"energy-hungry\" data centres.</p><p>AI can improve designs to maximise ventilation and reduce the need for cooling, such as via air-conditioning, even in an \"increasingly warming climate\". In turn, these AI models can serve as predictive models for \"digital twinning\", enabling greener and more energy-efficient operations.</p><p>At the consumer level, Google's Ms Brandt shared that AI is helping to recommend the best charging stops for electric vehicle users in Singapore on Google Maps. These suggestions are based on factors like current traffic situation, charge level and expected energy consumption. DISASTER PREVENTION</p><p>In the broader Southeast Asia region, which can be more prone to extreme weather events, AI can also be used for disaster prediction and prevention.</p><p>With haze being a recurrent transboundary air pollution issue in the region, AI-driven air quality monitoring systems can provide real-time data on air pollution levels, which can \"provide warning to the public and drive public agency decision-making to improve air quality and reduce emissions\", said Prof Tsang.</p><p>AI can also improve the accuracy of weather forecasting models, allowing for \"more reliable predictions\" of extreme weather events, such as typhoons, heavy rainfall and flooding, he added.</p><p>Pointing to how sea levels are rising faster in Southeast Asia than any other part of the world, as well as how countries in the region \"fall victim to many climate hazards\" due to low-lying countries, Ms Brandt said that Google's AI can help communities through hyperlocal flood forecasting models that predict where riverine floods will occur.</p><p>\"This way, we are able to alert people in areas that will be impacted, up to seven days in advance before disaster strikes. We can also share information on where they can go to be safe,\" she added.</p><p>\"This is integral because accurate and accessible forecasting has the potential to decrease fatalities and economic damages by 30 to 50 per cent.\" Developing countries at the United Nations COP27 climate summit last year proposed a climate \"loss and damage\" fund to unlock at least US$100 billion by 2030 to address irreversible damage caused by climate change.</p><p>While countries agreed to the fund, no decision has yet been made on which countries will bear the cost and which will benefit. But some have argued that rich countries contribute the most to climate change and owe a debt to poorer ones who are least responsible yet suffer the most.</p><p>In the meantime, individual organisations of all sizes can also contribute to climate change, Ms Brandt believes.</p><p>On one hand, small companies have an \"integral role\" to play in tackling climate change, especially with their \"hyperlocal insights\" and \"on-the-ground experience\". Instead of taking the wheel, larger companies can then support smaller organisations who require monetary or technical support to realise their solutions and help them scale, she added.</p><p>Google.org, the tech giant's philanthropic arm, committed US$1 million to Singapore's Mandai Nature last year as part of its efforts to combat climate change.</p><p>On Thursday (Sep 28), it announced its continued commitment to AVPN's APAC Sustainability Seed Fund with a funding grant of another US$5 million, bringing its total support to US$8 million over two years. FOOD SECURITY</p><p>Nonetheless, as such extreme weather affects the food we put on our table, AI can step in to help the agriculture industry adapt to climate change so their practices don't become obsolete, noted Prof Tsang.</p><p>\"Modern agribusinesses can use AI to analyse their farms' data for crop yield predictions or climate control, especially in the face of climate change. Specific to Singapore, AI can assist businesses in becoming more efficient, especially in the face of land and manpower constraints,\" he explained.</p><p>For example, A*STAR's partnership with Archisen, an agri-tech firm based in Singapore, helped the firm to produce up to 100 tonnes of vegetables annually, by using AI to create a predictive model that determined key parameters affecting yield and quality.</p><p>On the other side of the world, Mr Eric Enno Tamm, CEO and co-founder of This Fish, a Vancouver-based software and AI company for the seafood industry, has seen how warmer ocean conditions have created algae blooms, resulting in \"large aquaculture die-offs\".</p><p>He added that sockeye salmon - the \"very red, high-quality sushi salmon\" often found in sushi restaurants - being produced out of British Columbia has also \"gone down considerably\" in the last 20 years.</p><p>Even though one might assume AI can help fishermen predict future fishing patterns, Mr Enno Tamm, whose firm has a couple of customers in Singapore, highlighted that climate change might ironically impede this development.</p><p>He recalled a conversation with tuna fishermen from the Philippines about whether digitising about 20 years of their logbook data, on where they caught their fish and the past weather conditions, would help them to predict which would be the best areas to fish for the future.</p><p>\"The one thing they said that was interesting is that because climate change has been changing patterns, where the stocks are and (the fish) migrations, they felt that actually all of that historic fishing data may not help them understand where to catch fish in the future,\" he said.</p><p>\"In this case, climate change is actually jamming AI. Most machine learning uses historical data to predict the future. But if we fundamentally change the environmental regime ... then actually your historical data is not going to help you that much for the future.\"</p><p>Still, Mr Enno Tamm added, AI can help fish farmers \"at a microscale\", such as understanding how changing ocean conditions today would affect the behaviour of their fish over the next month.</p><p>\"The biggest impacts, I think, from climate change are going to be on the ocean. Because we're not aquatic animals, we're not going to see it as quickly. But we'll see it in our food,\" he said. AI IN \"NATURE-BASED\" SOLUTIONS</p><p>Over at the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions (CNCS) at the National University of Singapore, research has taken on a slightly different slant. The centre focuses on tackling climate change with nature.</p><p>\"While climate change is a major crisis confronting humanity today, another crisis is looming - biodiversity loss. Nature-based solutions can help our efforts in tackling them both,\" the centre's director, Professor Koh Lian Pin, told CNA.</p><p>Using the example of saving forests, Prof Koh said ensuring forests remain intact not only prevents the release of greenhouse gas emissions associated with deforestation. Forests are also home to wildlife, and deliver water purification to local communities.</p><p>Still, there are \"some uncertainties\" involved in quantifying the role of nature, he noted. \"Most estimates on natural carbon storage by forests in Southeast Asia are done using global or pantropical models - a one-size-fits-all approach.\"</p><p>As such, CNCS last year launched the Carbon Integrity research project, which aims to develop models specific to Southeast Asia by leveraging AI.</p><p>CNCS works with partners to establish \"forest monitoring plots\" where carbon estimates are made using tree measurements taken during field surveys, Prof Koh explained.</p><p>Then, a drone- or airplane-mounted Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor is used to scan the forest plots and collect data. This data includes the density of canopy cover and the varying heights of trees, and can also be used to observe the forest structure at a larger spatial scale.</p><p>This data, together with information on land cover from satellites, supplements carbon estimates derived from field measurements.</p><p>To estimate the amount of carbon in different forest types, researchers then bring in machine learning - a subset of AI that recognises patterns in large data sets - to identify relationships between the data sets and develop models combining field measurements, LiDAR data and satellite data.</p><p>The end goal? Having these models estimate carbon in the future using \"only the satellite data\", said Prof Koh.</p><p>Having models of specific forest types will provide \"more accurate estimates\" of carbon storage in Southeast Asia's forests and natural habitats, he added.</p><p>And this could then help policymakers \"prioritise areas for conservation or give land developers greater confidence to protect forests as forest carbon projects, instead of felling them for other land uses\".

It is obvious - sacrificing assets which generate income in the long term is a poor way to solve short-term issues. In the same vein, we must consider how we are managing the fundamental assets which our economy, and in fact our society and very lives depend on - our natural capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A calculation provided by the international research organisation Global Footprint Network, shows that we are using our resources at an alarmingly fast rate. It is only a matter of time until already degraded ecosystems begin to collapse. Earth Overshoot Day is the day when we have used up, more from nature, than the Earth can replenish in a year. This means that from that date until 31 December, we are in debt to the planet. To everyone's dismay, it is coming earlier each year. In 2023, it was on 2 August, and we have been in deficit since 1970.</p><p>For Malaysia, this year's Earth Overshoot Day was even earlier, on 16 May. The analogy of \"belum habis bulan, sudah habis gaji\" (spending your entire salary before the end of the month) is apt here. In any prudent household, we would have set aside some of our earnings for rainy days and put some up in savings. Instead, we have depleted our earnings even before the middle of the month and are now relying on others to meet our necessities. This is the implication of Earth Overshoot Day, using our annual allocation of natural resources way before the end of the year.</p><p>Our environmental deficit is growing, and we are seeing the consequences manifested in natural disasters. For example, excessive logging has weakened our forests' ability to prevent soil erosion, leading to landslides and flash floods during heavy rain. To make matters worse, we are even converting forests into agricultural plantations for medium-term gains.</p><p>Given this, it was encouraging to see the recognition of our natural heritage and biodiversity continuing to feature in budget announcements. One is the Ecological Fiscal Transfer (EFT), a mechanism where the federal government transfers money to state governments based on the size of their protected areas. The increase from RM150 million to RM200 million is an essential step that will help states maintain protected areas in the marine and terrestrial landscapes - which are our stock of natural wealth, providing essential ecosystem services and food security to people throughout Malaysia. EFT is a way to protect and nurture our rich heritage and we hope it will reach the level needed for meaningful impact.</p><p>Nurturing our natural resources creates the opportunity for Malaysia to be a regional economic champion. Looking at the current global shift to greener practices, as well as our rich natural advantages, we are well positioned to succeed in the green economy. The budget supports the Green Economy by way of providing RM1 billion in biodiversity sukuk to replant degraded forests. There are also tax exemptions for social enterprises to implement carbon projects in enhancing our forest as a carbon sink towards combating climate change. The allocation of funds towards this initiative is a good move, as it has the potential to effectively accelerate and spur forest restoration efforts. However, some of the reskilling allocations should be channelled to build a workforce that can support our Green Economy transition.</p><p>Additionally, the government's RM11.8 billion support of 33 flood mitigation projects is a proactive step to prevent future disasters. However, to fully address the root causes of the problem, we need to value nature in economic and social terms and prioritise nature based solutions that harness the power of nature to address major societal issues, including climate change. While the RM200 million EFT to nurture natural resources, ensuring our forests to function as they should be may seem like a big amount, it is only 1.69% of the RM11.8 billion allocation to flood mitigation projects. This suggests that giving more weight to protecting our natural resources is more cost-effective compared to mitigating the impact of floods due to our degraded forest.</p><p>While WWF-Malaysia applauds the government's RM563 million slope rehabilitation budget, it is worth noting that part, if not all, of this expenditure, might have been avoided if existing environmental regulations and guidelines had been adhered to. Stricter regulations and proper landuse planning should be adopted to avoid forest conversion and overdevelopment in environmentally sensitive areas.</p><p>The \"no-go\" decision on 9 August to develop a new Tioman airport was a victory for nature, which is an important area for biodiversity. Nevertheless, the recent budget allocated RM47 million to improve passenger facilities at Tioman Airport and extend the existing runway to 1,300 metres. Allocation was also given to an infrastructure project that includes a proposed port at Pulau Carey, known to be the home of the Mah Meri people and has important mangrove habitats. We urge the government to carefully assess all infrastructure development projects, including their carrying capacity, environmental, social, and climate impacts, and to follow proper decision-making procedures when allocating funds.</p><p>As the Prime Minister has said, \"Malaysia is one of the seventeen megadiverse countries in the world, making it a biodiversity superpower.\" As such, Malaysia has the potential to be a regional economic champion by leveraging and enhancing its natural advantages and developing a sustainable economy with our green assets.</p><p>Budget 2024 is a positive step forward, but it is only the beginning. Just like we aim to reduce our fiscal deficit, we urge the government to increase investment in our natural capital to create a more sustainable, prosperous, and equitable Malaysia for all. Let's aim to reverse the alarming trend of Earth Overshoot Day occurring earlier each year in Malaysia.</p><p>*This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

The solar pumps convert sunlight into the electricity needed to move water from a source such as a well.</p><p>MANY FARMERS STILL RELY SOLELY ON RAINFALL</p><p>Among the conditions for receiving a solar pump is having access to a water source.</p><p>Such a pump can easily cost US$2,000, which many cannot afford.</p><p>Mr Jamir is among just a few farmers to receive the solar water pump from the government at a subsidised fee of about US$600.</p><p>But hundreds of other farmers who still rely solely on rainfall are now lacking in food security. They have to divert water from nearby rivers to their farmlands to manually water their crops. There could be devastating consequences if these farmers do not get the help that they need, stressed Mr Jamir.</p><p>\"Initially, people knew that towards the end of January we would start having rain, which has changed,\" he added.</p><p>\"Everything has changed really, now we just started to have some rain and we are not sure until when. So without support like irrigation systems, farmers will abandon everything. People will die of hunger, people will lose income.\"</p><p>With the solar water pump, Mr Jamir hopes to continue farming throughout the year, regardless of the unreliable rainfall.</p><p>Those harvests, he said, mean he can keep putting food on the table and secure an income.

The global economy is in a complex state characterised by uncertainty, making caution our guiding principle. We find ourselves in a landscape where valuations are far from their peak, the global economy remains sluggish, inflationary pressures persist, and the threat of a potential global recession looms large.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, we have anticipated that the Southeast Asia digital economy is well-positioned to excel in the next economic recovery cycle. At the beginning of 2023, we believe the best drivers can still race even in a perfect storm. In this instance, East Ventures continues to race in this storm by steadfastly directing and supporting our portfolio companies, remain investing in good founders, and creating more meaningful impact for the ecosystem. Highly adaptable drivers and teamwork are key.</p><p>To date, East Ventures consistently supports and advises our founders intensively through initiatives and platforms, which also allows them to share and gain insights to help them navigate their businesses in challenging times. Among the 90% of growth-stage startups in our portfolio, 30% are on the path to profitability, 60% are already profitable, and the remaining 10% are still striving to adapt.</p><p>Additionally, East Ventures has gained strong support from our Limited Partners in fundraising, a resounding vote of their confidence in our investment strategy. We successfully sealed three new funds last year.</p><p>In May 2023, we secured US$250 million (RM1.16 billion) through the successful launch of the first and final close of the Growth Plus Fund, which aims to provide our high-potential growth portfolio companies with the resources to scale. Five months later, we identified opportunities in building an investment corridor between the Southeast Asian and Korean venture ecosystem and announced the \u201cEast Ventures South Korea fund in partnership with SV Investment\u201d totaling US$100 million (RM464 million), with the fund expected to have a first close in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>Most recently, we announced our first US$30 million healthcare fund dedicated to driving innovative healthcare solutions in Indonesia. This fund will play a pivotal role in fostering and catalysing healthcare innovation in Indonesia \u2013 proof of our long-term commitment to the healthcare sector.</p><p>[RM1 = US$0.21]</p><p>Collectively totaling US$380 million, these funds underscore our robust commitment to three main areas: diverse sectors, regional collaborations, and forging a productive and healthy Southeast Asia for today, tomorrow, and more generations to come.</p><p>And the racing is yet to stop. As an active player, East Ventures keeps investing in high-quality founders and maintains a prudent approach. In 2023, we sealed 63 deals, welcomed 29 new portfolio companies while disbursing nearly US$80 million to our seed and growth portfolio companies. These strategic investments span various sectors, including e-commerce enablers, biotech, Software as a Service (SaaS), electric vehicles, climate tech, and more.</p><p>Consolidating the digital ecosystem and beyond</p><p>East Ventures continues to strengthen our presence within the digital ecosystem in Indonesia, the Southeast Asian region, and across broader sectors.</p><p>Our commitment to advancing Indonesia's digital competitiveness has been reflected through various initiatives undertaken since our inception. Last year, we launched the East Ventures \u2013 Digital Competitiveness Index 2023, the 4th edition since 2020. This report covers digital competitiveness across 38 provinces and 157 cities/districts in Indonesia, with a median score of 38.5. This marks a notable increase from previous years: 35.2 (2022) and 32.1 (2021). It\u2019s evident that digital adoption has grown more equally across all provinces.</p><p>Additionally, we remain optimistic about the resilience of the Southeast Asian economy. With a combined GDP of US$4 trillion, a population of 650 million, over 70 million small and medium-sized businesses, and a potential for a US$20 billion economic boost, the region presents enticing investment opportunities across countries. For instance, Indonesia and Thailand excel in automotive manufacturing. Their collaboration\u2014Indonesia providing electric batteries and Thailand manufacturing automotive parts can create a unified strategy, drawing significant investments to build a regional electric vehicle ecosystem.</p><p>Realising the importance of an integrated Asean, East Ventures took part in promoting collaboration through the Asean-Business Advisory Council (ASEAN-BAC) 2023, which focuses on driving the region's transformation through innovation and inclusivity across priority programs, such as digital transformation, sustainable development, health resilience, trade and investment facilitation, and food security. We engage proactively in two priority programmes: trade and investment facilitation and sustainable development.</p><p>These programmes are strengthened with legacy projects to ensure their enduring impact in the future. The trade and investment facilitation programmes aim to address the disparity in intra-regional trade by reducing non-tariff barriers, balancing trade with partners, and exploring upgrades to free trade agreements. Therefore, the Asean Business Entity legacy project is formed to strengthen intra-Asean investment by offering advantages dedicated to promoting key reforms in trade and investment within Asean.</p><p>Aligned with our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we participate in the Carbon Centre of Excellence in empowering Asean businesses to navigate carbon markets effectively by facilitating a common framework for the net-zero goal and sharing knowledge on nature-based solutions and carbon trading across markets.</p><p>To achieve this goal, East Ventures accomplished some new and continued initiatives in 2023. We launched the second Sustainability Report, which highlighted our proactive measures toward climate action. Together with Temasek Foundation, we launched the first Climate Impact Innovations Challenge, Indonesia\u2019s largest climate-tech pitching competition. The programme received over 330 applications from Southeast Asia and beyond, and four champion companies were chosen from four unique tracks: renewable energy, food &amp; agriculture, mobility, and ocean.</p><p>We also actively engage in impactful initiatives, by fostering forest conservation and nature tourism in Komodo National Park, such as 5,000 mangrove planting, revitalizing tourist facilities, and Bersih Bersih Bajo \u2013 a beach clean-up initiative in collaboration with Rekosistem, local government, and communities.</p><p>Another fun initiative is the F2DT BAG 22 project, a high-mobile backpack specifically designed to cater to founders who often embark on two-day trips. This project empowers multi-stakeholders: enhancing our internal team\u2019s capabilities, collaborating with local SMEs, and partnering with local communities, to amplify our environmental impact. From 250 F2DT BAG 22 sold, we planted 1,250 mangrove trees at Semarang Mangrove Center, Central Java, Indonesia.</p><p>In November 2023, we contributed to the \u201cTree Planting Joint Movement\u201d (\u201cGerakan Tanam Pohon Bersama\u201d), a collaborative project between the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the President of the Republic of Indonesia. Through this movement, we have donated 200 mahogany trees to help reduce air pollution in Jakarta.</p><p>In the healthcare sector, East Ventures undertook several initiatives, such as launching a white paper, \u201cGenomics: Leapfrogging into the Indonesian healthcare future\u201d, which was a collaboration with the Ministry of Health. This also led to the incubation programme of MoH\u2019s Digital Transformation Office, \u201cHealth Innovation Sprint Accelerator 2023 in collaboration with East Ventures\u201d.</p><p>Additionally, East Ventures continues to support the Biomedical &amp; Genome Science Initiative (BGSi), which first commenced last year. In 2023, we donated reagents and consumables worth US$66,000 for use in sequencing processes in BGSi.</p><p>Cloudy but brighter skies, cautious paths</p><p>The past few years have been rough, like staring into a cloudy sky with no sunshine in sight. However, there are hints that things might clear up soon. The Fed might loosen its grip on interest rates this year, giving the United States\u2019s economy a chance to breathe easier. This, in turn, could be a shot in the arm for the tech industry.</p><p>However, like seasoned racers, our cautious instinct remains acutely aware of the obstacles ahead. Geopolitical tensions spread across certain regions continue to pose significant market volatility. Moreover, with elections in America and Indonesia approaching, the way forward still requires vigilance and unwavering focus.</p><p>As a skilled driver, East Ventures sustains our focus and self-awareness amidst the current situation. Entering 2024 comes with uncertaintiesm however, we see positive signs and are staying aware, closely monitoring, and focused on our objectives regardless of external fluctuations.</p><p>This year, East Ventures is entering its 15th year. We started to build the digital ecosystem in Indonesia in 2009 when no one noticed how low the internet penetration in Indonesia could translate into huge potential. With a massive population of over 270 million and mostly are productive ages, Indonesia\u2019s digital economy has grown fast with mobile phone penetration close to 80% and the country has become an economic driver in Asean and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Our strategy is firm and remains the same: to identify and invest in the best founders and opportunities regardless of good or bad times. Additionally, while we see numerous investment prospects in diverse sectors, encompassing climate (including energy transition and climate-related projects), healthcare, and supply chains, we are constantly making strides through sector-agnostic investments.</p><p>East Ventures has demonstrated consistency and perseverance throughout our journey, through multiple funding cycles and global crises. We constantly remind ourselves to compete with our previous achievements and stay alert for the less obvious opportunities. Our goal is to always be ahead of the wave before it becomes a mega-trend.</p><p>As Indonesia is reaching 80% internet penetration, we are witnessing the end of an era of consumer digital transition and the emergence of a new one: the upcoming demographic dividend bonus. In the next ten years, Indonesia will enter an early demographic dividend era, leading up to the peak of the demographic dividend about 20 years from now. By then, almost 206 million people will be in their productive age, theoretically able to support their dependents. The majority of the workforce in the next 10 to 20 years will be digital natives, led by Generation Z and supported by a mature Millennial generation. A significant portion of the productive population is coming of age. These circumstances present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform Indonesia into a high-income country and catalyse the emergence of new business opportunities.</p><p>Whether the upcoming generation will be able to realize the '2045 Golden Indonesia' vision or become a demographic liability depends on our readiness to prepare and act now.</p><p>Willson Cuaca is the Founding Partner at East Ventures.</p>", "publisher": "Digital News Asia", "instances": ["The trade and investment facilitation programmes aim to address the disparity in intra-regional trade by reducing non-tariff barriers, balancing trade with partners, and exploring upgrades to free trade agreements.

Combined with possible high tides and storm surges, sea levels could rise by 4m to 5m, threatening low-lying Singapore's shorelines.</p><p>The effects of high sea levels at East Coast Park - Singapore's largest park with a span of about 13km - are already being felt. In 2018 and in January this year, swathes of the park were flooded due to rain and high tide. POTENTIAL IMPACT</p><p>The process of reclaiming land from sea \"would certainly lead to the decline of marine species living in the sea and potentially habitats around it\", said Associate Professor Huang Danwei from the National University of Singapore (NUS).</p><p>For example, half of coastal wetlands in China have been lost to land reclamation.</p><p>The deputy head of Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, whose research interests include coral reef ecology and conservation, cautioned that Singapore needs to strike a balance between coastal protection and marine life protection.</p><p>\"Certainly, lives, livelihoods and properties are at stake, but terrestrial and coastal ecosystems that may be affected by the seawater inundation in the next few decades could also be impacted,\" added Assoc Prof Huang.</p><p>\"These should be balanced by the potential impact on sea life directly at the areas of reclamation and also marine ecosystems adjacent to these areas.\"</p><p>Land can be reclaimed by adding material such as rocks, soil, and cement to an area of water. It can also be achieved by draining submerged wetlands or similar biomes.</p><p>Stephen Beng, the chairperson of the Friends of the Marine Park ground-led initiative, concurred that reclamation works on Long Island will \"most definitely\" disrupt ecosystems and lead to a loss of habitat and biodiversity.</p><p>He noted that Singapore lost 60 per cent of its coral reefs, which \"support a greater diversity of life than any place on earth\", over the past few decades due to reclamation and development works.</p><p>A vast majority of these reclamation works have happened along the eastern coast, such as the East Coast Reclamation Scheme that was launched in 1966. It was completed 20 years later with a total of 1,525ha of land reclaimed.</p><p>With the Long Island project slated to be a similarly decades-long one, more sediment and pollutants could end up in the waters. This could smother corals and seagrasses and impact the Southern Islands, which is home to most of Singapore's remaining coral reefs, said Dr Jani Tanzil, facility director of St John's Island National Marine Laboratory.</p><p>Aside from the past loss of coral reefs, she noted that reefs in Singapore already exist \"in marginal conditions where light penetration is limited\".</p><p>\"I'm worried that if the land reclamation works are not managed properly, we may see our reefs having to endure even lower light conditions for decades to come, and further truncation of our reefs to even shallower vertical distribution,\" Dr Jani added.</p><p>NUS biological scientist N Sivasothi also pointed out that the Long Island project will eliminate existing marine habitats, given the plans to create an enclosed waterbody - eventually, a freshwater reservoir - in front of East Coast Park.</p><p>Nevertheless, he said these marine communities are not as mature as those on Chek Jawa Wetlands or Pulau Ubin.</p><p>Mr Beng added: \"We've ... seen that life on our reefs and shores does return when given a chance, though some changes and losses cannot be reversed such as predator-prey relationships, invasive species, resource competition.</p><p>\"Our remaining reefs and living shores could disappear within a generation under the threats of climate change and coastal development.\"</p><p>DESIGN WITH NATURE FIRST IN MIND</p><p>The experts championed the idea of designing structures at Long Island with a nature-first approach, including artificial reef structures that can beef up coastal defence and biodiversity protection.</p><p>Mr Beng further suggested providing sufficient depth for mangroves, slopes of reefs, and allowing the natural accumulation of sediment for sandy beaches and rocky shores.</p><p>Professor Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, also pointed to \"working with nature\" concepts where developments are designed based on natural principles that mimic nature.</p><p>Marine forces - such as waves and tides - should be used to maintain high-quality developments like artificial beaches, lagoons, wetlands and mangroves, rather than being viewed as something to protect against during extreme events, he added.</p><p>\"Coastal environments are transient, continuously reshaped by the natural forces of waves, tides, surges, erosion and deposition. To be sustainable, the Long Island developments must be designed and implemented with a clear understanding and respect for local natural processes,\" Prof Horton noted. Mr Beng cautioned that Singapore must not \"become comfortable with the ability to reclaim and restore\", despite coming far to include conservation considerations in development plans.</p><p>Time must be given between work phases for the environment to recover, and the government must also continuously monitor environmental and social impacts over a wider area, he said.</p><p>This is especially because the Sisters' Islands Marine Park - part of the Southern Islands - will be exposed to much of the risks during reclamation and construction works, and may also face changes in water quality and flow.</p><p>\"Nature is most resilient to disturbances when it's left natural,\" Mr Beng noted.</p><p>\"If climate adaptation and future development come at a greater cost to nature, then that could also mean an unrecoverable expense for all of us.\"</p><p>Whether or not Singapore's environment will benefit from having another island, where flora and fauna can flourish, is up in the air for now.</p><p>Assoc Prof Huang said a comprehensive environmental impact assessment is needed to determine the biodiversity costs.</p><p>He added: \"An artificially created land area with additional coastal space is not the same as natural ecosystems that have been around for thousands of years in terms of biodiversity and their natural functions and services, even if the island might be designed to host biodiversity with an abundance of greening efforts.\" \"URGENT RESPONSIBILITY\" TO ADDRESS SEA LEVEL RISE</p><p>Mr Sivasothi pointed out some key differences in the preparations and design for the Long Island project compared to reclamation works from decades ago.</p><p>For example, there is a desire to integrate relevant terrestrial and marine nature areas with the project. Much more is also known about the restoration ecology of terrestrial and marine environments from both local and global studies, which means Singapore can \"ensure the facilitated establishment of nature areas unlike before\", added Mr Sivasothi.</p><p>He also spoke of being heartened to see during a recent engagement that the push to protect and integrate biodiversity in the Long Island project not only came from members of nature groups, but from many other participants.</p><p>\"The responsibility to address sea level rise is a critical and urgent responsibility of this time,\" Mr Sivasothi pointed out.</p><p>\"An island state like Singapore with high population density and no hinterland is much more vulnerable than most other countries, and global action to address global warming deadlines is always behind schedule. So, it is welcome that we initiate plans to prepare the country.\"</p><p>Prof Horton said that land reclamation can be done safely and with minimal - even positive - impact through appropriate site selection, master planning and support studies.</p><p>\"It is also key to engage with stakeholders to get their views, concerns and expectations.

In an email interview with City &amp; Country, he shares what the company has done and the wins it has achieved as well as its involvement in World Cities Day on Oct 31, a day designated by the United Nations to champion inclusive, resilient and sustainable urban development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00e2  In 2023, Think City has made significant strides in its mission to create liveable and sustainable cities despite the challenges. We\u00e2  ve fostered stronger partnerships and community involvement, utilising a community-first, evidence-based approach to tailor solutions to the unique needs of Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Johor Bahru city dwellers as well as our work to connect small towns and cities in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>The ongoing projects that Think City is involved in include the continuous efforts to revitalise downtown KL using the RM15 million allocated under Budget 2023. It has provided the Creative KL Grants Programme and Creative KL Urban Challenge to support innovative projects and solutions to transform the city into a liveable, sustainable and inclusive hub that celebrates arts and culture in all forms. In addition, it organised Pentas Seni Merdeka and Arts on the Move, featuring arts and culture programmes such as traditional arts performances, art installations and workshops.</p><p>Then there is the Kita-Untuk-Kita (K2K) programme to alleviate poverty and reverse the social, economic and physical deterioration in public housing schemes. The programme covers 10 public housing settlements in KL and Selangor, which have a total of 50,000 residents.</p><p>There is also the Heritage Railway Rejuvenation Programme, which involves a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Transport\u00e2  s Railway Assets Corporation to acknowledge and appreciate the rich railway heritage and promote best practices in placemaking and adaptive reuse of the stations in Kluang, Penang and KL.</p><p>With the RM10 million in funding granted to Think City in 2022, the Northern Region Archaeotourism Network Programme (NRAN) was set up to promote culture-based economies in the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia by connecting small towns and cities to historical and heritage sites in the country that date back 1.83 million years. The programme was given a boost with the Cultural Economy Catalytic Grants Programme (CECG).</p><p>Monetary support</p><p>The recent announcement of Budget 2024 saw Think City receiving an allocation of RM20 million. Hamdan already has plans to put this money to good use.</p><p>\u00e2  With an allocation of RM20 million, Think City will further develop downtown KL as a creative and cultural district, focusing on flagship projects around Masjid Jamek and its surrounding areas. We will deepen our partnerships with the downtown KL community to jointly preserve, innovate and activate the historical city centre,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>\u00e2  Think City, in cooperation with the Penang state government and Aga Khan Trust for Culture, is leading a comprehensive restoration project for Fort Cornwallis, Peninsular Malaysia\u00e2  s largest fort. This initiative is part of the larger North Seafront Improvement Programme and is set to conclude in 2025. Our primary goals are to authentically restore Fort Cornwallis to its historical significance and improve its accessibility and appeal to visitors.\u00e2 </p><p>Hamdan also points to the activities carried out under the Penang Nature-Based Climate Adaptation Programme, which was launched in 2022 by UN-Habitat in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Water, the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, the Penang Island City Council and Think City.</p><p>\u00e2  This programme involves a diversified set of components, addressing both the environmental and social aspects of climate change in Penang\u00e2  s urban areas through nature-based solutions. Think City will focus on inculcating more urban greening measures as well as community-based initiatives in building resilience in anticipation of climate change among public housing and B40 communities, as well as non-governmental organisations through awareness raising and capacity building,\u00e2  he says.</p><p>World Cities Day</p><p>World Cities Day will be celebrated on Oct 31 and Think City will acknowledge it by continuing to bring awareness to its efforts.</p><p>\u00e2  In alignment with this year\u00e2  s theme, \u00e2  Financing a Sustainable Urban Future for All\u00e2  , our unwavering commitment is to foster enhanced participation and continuous engagement with the rakyat,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>\u00e2  This dedication extends to ensuring that the funding mechanisms underpinning our flagship projects and initiatives are not only sustainable but also inclusive and centred around the needs and aspirations of the rakyat. This approach empowers them to instigate impactful change and elevate the overall quality of urban living.</p><p>\u00e2  Elevating our advocacy efforts to promote increased collaboration between the public and private sectors for the financing and management of urban projects and solutions is of paramount importance too. We are intensifying these efforts, particularly within our flagship programmes like the Kuala Lumpur Creative and Cultural District, aiming to foster a holistic, community-driven approach.\u00e2 </p><p>He adds that Think City will continue to forge close collaborations with its stakeholders to achieve a sustainable urban future for all.</p><p>Creating liveable city spaces</p><p>Think City is focused on providing solutions to urban issues that plague cities as urbanisation grows. One of the initiatives is to create sustainable and liveable public housing in the city so as to develop a more vibrant cityscape and sustainable lifestyle for its residents.</p><p>\u00e2  Think City has been involved in a variety of research and interventions over a decade surrounding housing and residential communities in Malaysia, primarily through its extensive research and intervention efforts spanning over a decade. Our involvement in public housing initiatives began in 2016, with a notable project in Program Perumahan Rakyat (PPR) Kota Damansara. In this instance, we took an underutilised space and reimagined it as a communal area, with a primary goal of fostering social cohesion and improving the quality of life for residents,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>\u00e2  The Right to the City (R2C) is an overarching platform that forms the foundation for our efforts in improving public housing, where Think City collaborates with experts and practitioners to develop and implement effective policy recommendations aimed at enhancing public housing and strengthening the resilience of vulnerable communities.</p><p>\u00e2  From the learnings of R2C as well as on-the-ground research and engagements, the K2K initiative was designed and has been particularly instrumental in addressing the challenges faced by public housing communities, focusing on four critical areas \u00e2 \" community empowerment, community co-management, improved income generation and policy reform. It was conceived to help people weather the pandemic storm and has evolved into a more extensive, long-term effort, with support from private and non-profit organisations.\u00e2 </p><p>To further enhance this initiative, certain programmes were launched against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was the \u00e2  K2K INDAH\u00e2  study, which looked at aspects such as childhood nutrition, quality of life and governance in more than 200 households. The \u00e2  K2K Aktif Bersama\u00e2  a health and well-being programme designed to address various needs during the pandemic, including mental health consultations, entrepreneurship support and grant writing workshops. It also fostered community engagement through activities such as walking groups and composting workshops.</p><p>There was also the \u00e2  Bakul K2K\u00e2  pilot programme, which provided access to affordable fresh produce while promoting the R2C programme\u00e2  s principles of inclusivity and equitable access to resources.</p><p>Hamdan points to the equipping and empowering of community leaders to take charge and responsibility in driving change in their communities. To enhance youth engagement, Think City initiated a youth-centric programme led by dedicated coaches, further enhancing community cohesion and promoting healthy and active lifestyles.</p><p>Long-term view</p><p>When Think City was formed, it realised that changing mindsets would take time, and while it has achieved significant milestones, the transformation journey is ongoing. Hamdan explains that as 75% of Malaysians reside in urban environments, the prosperity of the nation will be determined by how cities and towns perform \u00e2  in achieving global socioeconomic competitiveness, resiliency and high quality of life\u00e2 .</p><p>He says Think City is committed to accelerating its efforts in driving urban rejuvenation nationwide to deepen its work in existing networks in the peninsula and to explore opportunities in Borneo alongside efforts to rejuvenate important cultural sites.</p><p>\u00e2  The momentum extends as we broaden our initiatives to rejuvenate essential heritage assets across various cities and towns in Malaysia. This includes revitalising local heritage and cultural offerings, thereby boosting local economies through culture-focused economic development while extending nature-based climate adaptation programmes across other cities in Malaysia, preparing them for future challenges,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>He adds that on the international front, Think City will expand its network and nurture existing partnerships such as with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, UN-Habitat and ICCN (Indonesia Creative Cities Network). It will also continue projects like restoring historical heritage in Hyderabad, India.</p><p>\u00e2  As we forge ahead, we are set on contributing to making cities that are not only sustainable and liveable but also vibrant hubs of cultural and creative expression, resonating with global urban development and sustainable goals,\u00e2  says Hamdan.</p><p>[END]</p>", "publisher": "The Edge Malaysia", "instances": ["Our primary goals are to authentically restore Fort Cornwallis to its historical significance and improve its accessibility and appeal to visitors. \u00e2 Hamdan also points to the activities carried out under the Penang Nature-Based Climate Adaptation Programme, which was launched in 2022 by UN-Habitat in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and Water, the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, the Penang Island City Council and Think City.

Once a haven for backpackers, it is undergoing a dynamic transformation. </p><p>Urban Mechanics director Daniel Lim said the focus is on upgrading buildings and creating a bustling hub for work as the urban regeneration effort is not merely about aesthetics; it is a rethinking of how this space can be utilised. </p><p>\"This hub also capsulises the surrounding area, so it is not about the shophouse per se,\" he said. </p><p>From the architectural transformation of former shop lot houses to the creation of a pocket park - a small indoor green space for public use that promotes inclusivity - the area is becoming a melting pot of generational businesses, new stores and vibrant sub-communities. </p><p>The work hub area is filled with shops that receive grants from Think City, such as Mingle Block, Rumah Gambus and a bookshop owned by Engku Roestam Alias, called Riwayat Bookstore. </p><p>Engku Roestam mentioned that the name \"Riwayat Bookstore\", chosen after closing his first bookstore, \"Kedai Buku Titiwangsa\", is inspired by the diverse stories held within each book. Therefore, the name Riwayat Bookstore resonates well with this concept. </p><p>Operating for more than a year at the present location, Engku Roestam shared his experience managing a bookstore that focuses on selling Malaysian-themed books and his initiatives after receiving the grant from Think City. </p><p>His mission is focused on building communities that revolve around the culture of reading informative books, while utilising grants to organise book events and activities. </p><p>\"We use the grant for new book launching events, book discussions, poetry reading sessions, book festivals and residency, where we host writers to do their work around Riwayat Bookstore, along with conducting writing workshop classes,\" he said. </p><p>Additionally, he remarked on the positive aspects of the construction of HSS Pocket Park, launched on Malaysia Day, Sept 16, 2023, by Ng Tiang Plantation, the building's owner. </p><p>\"It helps with the sales and we feel very grateful because we are surrounded by a good ecosystem of shops around the area such as cafes, foods and the Gambus store, and it is (also) close to the train station,\" he said. </p><p>Engku Roestam also applauded Think City's efforts to revitalise the empty shop lots. </p><p>\"Think City saw that (parts of) KL had become more lifeless. To make the areas relevant again, it has gazetted this location under the KLCCD,\" he said. </p><p>Facade Improvements and Urban Challenges </p><p>Think City acknowledges and tackles urban challenges head-on, addressing issues like damaged sidewalks, potholes and the insufficiency of waste management in the heart of downtown KL. </p><p>There are also discussions about proper pedestrian crossings to enhance accessibility by engaging with the KL City Hall (DBKL). </p><p>The conservation efforts extend to the adaptive re-use of shophouses, drawing inspiration from Penang China House, by making the best of their cultural architecture and maintaining the street vista. </p><p>\"We preserve the street vista of the shophouses, maintaining their original fabric while infusing them with new contents,\" said Lim. </p><p>Besides that, collaborations with Prasarana (M) Bhd are also initiated to transform the user experience of the train transit stations user. </p><p>Hamdan shared the progress along the route towards Masjid Jamek. </p><p>\"There are a lot more new investments such as new coffee outlets, among others, which serve as evidence of how people are eager to see the potential of the area,\" he commented. </p><p>River of Life Tour </p><p>The historic Masjid Jamek Sultan Abdul Samad (MJSAS) stands as a testament to Think City's commitment to preserving cultural heritage. </p><p>Beyond a mere facelift, the organisation is deeply involved in the rejuvenation of the mosque and its surroundings. </p><p>Urban Mechanics associate Rashidah Kamaluddin shared some insights about Think City's joint effort on this historical landmark. </p><p>\"This year, Think City has been invited by Masjid Jamek's management to be a strategic partner,\" she said. </p><p>This strategic partnership has led both parties to create a two-step initiative called the MJSAS Improvement Plan and Masjid Jamek Enclave Action Plan. </p><p>Improving the heritage building, however, comes with comprehensive standard operating procedures (SOPs). </p><p>\"The first step is always to understand the reputation of the building itself, and only then can we know what kind of improvement can be done,\" she said. </p><p>Afterward, it needs to assess the current condition and landscaping of the building, determine locations to place wayfinding signs and emphasise the interpretation of the building. Think City aims to highlight the history, culture, religion and significance of the mosque in the middle of KL. </p><p>The plans include not only architectural assessments but also comprehensive improvement strategies for the entire MJSAS enclave. </p><p>\"This goes beyond the compound of the mosque; we are looking towards the whole area, as well,\" she added. </p><p>The areas within the MJSAS enclave action plan include the surrounding of Jalan Benteng, Jalan Melaka and Jalan Melayu. </p><p>Rashidah said by elevating the light rapid transit (LRT) as an entry point to downtown KL, Think City aims to enhance public transport via collaboration with DBKL. </p><p>Along the River of Life, the pathway connects to the Masjid Jamek Pedestrian Bridge, offering a panoramic view of both the Gombak and Klang Rivers, given its location at the confluence of these two waterways. </p><p>Lim elaborated more on community-building efforts done by Think City, such as Pentas Seni, a monthly cultural event in Dataran Merdeka, which exemplifies Think City's commitment to promoting cultural heritage. </p><p>The initiative also serves as a platform for content creation. </p><p>He said the government has given a mandate to look at the whole area, so Think City is developing the Dataran Merdeka heritage precinct plan which is to look at the connection to Carcosa Seri Negara, Masjid Negara, Muzium Negara, the railway, all the way to KL Sentral. </p><p>\"It is a long corridor, but we are trying to go precinct by precinct to achieve that as well,\" he added. </p><p>As the River of Life pathway unfolds, it connects Masjid Jamek and Pasar Seni, showcasing diverse cultural heritage sites and the ongoing improvement of Central Market. </p><p>Revival of Central Market </p><p>Central Market, now a thriving cultural arts hub, is a testament to Think City's dedication to revitalising public spaces. </p><p>Its restoration efforts extend beyond heritage sites to community spaces like Lorong Bandar 11, which was formerly occupied by homeless people, drug addicts and vandalism activities. </p><p>Collaborative initiatives with community efforts are done to uplift the area and support the homeless population. </p><p>From the Sin Sze Si Ya Temple's facade restoration to the adaptive reuse of Else Hotel as a pop-up exhibition space, Think City showcases the power of integration and adaptation. </p><p>Building a Sustainable Future Think City, in response to climate change, has introduced innovative solutions. </p><p>The Arts on the Move (AoTM) initiative not only connects culture and transit, but also fosters environmental awareness through art installations. </p><p>AoTM is the result of the collaboration with Prasarana and supported by Yayasan Hasanah. </p><p>Its 2023 edition is currently anchored at mass rapid transit (MRT) Pasar Seni, showcasing four art installations named Oculus, Prism, The Forest and Sunnyside Up. </p><p>With each piece of art conveying its messages to be interpreted by MRT commuters, Think City hopes that this effort could encourage more people to walk while enjoying the beauty of the art installations. </p><p>Think City brands and communications executive Nisshanthan Dhanapalan said it has a database called The Atlas of Climate Resilient Tree Species (ACResT), which highlights the importance of resorting to nature-based solutions by planting trees resistant to natural disasters. </p><p>\"We aim for it to be a platform for city councils to use and to plant trees that are heat and flood resistant,\" he said. </p><p>Nisshanthan added that it is working closely with Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat (BPR) communities, adding that its Kita-untuk-Kita (K2K) programme, which is backed by a government fund of RM35 million in 2023, is created to address social equity issues around the area. </p><p>This programme focuses on improving nutrition, increasing job opportunities and enhancing overall community wellbeing, with a particular emphasis on People's Housing Programme (PPR) communities. </p><p>\"Currently, there is a lot of cultural mapping, a lot of work on establishing a baseline before any interventions take place,\" he said. </p><p>The tour ended with a performance by Sean Ghazi, Ida Mariana, and their Retro Glam Malaysian band, Tarakucha!, at MRT Pasar Seni. </p><p>The ensemble wore outfits from Batik Boutique, which is one of Think City's grantees. </p><p>The Batik Boutique showcases Malaysia's cultural fashion, elevating it to new heights while empowering artisans from marginalised communities to produce fair fashion, home goods and accessories made from traditional batik fabric. </p><p>Owner Amy Blair said she wanted to expand batik production while competing with other players in the industry, as some of them sell non-authentic batik by using machines to digitally print the designs on clothing. </p><p>\"We wanted to open our own production house for batik, and this was when Think City came into the picture,\" she said. </p><p>She brought in younger people who studied about batik in universities, who want to keep the culture alive and thriving for the next generations, focusing on employment for the marginalised population living in poverty. </p><p>\"Our project aims to expand our batik production in-house and train at least 10 batik artists,\" she added. </p><p>Blair added that five out of 11 batik artists under its training programme are now working as employees for the boutique, which reflects the potential to create more job opportunities. </p><p>Batik Boutique is also using the grant to host free events to educate the masses about batik by inviting potential corporate clients to participate in batik production workshops. </p><p>As the immersive tour with Think City fully unfolded, it became apparent that the organisation is not merely transforming physical spaces but nurturing a vision for a dynamic and resilient KL. </p><p>It echoed a narrative of transformation, inclusivity and sustainability, serving as an inspiration for cities globally, a blueprint for those seeking to marry the richness of their past with the promise of a resilient and vibrant future.  </p>", "publisher": "The Malaysian Reserve", "instances": ["Its 2023 edition is currently anchored at mass rapid transit (MRT) Pasar Seni, showcasing four art

However, the predominantly outdoor workforce of Singapore could only seek shelter under trees or bear the brunt of the heat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">High temperatures are not unusual in Singapore, with the inter-monsoon months of April and May usually the warmest. But the recent spell of hot weather, coupled with a new report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that global temperatures are likely to surge to record levels in the next five years, have sparked concern.</p><p>The cause of high air temperatures can be attributed to the ongoing El Nino Southern Oscillation event. In the case of 2023, it is the warmer phase of El Nino that could bring about potential heatwaves to Singapore. This, coupled with the relatively drier months outside both monsoon seasons, could have contributed to the past week of warm weather. HEAT AND THE CITY</p><p>Singapore has heated up notably since the mid-1970s when rapid urbanisation took place. According to the Meteorological ServiceSingapore, the island is warming up twice as fast as the rest of the world, at 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade.</p><p>As a city, Singapore faces the twin effects of enhanced global warming and the urban heat island effect.</p><p>In the specific case of Ang Mo Kio last week - where the 37 degrees Celsius temperature matched the 40-year record set in Tengah on Apr 17, 1983 - a factor contributing to the high temperature could be the additional energy released from vehicles and construction, which alters the urban environment by directly increasing the air temperature or indirectly influencing other parameters like surface temperature.</p><p>Where trees are cut and the ground is exposed to solar radiation, the cooling effect provided by Bishan-Ang Mo Kio park would reduce.</p><p>Additionally, more buildings and increased urbanisation efforts such as construction have caused more heat to be generated and retained in the city, ultimately leading to a surface energy imbalance, which means that more heat is stored than what can be dissipated naturally.</p><p>Coupled with slower traffic increasing exhaust heat contributions due to fewer vehicle lanes or makeshift roadside barricades, it was not entirely surprising that the estate experienced the sweltering temperatures.</p><p>As Singapore continues with its urbanisation plans, it is important to note that this can have more of an impact on warming than climate change.</p><p>Projections based off 2015 conditions from a recent local study show that already developed urban areas like Tai Seng would face less of a temperature increase than rapidly urbanising estates like Khatib (almost 0.8 degrees Celsius) or Ang Mo Kio (just below 0.5 degrees Celsius).</p><p>With both current conditions and future projections indicating a rise in temperatures across Singapore, there is no time to waste to implement solutions to mitigate urban heat. WHAT CAN BE DONE?</p><p>At the individual level, while the typical short-term solution is to blast the air-con, the excess heat from vents further contribute to the problem. Instead, consider using fans or having the air-conditioning unit turned on only for short periods of time.</p><p>Additionally, commuters can help to reduce waste heat generated from vehicles by using public transport to get to work. By reducing the number of cars on the road and subsequently easing traffic conditions, there would be less man-made heat.</p><p>For occupants in existing buildings that cannot be changed, exceptions can be made for dress codes to be less formal where possible, as seen from Henry Park Primary School's relaxed uniform guidelines.</p><p>Considering urban planning, green spaces such as forests and parks as well as blue spaces such as lakes and rivers should be preserved, and where possible, increased in size and number.</p><p>Large parks have been proven to bring about cooling effects at a macro level, and tree shading for pedestrians can lower air temperatures at the microscale.</p><p>Results from another study conducted on neighbourhood parks in Singapore reveal that having continuous shading over truncated segments can help ease temperatures.</p><p>Additionally, having extended unshaded pathways adjacent to shaded areas can result in microscale hotspots - suggesting that tree planting and park management decisions should account for foliage overlap to maximise shade provision. Outside of parks, more can be done - on new buildings. This can range from mangrove restoration to implementing green roofs and walls that reduce bare concrete surface exposure to incoming radiation.</p><p>While green roofs and walls cannot be substitutes for actual forest patches, they can help by cooling the building's exterior, which results in less heat conducted to the interior.</p><p>Moreover, these plants utilise heat to transpire, which further lowers the building temperature. Buildings can also be designed to feature a more open concept to maximise air flow while retaining ceiling shade (for example, The Star Vista shopping mall), thereby reducing the need for building-wide air conditioning systems.</p><p>Ultimately, the combination of implementing green infrastructure and nature-based solutions alongside lifestyle adjustments can double up as protection from urban heat island effects and help tackle urban heat island.</p><p>By cutting down less or strategically planting more trees, implementing smart urban design in newer buildings, choosing to take the train or bus instead of personal vehicles, we can make a concerted effect in reducing the amount of heat produced and subsequently stored within the city, thereby leaving us better prepared for potential heatwave events.</p><p>Aikeen Lim is a Postdoctoral candidate at Nanyang Technological University's Asian School of the Environment.

This is what you've been wearing to work since your company changed the office dress code in response to rising temperatures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On your 15-minute walk to the MRT station, the path is fully shaded by sheltered walkways and rain trees. You stop to fill your bottle at one of the many water coolers along the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At your office, the air-conditioning is set at 25 degrees Celsius or above, as required by law. The office building, made of timber, is plugged into the district cooling system.</p><p>Home after work, you check your mobile app for heat guidelines - customised to your age, ethnicity and gender - to find out whether it's fine to exercise outside in the blazing sun.</p><p>At the fitness corner downstairs, a misting system keeps you cool while you work out. Ducking into a neighbourhood cooling centre for a break, it is filled with elderly residents who have come for some air-conditioned comfort.</p><p>Before sleeping, a notification pings with the daily heat advisory, telling you if schools or offices will be open the next day. Another 40 degrees Celsius day is expected, so it is status quo.</p><p>This might sound like a dystopian future, but Singapore is set to experience days with peak temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius as early as 2045, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu told parliament last year.</p><p>Already, the country matched a 40-year temperature record in May when the daily maximum temperature hit 37 degrees Celsius in Ang Mo Kio.</p><p>Elsewhere in the region, heatwaves have killed dozens of people in India, where temperatures soared above 45 degrees Celsius last month. Parts of China, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have also experienced record-breaking temperatures near or past the 40-degree mark this year.</p><p>Warming in Singapore is driven by climate change globally and by the local urban heat island effect - when natural land cover is replaced by urban surfaces that absorb and store heat. Professor Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), expects the 37-degree ceiling to be broken in 2024, with El Nino conditions projected to develop later this year.</p><p>\"Sometimes we dismiss a tenth of a degree because we're used to the changes between night-time and day, where it can shift by 10 degrees Celsius,\" he said.</p><p>But each increase by a tenth of a degree actually represents an \"incredible\" rise in temperature.</p><p>It is a myth that residents of equatorial Singapore are physiologically acclimatised to warming weather, experts told CNA.</p><p>\"That is very untrue because the data is showing most Singaporeans spend their time indoors,\" said Associate Professor Jason Lee, director of the Heat Resilience and Performance Centre at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS).</p><p>\"So physiologically we are not, but behaviourally we are very acclimatised,\" he said. \"Behaviourally we are very good at escaping from the heat.\"</p><p>As the planet warms, escaping from the heat may not be sustainable. Instead, the way ahead will involve learning to live with the heat - from embracing nature-based solutions to adjusting the way people live, work and play in Singapore. WORKING AND STUDYING IN A WARM WORLD</p><p>Forty degrees Celsius is not just a psychological threshold, but also approaches a physiological one.</p><p>A wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius is commonly thought of as the limit for human safety. A more recent study found that 31 degrees Celsius is the upper limit of heat stress for healthy young men and women - this corresponds to an air temperature of 38 degrees Celsius at 60 per cent humidity.</p><p>Singapore's mean annual relative humidity is about 84 per cent. The body's main mechanism for losing heat is through evaporation of sweat, which becomes harder when relative humidity is higher.</p><p>Heat stress occurs when the body is unable to dissipate excess heat. Without appropriate medical attention, this can progress to heat stroke, and may lead to multiple organ failure and death.</p><p>But before that point, heat stress can affect one's ability to make decisions in the workplace and lead to more workplace accidents, Assoc Prof Lee said.</p><p>A 2017 study by researchers at Michigan State University and the University of South Florida found that exposure to heat resulted in workers perceiving the same activities as less risky, and increased their risk-taking behaviour.</p><p>\"If the machine requires 10 steps and you are a very experienced worker, when you are very uncomfortable - in this case very hot - there is a tendency to say, let me get out of here as soon as possible. And therefore I might skip steps, and therefore accidents might happen,\" said Assoc Prof Lee.</p><p>A hot environment can also affect one's mood and compromise decision-making. The epidemiological data on this is very clear, he added.</p><p>\"When it's hot, people are moody, get more depressed, get angry. (In an) extreme case - suicide. So mental health is also indirectly affected due to the weather.\"</p><p>Infants, the elderly and people with disabilities are more vulnerable to the heat. But heat stress can also arise when healthy adults exert themselves at work.</p><p>When it is hot, most people will decide to slow down and not work themselves too hard, said Assoc Prof Lee. But the risk calculation differs with socio-economic circumstances.</p><p>For example, said the associate professor, a delivery rider may think: \"You're telling me that I may die of heat injury - that's a 'may'. But I know if I don't deliver 10 parcels a day, it will compromise my bread and butter. I've got kids at home, (I) will take the risk.\"</p><p>This can lead people to work through thermal discomfort, making \"over-motivation\" and peer pressure significant risk factors for heat stroke. The psychological impact of heat is also felt in schools, where concentration levels in the classroom will likely dip with uncomfortably high temperatures.</p><p>There is a very strong correlation between thermal comfort and student performance, said Professor Wong Nyuk Hien of the College of Design and Engineering, NUS.</p><p>In a 2022 study published in HSSE Online, a journal by the National Institute of Education, secondary school students were observed becoming more fidgety and talkative when the weather was warmer. They would zone out, rest their heads on the table and get frustrated, especially in the afternoon.</p><p>Teachers who participated in the study tried to vary the pace and style of teaching to keep students engaged. Some encouraged movement in the classroom or introduced short breaks between and during lessons, while others preferred that students stay in their seats to avoid generating more body heat.</p><p>The teachers also suggested that \"dress-down\" days - when students are allowed to wear physical education shirts with the usual uniform bottoms - should be allowed more frequently, and that more water coolers should be installed closer to the classrooms. PUBLIC COOLING SHELTERS</p><p>Given the consequences of heat stress, does that simply mean more air-conditioning is needed?</p><p>About 80 per cent of households in Singapore own air-conditioners, according to the Department of Statistics. For many, it is their first option for respite on a hot day.</p><p>But conventional air-conditioners dump heat outside, causing outdoor temperatures to rise. This in turn encourages higher usage of air-conditioning and it creates a vicious cycle, said NUS' Prof Wong.</p><p>About 60 per cent of the energy used to support a building goes towards cooling it, he added. This is not sustainable, the experts pointed out.</p><p>Air-conditioning should be \"the last option\" for cooling, and only for those who need it, said NUS' Assoc Prof Lee.</p><p>\"Those people who really need air-con don't have air-con or don't use air-con,\" he said, pointing to manual labourers and the elderly who cannot afford it. In contrast, \"people who don't really need air-con are abusing\" it.</p><p>To address this, Singapore could create public cooling shelters for vulnerable individuals, he said. Such shelters have been set up in Hanoi and around the US during heatwaves. The concept resembles that of a public bomb shelter. When the temperature hits a threshold, cooling shelters can be set up at Housing Board blocks and facilities like community centres. Other cooling methods can also be considered, such as giving out ice slurries.</p><p>This might mean the use of air-conditioning elsewhere can be restricted. Experts who spoke to CNA said there should be a mandatory temperature cap for air conditioners, suggesting 22 or 25 degrees Celsius as the floor below which temperatures are not allowed to go.</p><p>\"Rather than guidelines, make it legal. Put it in the justice system. You are not allowed unless you've got a medical exemption,\" said NTU's Prof Horton.</p><p>To encourage behavioural changes, there could be stronger policy measures penalising organisations that do not adapt to increased heat exposure, said the Singapore Management University's (SMU) Associate Professor Winston Chow, a principal investigator of the Cooling Singapore research project.</p><p>Ensuring that safety and health regulations protect workers from heat exposure will also become even more important. For outdoor workers, these may be policies looking at their right to water and shade, as well as the option to cease work if it is too hot, he added.</p><p>Heat guidelines will need to incorporate data from more diverse groups of people so they can be more personalised, said NUS' Assoc Prof Lee.</p><p>For office and uniformed workers, moving away from long-sleeved shirts, long trousers and covered shoes is also an obvious change as the world warms. This involves a shift in perspective on \"looking smart\", said Assoc Prof Lee.</p><p>\"The uniform must be functional first, then the smartness,\" he said, pointing to the Bermuda shorts and polo shirts worn by some police officers as a positive example. THE FUTURE OF COOLING</p><p>The sight of rows of air-conditioning condenser units blowing hot air back into streets could disappear in the future, if district cooling expands from Marina Bay and Tengah to become the default across the island.</p><p>District cooling uses cold water chilled in a centralised plant to cool buildings through a network of pipes. This is meant to improve energy efficiency through economies of scale and reduce carbon emissions from refrigerants.</p><p>As outdoor temperatures rise, should open-air spaces like hawker centres become enclosed, so that air-conditioning can be installed? Prof Wong doesn't think that is necessary.</p><p>Hawker centres are more like a \"transitional space\" than a place where people dwell and focus on work, he said.</p><p>Corridors and atriums of buildings fall into the same category. A warmer Singapore could actually see less air-conditioning if it is removed from such transitional spaces. A hybrid ventilation system combining fans and air-conditioning - at a higher temperature of about 27 degrees Celsius - could also become the norm. Such a system is already in use in NUS' Net-Zero Energy Building @ SDE.</p><p>Buildings could become cooler if construction moves away from using concrete, which stores heat well and emits significant volumes of greenhouse gases during production.</p><p>As an alternative, Prof Wong pointed to the use of timber - such as in a newly opened six-storey, zero-energy development in NTU, touted as the largest wooden building in Asia.</p><p>Compared to concrete, timber has low thermal mass, meaning that its ability to absorb and store heat is low. This is preferred in hot and humid climates. In contrast, high thermal mass materials like concrete, if left unshaded, may absorb solar energy throughout the day and release it into the building at night.</p><p>In addition to using timber, NTU's building - called Gaia - uses sun shades on its facade and open areas, terraces and air wells to increase ventilation.</p><p>To make buildings more comfortable in the heat, designers and developers should go back to traditional design features like orientation relative to the sun, shade and natural ventilation, while relying less on glazed windows, said Prof Wong.</p><p>Innovations like \"cool paint\", a type of paint containing additives that reflect heat from the sun, could also make a difference. A cool paint pilot with Housing Board flats in Tampines aims to reduce ambient temperature by 2 degrees Celsius. SHOULD WORK START LATER IN THE DAY?</p><p>With all the effort and energy needed to keep cool in the daytime, would Singapore reach the point of scheduling work and other essential activities to start later in the day and end well after dark?</p><p>That's not desirable as working overnight has its own drawbacks, according to NUS' Assoc Prof Lee. The night shift interrupts circadian rhythms and social lives, and workers may start work without being well rested, putting their safety at risk. The need for lighting will also put extra pressure on the power grid.</p><p>But even if normal work hours are maintained, leisure patterns, including recreational sports, are likely to change. There is a tendency during warm weather for people to stay indoors as much as possible, only venturing outside in the evening.</p><p>This is reinforced by official guidelines. For instance, the Ministry of Education encourages schools to minimise outdoor physical activities between 10.30am and 3.30pm on warmer days.</p><p>As temperatures rise, this blackout period could lengthen. But trying to avoid being outside on hot days can lead to a decrease in outdoor physical activity and in turn, affect mental health, Assoc Prof Lee pointed out.</p><p>Instead of hardening the boundaries around the hours that people should not exercise outdoors, another approach would be to embrace the heat and manage it.</p><p>\"We feel heat as a distress. Heat is actually a stressor ... All stressors, if you know how to use (them) creatively, can be eustress\", or a beneficial form of stress, said Assoc Prof Lee.</p><p>Exercise could be planned for the hottest times of the day in order to put extra strain on the body and maximise training outcomes, said Assoc Prof Lee. To compensate, the workout could be less intense or shorter.</p><p>\"Training is all about creating strain so that your body can respond ... Now with heat, in 30 minutes you get your heart rate to the same level as compared to your old condition (where) you had to do it in 45 minutes,\" he said.</p><p>\"You want to do 45 minutes at 8am, or 30 minutes at 12 noon? You can actually save your time by reaching the same endpoint faster. That, to me, is training efficiency.\"</p><p>In hot yoga, practitioners intentionally use heat to intensify physical activity. Instead of practising in artificially heated rooms, for instance, such classes can be held outdoors in unshaded areas when the sun is high on a 40-degree day.</p><p>To manage the heat risk, public misting systems that spray ultrafine water droplets onto people can be set up at more parks, exercise corners and even playgrounds, said Prof Wong.</p><p>At the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, when heat and humidity soared during Japan's summer, the Games organisers and national teams used misting fans to cool athletes and even horses. A heat advisory system will be important to prime people for hotter weather, and also to make sure that healthcare and emergency services are prepared for more heat injuries, added SMU's Assoc Prof Chow.</p><p>Then there are the unavoidable outdoor activities, like the last mile walk from public transport nodes to one's destination.</p><p>In a warmer Singapore, Walk2Ride - the Land Transport Authority's programme to build covered walkways for residents within 400m of all MRT and LRT stations and bus interchanges - could be expanded to more locations.</p><p>Nature-based solutions, in the form of trees with broad canopies, could also become more widely used for shade, said Assoc Prof Chow.</p><p>DIFFICULT TRADE-OFFS</p><p>Adapting to warmer temperatures will necessitate changes to Singapore's physical environment, but ultimately also to the day-to-day decisions.</p><p>This means not taking the climate for granted and acknowledging the role of the environment when making choices, said Assoc Prof Chow.</p><p>\"If you're making a decision to buy a new home, if you're making a decision to buy a new car, or to go on a holiday - previously you would take the carbon emissions that you use in travel for granted because it's not priced into your decision-making as an individual.</p><p>\"I think we're coming to the age where these sorts of trade-offs, which we took for granted with the environment, are becoming very apparent, are becoming very stark,\" he said.</p><p>\"These environmental trade-offs are going to be uncomfortable for a lot of people, myself included.

Oil majors turn to nature to help plug revenue gap", "published": "2020-12-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">LONDON: Oil companies such as BP and Shell are nurturing nature as a future revenue stream, betting on an expected rise in carbon credit prices as their fossil fuel profits ebb. BP last year put US$5 million into Finite Carbon, a company that connects forestry owners with companies seeking to offset their climate-warming emissions via-tree planting. The Californian firm expects to generate US$1 billion for landowners over the next 10 years, after a 20 per cent to 40 per cent cut of the proceeds, its chief executive Sean Carney said. And as companies and countries have rushed over the last year to pledge new net-zero global warming pledges, that forecast may be too conservative, Carney said. </p><p>\"When you put it next to all the announcements and all the talk, it's a really small number. We might be thinking too low here given the commitments,\" he told Reuters. Climate change goals, agreed in Paris in 2016, have fuelled a growing, but still immature, market for carbon offsets as companies and countries seek to fall in line. European oil majors say investing in projects to create more credits is simply good business, offering new revenue streams at a time when oil prices have collapsed and appetite for new exploration evaporates. \"Investing in carbon sequestration, at a time when the world is increasingly carbon constrained, over time will prove to make good commercial, business sense,\" Duncan van Bergen, Shell's head of Nature Based Solutions, told Reuters. Big oil's involvement has split environmentalists. Sarah Leugers at the non-profit Gold Standard Registry welcomed interest from large emitters in nature conservation, but added: \"I do worry that they're initiating projects in a market that they can profit from that's attempting to solve a problem that they've largely created,\" Leugers said. Others note the cash is going toward projects of universal benefit. \"Why would it be OK to make money with digging out fossil fuels, but not with saving the planet?\" said Renat Heuberger, CEO of the leading climate project developer South Pole, which typically takes a 10 per cent cut from credits it develops and sells. CARBON KLONDIKE Although some industries are covered by carbon-trading schemes enshrined in law, such as in the European Union, California and Australia, most of the world has no such government-backed markets. That leaves most emitters with only a handful of small, voluntary carbon offset markets launched over the last 15 years. And as more seek credits, the price is expected to rise. Shell's budgets, for example, are based on a carbon price of US$85, or around (EURO)70, a tonne by 2050 which is more than twice the current price of just under (EURO)30 on the EU carbon-trading scheme. While each \"registry\", or voluntary market, has its own rules for entry, they generally work by certifying credits for carbon-reducing projects which preserve forests or wetlands or help swap out wood or coal burning stoves with ones using cleaner fuels. The entire voluntary carbon offset market last year was worth around US$300 million, trading offsets for around 104 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), according to Ecosystem Marketplace, the main aggregator of these data. However, that compares with the 33 billion tonnes of CO2e emitted by the energy sector alone in 2019, of which 2.1 billion tonnes came from products made by European energy majors, International Energy Agency and Reuters calculations show. A November report by a taskforce of investors and emitters led by former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the voluntary market would have to grow 15-fold to meet the goal of avoiding catastrophic climate change. Oil majors are playing a growing role in this as they seek to establish themselves in the new carbon neutral world order, with France's Total earmarking US$100 million a year for nature-based solutions, including an unspecified amount toward creating credits. Shell plans to spend US$100 million on average over the next year or two on nature-based carbon offsets and van Bergen expects emissions cuts from nature-based solutions or carbon sinks will be \"material\" by 2030 or 2035. In August it bought Select Carbon which helps farmers in Australia modify their land use and certifies credits for use in a government-managed scheme or sold on the secondary market. BP's investment in Finite Carbon went toward software that allows landowners to monetise the planting of new trees or preservation of existing woodlands. Using machine learning, remote sensing and digital payments, the software is aimed at landowners with parcels as small as 40 acres, too small to take part in many carbon markets. For BP's head of ventures Nacho Gimenez, the Finite Carbon investment fits with a responsibility to rein in emissions. \"As long as someone is investing in something positive, that's the baseline,\" Gimenez told Reuters. Such nature-based offsets could remove up to 12 billion tonnes of emissions a year on the back of US$120 billion to US$360 billion spending by emitters, British bank Barclays estimates. But with no global standard for evaluating the carbon impact of a project or for pricing credits, a credit from the same project can fetch a higher price in one sale than in another. - Reuters/kv</p>", "publisher": "Channel NewsAsia", "instances": ["1 billion tonnes came from products made by European energy majors, International Energy Agency and Reuters calculations show.
