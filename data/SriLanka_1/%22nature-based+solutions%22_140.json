Last summer in the US, when older people fell down on tar during heat waves, they had to be treated first for burns. Scientists believe that July 2023 was the hottest month on record. Last year, we read of multiple disasters worldwide: extreme heat waves in the USA, various parts of Europe and Asia; over 4,000 wildfires which raged in Canada, as well as a devastating one in Hawaii; and severe monsoons which caused extreme floods in many parts of Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of the above are attributed to global warming and climate change. Our actions that emit greenhouse gases have increased the Earth's temperature faster since 1970, than any other period in the last 2000 years. This global warming has wrought havoc on the Earth's climate - such as warming oceans and resulting cascading impacts such as melting icebergs, sea level rise, coastal flooding, and saltwater going up rivers, all of which disrupt livelihoods, food and water security.</p><p>The most challenging impact of global warming has been long-term shifts in the Earth's weather patterns. There are more intense and frequent extreme weather events - such as storms, cyclones, floods and droughts, often leading to erosion and landslides. Erratic (out-of-season) rainfall, failure of monsoons and seasonal shifts have serious effects on agriculture, causing crop failure and therefore, affecting food security.</p><p>These effects of climate change are bad enough, but they are exacerbated by other human activities - namely, habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation, pollution, and introduction/spread of invasive alien species. For example, deforestation of catchment forests upstream results in erosion, and sometimes, slope instability, which, in turn, leads to landslides and downstream floods. There was a recent news item from the National Building Research Organisation that because of deforestation coupled with heavy rains, 1/5th of Sri Lanka is landslide-prone. Poor agriculture practices that leave soil exposed to heat when there is a drought, worsen its impacts. Relying on monocultures of crops when there are seasonal shifts (delayed monsoons, for example) can increase food insecurity.</p><p>Any process that emits CO2 is called a carbon source, and green plants that absorb carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis, are known as carbon sinks.</p><p>There are two ways of dealing with climate change. Human action/s to reduce emissions or to reduce carbon sources/enhance carbon sinks is called climate change mitigation. These actions include switching to clean energy, reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing energy efficiency. However, even if, today, everyone, everywhere stopped all emissions of greenhouse gases, the temperature of the surface of the Earth would not cool for thousands of years to levels before the Industrial Revolution. Therefore, adjusting to observed or predicted climate change also becomes necessary. This is known as climate change adaptation. Adaptation could be as simple as growing drought-tolerant crops in the dry zone.</p><p>In December 2023, leaders of governments of the world met at the 28th Conference of Parties (COP). After contentious debates, negotiations and compromise, they agreed to 'transition away from fossil fuels'. Some hailed this outcome as 'the beginning of the end of fossil fuels', others were deeply disappointed with the wording and that the proposed transition was not given a time frame.</p><p>Without waiting to see what will happen about shifting from fossil fuels at the global scale, what can we, the public, do?</p><p>Look to nature for solutions</p><p>Look, for example, at trees. Their leaves and canopies slow the rate of rainfall falling to the forest floor. Leaf litter functions like a gigantic sponge soaking the water up and slowing its release into the soil. This is a natural method of regulating floods and recharging groundwater. The roots of trees hold soils together. Without leaf litter and roots, rain falling on bare soil flows fast over the surface, resulting in erosion. Heavy rain falling on large areas of bare soil on slopes could cause landslides. Catchment forests reduce the risk of floods by increasing the amount of rainfall soaked into the soil, reducing and delaying the highest flows of floodwaters.</p><p>Meanwhile, green plants serve as nature's carbon sinks by removing carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis. During this process, they also replenish the oxygen that we breathe.</p><p>Nature has provided us with a ready-made solution for climate change adaptation. Why then, are we not looking to nature and using these solutions?</p><p>Nature-based Solutions (NbS) involve working with nature to address challenges of communities and societies, to provide benefits for both human well-being and biodiversity. This approach aims for a win-win both for us humans, as well as for biodiversity.</p><p>Compared to hard engineering solutions, NbS provide additional benefits called co-benefits as shown in the diagram above.</p><p>In contrast, the construction of a gabion retaining wall in a river or canal - for the prevention of erosion - may also provide clearer water but no other benefits.</p><p>The other difference is that NbS are cost-effective. In the mid-hills of Nepal, erosion and resultant landslides were common along many rural roadsides built without any safeguards to control erosion. A native plant - broom grass (Thysanolaena nees) - is a hardy perennial, with a network of roots that holds the soil together. When villagers planted broom grass along roadsides, this simple action significantly reduced erosion and landslides. An important co-benefit was that once this grass grew to about two metres, it could be cut and sold - as fodder for livestock, fuel and for brooms - which increased the household income of villagers. A standard cost-benefit analysis showed that over time, NbS were less expensive than hard engineering because there is far less maintenance necessary. But when the co-benefit of the income that communities earned was included, NbS were shown to be much cheaper than hard engineering solutions.</p><p>In the high Andes Mountains of Peru, livestock are grazed in high-elevation, wet, montane grasslands. There now are recurring droughts. With community participation, a pasture and water management plan was developed to ensure better management of water and establish a rotational grazing pattern (to avoid overgrazing). The ecosystem service of provision of year-round water was restored. Better management increased milk yield, fetching more income. The improved growth of grasses has also contributed to the conservation of threatened species - such as the vulnerable Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) and the Per\u00favian guemal (Hippocamelus antisensis) - another win-win for people and biodiversity.</p><p>Urban areas are most at risk from heat waves. They act as heat islands - trapping the sun's heat in concrete in buildings and the surfaces of roads. Green infrastructure (such as corridors of vegetation), green spaces (parks, grasslands and urban wooded areas), green walls and green roofs are extremely effective in reducing ambient heat. Increasing blue infrastructure (such as natural or artificial ponds and lakes) has the same effect. Barcelona, in Spain, increased tree coverage from 5% to 30% and reduced temperatures so much, that the city saved 10 million USD in annual bills for air conditioning.</p><p>Most cities have impermeable systems - such as tar, concrete, stone, brick, and roofing - that prevent water from filtering through the ground. The sponge city concept uses blue infrastructure to absorb rainwater, which is then naturally filtered by the soil to reach aquifers. Sponge cities are connected by open green spaces and waterways, which naturally retain and filter water. They also have green roofs that can retain and filter rainwater before releasing it into the ground. Also important in sponge cities are permeable roads and pavements, bio-swales (landscaped areas that collect stormwater runoff, filtering out pollution and letting the water soak into the ground) and bio-retention systems (depressed, landscaped areas for the discharge of stormwater). In a sponge city, in addition to providing natural flood control, co-benefits such as cooling, enhancing urban biodiversity and increasing recreation are also achieved.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, I think that we have long since forgotten to look to nature for solutions, in our unending quest for development, although traditionally, NbS were successfully implemented, using observation and common sense.</p><p>Colombo has the distinction of becoming the world's first Ramsar Wetland City. It is in the floodplain of the left bank catchment of the Kelani Ganga and historically, was built on, around and interwoven with wetlands. However, now only about 2,000 ha of these wetlands - natural, giant sponges - remain. Some wetland parks, set up for the conservation of these critical soakage areas for the capital, are now being pruned and tamed as venues for wedding photographs. Sri Lanka had a ready-made sponge city......... but we have reclaimed it, dredged it, filled it and built infrastructure and roads, so that, often, with monsoonal rains, Colombo floods.</p><p>A recent article in the Sunday Times stated that 214 trees posing danger to people have been removed by the Colombo Municipal Council. Assuming that these are all old trees (about 30 years old), with trunks at least metre in a diameter, and that all plant species absorb an equal amount of carbon, these trees that were cut, stored about 4,639 tons of carbon. We should have maintained and looked after those magnificent trees so that they did not pose a threat to people. Instead, these natural carbon sinks were grossly neglected, and we must now forgo the immense benefits they provide us.</p><p>We Sri Lankans must do better. Perhaps we must see green plants as tiny carbon-guzzling, oxygen-generating machines, just as we know that vehicles are petrol-consuming carbon-dioxide-releasing machines. What if each of us pledges to plant and look after a native herbaceous plant, a shrub or a tree, and tend it? Those who own estates or large gardens can plant trees, others with small gardens can plant shrubs, while those who live in apartments can grow plants in pots. Even if 1% of our population fulfils this pledge and plants trees and tends them, then we will have 221,810 more carbon sinks, absorbing an estimated 4,807,835 tons of carbon in their lifetime, absorbing the emissions for a year from one million cars.</p><p>As Jane Goodall says 'What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM0701202400113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B24-F241-F00C-61W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 7, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

These challenges are distinct but also deeply interconnected in complex and multidirectional ways. They have in common that they threaten to overwhelm coping capacities and seriously impact human economies and societies, turning them from challenges into crises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This multitude of global crises, which includes the climate crisis, the biodiversity crisis, and the pollution crisis, can be described as a polycrisis that affects multiple systems at the same time and in ways that influence and exacerbate each other. A polycrisis does not have a single cause and, therefore, no singular solution. However, the interconnected nature of its constituent crises means that actions taken in one sphere-for example, climate action or environmental conservation-have the potential to produce powerful synergies and co-benefits. In other words, while there is feedback between the crises, there is also the potential for feedback between solutions.</p><p>Global processes to address global challenges</p><p>Countries such as Sri Lanka can greatly benefit from integrating their strategies and plans and harnessing synergies between development, climate action, biodiversity conservation, pollution reduction, and key sectoral interventions. However, uniting these different processes-each with their own institutional setups, policy frameworks, finance streams, evidence bases, and actors-is not an easy task.</p><p>Toward the end of 2022, the need to address the polycrisis in a holistic fashion is becoming increasingly obvious, with multiple important summits happening in close succession. In November 2022, the 198 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) met in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, with a total of 45,000 people attending the two-week conference (UNFCCC COP27). Only a week later, the first session of a new Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution took place in Punta del Este, Uruguay, with more than 2,500 delegates from 147 countries (INC-1). Finally, representatives of 188 governments gathered in December in Montreal for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15), which concluded with the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).</p><p>Climate change is explicitly mentioned in the GBF, with three targets directly referring to climate change and the need to optimise 'co-benefits and synergies of finance targeting the biodiversity and climate crises.' Similarly, the COP27 cover decision (the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan) addresses biodiversity and ecosystem conservation in multiple places and contains dedicated sections on forests and oceans, as well as an acknowledgement of the urgent need to harness synergies for addressing the 'interlinked global crises of climate change and biodiversity loss in the broader context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.'</p><p>Synergetic solutions for complex challenges</p><p>The above-mentioned conferences are not the only important events of the year-for example, COP15 of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the third 'Rio Convention,' took place in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in May-, and a multitude of other planning and implementation processes took place on the regional, national, and local level. However, many of these processes aim to address the same underlying causes in similar timeframes (with target years 2030 and/or 2050) in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals and the need for economic growth and recovery after COVID-19 and global supply chain disruptions.</p><p>For example, there are clear parallels between the global frameworks for climate action and biodiversity conservation. Both the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) have similar governing bodies (their respective Conferences of the Parties) and mechanisms for communicating national commitments (Nationally Determined Contributions and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans), as well as overlapping funding mechanisms (Green Climate Fund and Global Environmental Facility) and related science-policy bodies (IPCC and IPBES).</p><p>Nature-based solutions and planetary health</p><p>The GBF aims to protect 30% of the planet and 30% of degraded ecosystems by 2030, reduce the extinction of threatened species, and focus on the sustainable use and management of biodiversity and natural resources. The UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also adapting to the unavoidable effects of climate change to protect people, livelihoods, and ecosystems. In addition, there is an urgent need to manage waste and plastic pollution, stop desertification, and prevent soil degradation.</p><p>To do this, it is possible to identify and utilise synergies between national commitments under different global frameworks. Actions on climate change and biodiversity can complement each other, address common causes and impacts, and target co-benefits through multidisciplinary cooperation.</p><p>The advantages of coordinated and synergetic actions are multifold. If a polycrisis is addressed through holistic interventions, it can help to use resources more efficiently, avoid redundancies and duplication of efforts, enhance knowledge-sharing, and improve access to different funding sources, technology transfer, and other means of support. Policy coherence is an important element that guides implementation, and reporting on progress can be done more comprehensively and efficiently.</p><p>Nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based adaptation can help to bridge the gap between these different targets and address multiple crises simultaneously. For example, this could be in the form of green infrastructure or ecosystem services, but also revolving around investment in a blue economy or green finance, including tools and instruments such as ecosystem discounts, green or blue bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, or carbon credits.</p><p>Whether it is on the local, national, regional, or global level, there is a significant potential to identify synergies and try to design actions around them that can support economic growth and recovery, contribute to the conservation of nature, strengthen human and planetary health, mitigate climate change, and build the long-term resilience of all systems.</p><p>(The writer works as Director - Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

On the other hand, Sri Lanka can benefit from a just transition towards a more climate-friendly, resilient, and sustainable economy that considers projected climatic changes as well as national goals towards emission reduction, adaptation, and energy and food security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this context, a 'just transition' refers to the process of shifting to low-carbon, environmentally sustainable economic models and business practices in a fair and inclusive manner that protects workers and provides opportunities for communities which may be adversely affected by this transformation.</p><p>Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) plays a vital role in preparing Sri Lanka's workforce for such a transition and providing a pool of skilled human resources for the transformation of key sectors.</p><p>Skills, competencies, and TVET in Sri Lanka</p><p>Technical and vocational education in Sri Lanka commenced with the establishment of the Government Technical College in 1893 in Maradana and is today governed and implemented by a multitude of agencies from both the public and private sector. The National Vocational Qualifications Framework (NVQF) established in 2005 provides a general structure for TVET in the country and comprises seven levels of instruction in three categories of professions at certificate, diploma, and degree levels.</p><p>In addition to technical skills relevant to different industries and processes, TVET should also include cognitive and attitudinal competency areas such as systems thinking and critical thinking or the ability to learn, collaborate, and reflect. Based on this framework, it is possible to develop standards, curriculums, training plans, requirements, and learning outcomes as well as systems for quality assurance and monitoring and evaluation.</p><p>Priority sectors for a just transition</p><p>Sri Lanka's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement identify six priority sectors for climate change mitigation (electricity, transportation, industry, waste management, forestry, agriculture) and nine sectors for adaptation (agriculture, fisheries, livestock, water, biodiversity, coastal and marine, health, urban planning and human settlements, tourism and recreation), plus one additional cross-cutting sector focused on preventing and addressing climate-induced loss and damage. These sectors are directly impacted by climate change and/or potential key contributors to climate action and a just transition.</p><p>To achieve the intended contributions and commitments across the different sectors, a skilled workforce is required at every level, including a large number of technicians and technical assistants, electricians, project officers, experts in sustainable architecture and services, civil engineers and construction site supervisors, energy auditors, surveyors and survey field assistants, laboratory technicians and assistants, resource assessors, and many other types of qualified personnel. Enhancing current TVET programs with relevant qualifications and mainstreaming climate change into TVET is crucial to fulfilling these requirements and create a workforce that not only has specialised technical skills but also an interdisciplinary understanding of how climate change affects their sector, the ability to collaborate across disciplines, and the capacity to innovate and adapt to a rapidly changing context.</p><p>For example, the energy sector is critical for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as for providing energy security and a low-cost, sustainable, and resilient supply of clean electricity. A recent research study estimates that to implement Sri Lanka's national plans and commitments for the future development of the renewable energy sector, an overall number of approximately 1,650 technicians and 1,100 technical assistants could be needed in the short term, and a cumulative number of 5,300 technicians and 2,900 technical assistants in the medium term.</p><p>Competencies needed for these technicians and technical assistants include an understanding of renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, grid management, and energy storage, but also problem-solving, planning, learning, teamwork, and integrated systems management.</p><p>Currently, there are only a few dedicated training programs, modules, and certificate courses for renewable energy, the majority of which are focused on solar PV systems (ground, floating, and/or rooftop) and located in Colombo district. This highlights the need to build on the existing training opportunities, programs, and courses by incorporating climate-relevant elements; develop specialised degrees and certificates to cater to the growing labour market demand; and ensure that women, youth, and those from rural areas and vulnerable communities have equitable and supported access to TVET.</p><p>Other sectors and industries are faced with similar challenges. For example, TVET for construction and infrastructure needs to incorporate competencies and skills related to sustainable building materials, energy efficiency, resilient construction techniques, and nature-based solutions; food systems need a workforce that understands climate-smart farming practices, efficient water and land management, integrated pest management, and new and emerging technologies. Electric vehicles, alternative fuels, recycling technologies, circular economy, carbon counting, and risk awareness are other examples of areas where TVET can play a crucial role for economic transition.</p><p>Enhancing TVET to facilitate a just transition</p><p>In addition to the considerations outlined above, TVET can also benefit from strong linkages between training providers and the labour market, for example, through employment sector councils and multi-stakeholder expert committees. Furthermore, demand-driven curriculums, hands-on training, workplace exposure through exchange visits, peer-to-peer learning, mentoring, backstopping, job fairs, entrepreneurship development, and other initiatives can strengthen partnerships between TVET institutions and job providers.</p><p>TVET has an important role to play for facilitating Sri Lanka's transition towards a more climate-smart, resilient, and sustainable economy. By building specific competencies across key sectors such as energy, construction, food systems, or transportation, TVET can enable the country's workforce to achieve national goals and commitments for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development. In addition, cross-cutting competencies that integrate environmental and social understanding with technical proficiency is key.</p><p>A holistic TVET approach that mainstreams climate change and provides context-specific programs and qualifications tailored to industry needs and future opportunities can help to ensure that Sri Lanka's workforce is equipped to innovate and adapt to a rapidly evolving climate landscape.</p><p>(The writer works as Director: Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

The Meeriyabadda and Aranayaka landslides bear testimony to this statement. However, with thundershower warnings issued on a number of districts in the country, it is important to revisit landslide mitigation strategies, particularly in hilly areas. In some cases, latest technology has been used for water retention and increase soil strength. But engineering experts are now looking at possibilities of nature-based solutions to mitigate landslides. Speaking at the Moratuwa University's Inaugural Lecture Series, Prof. Udeni Nawagamuwa of the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Moratuwa shed light on 'Nature-based Landslide Mitigation' with a few case studies done in several parts of the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How landslides occur</p><p>\"A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris or earth down a slope,\" he explained in his opening remarks.\"Landslides are a type of 'mass wasting' which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. As people move into new areas of hilly or mountainous terrain, it is important to understand the nature of their potential exposure to landslide hazards, and how cities, towns, and counties can plan for land use, engineering of new construction and infrastructure which will reduce the costs of living with landslides.\"</p><p>Human activities could be a contributing factor in causing landslides. \"However, many landslides caused by human activities could be avoided or mitigated. These could be a result of building roads and structures without adequate grading of slopes, poorly planned alteration of drainage patterns and disturbances caused to old landslides.\"</p><p>Identifying warning signs</p><p>In most instances people are unaware of an impending landslide. But warning signs could be observed. Some of these include:</p><p>Mitigation measures</p><p>Prof. Nawagamuwa then shed light on the latest Landslide Hazard Zonation Mapping Project (LHMP) implemented by the National Building Research Organisation. \"Hazard zonation mapping is based on an extensive field study and evaluation of six causative factor attributes such as geology, slope, soil overburden, hydrology, landform and land use patterns in the area. While maps are available in 1:50,000 scale and 1:10,000 scale, 1:50,000 scale maps are available for Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Kandy, Matale, Kalutara, Galle, Matara and Moneragala districts. These maps display the distribution of the severity of landslide hazard potential in a given area.\"</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>\"Landslide mitigation measures also include nature-based solutions which are interventions that make use of natural processes and ecosystem services to address hazards such as floods, erosion and landslides. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) is one of the effective and sustainable techniques to reduce risk of disasters,\" he added.</p><p>\"The role of plants in improving slope stability and minimising soil erosion can be divided into two categories; hydrological and mechanical mechanisms. However, both these mechanisms have positives and negatives. For example in the hydrological mechanism, foliage intercepts rainfall, causing adsorptive and evaporative losses that infiltrate precipitation to infiltrate. However, the depletion of soil moisture by root adsorption may encourage the soil to crack, thus increasing infiltration capacity. On the other hand, roots reinforce soil, increasing soil shear strength in the mechanical mechanism. But plants exposed to the wind could transmit dynamic forces to the hill.\"</p><p>Prof. Nawagamuwa further said that some of the benefits of nature-based solutions in stabilising slopes include the greater ability to catch rainfall when there's a high density of the canopy and leaf area. \"This interception reduces and delays rainfall to the soil surface. A tree's roots will increase soil shear strength via the tensile strength of its own roots and provide slope-shearing resistance during or after heavy rainfall on shallow landslides.\"</p><p>Site-specific landslide risk assessment</p><p>\"When choosing a site, all elements at risk including houses, buildings, infrastructure facilities, lifelines, topography, hydrology and ecological features, soil formations and socio-economic data related to populations likely to be exposed are being considered,\" he explained.</p><p>But when selecting plants several aspects need to be looked into. \"Architectural features and structure of plant root systems play a significant role in shallow slope stabilisation and erosion control. Ecological significant and compatibility with surrounding environment also needs to be considered. Native plant species are preferred because they tend to tolerate drought and need little irrigation, fertilisers, pest and disease control and demand less trimming. Prof. also emphasised on aboveground plant structure and belowground root system which stabilise slopes by intercepting and absorbing water, retaining soil, retarding run-off velocity, increasing surface roughness, rainwater interception and evapotranspiration.\"</p><p>Speaking about natural vegetation types, he said that the dominant vegetation in the wet zone is tropical evergreen forests with tall trees, broad foliage and a dense undergrowth of vines and creepers. On the other hand, subtropical evergreen forests resembling those of temperate climates flourish in higher altitudes. Montane vegetation at highest altitudes tends to be stunted and windswept.</p><p>Recommended plant species</p><p>Grasses - Cymbopogon citrates- suitable for tropics and is known to be a good soil conditioner in worn out land. The plants quickly produce a bulk of organic material attracting worms and other beneficial creatures, quickly enriching the soil. The grass is useful for soil improvement and erosion control.</p><p>Small tree (Shrub) - Coffee arabica-suitable for tropics and subtropics. The plant firmly holds onto soil and is a wind barrier. Erosion control can be achieved by cultivating coffee with low spacing.</p><p>Medium size tree - Tremaorientalis- the plant can be found in secondary forests in the wet and intermediate zones. The tree has an extensive root system that enables to hold soil together and is categorised as a tree with high anchoring root index.</p><p>Large tree - Micheliachampaca- it is found in tropical and subtropical, moist broadleaf eco-regions. These are elevations of 200-1600 metres. These plants are known to hold soil tightly while acting as a wind barrier. The presence of roots increases the effective cohesion of soil, resulting in the increase of shear strength.</p><p>While drawing examples from a few case studies done in Sri Lanka Prof. Nawagamuwa said that certain challenges exist in applying nature-based solutions for landslide risk management in Sri Lanka. \"Designers lack confidence in the use of vegetation for slope stabilisation, there's a lack of knowledge about soil bioengineering and landscaping measures to stabilise unstable slopes and there's limited interest in allocating resources for associated research, capacity building and knowledge enhancement of</p><p>landslide professionals.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

On May 22, the United Nations marks the International Day for Biological Diversity with the theme being building a shared future for all life. In a statement the UN says As the global community is called to re-examine our relationship to the natural world, one thing is certain; despite all our technological advances we are completely dependent on healthy and vibrant ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter and energy, just to name a few.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the UN fitting within the context of the ongoing United Nations Decade on Restoration, which highlights that biodiversity is the answer to several sustainable development challenges, the slogan conveys the message that biodiversity is the foundation upon which we can build back better.</p><p>From ecosystem-based approaches to climate and/or nature-based solutions to climate, health issues, food and water security and sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity is the foundation upon which we can build back better. That is the main message from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), key international instrument for sustainable development. Stressing that when biodiversity has problem, humanity has a problem the UN says biological diversity is often understood in terms of the wide variety of plants, animals and microorganisms, but it also includes genetic differences within each species - for example, between varieties of crops and breeds of livestock - and the variety of ecosystems -- lakes, forest, deserts, agricultural landscapes that host multiple kind of interactions among their members -- humans, plants and animals.</p><p>Biological diversity resources are the pillars upon which we build civilizations. Fish provide 20 per cent of animal protein to about three billion people. More than 80% of the human diet is provided by plants. As many as 80% of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-based medicines for basic healthcare.</p><p>But loss of biodiversity threatens all, including our health. It has been proven that biodiversity loss could expand zoonoses - diseases transmitted from animals to humans- while, on the other hand, if we keep biodiversity intact, it offers excellent tools to fight against pandemics like those caused by coronaviruses.</p><p>While there is a growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to future generations, the number of species is being significantly reduced by certain human activities. Given the importance of public education and awareness about this issue, the UN decided to celebrate the International Day for Biological Diversity annually.</p><p>Current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems will undermine progress towards 80% of the assessed targets of eight Sustainable Development Goals. Three-quarters of the land-based environment and about 66% of the marine environment have been significantly altered by human actions.One million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction.</p><p>Meanwhile the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has given a beginner's guide to ecosystem restoration. It's a phrase that's been on the lips of scientists, officials and environmental activists a lot in the last few months: ecosystem restoration. This year, June 5, World Environment Day, marks the official launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, a 10-year push to halt and reverse the decline of the natural world.</p><p>What exactly is an ecosystem and how do you restore one? To answer the first question an ecosystem is a place where plants, animals and other organisms, in conjunction with the landscape around them, come together to form the web of life. Ecosystems can be large, like a forest, or small, like a pond. Many are crucial to human societies, providing people with water, food, building materials and a host of other essentials. They also provide planet-wide benefits like climate protection and biodiversity conservation. But in recent decades, humanity's hunger for resources has pushed many ecosystems to the breaking point.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, most political leaders and top business tycoons know little and care less about biodiversity. We hope they would educate and enlighten themselves to give more attention to this. The people also need to play a part. If we just act as residents of this country, we will focus mostly on what benefits us and our families. Instead of just being residents, we need to be citizens who act effectively for the common good and play a bigger role in vital issues such as preserving biodiversity.</p><p>English broadcaster, biologist, natural historian and author David Attenborough says, it is that range of biodiversity that we must care for - the whole thing - rather than just one or two stars.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Tropical countries such as Sri Lanka are therefore at heightened risk</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">from rising global temperatures, with urban populations-for instance in Colombo-among the most vulnerable and exposed. However, there is a range of possible actions and interventions to mitigate increasing temperature, counteract the urban heat island effect, and cool down cities to protect humans, animals, and the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban heat in the context of climate change</p><p>Average temperatures are rising around the globe, and every new decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the previous one. As reported by the State of the Global Climate 2021 published by the World Meteorological Organization in May, 'the most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, were the seven warmest years on record,' and global mean temperatures in 2021 were '1.11 \u00b1 0.13 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 average.'</p><p>The report further states that 'the acute impacts of weather and climate are most often felt during extreme meteorological events such as [...] heatwaves,' and that heatwaves and extreme heat had devastating effects and caused deaths across different world regions, which in many cases would have been 'virtually impossible without climate change.'</p><p>Global warming leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves as well as extended periods of high temperatures, which can harm human health, wellbeing, and livelihoods. In particular, already vulnerable or weakened groups, such as the elderly, children, or the economically disadvantaged, are at risk of severe impacts that can worsen chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions and even lead to death. Furthermore, natural ecosystems, biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and many other aspects of human society and economy can be adversely affected by heatwaves and heat stress.</p><p>Due to the 'urban heat island effect,' cities and urban agglomerations are hit especially hard by these rising temperatures. They become hotter than rural areas because of their population density, the higher concentration of 'sealed' surfaces that absorb and retain heat, and other factors such as air pollution. For Colombo, it has been estimated that average temperatures may have already risen by 1.6 degrees Celsius due to the heat island effect, which would be significantly higher than the global average. For Sri Lanka as a humid tropical country, this poses the danger of lethal 'wet bulb' temperatures, which are caused by a combination of high temperature and humidity and prevent the human body from cooling itself by evaporating sweat.</p><p>The 11th World Urban Forum (WUF11), which just took place in Katowice, Poland, also highlighted the importance of recognising and addressing climate change in urban planning. Building resilience for sustainable urban futures, transforming cities through innovative solutions, and enhancing climate adaptation and nature-based solutions were among the key dialogue topics of the five-day global conference, which is convened every two years by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat).</p><p>Adapting to urban heat and building resilience</p><p>The urban heat island effect in the context of rising global temperatures poses a serious threat that needs to be addressed by incorporating heat stress management into policies and action plans and address impacts to health and productivity through social protection schemes and infrastructure development. Weather forecasting, early action, and monitoring can also play a big part in enhancing heat wave response, especially if they are combined with awareness creation and education on potential risk factors, symptoms, responses, and treatment options. Other collective resilience-building measures can include heat hotlines, community check-ups, or community cooling centres.</p><p>In addition to this, heat adaptation encompasses a range of nature-based interventions and actions. For one, making cities greener tends to make them cooler as well, as plants provide shade as well as cooling through evapotranspiration. This can include urban forestry-planting more trees and generally increasing the vegetation cover-as well as the development of green corridors, parks, and rooftop gardens. Such green infrastructure also offers a range of co-benefits beyond lowering temperatures for cities, including erosion control, emission reduction, and improvement of air quality.</p><p>Heat-resilient cities can be green, blue, or blue-green. Urban wetlands are powerful nature-based solutions for managing heat stress as well as water quality and protecting against flooding and stormwater runoff. Revitalising urban streams, watercourses, or lakes can also pay off in many ways, including by providing cooling and other ecosystem services. Other possible actions include cool roofs and pavements-using materials that reflect more solar energy and enhance water evaporation-or infrastructure planning that takes into account 'natural' wind and urban ventilation corridors.</p><p>What many of these solutions have in common is that they view the urban environment as an ecosystem that consists of more than just streets and buildings, and which is deeply interconnected with natural and social systems. They aim at creating greater awareness and enhance adaptive capacities while also conserving natural ecosystems, which can serve as a low-cost way to protect the natural environment as well as human communities from heat stress and heat-related impacts. With holistic and integrated planning, cities like Colombo can reduce days of extreme heat and avert heat-related deaths as well as other serious impacts to labourers, families, the urban poor, and vulnerable groups.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT01072022000514</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65V1-4JD1-JCH9-G063-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 1, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYFW</classCode><className>HEAT STRESS DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp;

Climate finance, sustainable finance, and green finance have great potential to scale up investment and harness synergies to not only survive climate change but turn it into an opportunity for transformative growth and prosperity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following will wrap up and connect three guest columns on climate finance and resilience published over the last weeks, which have focused on the foundations of a sustainable financial system as well as access to funding in the context of ecosystems, nature-based solutions, and a just transition. Bringing these elements together can help individuals, companies, and governments to develop plans and policies that maximise investment flows and lead to optimal socio-economic outcomes.</p><p>Mainstreaming adaptation and risk finance</p><p>Science has made it clear that vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka can no longer achieve optimal socio-economic outcomes and sustainable development without investing in climate resilience and risk management. The Sixth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year states that 'overall adverse economic impacts attributable to climate change, including slow-onset and extreme weather events, have been increasingly identified,' and that 'global aggregate net economic damages generally increase non-linearly with global warming levels.' Rising temperatures and progressive climate change impacts will severely affect economies around the world, particularly those that are already vulnerable and have limited financial resources available.</p><p>To avoid and adapt to this, systems transitions are needed for energy generation, infrastructure, land use, industry, society, and key economic sectors such as food systems, export products, trade, tourism, or the garment and textile industry. These sectors are vulnerable to climate change, but they can also offer solutions and serve as levers of change. By building on existing natural resources and human capacities-including ecosystem services, green infrastructure, and local and traditional knowledge-as well as investing in innovation and transformative adaptation, vulnerable sectors can turn from liabilities into engines of growth.</p><p>However, a large-scale transition requires significant resources, including in the form of finance, technology, and technical expertise. Domestic public funds are unlikely to be sufficient for this, especially as they are already strained due to the increasing intensity and interconnected nature of climate risks and economic impacts. The IPCC report highlights this as well, stating that 'adverse climate impacts can reduce the availability of financial resources by incurring losses and damages and through impeding national economic growth.' To close the looming finance and protection gaps, it is therefore vital to secure and scale up bilateral, multilateral, and private sector funding from a range of sources.</p><p>Foresight and planning for long-term resilience</p><p>There are multiple avenues of financing that can be explored in the context of climate change adaptation, resilience-building, and economic recovery. As outlined in the three previous columns, natural ecosystems and biodiversity can be harnessed to attract funding, while the framework of a just transition can serve to accelerate economic transformation and stimulate growth. However, policy coherence and early, anticipatory action that pre-empts or prevents shocks are equally important factors to survive in a changing climate.</p><p>Currently, countries across the world are mostly reacting and responding to climate shocks and other unexpected events on an ad-hoc basis without pre-arranged resources. Anticipatory and risk-informed investment for resilient economic growth can minimise these shocks and greatly enhance the ability of key stakeholders to deal with them. Through investment in a climate-smart and resilient economy as well as the use of diverse financial instruments, including insurance and insurance-linked instruments, early action finance, or national contingency funds, countries can save money, protect lives and assets, and adapt in proactive ways to seize emerging opportunities.</p><p>For example, countries can use different kinds of bonds-such as sustainability bonds, climate bonds, green bonds, resilience bonds, or the new category of blue bonds-to raise funds for starting or scaling up projects that commit to climate-smart, sustainable, green, and/or resilient outcomes. These debt instruments are usually asset-backed or ringfenced to ensure that funds will go towards their intended purpose, and they present a powerful opportunity to invest in projects that offer a return of investment beyond merely repaying the loan with interest. Financial market instruments like these bonds can help actors to fulfil their social and environmental responsibilities, enhance the economy by harnessing domestic renewable energy resources and nature-based solutions, and prevent vast losses and damages.</p><p>Pathways to prosperity</p><p>In the context of today's world and pathways into the future-such as the climate change scenarios projected by the IPCC-, it is critical to look ahead. Societies and economies need to develop long-term plans on how they can become climate-resilient, adapt to and benefit from the anticipated changes, absorb shocks, and access the finance necessary to transition. These plans should be integrated with a holistic and flexible policy framework that removes investment barriers, precision-channels resources to where they are needed, and encourages sustainable, climate-friendly, and resilient entrepreneurship across key sectors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT04062022000543</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65M7-73F1-F00C-6473-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 4, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Especially for coastal and island countries such as Sri Lanka, ocean health is closely linked to the wellbeing and prosperity of human communities, and harnessing ocean power presents a significant opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, to benefit from ocean resources holistically and in the long-term, these resources need to be managed in sustainable, nature-positive, climate-friendly, and inclusive ways. It is therefore important to understanding existing and upcoming governance and policy frameworks on the national, regional, and global level that can facilitate such approaches and protect both the environment and human communities.</p><p>The central role of oceans</p><p>From a climate change mitigation lens, oceans are indispensable, as they absorb almost a quarter of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions and 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming. They stabilise the Earth's climatic systems and produce approximately half of the Earth's oxygen. Furthermore, oceans support climate change adaptation by providing livelihoods, transport, a potential source of renewable energy (in the form of wave energy, ocean thermal, or offshore wind), and a host of ecosystem services. The world's seas are also habitats to a wealth of biodiversity and host an incredible variety of species of marine animals, plants, and microorganisms.</p><p>On the flipside, oceans are facing climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and other threats. Ocean acidification, ocean warming, species extinction, overfishing, plastic pollution, waste dumping, oil spills, shipping accidents, and various human activities all present serious challenges to marine and coastal ecosystems that need to be addressed through concrete plans and actions.</p><p>Within a country's territorial sea (extending 12 nautical miles from the coast) and exclusive economic zone (extending 200 nautical miles), such actions mainly fall under national jurisdictions and can be guided by domestic frameworks. In many cases, these national frameworks also connect to regional processes, such as regional fisheries management organisations or the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), of which Sri Lanka is a part. Globally, the importance of oceans has also been highlighted in climate change negotiations-as just one example, the cover decision of the recent Conference of Parties (COP27) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) contains a sub-section focused on oceans-or in the discussions around a global treaty on plastic pollution, which explicitly includes 'plastic pollution [...] in the marine environment.'</p><p>The high seas treaty</p><p>However, these frameworks only address certain aspects of ocean governance, and countries' jurisdictions do not extend to the high seas, which form the majority part of the world's oceans. Accordingly, a new treaty is needed to protect 'biodiversity in oceans beyond national jurisdiction,' (BBNJ) which refers to living marine resources found in the high seas and on the seabed. The high seas contain a significant part of overall marine biodiversity, including many unique and/or vulnerable species that are already threatened by overfishing, pollution, and the impacts of climate change.</p><p>An International Seabed Authority was established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1994, but there has not been any governing body or international legally binding instrument to safeguard biodiversity in the open ocean so far. However, after long and strenuous negotiations in New York earlier this month, a landmark agreement was reached on a new 'high seas treaty' to govern BBNJ. Countries will need to formally adopt the proposed treaty at a resumed session, this presents an important milestone and step forward in an area that needed urgent attention.</p><p>The preamble which is expected to be part of the new treaty highlights 'the need to address, in a coherent and cooperative manner, biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems of the oceans, due to, in particular, climate change impacts [...], ocean acidification, pollution [...], and unsustainable use.' Key thematic areas covered by the treaty include marine protected areas, sharing of marine genetic resources, and requirements for environmental impact assessments for deep-sea activities.</p><p>Opportunities for action</p><p>There are several possible ways in which national actions can link to these global frameworks and enhance action on all levels. Bringing together different stakeholders-such as those working on coastal conservation, fisheries, marine ecosystems, shipping, renewable energy, tourism, coastal development, and trade-can also help to strengthen policy coherence and create greater awareness of the interlinkages between climate action, environmental protection, waste management, and economic growth.</p><p>By actively engaging in the UNFCCC process as well as the development of the high seas treaty and the global plastic treaty, countries such as Sri Lanka can highlight national-level work, identify gaps, exchange technical expertise, and gain access to support, funding, and technology transfer. As just one example, nature-based solutions can bridge climate action and biodiversity conservation and create significant benefits in terms of mitigation ('blue carbon') as well as livelihoods, environmental services, and disaster risk reduction for coastal communities. Similarly, financial instruments such as blue bonds or debt-for-nature swaps can help to access funding for a blue economy while risk transfer mechanisms can contribute to the resilience and sustainability of interventions. Other potential avenues of action include blue entrepreneurship, youth engagement on oceans and climate action, and public-private partnerships, which can connect the national to the global level and offer many co-benefits for climate action, economic empowerment, and overall prosperity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2503202300030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67VN-PRB1-JCH9-G4YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 25, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Business &amp;

Such solutions include policies and national strategies but also mobilisation of the private sector, the harnessing of market forces, and public-private partnerships. Particularly in developing and emerging economies, young entrepreneurs can play a critical role in working towards this goal and contributing to adaptive, inclusive, and sustainable solutions.</p><p>Entrepreneurs are key for a dynamic and growing economy. They bring new goods, services, or technologies to the market and can act as catalysts for transformative change. Entrepreneurship is focused on building a business from concept to market maturity and beyond, but it does not necessarily contribute to climate action, environmental conservation, or social justice. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between different kinds of enterprises and their role in the context of overarching global, national, and local challenges.</p><p>The concept of climate entrepreneurship</p><p>Start-ups and innovative businesses are engines of economic growth and can create income, employment opportunities, products, and many other tangible benefits for their communities and countries. Building on this, sustainable and climate-friendly enterprises focus not only on economic but also on environmental and social aspects, such as reducing their resource footprint or engaging in fair trade, localised supply chains, and energy efficiency.</p><p>Climate entrepreneurship goes one step further and puts climate action at the heart of the business case. From this perspective, revenue and clean, green, and responsible business practices are not opposed, but rather complementary to each other. Climate entrepreneurship is about strategic alignment of business goals with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Sustainable Development Goals. It is about looking ahead and planning for a changing climate, for less reliable weather patterns, extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related risks. In addition, climate entrepreneurship also aims to identify opportunities and re-imagine problems, as well as to understand the skills, services, and products that are needed to drive climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>In the age of climate change, there will be growing demand for energy, particularly clean and renewable energy; for sustainable and regenerative food systems; and for resilient, mobile, and digitalised financial services and systems. Climate entrepreneurship capitalises on foresight and anticipation, it envisions the challenges of tomorrow and finds solutions for them today. This could be in the energy sector, where there will be a clear momentum to shift towards clean and renewable energy sources; but it could also be about alternative value chains; innovative agricultural practices and alternate protein production; risk-informed planning and infrastructure development; digital solutions and frontier technologies; health and sanitation sector actions in the face of heat waves and shifting disease vectors; nature-based solutions and green infrastructure; or circular economy and waste management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT12082022000538</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664X-JWJ1-JCH9-G0CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 12, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Storms also caused significant economic damage, especially in India (USD 4.4 billion), China (USD 3.0 billion), and Japan (USD 2 billion),\" the WMO said in a report titled the State of the Climate in Asia 2021.</p><p>The report highlighted how climate change impacts are wreaking an ever-increasing human, financial and environmental toll, worsening food insecurity and poverty and holding back sustainable development.</p><p>The report also painted a worrying scenario for future water stress. High Mountain Asia, including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, contains the largest volume of ice outside of the polar region, with approximately an area of 100,000 km2 of glacier coverage.</p><p>According to the report, the rate of glacier retreat is accelerating and many glaciers suffered from intense mass losses as the result of exceptionally warm and dry conditions in 2021. These so-called water towers of the world are vital for freshwater supplies for the most densely populated part of the planet and so glacier retreat has major implications for future generations.</p><p>Water-related extremes are the most important hazard in Asia, according to WMO.</p><p>\"The climate indicators and extreme events shown this report and expected increase in precipitation over much of Asia in the future shows just how vital it is to strengthen early warning systems,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. \"The UN Early Warnings for All programme will help protect people from more frequent and intense extreme weather - and there are major gaps to be filled in Asia.\"</p><p>The report, which was produced jointly with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was presented during the UN climate change negotiations, COP27, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.</p><p>It shows how, compared to the average in the past 20 years, economic losses are on the rise for most types of disasters. Economic damage from drought has increased by 63 percent from flood has increased by 23 percent, and from landslides has increased by 147 percent compared to the 2001-2020 average.</p><p>In 2021, there were a total of more than 100 natural hazard events in Asia, of which 80 percent were flood and storm events. These resulted in almost 4,000 fatalities, about 80 percent caused by flooding. Overall, 48.3 million people were directly affected by these hazards, causing total economic damage of USD 35.6 billion.</p><p>While floods caused the highest fatalities and economic damage, drought in the region affected the highest number of people, according to the report. Sand and dust storms were also a major problem.</p><p>\"Given that floods and tropical cyclones in the region account for the highest economic losses, investment in adaptation must be directed towards prioritizing anticipatory action and preparedness,\" said Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP.</p><p>\"Notwithstanding the progress in establishing early warning systems, further strengthening is needed as climate change intensifies. Similarly, new infrastructure needs to be made more resilient, alongside improvements in water resources management and dryland agricultural crop production, while nature-based solutions bring durable and wide-ranging benefits.\"</p><p>The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Asia-Pacific Disaster Reports 2021 and 2022 estimate that in Asia, the annual investment in adaptation would need to be highest for China, at USD 188.8 billion, followed by India at USD 46.3 billion, and Japan at USD 26.5 billion.</p><p>As a percentage of the country's GDP, the highest cost is estimated for Nepal, at 1.9per cent, followed by Cambodia at 1.8per cent, and India at 1.7per cent.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Only 11 percent or US $ 14 billion annually is contributed by the private sector. The investment is significantly small, even though they contributed 60 percent of the total national GDP in most G20 countries.</p><p>The G20 investments represented 92 percent of all global NbS investments in 2020.</p><p>The report findings stressed the urgency to increase net-zero and nature-positive investments to close these finance gaps and increase NbS investments by at least US $ 165 billion per year, especially in ODA and private sector spending.</p><p>At global level, future investments in nature must rise fourfold by 2050, equalling an annual investment of over US $ 536 billion.</p><p>As G20 countries carry out most of the global economic and financial activity with fiscal leeway, the nations have the capacity to meet that target, the report said.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The Daily FT caught up with her before her departure to get a quick recap from her on the tenure in Sri Lanka which was momentous with several key developments in terms of bilateral cooperation between the UK and Sri Lanka and UK's support to Sri Lanka. Incidentally, after assuming duties in August 2019 Hulton's first print interview was also with the Daily FT in October same year (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.lk/Opinion-and-Issues/On-a-quest-to-take-UK-SL-ties-from-good-to-great/14-688682\">https://www.ft.lk/Opinion-and-Issues/On-a-quest-to-take-UK-SL-ties-from-good-to-great/14-688682</url>). Here are excerpts from the interview with Hulton days prior to her departure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: You've been in Sri Lanka through extraordinary times. What are your reflections?</p><p>Sri Lanka has gone through some challenging times in the last few years. I know the effects of the economic crisis are still being widely felt and I am glad that we have been able to support Sri Lanka in a range of ways. This has included providing \u00a3 3 million humanitarian assistance through cash transfers to support the most vulnerable communities. I have been able to visit some of these groups and hear how the funds have helped their food security and medical needs.</p><p>We are also providing economic support for Sri Lanka through multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and United Nations. We have welcomed the Government of Sri Lanka's commitment to implementing the economic reform program supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility and encourage Sri Lanka to continue engaging with the IMF and EFF program to build investor confidence, drive growth and bolster Sri Lanka's development.</p><p>Q: Can you highlight some of the other key areas of UK-SL cooperation?</p><p>UK Sri Lankan cooperation continues to grow and there have been some recent developments in the area of business and trade. The UK is Sri Lanka's second largest export market. In 2022, the total trade in goods and services between UK-Sri Lanka was \u00a3 1.3 billion - an increase of 11.6% from the previous year. The UK's new trading preferences scheme is now in force - and there are significant benefits for Sri Lanka.</p><p>The Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) allows Sri Lanka to trade with the UK tariff-free on 92% of goods, increasing the competitiveness of Sri Lankan products in the UK market. As the demand for sustainable, fair-trade, and healthier products continues to grow in the UK, Sri Lankan business is well placed to develop in this market.</p><p>Environmental cooperation has also been a strong pillar of our partnership. The UK was proud to host the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) on Climate Change solutions in Glasgow in 2021. Sri Lanka has made some strong commitments which we want to support through a range of collaborative environmental projects which underpin the goals of the Glasgow Climate Pact. These projects have included work to protect biodiversity, implement nature based solutions, support climate adaptation and resilience efforts and protect wildlife in Sri Lanka. We will continue this work through the UK's Climate Action for a Resilient Asia Program which will include funding projects that mobilise climate finance, strengthen water security, conserve ecosystems and biodiversity, and help vulnerable communities lead local adaptation efforts.</p><p>The Blue Planet Fund reinforces the UK's global leadership on marine issues, including the call to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030 and existing commitments to tackle plastic pollution. The UK Ocean Country Partnership Program for Sri Lanka under the Blue Planet Fund, will deliver marine science technical assistance across the three core themes of marine pollution, biodiversity loss and supporting sustainable seafood.</p><p>We also partnered with UNICEF to provide lifesaving medical equipment for high-risk pregnant mothers and infants during the pandemic. And scientists from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Oxford University collaborated together on a UK-funded project, to support vital immunology research. The UK is also known for our role at the UN Human Rights Council. We want to support Sri Lanka in addressing the issues raised in the current resolution. We are doing this by working with civil society and grassroots organisations through a number of projects, such as landmine clearance, sustainable resettlement of internally displaced people, including livelihoods support, with a particular focus on women headed households.</p><p>We have also worked with local partners to support effective responses to online gendered hate speech and cyber-sexual gender-based violence in Sri Lanka. We hope that Sri Lanka will address the legacy of the war and work towards building a fully inclusive society where people from all backgrounds can thrive.</p><p>Education remains one of our strongest connections. The UK is recognised across the world for its high-quality education. Four out of the world's top ten universities are in the UK, and there are more than 45 UK higher education institutions and professional bodies represented in Sri Lanka. These offer a variety of courses in partnership with over 50 local institutes and I've loved having the opportunity to hear about their work whilst I've been here. Students have a wide range of choices to study either in the UK or in Sri Lanka to obtain a world class qualification.</p><p>We're also keen to make people aware of the scholarship opportunities available to Sri Lankan students and to encourage applications from across Sri Lanka. Chevening is the UK Government's prestigious fully-funded scholarship program - I love catching up with Chevening alumni here, who are excelling in a wide range of fields. Every year the scholarship sends selected Sri Lankan students to the UK to complete a one year master's program in any subject they choose at any university, fully paid. We look for candidates who have leadership potential and an excellent record of achievement as well as a strong desire to make a difference in their country.</p><p>It's a pleasure to work alongside the British Council here who are well known for their educational opportunities. They build connections between people in the UK and Sri Lanka through arts, culture, education and the English language. They deliver close to 100,000 UK exams on an annual basis, creating new pathways and opportunities for students, and young professionals.</p><p>I was so pleased to be able to join them last week to attend a filmed performance of Sleeping Beauty from the Royal Opera House. It was also an honour to welcome the Graetian Awards to Westminster House in the last few weeks of my time here - my congratulations to the two winners! I have really enjoyed getting to know Sri Lankan literature better and honoured to have had the opportunity to meet some of the authors of these incredible works.</p><p>Q: As you look back on your time here, what have been some of the most memorable occasions?</p><p>We have had some special moments of celebration, with the Queen's Baton visiting Sri Lanka ahead of the Commonwealth Games hosted in Birmingham. Her Late Majesty The Queen celebrated her Platinum Jubilee year and the occasion was marked by a series of special events in London, as well as the lighting of Platinum Jubilee beacons in the UK and overseas, including in Sri Lanka. When she passed away last year we were all touched by the heartfelt messages of condolence from so many people here, often sharing their memories of her visits.</p><p>We were also able to celebrate a historic event - the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Queen Camilla. It was a wonderful opportunity to bring many of the colleagues and partners we work with in Sri Lanka together and witness the special moment together.</p><p>This is an important year for the UK and Sri Lanka as we mark 75 years of bilateral relations. We are celebrating this through '75 Stories' highlighting remarkable stories of Sri Lankans in the UK, and British nationals here in Sri Lanka - underlining the strong people to people links between our two countries.</p><p>Over the last four years, I have been able to travel to different parts of the country, including with visitors like Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office Minister Lord Ahmad. I have found experiencing Sri Lanka's rich religious and cultural heritage very rewarding and it has meant I have been able to meet people of diverse faiths and backgrounds and better understand a range of perspectives. We have also had a visit from the UK Prime Minister's Trade Envoy for Sri Lanka Lord Davies of Abersoch. It was great to be able to build on online meetings and bilateral engagements he had joined us for and welcome him here. With Lord Davies, we have been engaging with the business community, particularly through the Council for Business with Britain, and Government stakeholders to explore how we can further deepen our bilateral trade ties.</p><p>As I get ready to depart back to the UK, I want to thank everyone who has supported and worked with us in the last few years. It has been an honour to lead the British High Commission here and I hope to keep in touch and visit again one day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2906202300047</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K4-X801-F00C-638V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1547\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 29, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Adaptation measures-for example, flood protection, nature-based solutions, or climate-smart agriculture practices-can reduce the vulnerability of human systems and help people withstand or recover from impacts. However, there are hard and soft limits to adaptation that depend on physical limitations as well as available resources, capacities, technology, and finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Loss and damage in the climate negotiations</p><p>The concept of 'loss and damage' is used in climate negotiations to refer to the negative impacts of climate change on people, livelihoods, and ecosystems that go beyond the limits of adaptation. In the negotiation process under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), developing countries have pressed for an inclusion of loss and damage since at least the 1990s. The concept became formalised with the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism in 2013 and the Paris Agreement in 2015, which contains a section dedicated to loss and damage (Article 8). Broadly speaking, key areas of concern are the implementation of comprehensive risk management approaches, improved understanding of slow-onset events, non-economic losses, and human mobility, and enhanced action and support.</p><p>The latter point has drawn considerable attention at the last two global climate change conferences (COP26 and COP27) and led to the recent decision to establish a separate fund for loss and damage. However, while negotiations on the modalities and operational arrangements for this fund will take place throughout the year and towards COP28, three other questions are also of crucial importance: what exactly does loss and damage mean for those affected, what kinds of support are needed on the ground, and how can a global fund help to provide them?</p><p>Loss and damage comes in many shapes and forms.</p><p>On the one hand, there are impacts that can directly be measured in economic terms: damage to infrastructure and assets, loss of working hours, reduced productivity, destroyed houses. On the other hand, many facets of loss and damage are intangible or much harder to quantify, for example, loss of life or health; displacement or climate-induced migration; loss of territory, cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, or societal identity; and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.</p><p>As identified by the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, there is currently a 'disproportionate emphasis on economic loss and damage while intangible, non-economic losses and damages are relatively less measured and reported.' Simultaneously, it is clear that 'aggregate losses and damages would be higher if non-economic values are considered,' indicating the importance of understanding and considering these aspects of loss and damage in any assessment and intervention.</p><p>Cultural loss and damage</p><p>Cultural loss is a key aspect of non-economic loss and damage that needs further investigation to enhance a detailed understanding of what it entails and facilitate the development of evidence-based policies, plans, and actions. Especially in the context of the anticipated loss and damage fund and the availability of further means of support through an operationalised Santiago Network for Loss and Damage, it is important for countries such as Sri Lanka to identify and quantify forms of loss and damage as well as potential mechanisms to address them.</p><p>Cultural loss can affect individuals, communities, or societies in a multitude of forms. For example, it could manifest as the loss of traditional arts and crafts such as textile-making, masks, pattern stitching, or woodwork. When climate change impacts force communities to change their way of life and migrate away or shift towards new livelihoods, the transition of such practices can get interrupted, and the knowledge lost. Similarly, climate-induced changes to ecosystems can lead to a reduced availability of raw materials or the disappearance of vital species involved in traditional artisanal processes. Depending on the exact climate impacts in an area, communities can lose access to traditional resources, ingredients, diets, meeting spaces, or animals and plants of cultural significance.</p><p>For much the same reason, customs, traditions, ritual, or ceremonies can become lost as well, as can local dialects, vocabulary, or even entire Indigenous languages as their speakers are displaced and assimilate into new host communities. Heat can make outdoor places less hospitable and lead to shrinking spaces for informal engagement and meetings, while sea level rise can destroy both tangible and intangible cultural heritage or cause a permanent loss of territory. Further inland, floods, landslides, or storms can irreversibly affect heritage sites, archaeological sites, and places of cultural or spiritual significance.</p><p>Cultural loss is very much human loss and can gravely affect individuals or families. Fear of cultural loss can result in worry, anxiety, or sadness, affecting mental health and the underlying sense of safety and security within a community. Furthermore, past losses leave trauma and can lead to long-term psychosocial issues that manifest in substance abuse, depression, or a deterioration of social cohesion and solidarity.</p><p>There are many ways in which climate change directly or indirectly impacts lives and livelihoods, be it through extreme weather events or long-term processes. Understanding the exact nature of the consequences of these impacts that go beyond physical or economic loss and damage is an important prerequisite to work with affected communities, design effective interventions, and establish support structures that can channel available funds towards the most vulnerable, which in turn can help to access and mobilise finance from within and beyond the UNFCCC process.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT20012023000522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67C8-BTG1-JCH9-G381-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"996\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 20, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

They provide a range of critical environmental, economic and social benefits. The most significant benefit being the enormous carbon sequestration potential of seagrass, storing up to 18 percent of the world's oceanic carbon, which is greater than that of rainforests which makes protection and restoration of seagrass a vital tool in efforts to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.</p><p>The vital functions of seagrasses also include its role in stabilizing the sea bottom and providing ecosystem support via food and shelter for a number of marine creatures, including commercial and recreational fish species, as well as endangered and charismatic species such as turtles, dugongs and manatees. However, seagrass ecosystems are being destroyed as a result of human activity.

He highlighted the importance of seagrass as a carbon sink, in protection against coastal erosion, in stabilizing the sea bottom, increasing the resilience of the most vulnerable ecosystems, and increasing food stability for a number of marine creatures, and the pivotal role it plays in curtailing the effects of climate change.</p><p>The World Seagrass Association closely supported the Government of Sri Lanka in this endeavor.</p><p>Seagrasses are one of the most valuable marine ecosystems on earth covering around 300,000 square kilometers in 159 countries and six continents. They provide a range of critical environmental, economic and social benefits. The most significant benefit being the enormous carbon sequestration potential of seagrass, storing up to 18 percent of the world's oceanic carbon, which is greater than that of rainforests which makes protection and restoration of seagrass a vital tool in efforts to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. The vital functions of seagrasses also include its role in stabilizing the sea bottom and providing ecosystem support via food and shelter for a number of marine creatures, including commercial and recreational fish species, as well as endangered and charismatic species such as turtles, dugongs and manatees. However, seagrass ecosystems are being destroyed as a result of human activity. The United Nations Environmental Programme Publication 'Out of the Blue: the value of seagrasses to the environment and to people' states that \"7 per cent of seagrass marine habitat is being lost worldwide per year, which is equivalent to a football field of seagrass lost every 30 minutes\".</p><p>The initiative was a collective effort of studying sea grass ecosystems and examining restoration and conservation through Nature-based Solutions by an NGO and academics and paving the way to highlight the importance of scientific-evidence based approaches at the policy level.</p><p>The Biodiversity Secretariat of the Ministry of Environment, Department of Aquaculture &amp; Fisheries at the Wayamba University and the Blue Resource Trust worked together with the Ocean Affairs, Environment and Climate Change of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and contributed to the process and coordinated with the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the UN in New York in this regard.</p><p>The introductory speech by Ambassador Pieris can be viewed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/S3EB7C0I0kY\">https://youtu.be/S3EB7C0I0kY</url></p><p>The full adoption of the resolution can be viewed here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/gnJ2huRVs3k\">https://youtu.be/gnJ2huRVs3k</url></p><p>Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the UN</p><p>New York For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SRLKGV-NSLPR4115562</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SRLKGV2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65J4-N1Y1-JDKC-R4MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377133</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><timeReceived>11:31 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 HT Media Limited.

Friday's hub, of course, was the 'Lost Ingredients Lab'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Dilmah, the tea giant, this location was where it all started small, the Head Office and manufacturing complex at 52, Maligawatte Road 'as in the beginning', where Founder Merrill J. Fernando had the dream of producing the world's first genuinely ethical tea which has come true.</p><p>With Merrill himself dedicating the 'birthplace' of Dilmah to the Genesis Project on May 6, last year (2022), it has now become a second 'home and workplace' for its first pioneers, selected through a rigorous process - six from around 120 applications.</p><p>Dilmah has within the folds of the Genesis Project, in addition to the Lost Ingredients Lab, a Digital Library, a Co-Working Space, a Market Space and a Townhall Space.</p><p>The Lost Ingredients Lab has been made possible with Euros 500,000 (around Rs. 178 million) from the European Union (EU), the first time it has given a grant to a Sri Lankan corporate, and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) of the German Federal Government. The technical consultants for this lab are Good Life X (GLX).</p><p>On Friday, soon after the unveiling of the Lost Ingredients Lab kitchen, senior chef Anura Uduwara Arachchi from Water's Edge Hotel demonstrated how the snacks the invitees and participants would later savour were prepared using 'lost' or 'not-given-due-place' ingredients such as gotukola, seaweed and jakfruit.</p><p>When the Sunday Times visited the Genesis Project on Thursday to meet the pioneer entrepreneurs, all systems were set to go, less than a year after its dedication.</p><p>Green and healthy are the products of Lakmini Weerakkody (29) from Bandaragama. While attending work from home, she was able to try out her hand at dehydrating vegetables, fruit and green leaves because she knew that a lot went to waste because they were perishables.</p><p>Banking on her food technology background, Lakmini was able to make a small machine and carry out trials on right temperatures for dehydration for different fruit, vegetables and green leaves, without destroying their natural properties and nutrition.</p><p>Employing and empowering two women in the area, she was sending samples with much emphasis on gotukola (Centella asiatica) amounting to about 500 kilos a month in 2019 to businessmen who were exporting them. Putting by most of her salary, she had been able to expand her business in 2022 and now owns a quality-certified small factory as well as a bigger machine.</p><p>Heading Lak Nature International, an all-female business which has given 20 women in the low-income bracket a way to eke out a living, she produces 3,000 kilos of dehydrated products a month.</p><p>Through the golden opportunity of the Genesis Project, this 'Gotukola Goddess', as she is called with affection, would be pitching her signature products of gotukola porridge, tea, soup and salad, with the hope of widening her horizons over the seas.</p><p>It is another plant product - seaweed - that Shawn Senarath (24) from Colombo will put forward for attention and investment through his business Ceylon Aqua and Agri, as he says with conviction that there is much potential for it.</p><p>Getting seaweed from farmers, a majority of whom are women, in Jaffna and Mannar, he says it is a stable income generator because the harvesting can be done in 50 days. While seaweed strengthens the coastal eco-system and restores it rather than taking anything away from it, value-addition and vertical integration of this product could bring into the country much-needed foreign exchange because it is a popular and nutritious food in many countries.</p><p>Shawn is offering sea-moss gel which has 92 of the 102 minerals essential for human well-being.</p><p>Burger patties and nuggets, both jakfruit based are what Sahan Bakmiwewa (28) from Colombo puts up for grabs to investors through his company dubbed Plant Based Studios.</p><p>He was engaged in organic spice exports from his Matale factory when numerous were the queries from the west about polos, the tender jakfruit. Why, he wondered, and found to his amazement that with many going down the vegan pathway, the attraction of polos was its meat-like texture which made it a good vegan substitute.</p><p>Sahan too tried to go vegan, but the resolve lasted only three days, he smiles, for the food was not very tasty but it was very expensive.</p><p>While his company is also producing rice milk made from traditional rice varieties, he is hoping that investors would pick up the polos burger patty and nugget and make them sizzle in hotels, restaurants and cafes locally and later internationally.</p><p>From the earth and the sea, the Sunday Times is transported to the virtual, when Sharmilan Somasundaram (28) from Batticaloa introduces us to his start-up Niftron which is offering 'blockchain' technology.</p><p>This technology, a service platform, is an advanced database mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network, he says, explaining that a blockchain database stores data in 'blocks' that are linked together in a 'chain'.</p><p>Sharmilan underscores that there is no paper trail or documents which could be fiddled with. A blockchain, say with regard to an organic product, would leave clear traceability from farm to market, with consumers being able to scan a QR Code and see its journey.</p><p>Citing a few examples, he says that this service platform can be used to trace the story of the cultivation of traditional rice varieties, Sri Lankan women in the apparel industry who stitch intricate lace and whether plastic manufacturers are in reality using recycled raw material.</p><p>It is another traceability solution with a different tweak that Mathangey Sathiyamoorthy (27) from Colombo is putting forth through her company, Polar.</p><p>This solution uses the Internet of Things (IOT) technology, she says, allowing the tracking of any type of perishable food through all stages of production, processing and distribution.</p><p>Picking up a stock of vegetables being transported from a Sigiriya farm to a market shelf in Colombo in a truck with cooling facilities, Mathangey says this platform and device would send real-time data and alerts when necessary on the condition of the stock. Then if there is a disturbance in the temperature which could cause a deterioration of the vegetables, immediate action could be taken to correct it. Global expansion is what she is looking for.</p><p>Joining on Zoom from Matale is Kapila Weeratunga Arachchi (59), an entrepreneur who develops and manufactures different types of dryers through his company Saviru Technologies and Services, for businesses engaged in dehydration techniques for vegetables and fruit.</p><p>His dryers with a capacity ranging from 5 kilos to 5,000 kilos can work with wood, oil, gas or electricity.

It has distinguishable elements including a hazard, exposure, vulnerability, response options, values, magnitude, likelihood, and temporal characteristics, and is further shaped by socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental factors. Whether they are faced by an individual, community, company, or national level, risks are multifold, complex, and interconnected. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In general, risks fall into categories such as market risks, liquidity risks, credit risks, operational risks, production risks, legal and regulatory risks, environmental risks, and many others. In the age of climate change, climate risk has emerged as a crucial additional category of risks that affects all sectors and areas of the economy, for example through extreme weather events, shifting weather patterns, and long-term processes including sea level rise and ecosystem degradation.</p><p>Climate change and risk finance</p><p>To manage climate-related or climate-compounded risks, entities have a range of options, for example risk prevention (reducing exposure), risk reduction (reducing vulnerability), risk analytics leading to risk-informed planning, and risk transfer, which is usually done through indemnity-based or parametric insurance mechanisms.</p><p>Risk finance is an integral part of risk management and vital to addressing the multitude of risks connected to climate change. At its core, risk finance is about finding ways to compensate for the potential of losses or damages in the most effective and least costly way possible. Depending on the risk, the entity, and available mechanisms and frameworks, risk finance can take many different forms and vary significantly in volume.</p><p>Cost of risk (COR) is a quantitative measure of the total direct and indirect expenditures dedicated to mitigating the risk exposures confronting an organisation in pursuit of its objectives. However, it is important to note that risk finance cannot cover the entirety of risks faced by different entities. As the recent Sixth Assessment Report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) outlines: 'Risks can be reduced or managed by risk finance (insurance and other means), but some residual risk remains, particularly for high impact unavoided and unavoidable risk, which is retained implicitly or explicitly.'</p><p>Innovative financial instruments</p><p>Financial instruments and vehicles such as bonds, concessional loans, contingent credit lines, donor assistance, domestic credit, catastrophe deferred drawdown options, weather derivatives, or equity funds can play a key role for risk finance. They have the potential to attract and accelerate investment from other countries, multilateral institutions, or the private sector, and capitalise on a mindset shift towards more sustainable, green, climate-friendly, and responsible investment.</p><p>The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report has highlighted the potential for 'innovative policy instruments like [...] climate bonds' to supplement traditional financial instruments and scale up investment into climate-smart and resilient development projects. Social impact bonds, green bonds, and sustainability bonds are three major categories of 'thematic' bonds that facilitate impact investment earmarked for a specific kind of usage. These bonds are issued to (re-)finance projects that have a positive social impact, a positive environmental impact, or a combination of both. In addition, sustainability-linked bonds are related instruments with a wider scope, funding not specific projects but general operations of an entity that are linked to sustainability targets and conditions.</p><p>Some categories of projects funded by green and climate bonds include clean and renewable energy and transport; enhanced energy and resource efficiency in key economic sectors; green buildings and cities; climate-smart transport systems; sustainable and climate-friendly food systems; nature-based solutions and ecosystem conservation; water management; waste and pollution control; or digital and frontier technologies with benefits for climate and environment.</p><p>Other related financial instruments include resilience bonds, catastrophe bonds ('CAT bonds'), CAT swaps, blue bonds, forest resilience bonds, climate-conditional grants, carbon credits, or ecosystem-linked insurance schemes, for example restoration insurance or reef insurance offering premium discounts or other benefits for ecosystem conservation and nature-based risk management.</p><p>Furthermore, public debt for developing countries has increased in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and more intense and frequent climate-induced losses and damages. To alleviate this strain on public finances, bilateral or tripartite debt-for-climate swaps have been proposed as a potential solution that could allow countries such as Sri Lanka to receive debt relief in exchange for commitments to undertake climate-related investments. The IPCC report also outlines initiatives such as 'comprehensive debt relief by public creditors, green recovery bonds, [...] and new SDG-aligned debt instruments' to address unsustainable debt burdens and free up investment in climate adaptation and a green economic recovery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT05092022000521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66B1-WKG1-F00C-63FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 5, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Business &amp;

The country's unique biodiversity is currently threatened by climate change, habitat fragmentation and over-exploitation. Severe shifts in Sri Lanka's seasonal rainfall patterns accompanied by increased flood and drought events in the last decade have directly impacted rural food security and income. According to HSBC Global Research, climate change will be the defining crisis of the century for Asia. Ignoring the human impact on climate will delay reducing inequality and achieving sustainable long-term growth in the region.</p><p>Project CORE is part of a US$ 100 million global initiative by HSBC to accelerate efforts to build a Net Zero Economy. HSBC unveiled this Climate Partnership with World Resources Institute (WRI) and WWF in May 2021. This is part of HSBC's ambitious climate strategy, announced in October 2020.</p><p>Project CORE is built around a multi-sector and multi-stakeholder approach, which in time can be replicated in other areas.</p><p>For instance, the project team will collaborate with the Forest Department to adopt a number of landscape approaches and techniques. Another important feature of the project is the schools-led effort to restore 25 hectares of the identified area.</p><p>This hands-on experience will play a pivotal role in improving the students' knowledge on ecosystem services and potential restoration benefits towards water resources, biodiversity, climate adaptation, family nutrition and disaster risk reduction.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The richly decorated frescoes and mirrored wall have also led Sigiriya to become one of Sri Lanka Tourism's most prominent archaeological attractions. The latest addition to Sigiriya's accolades is the recent announcement by Bloomberg, that listed the Lion Rock fortress, as one of the new seven wonders of the world.</p><p>Bloomberg's announcement is timely for Sri Lanka, as the island plans to take advantage of the new behavioral patterns that are expected to emerge among post-pandemic travelers. According to experts from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), travelers are now more likely to demand a focus on sustainability, connections with local communities, open-air and nature-based cultural experiences-in other words, the ethos of travel in our little island home. Before global travel restrictions, the tourism sector in Sri Lanka was the third-largest export earner accounting for around 5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 with the sector directly employing 250,000 people and up to 2 million, indirectly. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka nearly doubled from 1.5 million to 2.3 million from 2014 to 2018. Revitalizing this sector through a speedy, clean and green recovery has the potential to provide tangible benefits to the Sri Lankan economy and communities across the island.</p><p>Building Back Tourism</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has been focused on just that: building back tourism as a resilient and sustainable sector. The newly developed Tourism Roadmap, \"Putting People First: Building a More Resilient Tourism Sector in Sri Lanka\", aims to rebrand Sri Lanka which, for decades, has been pegged as a mass low-spending market, to an unmissable, signature experience recognized for its niche, indigenous products and services around nature, wellness, culture and adventure. It also aims to redesign the industry to protect it's people. Sri Lanka's tourism is still reeling from the devastating Easter Attacks in 2019, and are only just getting its bearings together from the global travel collapse and effects of COVID-19. This roadmap for Sri Lanka, aims to provide social protection nets for those in the industry to withstand such untimely events in the future. UNDP will continue to assist the Government of Sri Lanka in updating the Tourism Development Strategic Action Plan 2021-2024, while also enabling Sri Lanka to transition to sustainable tourism by creating guidelines and standards for nature-based tourism. Prior to the pandemic, SLTDA put sustainability at the core in reviving this sector, by launching the National Sustainable Tourism Certification in 2018 with financial and technical assistance from the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN). Such programmes are essential, as tourism is often a source of pollution and biodiversity degradation with the benefits of tourism not trickling down to local communities. This certification scheme is geared towards promoting sustainable accomodations, destinations and tour operators.</p><p>The first phase of obtaining certification for accommodations was successfully completed, while SLTDA and UNDP are currently focused on obtaining Sustainable Destination Certifications for 9 destinations across the 9 provinces in the island. This certification scheme enables tourist destinations to be rated based on the overall quality of service and exclusiveness of the experience. Currently, 28% of total revenue from visiting international tourists is generated through biodiversity related attractions. This certification will further contribute to tourism, by attracting more eco-conscious tourists which will generate more revenue to help improve the biodiversity of these destinations. Despite the high value of these attractions, hardly any revenue is put back into developing and conserving these attractions and its surrounding habitats. The Destination certification looks at sustainably managing the existing biodiversity, by encouraging key tourist destinations to invest 0.5% (equivalent to 5 million USD per annum) back into biodiversity management. The scheme injects cash back into conserving natural resources and the surrounding local communities, ensuring tourism will be for the people and planet, leaving no one behind.</p><p>Sigiriya: The path to sustainability</p><p>Sigiriya, already a popular attraction amongst tourists, has been targeted for the sustainable destination certification particularly given issues noted by tourists such as overcrowding, congestion, and plastic pollution among many others.</p><p>Ramitha Wijethunga, National Project Coordinator of the Climate and Environment Team at UNDPSri Lanka also notes, \"the importance of protecting Sigiriya for future generations is very clear now. Under the Sustainable Destination Management Certification programme, the Ministry of Tourism and SLTDA together with the UNDP-BIOFIN project has taken steps to develop a plan to support the implementation, to ensure the sustainability of this cultural excellence and looks to extend this beyond Sigiriya into other wonders across the island\".</p><p>Nature based solutions</p><p>Some of these plans include the creation of a plastic free zone, upskilling neighboring communities to be interpreters, management of tourist flow through digital technology, development of neighboring attractions such as Pidurangala and Kaludiya Pokuna for visitor overflow and distribution. Tourism depends on the preservation of an attractive environment and certification acts as an incentive to tourism providers to rebuild these locations to be more eco-conscious.</p><p>The National Sustainable Destination Certification is a first step in promoting nature-based solutions for the country's green development. As flagged by the UNWTO, a green recovery is essential post-pandemic, in catalysing the responsible recovery of the tourism industry, balancing the needs of the people, and the planet for Sri Lanka's green growth.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

It is home to a rich ecosystem because of its climatic diversity and coastal influences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Tipping Point</p><p>We are in the Anthropocene and our planet is in a critical state. Scientists have declared our actions in the next 10 years to be catalytic in bringing the Earth back within its planetary boundaries-bending the curve on biodiversity loss, controlling greenhouse gas emissions, keeping global temperature rise below 1.5degC, and preventing climate change.</p><p>The anthropogenic mass, which consists of human-made inanimate objects such as houses, roads and plastic - is doubling its weight roughly every 20 years. As of 2020, anthropogenic masses have begun to exceed global living biomass. This means, we have used up nearly 50% of the world's natural resources as raw materials for our existence. Humanity today uses the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to provide resources for our use and absorb waste. We use more ecological resources and services than nature can regenerate -and added with the increase in rates of pollution and ecological degradation, we are now at a tipping point.</p><p>Future of our Civilization at Risk</p><p>Global warming is leading to the premature collapse of vital ecosystems necessary for our survival. Since our existence and the Earth's resources are intrinsically intertwined, these planetary changes will have catastrophic impacts on life as we know it. Advancing development, while erasing such planetary pressure is the next frontier for human development.</p><p>Amidst the torrential monsoon rains increasing risks of flooding, and heavy winds from 'Cyclone Yaas'- the second cyclonic depression in the Indian Ocean for the month of May- tearing through the island, while battling the third and the worst wave of COVID-19 that Sri Lanka has seen thus far, it has never been more evident that the time to act is now.</p><p>Our little island is one of 36 biodiversity hotspots in the world and has one of the highest rates of biological endemism. It is home to a rich ecosystem because of its climatic diversity and coastal influences. Our ecosystems act as our lifeblood; it recycles nutrients, provides clean water and energy, sustains the country's water production, and sequesters carbon and slows the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution.</p><p>Ecosystems: A Natural Climate Solution</p><p>As Sri Lanka's climate vulnerability and extreme weather events increase, apart from providing essential services, these ecosystems are also the solution to the climate crisis. Specifically, our ecosystems are capable of providing nature-based solutions to reduce climate vulnerability and impacts on communities. Forested watersheds sustain water supplies to people experiencing water stress, while feeding economic development and biodiversity.</p><p>Mangroves, other coastal vegetation, sand dunes, wetlands, and offshore coral reefs protect our coastline from the impacts of wave surges and extreme storms, while our forests are essential for flood, erosion control and headwater protection. Beyond this natural buffer, our ecosystems are the 'natural climate solution' providing us with cleaner air, reduced CO2in our atmosphere, climate resilient livelihoods, sustainable economic benefits and green growth, all through nature-based solutions to development.</p><p>While climate change threatens our ecological integrity, we too are threatening our ecosystems. According to the Sixth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity, in 2019, overfishing, destructive fishing methods, coastal zone development, pollution, unregulated and unsustainable tourism practices were some of the key drivers of degradation in Sri Lankan coastal ecosystems. The 2018 UNREDD National Action Plan and Investment Framework affirmed that habitatfragmentation, encroachment, urbanization, irrigation development, resettlement, transportation development, and private agriculture ventures were some of the key threats to our forests, grasslands and wetlands.</p><p>Dr. Buddika Hapuarachchi, Policy Specialist and Team Lead for Climate and Environment at UNDP in Sri Lanka, asserts the severity of the potential and novel risks communities and environment may be subject to. He notes, \"The recent fire on the cargo ship carrying hazardous substances; MV X-Press Pearl, and the heavy pollution of our coastline that followed was unexpected - but is evidence to the fact that additional and potential threats to our environment are exponential and compounding, and will require significant recovery time and resources.\"</p><p>At the heart of developmental progress</p><p>Although Sri Lanka has been pursuing 'low-carbon development', cross-sectoral policy inconsistencies, and structural issues have decreased the country's environmental sustainability. The increase in disaster losses and damages has also led to decelerated economic growth. According to the World Bank, in 2018, the economic growth of Sri Lanka reached a 16-year low of 3.3% due to the prolonged disaster losses over the years, especially those in 2017. This has resulted in an increase in food insecurity and multidimensional poverty from 11.9 % in 2019, to 14.3%in 2020, which is above three million people. Five years after the ratification of the Paris Agreement, it's clear that conserving, restoring and financing nature remains imperative, and as a nation, it is imperative that we avoidcreating new risks. We must place policy and legislative changes, multisectoral collaboration and innovative financing approaches at the heart of all developmental progress in the next ten years if we are to reverse the effects of these disasters.</p><p>At this critical juncture of COVID-19 recovery, the policy and fiscal choices made at this point will lock in the country's economic and developmental future. \"This is an ideal opportunity for Sri Lanka to push long-overdue climate and environmental sustainability actions, delink economic growth from fossil-fuel dependency and emissions, and promote climate-and nature-based solutions,\" says Dr. Hapuarachchi. Sustainable public-private partnerships must be encouraged, while transforming agriculture to a carbon sink, and ensuring that the 'whole of system' approach is applied when adapting, mitigating and eliminating vulnerabilities. Dr. Hapuarachchi sums up that, \"in short, balanced inclusive green growth [is what we need]. Development, that is socially inclusive and drives economic growth, employment and poverty reduction, while maintaining the healthy functioning of</p><p>our ecosystems\".</p><p>A Decade of Hope</p><p>World Environment Day 2021 calls for urgent action to revive our damaged ecosystems as we kick off the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030). Ecosystem restoration is a global undertaking at massive scale. It means repairing billions of hectares of land - an area greater than China or the USA - so that people have access to food, clean water and jobs. It means bringing back plants and animals from the brink of extinction, from the peaks of mountains to the depths of the sea. But it also includes the many small actions everyone can take, every day.</p><p>Sri Lanka has already taken a step in the right direction, making significant progress affirming these green commitments by setting ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement; through the development of sectoral development plans, relevant policies, strategies and guidelines to fulfill these climate commitments. These efforts are now being supplemented by the Government and development agencies pushing towards a 'systems shift' for green-centric development in the country.</p><p>The moment is now</p><p>While the impending risks and threats are daunting, Sri Lanka has always adopted a culture of resilience and collective action. When in need, we step up to the task, ensuring that no one is left behind while we build forward better.</p><p>This is our moment. We cannot turn back the time - but our actions today will determine our future. We are the generation that can make peace with nature. Let's restore, regenerate, renew, reuse, regreen and rewild our environment for a better and more sustainable future. Together, we can be the generation of restoration!</p><p>UNDP: UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone.

Converted into a royal palace following King Kashyapa's flight from the then capital Anuradhapura, the inner-city tiers, water gardens and moats are credited for their advanced, ingenious design.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The richly decorated frescoes and mirrored wall have also led Sigiriya to become one of Sri Lanka Tourism's most prominent archaeological attractions. The latest addition to Sigiriya's accolades is the recent announcement by Bloomberg, that listed the Lion Rock fortress, as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World.</p><p>Bloomberg's announcement is timely for Sri Lanka, as the island plans to take advantage of the new behavioral patterns that are expected to emerge among post-pandemic travelers. According to experts from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), travelers are now more likely to demand a focus on sustainability, connections with local communities, open-air and nature-based cultural experiences-in other words, the ethos of travel in our little island home.</p><p>Before global travel restrictions, the tourism sector in Sri Lanka was the third-largest export earner accounting for around 5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2018 with the sector directly employing 250,000 people and up to 2 million, indirectly. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka nearly doubled from 1.5 million to 2.3 million from 2014 to 2018. Revitalizing this sector through a speedy, clean and green recovery has the potential to provide tangible benefits to the Sri Lankan economy and communities across the island.</p><p>Building Back Tourism</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has been focused on just that: building back tourism as a resilient and sustainable sector. The newly developed Tourism Roadmap, \"Putting People First: Building a More Resilient Tourism Sector in Sri Lanka\", aims to rebrand Sri Lanka which, for decades, has been pegged as a mass low-spending market, to an unmissable, signature experience recognized for its niche, indigenous products and services around nature, wellness, culture and adventure.</p><p>It also aims to redesign the industry to protect its people. Sri Lanka's tourism is still reeling from the devastating Easter Attacks in 2019, and are only just getting its bearings together from the global travel collapse and effects of COVID-19. This roadmap for Sri Lanka, aims to provide social protection nets for those in the industry to withstand such untimely events in the future. UNDP will continue to assist the Government of Sri Lanka in updating the Tourism Development Strategic Action Plan 2021-2024, while also enabling Sri Lanka to transition to sustainable tourism by creating guidelines and standards for nature-based tourism.</p><p>Prior to the pandemic, SLTDA put sustainability at the core in reviving this sector, by launching the National Sustainable Tourism Certification in 2018 with financial and technical assistance from the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN).</p><p>Such programmes are essential, as tourism is often a source of pollution and biodiversity degradation with the benefits of tourism not trickling down to local communities. This certification scheme is geared towards promoting sustainable accommodations, destinations and tour operators.</p><p>The first phase of obtaining certification for accommodations was successfully completed, while SLTDA and UNDP are currently focused on obtaining Sustainable Destination Certifications for 9 destinations across the 9 provinces in the island. This certification scheme enables tourist destinations to be rated based on the overall quality of service and exclusiveness of the experience. Currently, 28% of total revenue from visiting international tourists is generated through biodiversity related attractions.</p><p>This certification will further contribute to tourism, by attracting more eco-conscious tourists which will generate more revenue to help improve the biodiversity of these destinations.</p><p>Despite the high value of these attractions, hardly any revenue is put back into developing and conserving these attractions and its surrounding habitats. The Destination certification looks at sustainably managing the existing biodiversity, by encouraging key tourist destinations to invest 0.5% (equivalent to 5 million USD per annum) back into biodiversity management. The scheme injects cash back into conserving natural resources and the surrounding local communities, ensuring tourism will be for the people and planet, leaving no one behind.</p><p>Path to sustainability</p><p>Sigiriya, already a popular attraction amongst tourists, has been targeted for the sustainable destination certification particularly given issues noted by tourists such as overcrowding, congestion, and plastic pollution among many others.</p><p>Ramitha Wijethunga, National Project Coordinator of the Climate and Environment Team at UNDPSri Lanka also notes, \"the importance of protecting Sigiriya for future generations is very clear now. Under the Sustainable Destination Management Certification programme, the Ministry of Tourism and SLTDA together with the UNDP-BIOFIN project has taken steps to develop a plan to support the implementation, to ensure the sustainability of this cultural excellence and looks to extend this beyond Sigiriya into other wonders across the island\".</p><p>Nature based solutions</p><p>Some of these plans include the creation of a plastic free zone, upskilling neighboring communities to be interpreters, management of tourist flow through digital technology, development of neighboring attractions such as Pidurangala and Kaludiya Pokuna for visitor overflow and distribution. Tourism depends on the preservation of an attractive environment and certification acts as an incentive to tourism providers to rebuild these locations to be more eco-conscious.</p><p>The National Sustainable Destination Certification is a first step in promoting nature-based solutions for the country's green development. As flagged by the UNWTO, a green recovery is essential post-pandemic, in catalysing the responsible recovery of the tourism industry, balancing the needs of the people, and the planet for Sri Lanka's green growth.</p><p>UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in 170 countries and territories, UNDP offer global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Today, some leaders are doing worse. They are throwing fuel on the fire. Literally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine ripples across the globe, the response of some nations to the growing energy crisis has been to double down on fossil fuels - pouring billions more dollars into the coal, oil and gas that are driving our deepening climate emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All climate indicators continue to break records, forecasting a future of ferocious storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and unlivable temperatures in vast swathes of the planet.</p><p>Our world faces climate chaos. New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production infrastructure is delusional. Fossil fuels are not the answer, nor will they ever be.</p><p>We can see the damage we are doing to the planet and our societies. It is in the news every day, and no one is immune.</p><p>Fossil fuels are the cause of the climate crisis. Renewable energy is the answer - to limit climate disruption and boost energy security. Had we invested earlier and massively in renewable energy, we would not find ourselves once again at the mercy of unstable fossil fuel markets.</p><p>Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century. But the battle for a rapid and just energy transition is not being fought on a level field. Investors are still backing fossil fuels, and governments still hand out billions in subsidies for coal, oil and gas - some US $11 million every minute.</p><p>There is a word for favouring short-term relief over long-term well-being. Addiction. We are still addicted to fossil fuels. For the health of our societies and planet, we need to quit. Now.</p><p>The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a livable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition.</p><p>To that end, I have called on G20 governments to dismantle coal infrastructure, with a full phase-out by 2030 for OECD countries and 2040 for all others.</p><p>I have urged financial actors to abandon fossil fuel finance and invest in renewable energy. And I have proposed a five-point plan to boost renewable energy round the world.</p><p>Five-point plan</p><p>First, we must make renewable energy technology a global public good, including removing intellectual property barriers to technology transfer.</p><p>Second, we must improve global access to supply chains for renewable energy technologies components and raw materials</p><p>In 2020, the world installed 5 gigawatts of battery storage. We need 600 gigawatts of storage capacity by 2030. Clearly, we need a global coalition to get there.</p><p>Shipping bottlenecks and supply-chain constraints, as well as higher costs for lithium and other battery metals, are hurting deployment of such technologies and materials just as we need them most.</p><p>Third, we must cut the red tape that holds up solar and wind projects. We need fast-track approvals and more effort to modernise electricity grids. In the European Union, it takes eight years to approve a wind farm, and 10 years in the United States. In the Republic of Korea, onshore wind projects need 22 permits from eight different ministries.</p><p>Fourth, the world must shift energy subsidies from fossil fuels to protect vulnerable people from energy shocks and invest in a just transition to a sustainable future.</p><p>And fifth, we need to triple investments in renewables. This includes multilateral development banks and development finance institutions, as well as commercial banks. All must step up and dramatically boost investments in renewables.</p><p>We need more urgency from all global leaders. We are already perilously close to hitting the 1.5degC limit that science tells us is the maximum level of warming to avoid the worst climate impacts.</p><p>To keep 1.5 alive, we must reduce emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by mid-century. But current national commitments will lead to an increase of almost 14 per cent this decade. That spells catastrophe.</p><p>The answer lies in renewables - for climate action, for energy security, and for providing clean electricity to the hundreds of millions of people who currently lack it. Renewables are a triple win.</p><p>There is no excuse for anyone to reject a renewables revolution. While oil and gas prices have reached record price levels, renewables are getting cheaper all the time.</p><p>The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85 percent over the past decade. The cost of wind power fell by 55 per cent. And investment in renewables creates three times more jobs than fossil fuels.</p><p>Of course, renewables are not the only answer to the climate crisis. Nature-based solutions, such as reversing deforestation and land degradation, are essential. So too are efforts to promote energy efficiency. But a rapid renewable energy transition must be our ambition.</p><p>As we wean ourselves off fossil fuels, the benefits will be vast, and not just to the climate. Energy prices will be lower and more predictable, with positive knock-on effects for food and economic security.</p><p>When energy prices rise, so do the costs of food and all the goods we rely on. So, let us all agree that a rapid renewables revolution is necessary and stop fiddling while our future burns.

We are pleased to announce continued support to Sri Lanka through the Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund (CSSF) to address legacies of conflict, promote human rights and build cohesion across all communities through program funding of up to \u00a3 3.7 million in 2022/23.'</p><p>'The UK and Sri Lanka share great historical and people to people links, and I look forward to building on the partnership we have created between our two countries,' Ahmad added.</p><p>Lord Ahmad met senior members of Government, including President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa. He discussed the importance of the UK-Sri Lanka relationship and areas of mutual interest such as climate change and economic recovery from COVID-19. The Minister also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government on healthcare cooperation, which will improve knowledge sharing, best practices and expertise on healthcare, and develop an ethical and sustainable recruitment program for the employment of Sri Lankan nurses and other healthcare professionals in the UK.</p><p>During his visit to the North and Eastern Provinces, the Minister met with local politicians and civil society. He discussed key Tamil and Muslim concerns, local governance and inclusive political engagement participation. He emphasised the UK's support for open, tolerant and inclusive societies as well as freedom of religion or belief.</p><p>Throughout his visit to Sri Lanka, Lord Ahmad heard about the essential role civil society plays in promoting respect for human rights and their views on how to make progress on reconciliation and accountability.</p><p>Lord Ahmad also met with business leaders to hear about economic developments and challenges, and explore UK support on infrastructure development and financial services. The UK is keen to support Sri Lanka improve its regulatory climate to improve the ease of doing business and further boost the UK-Sri Lanka trade and investment relationship.</p><p>Climate change and environmental protection is top priority for the UK, having hosted the UN climate change conference COP26 last year. As part of his visit, Lord Ahmad raised the importance of collaboration to support Sri Lanka's transition to a green and sustainable economy. The UK are eager to continue partnering with Sri Lanka to help them achieve their recent climate and COP commitments, including their move towards clean energy and away from coal.</p><p>Lord Ahmad highlighted ongoing work to underpin Sri Lanka's climate adaption and mitigation measures. This included support for nature-based solutions and the blue economy - a new concept that encourages better stewardship of our oceans. The UK will also help facilitate green finance and investment opportunities. All these initiatives will play a key role in delivering the action needed to support the 'Glasgow Pact', agreed at COP26, to accelerate global climate action.</p><p>Lord Ahmad met participants from the British Council's Women in STEM scholarships, to hear how their UK higher education qualification has impacted their career opportunities and professional contribution to society.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT290120220000504</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64NC-2HY1-JCH9-G1RC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 29, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Fernando's belief in the purpose of business is reflected in his philosophy that 'business is a matter of human service'. He embedded that into the foundation of his business when he launched his brand and began a multi-generational and uncompromising commitment to a new way of doing business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Dilmah was first born in 1988, it was the first time a tea grower had offered his produce to the world, direct and genuinely ethical. The paradigm shift that Dilmah represents has delivered over Rs. 5 billion of humanitarian benefit through the work of its MJF Foundation, and over Rs. 500 million for Dilmah Conservation's environmental interventions.</p><p>Dilmah Tea was awarded the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, with their independent panel of judges assessing the company's commitment to quality, tradition, customer, employees, innovation, ethics, integrity, and sustainability. As a family-owned tea company, the sustainable development of Dilmah's plantations - its community and environment - is integral towards creating long-term value.</p><p>Currently, residents of 16 estates in Kahawatte plantation, 16 estates in Talawakelle plantation, 13 estates in Elpitiya plantations, and Dunkeld Estate have benefited from initiatives related to healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and education. The Dilmah Plantation action plan for 2021-2025 is a Rs. 200 million initiative embracing education, entrepreneurship, climate resilience, nutrition, childcare amongst other areas.</p><p>Merrill J. Fernando is an ordinary Sri Lankan and his achievement in founding a company and integrating principles of sustainability into its core at a time the world was yet to understand sustainability, was visionary. The viability of a business today depends on using resources from healthy ecosystems and on the stability of a just society.</p><p>To ensure that economic, social, and environmental sustainability exists at the heart of its operations, Dilmah established the Merrill J. Fernando Charitable Foundation (MJF Foundation) and Dilmah Conservation to drive life-impacting initiatives ('Purpose Beyond Profit' is a free e-book, giving an overview of the overwhelming impact made through the two organisations).</p><p>The MJF Foundation works directly with estate workers and underprivileged communities to uplift lives and empowers them to pay-it-forward to their communities. Some of its core initiatives are the countrywide MJF centres, small-medium enterprises with over 2,000 small entrepreneurs, 'Empower' Culinary  and  Hospitality school, and 'disABILITY' teletherapy app.</p><p>The MJFCF scholarship program has currently awarded 425 scholarships including 262 scholarships for university education empowering children in plantations to enter university and has succeeded in producing doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers, and several other professionals.</p><p>The Foundation has improved the quality of life for plantation workers, residents, and the surrounding communities by establishing new housing, medical centres, and care for the entire resident population of the estates, pre-schools at 63 Child Development Centres, after-school programs, and nutrition programs.</p><p>The sustainable development of the plantations and people cannot be separated from the environment. Tea plantations situated in Sri Lanka's wet zone region are among the first places expected to be impacted by climate change. Focusing on conservation efforts that will directly benefit the environment, people, and wildlife that co-exist with them, Dilmah Conservation (DC) influences over 8,000 new individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices each year. DC is keen on providing nature-based solutions and has delivered 12 such initiatives.</p><p>Among these are the recently concluded one million cashew planting that annually feeds Rs. 2 billion into Sri Lanka's Eastern economy, energy usage reduction initiatives, organic practices that increase agricultural productivity of the lands, construction of nature corridors that increase the biodiversity of Dilmah's estates, green recovery programs for plantation habitat revival, and use of smart tools such as resource-efficient hydroponics for sustainable agriculture.</p><p>The reach of Dilmah's environmental arm extends beyond Colombo to include several initiatives that are among the first to be established by a private company such as a dedicated climate change research centre, urban arboretum, and open-air butterfly garden. As a commitment to a truly sustainable vision, Dilmah Conservation has further blazed a trail in the corporate sector by promoting sustainable beekeeping, home gardening, climate-smart irrigation, and diversification of monoculture with a key focus on educating the public.</p><p>Understanding the importance of SDG 17: partnering for sustainable development goals, Dilmah has pioneered and led the way in corporate advocacy, engaging the corporate sector towards building a better planet through its initiated Biodiversity Sri Lanka - a national platform that aids businesses in finding solutions to adjust their activities to ensure fair income and sustainable growth while benefiting biodiversity and ecosystems. Dilmah further complies with UN Global Compact Guiding Principles, embedding them in its business strategies.</p><p>The 2021-2025 Dilmah Plantation Action plan will revive the plantation community in 16 Estates that form a part of primarily Dilmah-owned Kahawatte Plantations, Talawakelle, and Elpitiya Plantations. The action plan will bear a holistic framework aimed at elevating the community members' physical, mental, and emotional well-being and socioeconomic status.</p><p>The areas of focus are gender and women, youth, education, health and wellbeing, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), climate-smart agriculture including agroforestry, adopting Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) as plantation best practices, water, climate change, livelihoods, and entrepreneurship. Over 138,415 people in the plantations are expected to benefit from the programs.</p><p>Winning the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 is considered a top honour in the Sri Lankan corporate field. Each year, submissions are evaluated by an eminent panel of local experts, thought leaders, and academics. The tea company further won category awards for Customer Relations, Environment Beyond the Business, and was chosen as one of the Top 10 Corporate Citizens of Sri Lanka.</p><p>It was also a proud parent moment for Dilmah as Rainforest Eco Lodge, a venture initiated by the company, was awarded Certificate of Merit for Best Sustainability Projects. Dilmah considers receiving Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 an important milestone in its journey as a truly sustainable brand with a purpose</p><p>beyond profit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM2504202100153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62J3-VNS1-F00C-63R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 25, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000834W</classCode><className>BEST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS453998 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS STORE RETAILERS (EXCEPT TOBACCO STORES)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BEST (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Initiative &amp;

It will be held by President Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister, in the next two years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile in a curtain raiser interview yesterday ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa said that not only the energy crisis but also the food crisis and COVID 19 threat still existed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\" ADB has tried to respond to these new challenges through various measures and we will continue to provide ordinary project financing, policy-based loans, budget financing for private sector and quite recently we have enhanced one of our existing financial instrument called CSF which would provide emergency financing to support DMCs to expand their countercyclical fiscal expenditure to mitigate the shocks coming from external events like food security and so on. Those are the short term measures but in the long term we are reviewing our projects in our pipeline for DMCs to see how we can support our DMCs to build very strong, robust and sustainable food systems through climate - smart agriculture, digitalization of the food value chains and nature based solutions, he said.</p><p>Developing Asia experienced a negative economic growth rate of negative 0.8% in 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic and it was the first economic contraction which happened in this area for the last 60 years. In 2021 it rebounded to 6.9% and this year 2022, ADB projects 4.3%. The reason for the rebound last year includes a couple of things. First the very mild health impact of the Omicron variant, second, progress in vaccination in this area and third very robust, strong performance of exports throughout this region. However, the space to recover varies among economies and remains very uneven among economies.</p><p>\"So we have to bear in mind four possible downside risks to the economic outlook of this region. First, the slowing down of China's economy due to the very stringent zero-COVID policy and second, there is still a possibility of emergence of a more lethal COVID 19 variant. Thirdly, the economic negative impact caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And fourthly, instability in the financial market due to the very aggressive rapid monetary policy normalization by some advanced economies. The Omicron outbreaks have been very short-lived in general and milder than the previous waves. Actually the number of COVID 19 in this region has dramatically dropped, declined. ADB also responded very quickly to this pandemic. In April 2020, we announced a US$ 20 billion COVID 19 comprehensive assistance package. Also in December the same year 2020 we announced an additional financial instrument for procurement of vaccines by developing member countries with the amount of USD 9 billion. So far we have committed USD 33 billion to support our DMCs to fight against the COVID 19 pandemic. Out of this USD 33 billion, USD 10 billion was for very quick disbursing budget financing called CPRO and USD 8 billion was for private sector financing, including very short-term trade financing. And USD 4 bn was for vaccine financing.</p><p>\"We are not completely out of the woods so we will continue providing those budget financing and private sector financing and also vaccine financing in addition to the ordinary project financing as necessary. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has posed a very serious risk to the economic outlook to this region. There are two kinds of risks; one is direct impact and indirect impact. Direct impact through trade, capital transactions with Russia and also remittance coming from Russia has been relatively limited to developing Asia as a whole except for a couple of countries in Central Asia, Caucasus and Mongolia who have traditionally maintained a very close trade and economic linkage with the Russian Federation.</p><p>On the other hand, the indirect impact and indirect risk has been locked through a very steep price increase in food and energy. I am quite sure importers, import countries of food and energy will see this year's import bills. Much more expensive than last year's, which means adding inflationary pressure on the economy.\"</p><p>Asakawa said that a number of central banks in this region have already started increasing policy interest rates to quell the inflation pressure which would add additional constraints on economic growth prospects of this region. Also indirect impact includes the deterioration of market sentiment which would depress consumers', producers', and investor confidence. So fighting for safety and tighter financial conditions globally might spur some sort of capital outflow movement from this region.</p><p>Together with the steep increase in food prices, the possible reduction of fertilizer supply by Russia would have a significant impact on the agriculture production of this region as well.</p><p>This has become a serious concern in terms of food security so this is exacerbating the already challenging situation due to the economic fallout of COVID 19 some political unrest notably in Afghanistan and Myanmar and droughts and other adverse weather events linked to climate change. He said the fight against climate change in this region will be won or lost and they have made important decisions on climate financing.</p><p>ADB has elevated their ambition from USD 80 billion to USD 100 billion of cumulative climate financing from 2019 to 2030. The commitment of USD 100 billion over 12 years is a big challenge for the ADB. \"We revised ADBs so-called energy policy which was very old. Under the new energy policy we officially decided to withdraw our financing for any new coal-fired power plants.</p><p>He also said they would use Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) to retire already existing coal plants and unlock investment in renewable energy so that they can promote the smooth transition from coal to renewable energy in each country. Due to the long lasting and low interest rate environment and also fiscal expansion to deal with the COVID 19 pandemic in almost every country the fiscal situation got worse. The time would thereby come for every country to change gear from fiscal expansion to fiscal consolidation. In that sense domestic resource mobilization (DRM) is very important. This means how to raise domestic tax revenue.</p><p>He said that globalization will come back and regional cooperation needs to be tightened up in trade and investment and despite the border closure and travel restraints introduced during the COVID period countries in the region have reopened and reconnected already. Another good example is the signing of the RCEP in November 2020 which has come into effect from January 2022.

Urban areas are currently home to 4.2 billion people, and urban populations expected to grow by an additional 2.5 billion people by 2050. All regions of the world are expected to urbanise throughout the next decades, but urbanisation is likely to be faster and include larger numbers of people in developing countries, particularly in the African and Asian region. South Asia, to which Sri Lanka belongs, is projected to be the second most rapidly urbanising region in the world behind Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As centres of population and human activity, cities are responsible for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions, which makes them critical contributors to climate change. For this reason, shaping the future of cities is central to solving the global climate crisis as well as to address biodiversity loss and the need for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Cities can reduce emissions and help mitigate climate change-for example through their infrastructure, the transport sector, buildings, energy usage, commercial activity, industry etc.-, but they can also enhance adaptive capacities of billions of people by providing them with the tools and enabling environment to better withstand climate change.</p><p>Cities as climate hotspots</p><p>Urban areas are potential catalysts for climate action, but they are also exposed and vulnerable to climate-related hazards and a multitude of short- and long-term impacts. For example, heat waves and heat stress, heavy rains, floods, storms, wildfires, and high winds already threaten cities around the world, while long-term processes such as sea level rise or water scarcity are expected to further affect urban areas throughout the 21st century.</p><p>This interconnection between cities and climate change is increasingly acknowledged in scientific literature and key global reports. For instance, climate change is prominently featured in the World Cities Report 2022 published by UN-Habitat, while the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has dedicated a separate chapter on cities and human settlements in its latest assessment report (AR6).</p><p>The IPCC report highlights that 'in all cities and urban areas, the risk faced by people and assets from hazards associated with climate change has increased,' disrupting infrastructure and essential services as well as the links between urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. The IPCC report outlines that globally, 'the most rapid growth in urban vulnerability and exposure has been in cities and settlements where adaptive capacity is limited-especially in unplanned and informal settlements in low- and middle-income nations and in smaller and medium-sized urban centres.'</p><p>How cities manage these growing climate risks and protect especially their most vulnerable population groups will make a crucial difference going forward. Factors such as governance capacity, financial support, awareness, and available technology play a role for this response, but also social and cultural factors, skill-building, entrepreneurship, welcoming migrants, dealing with legacy infrastructure and its constraints, harnessing innovation, and integrating natural ecosystems into urban planning and development.</p><p>Merging urban and natural ecosystems</p><p>Urban areas can be seen as artificial ecosystems of their own which are characterized by complex systems of human interaction, employment, supply and value chains, markets, infrastructure, services, transport, communication, sanitation, water management, food provision, storage, and many other elements. However, they are also connected to the natural environment and non-human ecosystems, for example forests, urban wetlands, rivers and estuaries, lakes, beaches, or parks.</p><p>These ecosystems provide a multitude of services that can make a key difference in quality of life, human wellbeing, and climate or disaster risk reduction. For one, air and water quality can be significantly improved by wetlands, trees, and green spaces inside an urban area. Furthermore, natural ecosystems can provide provisioning services, regulate other aspects of the environment, and serve as sites for recreational activities or tourism. They also have the potential to protect human communities, infrastructure, and assets from disaster events and unexpected shocks-such as floods or storms-and reduce coastal erosion and land degradation. Finally, they can also serve as habitats for biodiversity and urban wildlife, especially in tropical countries such as Sri Lanka.</p><p>The IPCC report refers to evidence from cities around the world, including Colombo, on the effectiveness of risk reduction through zoning and land use to 'protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect.' This highlights the fact that green infrastructure offers many benefits and can make cities not only more liveable and beautiful, but also safer and more prosperous.</p><p>Building resilient and adaptative cities</p><p>In contexts of crisis and difficulty, cities have the potential to turn into engines of growth and recovery. They offer a way for people to come together, connect, and engage in collective efforts that can reap social, economic, and environmental benefits if planned and managed properly. Cities can breed innovation and climate solutions, including nature-based solutions and 'grey' infrastructure, but also solutions related to start-up ecosystems, education opportunities, frontier technologies, and capacity-building.</p><p>Cities tend to attract migrants from rural areas, but these migrants often end up settling into informal and unplanned ways that expose them to climate, health, and security risks. However, if migrants can be integrated into the fabric of the urban centre-with access to infrastructure, services, utilities, social protection, employment, and skills development-, they have the potential to enhance adaptation by making economic, social, and cultural contributions and strengthen rural-urban linkages that can make the entire region more resilient.</p><p>Transforming cities to become more climate-resilient and adapt to the current and projected impacts of climate change presents a key challenge for the 21st century. Climate-related disasters and long-term impacts will put millions at risk, including the most vulnerable population groups. However, if cities incorporate the range of available solutions into urban planning processes and focus on sustainable, climate-smart, and resilient development pathways, they can turn this challenge into an opportunity and thrive in the age of climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT08072022000548</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65WF-JYF1-JCH9-G162-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1112\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>July 8, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>Wetlands Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY2NjI1NjQ3Qzk2NDE5NzlGQjFDNTkzQjg5QTAyMkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001779</classCode><className>URBANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

Key considerations towards this goal include entrepreneurship support, sustainability, climate resilience, risk management, and making progress towards both climate targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Entrepreneurship, sustainability and green growth</p><p>Economic development, diversification, and transformation are needed for Sri Lanka to deal with the acute crises and risks the country faces. Actions towards these goals should happen at all levels, from the local to the national and from macroeconomic policies towards smallholder livelihoods and start-up support. In addition, such actions can greatly benefit from aligning with global climate processes, national climate commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the United Nation's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>The SDGs acknowledge that ending poverty, climate action, and biodiversity conservation must go hand-in-hand with spurring economic growth, improving health and education, and reducing inequalities. This holistic approach and its key principles are relevant for start-ups as well as corporations, and they should permeate all business decisions to guarantee future-proof development that connects to global trends and builds on their momentum.</p><p>Entrepreneurship today needs to be conscious of the need for sustainability and green growth. Throughout all aspects of a business-such as product design, operations, packaging, transport, or marketing-, principles of sustainability should be applied to reduce environmental footprints and resource use. There are opportunities to capitalise on the need for transformation and invest in sectors such as renewable energy, clean technology, alternative forms of mobility, waste management, digitalisation, frontier technologies, and more efficient business practices and methods. The rise of new sectors presents a chance to invest in relevant skills and capacities to foster innovation and paradigm-changing solutions.</p><p>With targeted capacity-building and support, entrepreneurs and start-ups across the country can contribute to sustainable economic recovery and diversification. Particularly in rural areas, entrepreneurship can be enhanced by fostering an enabling environment and start-up ecosystem, including institutional arrangements and policies, facilitating social dialogue, investing in skills development, training, and re-training, providing infrastructure and seed funding, and investing in social protection schemes that provide safety for workers, their families, and communities at large.</p><p>Climate resilience and mainstreaming risk management</p><p>In addition to sustainability, any business-from start-up to large enterprise-needs to acknowledge the complex landscape of risks in the current environment. This includes market-related and economic risks, but also risks related to the ongoing climate crisis, environmental degradation, and disaster events. If businesses are aware of risks, they can mainstream comprehensive risk management into their planning processes and ensure that they are resistant to shocks, incorporate climate considerations, and utilise the full range of risk management instruments.</p><p>Risk management and resilience-building should be key components of an economic transition, enabling Sri Lanka to withstand impacts and adapt to environmental changes. This includes physical infrastructure and technological solutions, but also climate-informed planning, risk analytics, ecosystem conservation and nature-based solutions, adjustments to the policy landscape, capacity-building of institutions and the workforce, insurance and social protection schemes, and a variety of other interventions.</p><p>In short, entrepreneurs, established businesses, government institutions, and other relevant entities need to act in risk-informed ways that adapt both to a changing climate and the reality of other risks and impacts. By learning from science and experience, risks can be avoided, reduced, or turned into opportunities, for example by adopting innovative practices, new technologies, or connecting traditional and modern knowledge.</p><p>Linking SDGs and climate-smart development</p><p>Research suggests that climate action has the potential to reinforce all seventeen SDGs, while a failure to act decisively on climate will likely undermine SDG achievements. If economic development and building back better are aligned with both climate action and sustainable development, they can therefore develop strong synergies and avoid negative feedback loops.</p><p>Linking climate change and sustainable development also offers an opportunity to leverage additional funding and tap available sources of climate finance. As one of the key focus areas of the global finance discussion, climate finance is available both for mitigation (actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation, which covers measures to adjust a country's systems and economy to be more resilient and thriving even in unprecedented environmental and climatic conditions.</p><p>As of now, developed countries have not yet managed to live up to their global commitments under the Paris Agreement, which include raising $ 100 billion per year in finance for mitigation and adaptation. However, there is a significant amount of funding available from different sources to address climate change, with tracked climate finance around the world estimated to have increased by 60% since 2013/2014.</p><p>It may seem a daunting task to address climate change and the need for sustainable development while being confronted with severe challenges to the national economy, including the impacts of COVID-19 and global supply chain issues. However, combining economic recovery with climate-smart planning, resilience-building, and progress towards the SDGs it more than a necessity: it also makes a strong business case, both in terms of unlocking additional finance and of the long-term return of investment for profit, people, and the planet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT29042022000549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65BS-78N1-F00C-64DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 29, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DRAQ</classCode><className>GREEN GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X0S</classCode><className>ECONOMIC RECOVERY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DREL</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Currently, residents of 16 estates in Kahawatte plantation, 16 estates in Talawakele plantation, 13 estates in Elpitiya plantations, and Dunkeld Estate have benefited from initiatives related to healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and education. The Dilmah Plantation action plan for 2021-2025 is a Rs. 200 million initiative embracing education, entrepreneurship, climate resilience, nutrition, childcare amongst other areas, the company said in a media release.</p><p>Winning the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 is considered a top honour in the Sri Lankan corporate field. The tea company further won category awards for Customer Relations, Environment Beyond the Business, and was chosen as one of the Top 10 Corporate Citizens of Sri Lanka. It was also a proud parent moment for Dilmah as Rainforest Eco Lodge, a venture initiated by the company, was awarded Certificate of Merit for Best Sustainability Projects.</p><p>To ensure that economic, social, and environmental sustainability exists at the heart of its operations, Dilmah established the Merrill J Fernando Charitable Foundation (MJF Foundation) and Dilmah Conservation to drive life-impacting initiatives ('Purpose Beyond Profit' is a free e-book, giving an overview of the overwhelming impact made through the two organisations),</p><p>The MJF Foundation works directly with estate workers and underprivileged communities to uplift lives and empowers them to pay-it-forward to their communities. The Foundation has improved the quality of life for plantation workers, residents, and the surrounding communities by establishing new housing, medical centres, and care for the entire resident population of the estates, pre-schools at 63 Child Development Centres, after-school programmes, and nutrition programmes.</p><p>The release said that the 2021-2025 Dilmah Plantation Action plan will revive the plantation community in 16 estates that form a part of primarily Dilmah-owned Kahawatte Plantations, Talawakelle, and Elpitiya Plantations. The action plan will bear a holistic framework aimed at elevating the community members' physical, mental, and emotional well-being and socio-economic status. The areas of focus are gender and women, youth, education, health and well-being, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), climate-smart agriculture including agroforestry, adopting Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) as plantation best practices, water, climate change, livelihoods, and entrepreneurship. Over 138,415 people in the plantations are expected to benefit from the programmes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1104202100096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DV-VBH1-F00C-63W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 11, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000834W</classCode><className>BEST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS453998 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS STORE RETAILERS (EXCEPT TOBACCO STORES)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>BEST (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp;

The contentious issues with land we face today can be addressed whilst protecting natures bounties, if we act accordingly, together.</p><p>\"Building on the pilot project launched in 2015 by the MoE and UNDP to protect ESAs from the threats that they face, the policy will guide to designate an Environmentally Sensitive Area based on the best scientific data available and consideration of the economic and any other relevant impact of such designation.Highlighting UNDP's role, Robert Juhkam, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, \"The ESA policy ensures that communities are a part of economic growth without compromising environmental conservation.</p><p> A blueprint to the innovative public-private-community partnerships that underpin the much-needed paradigm shift, to support and encourage stewardship and innovation in green growth, while raising awareness to enable the pursuit of economic growth in balance with the planet for Sustainable Development.\"Sharing her insights on the concept of ESA in Sri Lanka, Prof.</p><p> Sevvandi Jayakody of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka stated, \"The balanced decision making about land comes only through acute investigation of what value it possess, what potential it holds and how strategic we are in utilising them with due diligence for both values and users. That's the process the ESA Policy tries to bring in.</p><p> \"The policy will aim to create enabling platforms at all levels for a participatory and conscious decision-making process for the public and private sector, and communities in land use planning and sustainable land management in ESAs.Speaking on the significance of the 'Environmentally Sensitive Areas' in conserving biodiversity outside the 'Protected Areas' in Sri Lanka, Somarathne Vidanapathirana, Secretary, Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation stated, \"All significant biodiversity are not within the Protected Areas.</p><p> Therefore, the ESAs are the alternative and most effective approach that can be used to conserve andmanage biodiversity outside protected areas scattered around the country.\"Further, adding on the strategic importance of land use planning in environmental conservation and ensuring resilient communities and development, R.</p><p>.A.</p><p>K.

When first created by the Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in late 1993, December 29 (the date of entry into force of the Convention of Biological Diversity), was designated The International Day for Biological Diversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In December 2000, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted May 22 as the IDB, to commemorate the adoption of the text of the Convention on May 22, 1992 by the Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity. This was partly done because it was difficult for many countries to plan and carry out suitable celebrations for the date of December 29, given the number of holidays that coincide around that time of year. Sri Lanka, one of the world's best-known biodiversity hotspots, also marks the day every year.</p><p>UN Biodiversity conference</p><p>The Biodiversity Day 2022 slogan is \"Building a shared future for all life\". The slogan was chosen to continue building momentum and support for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework to be adopted at the upcoming UN Biodiversity Conference.</p><p>Biodiversity remains the answer to several sustainable development challenges. From nature-based solutions to climate, health issues, food and water security, and sustainable livelihoods, biodiversity is the foundation upon which we can build back better.</p><p>But why should we care about biodiversity? There is no doubt that the planet is facing its greatest crisis. Global warming may lead to a major upheaval on Planet Earth. In other words, many species are vanishing before our very eyes.</p><p>Today, the rate of species extinction may be 1,000 times higher than the natural background rate. In fact, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that Nearly 30 percent of the 138,374 species assessed for its survival watchlist are now at risk of vanishing in the wild forever, as the destructive impact of human activity on the natural world deepens. UN's biodiversity experts have warned that a million species are on the brink of extinction - raising the spectre that the planet is on the verge of its sixth mass extinction event in 500 million years.</p><p>Rapid degradation of ecosystems</p><p>Recent surveys reveal that 21 percent of all known mammals, 30 percent of all known amphibians, 12 percent of all known birds, and 28 per-cent of reptiles, 37 per cent of freshwater fishes, 70 per cent of plants, 35 percent of invertebrates assessed so far are under threat.</p><p>The goal of halting the loss of biodiversity is the subject of several key international agreements. Each recognises the rapid degradation of ecosystems and habitats, the increasing threat to many species populations and the urgent need to take action that will halt the decline in irreplaceable natural resources. The main target is \"to achieve a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss\" and the one addressed at EU and Pan-European level is even more ambitious as to \"halt the loss of biodiversity\".</p><p>Red List assessments</p><p>There are some encouraging results in this regard. The latest update of the IUCN Red List for Threatened Species also highlights the potential for restoration, with four commercially fished tuna species pulling back from a slide towards extinction after a decade of efforts to curb overexploitation. The most spectacular recovery was seen in the Atlantic bluefin tuna, which leapt from \"endangered\" across three categories to the safe zone of \"least concern.\" \"These Red List assessments demonstrate just how closely our lives and livelihoods are intertwined with biodiversity,\" IUCN Director General Bruno Oberle said in a statement.</p><p>\"Humans are part of nature's rich diversity and have the power to protect or destroy it,\" says the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is hosted by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p>Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, is essential to sustaining the living networks and systems that provide us all with health, wealth, food, fuel and the vital services our lives depend on. Human activity is causing the diversity of life on Earth to be lost at a greatly accelerated rate. These losses are sometimes irreversible, impoverish us all and damage the life support systems we rely on every day. But we can prevent them to a great extent.</p><p>That is the message that activists hope to spread this year. The loss of biodiversity can be prevented if corrective action is taken early.</p><p>We must remember that the world's diverse ecosystems purify the air and the water that are the basis of life, stabilize and moderate the Earth's climate, renew soil fertility, cycle nutrients and pollinate plants.</p><p>But is there anything we can do to save our planet and hence, biodiversity? The goal is to prevent global warming, which has a direct effect on biodiversity. Here, according to the UN, are some of the things you can do to save the world:</p><p>Remedies</p><p>Take public transport, bike, walk, or carpool to work (or other destination) at least one day a week. Avoid air travel where possible; Buy food, preferably organic food-vegetables, fruits, dairy, eggs, and meat-from a village fair, not a supermarket; Eat sustainably harvested seafood and farmed fish that are herbivorous; Install LED light bulbs in your home-it will save electricity and replacement bulb costs each year, and reduce carbon emissions by a ton every three years; Turn off lights in empty rooms; Stop using chemical herbicides and pesticides where possible; Tell everyone what you are doing to conserve biodiversity and ask them to join you. Support people's representatives who act for biodiversity. Above all, buy an consume only what you really need, and re-use and re-cycle whatever and whenever you can.</p><p>It is not only the UN, Governments and international wildlife/conservation organisations that should work to protect biodiversity.</p><p>People too can participate in this process by caring for Life and Nature at all times. We owe it to Planet Earth, our only home. We may go in search of other habitable planets in our and other galaxies thousands of years from now, but until then, let us protect the one we are already in with an all-out effort</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Management of the environment, its natural resources and biodiversity is vital in achieving sustainable development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Population pressure, increasing demand on natural resources, absence of environmentally sensitive development planning, practices and infrastructure, environmental pollution and illegal trades are among the major contributors for depletion of natural resources and decline of biodiversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this scenario, Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) require special protection as they are environmentally, ecologically, economically and socially significant in ensuring the resilience of communities and economies for long-term sustainable development.</p><p>To this end, a new National Policy on Environmentally Sensitive Areas in Sri Lanka is being launched, spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment, with the development and formulation of the policy supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). To introduce the new ESA policy and highlight the way forward for Sri Lanka, a virtual media briefing was held this morning in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Mass Media, as a part of its ongoing high-level Sustainable Development Discussion series organised by the Media Centre for National Development.</p><p>Speaking at the high-level forum, Ministry of Environment Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe stated, 'The ESA Policy addresses the need for dealing with the natural capital outside the formal protected areas system, which is key for the prosperity and future of this country, by aligning the rightful owners for decision making with regards to land. The contentious issues with land we face today can be addressed whilst protecting natures bounties, if we act accordingly, together.'</p><p>Building on the pilot project launched in 2015 by the MoE and UNDP to protect ESAs from the threats that they face, the policy shall guide to designate an Environmentally Sensitive Area based on the best scientific data available and consideration of the economic and any other relevant impact of such designation.</p><p>Highlighting UNDP's role, UNDP in Sri Lanka Resident Representative Robert Juhkam stated, 'The ESA policy ensures that communities are a part of economic growth without compromising environmental conservation. A blueprint to the innovative public-private-community partnerships that underpin the much-needed paradigm shift, to support and encourage stewardship and innovation in green growth, while raising awareness to enable the pursuit of economic growth in balance with the planet for Sustainable Development.'</p><p>Sharing her insights on the concept of ESA in Sri Lanka, Prof. Sevvandi Jayakody of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka stated, 'The balanced decision making about land comes only through acute investigation of what value it possesses, what potential it holds and how strategic we are in utilising them with due diligence for both values and users. That's the process the ESA Policy tries to bring in.'</p><p>The policy will aim to create enabling platforms at all levels for a participatory and conscious decision-making process for the public and private sector, and communities in land use planning and sustainable land management in ESAs.</p><p>Speaking on the significance of the 'Environmentally Sensitive Areas' in conserving biodiversity outside the 'Protected Areas' in Sri Lanka, Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation Secretary Somarathne Vidanapathirana stated, 'All significant biodiversity is not within the Protected Areas. Therefore, the ESAs are the alternative and most effective approach that can be used to conserve and manage biodiversity outside protected areas scattered around the country.'</p><p>Further, adding on the strategic importance of land use planning in environmental conservation and ensuring resilient communities and development, Ministry of Land Secretary R.A.A.K. Ranawaka stated, 'ESAs are about land management, which has been recognised by the Land Use Policy in 2007. The ESAs reduce pressure on land by balancing interest in biodiversity, development and resilient communities through consensus land management.'</p><p>The ESA policy will suggest nature-based solutions to enhance the integrity of conservation, resilience to climate change, and wise use of natural capital for development in Sri Lanka. The draft ESA policy is set to be rolled out by November 2021 following the approval from the Cabinet of Ministers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT030920210008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63HV-01M1-JCH9-G1CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 3, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Man belongs to the earth. Man has not woven the net of life: he is just a thread in it. Everything he does to this net he does to himself. What befalls the earth will befall the sons of the earth. We know this. All things are bound up in each other like the blood that binds the family.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Continue to contaminate your bed, and you will one night suffocate in your own waste. When the buffalo are all slaughtered, the wild horses all tamed, the secret corners of the forest heavy with the scent of many men, and the view of the ripe hills blotted by the talking wires, where is the thicket? Gone. Where is the eagle? Gone. And what is it to say goodbye to the swift and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Extracts from the widely acclaimed letter by Native American Chief Seattle of the Duwamish Tribe to United States President Franklin Pierce in 1855, in response to an offer to purchase the Dwamish lands in the North East of the US, currently Washington State.</p><p>Waking up to the natural melodies coming from the chirps of the birds and to a picturesque landscape is a fortune that not many city dwellers around the world can boast of. However, this is what most of the residents in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, the administrative capital, and surrounding wetland areas still enjoy each morning, despite living in a highly urbanized setting. Of course, not all of them understand and appreciate that Nature's gift.</p><p>The Salalihini Sandeshaya by Ven. Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, a historic piece of Sinhala literature, also depicts the beauty of these environs in a bird's-eye view. This epic poem was written during the time of King Parakramabahu VI. The Kingdom of Kotte, which flourished in the 15th Century, was naturally protected by its wetlands.</p><p>\"We are living in a very unique city, but we are not very conscious about the environment around us. From every breath we take to every rupee we earn, we are dependent on the environment surrounding us,\" Dr. Chethika Gunasiri, an Environmental Scientist at the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation (SLLDC), emphasized at the outset of her recent lecture titled 'Living in the only wetland capital in the world' at BMICH in Colombo. It was organised by the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) parallel to the World Wetlands Day which falls on February 2.</p><p>In her one-hour long thought-provoking speech, she underlined the major role played by urban wetlands to make the city liveable and resilient, and the challenges to their conservation.</p><p>When the cities are expanding, the urban wetlands are the first to be compromised. A study has found out that the wetlands in Colombo had shrunk by 40 percent from 1980s to 2014. We are losing the pristine wetlands at an annual rate of 1.2 percent. If this rate is continued, the consequences will be dire for all humans and animals in the city, including future generations.</p><p>Ramsar Wetland City</p><p>The natural landscape of Colombo is a low lying area filled with marshes and it is crisscrossed with man-made canals and lakes. Today, even after decades of rapid development and degradation, there are about 36 interconnected wetland patches in this mosaic, which is called the Colombo Wetland Complex (CWC) or the Colombo catchment. They cover an area of about 19 square kilometres out of the 121.5 square kilometres of the Colombo Metropolitan Region. Noteworthy, it provides a 50 percent contribution to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and has more than 2.3 million residents.</p><p>\"If the Colombo catchment is divided into three areas, the downstream, which is closer to the West coast, has no wetlands. The middle area is a retention area and houses all big wetlands such as the Kolonnawa, Heen-Ela and Kotte wetlands, Parliament Lake, Diyasaru Park and Kimbulawala Walk Way. It stores 37 percent of rainwater coming to this hydrological area. Upper side of the catchment consists mainly of paddy fields. The water coming into this area is diverting to neighbouring catchments,\" Dr. Gunasiri explained.</p><p>Colombo was among the first 18 cities the Ramsar Secretariat officially accredited as wetland cities in 2018. Dr. Gunasiri, who was a team member that prepared the Colombo Wetland Management Strategy and the application for the Ramsar Wetland City Accreditation for the Colombo City, thanked all the stakeholders who contributed to that landmark achievement as a country.</p><p>\"Colombo was the only capital city to get that title. Colombo City was re-branded and internationally recognized as a wetland city with this accreditation. Another 25 cities received this title in the last Conference of the Parties (COP) held in Geneva in November 2022. Altogether 43 cities have now been accredited as Ramsar Wetland Cities. These cities serve as examples and inspire deliberate actions for other cities toward sustainable urbanization,\" she added.</p><p>The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in the Iranian City of Ramsar, is the intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. As of now, 172 countries are signatory to it, and Sri Lanka became a part of it in 1992.</p><p>Natural sponge</p><p>A wetland is an ecosystem that comes in between a terrestrial ecosystem and deep water aquatic ecosystem. It is an intermediary stage. The main component of a wetland is water, and this water can be in different forms. The Ramsar Convention defines wetlands as \"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres\".</p><p>\"Wetlands usually have shallow water bodies, and because of that, they support a lot of biogeochemical cycles. That is the reason why wetlands are considered the most productive ecosystems in the world. Humans are strongly connected with them because they provide a lot of ecosystem benefits and services,\" Dr. Gunasiri expounded.</p><p>Serving as flood retention areas is a known function of wetlands. \"They act as natural sponges and protect the city from floods. The wetland soil, which is called hydric soil, has a high amount of clay and can absorb a lot of water. This is important as cities have a lot of impermeable surfaces,\" she observed.</p><p>Her lecture underlined that Colombo wetlands save Rs 15 billion every year through flood control. Colombo is vulnerable to floods, and the devastative flood event in 2010, during which even the Parliament Complex went under water, was an eye opener for the authorities as well as the public on the importance of conserving the remaining wetland patches, which are also the only green patches in the city.</p><p>\"This flood event transformed the way we looked at the Colombo Wetland Management. The Metro Colombo Urban Development Project, which primarily focused on hydrological solutions to the floods, started in 2012. The Wetland Management Division was established in the SLLDC in 2013. The Colombo Metropolitan Region Wetland Management Strategy, the first strategic document for the wise use of urban wetlands, came up (2013-2016), and wetland-based urban recreational and agriculture projects were actively started,\" she recalled.</p><p>More benefits</p><p>\"Wetlands are also considered as Nature's kidneys. As same as kidneys purify the blood, the wetland plants (reeds and floating vegetation) and the soil, in a process called phytoremediation, absorb toxic materials from water and convert them to non-toxic materials through a chemical process, and purifies the water,\" she elucidated, reminding that this function is of great importance as the water pollution is quite high in cities.</p><p>Touching on the financial aspect, she pointed out that the urban wetlands save Rs. 2 billion per year by cleaning polluted water.</p><p>Dr. Gunasiri drew the attention of the audience to the waste water problem in the Colombo Wetland Complex due to the mushrooming number of condominiums.</p><p>\"The horizontal expansion of Colombo is over now as there is no more space. We have started expanding it vertically with high rise buildings and condominiums. It does both good and bad. Sri Lanka does not have a sophisticated waste water management system. When the condominiums increase in number, a lot of people settle down in a small space, and the amount of waste water they produce is high. Though many are not yet aware about it, this is one of the biggest problems that we are going to face in the future,\" she noted.</p><p>Another important function of these ecosystems is that they cool the cities and help control temperature, thus making the cities more comfortable for humans and all other living beings. In that way, they also help save electricity used for air conditioning.</p><p>The Environmental Scientist pointed out that urban wetlands act as wildlife refuges, and because of that, they have high levels of biodiversity. Colombo wetlands are home to 277 animal species and 285 plant species, including many endemic and vulnerable species. For example, Colombo is the only city in the world where an urban fishing cat population is found.</p><p>In addition, she explained that urban wetland habitats are important for food security as 87 percent of total wetlands provide food for the citizens in Colombo. Moreover, these wetlands add aesthetic beauty to the city, and have a recreational value. Dr. Gunasiri brought up in her lecture that the country can generate at least Rs. 1.6 billion per year from recreation and tourism in these wetlands.</p><p>She observed the jogging tracks and parks in these areas serve two purposes. Firstly, they help improve the health of the people, and secondly, they bring people closer to the wetlands, enabling them to understand and appreciate their value. She mentioned that it was also a strategy to stop further encroachment of these areas.</p><p>Challenges</p><p>Garbage dumping, land filling and human encroachments have become common problems to the urban wetlands.</p><p>\"With the construction of the Parliament Complex in Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, a lot of developments and settlements started around this area, and a lot of marshes and paddy fields were cleared. In 1991, in order to protect that area from floods, 1,000 acres of marshes and active paddy fields around Parliament were acquired by the Government as flood retention areas. Those mainly included Kolonnawa, Kotte and Heen-Ela wetlands and Parliament upper retention area.</p><p>\"Recently, the Government re-demarcated those wetlands, and at that point it could be seen that some boundaries were going in the middle of home gardens, and sometimes even living rooms. That much of encroachment has happened in the last three decades,\" the environmental professional underscored.</p><p>The sensitive ecosystems of wetlands are heavily disturbed and destroyed due to garbage dumping. \"Even in highly managed public places such as jogging tracks and wetland parks, littering has become an issue. In some countries, people do not throw their litter until they find a dustbin, but our people are not like that. I admit that in some places garbage bins are not properly kept, but sometimes, even the dustbin is there, but the litter is out of the dustbin,\" she commented, adding that correcting such behaviours must happen from the school level.</p><p>She highlighted that alien invasive species pose a biological threat to Colombo wetlands. For example, she said that, the canal in Kolonnawa is covered with Water Hyacinth ('Japan Jabara'), the canal in the Diyasaru Park is covered with Salvinia and most of the wetlands in Colombo are covered with Pond Apple or 'Wel Atha'. Pond Apple has become a problem as it is making wetlands more terrestrial, negatively influencing functions of wetlands like water retention. Its removal has been difficult because the wildlife has adapted to it.</p><p>She also drew the attention of the audience that various Government agencies, such as the Urban Development Authority, Department of Wildlife and the SLLDC, own various parts of the CWC, and bringing them all to one table for decision making has become challenging.</p><p>Role of citizenry</p><p>Commenting on the issue of pollution of Beira Lake in the heart of Colombo, she said the major sewerage lines that discharge wastewater to the Lake have already been identified and stopped. \"This issue has been there for many decades now, and it has to be addressed with multiple solutions. We often come across new proposals in that regard and pilot studies have been conducted for them, but the main constraint in going into the mass scale is that they are not economically viable. The recent floating wetlands project has made some positive impact. We have to be careful that any solution that we implement does not negatively affect the many offices, hotels and business places around it,\" she added.</p><p>\"After all, Colombo is our Capital City and we cannot stop development. Both development and Nature have to go hand in hand. To achieve this end, we have to think of using urban wetlands as nature-based solutions for the environmental problems in the city. A lot of countries are using similar concepts,\" she said, commenting on the future management of Colombo wetlands.</p><p>Responding to a question by the audience on high profile interventions and political interventions that hamper the wetland protection, she admitted that they are a pressure to be reckoned with. \"Because of the high land price, everybody wants to fill these lands and put them into commercial use. We too have to struggle at times to stop such activities. That is why public awareness is important. If the public can make a strong voice in opposition to such activities, that helps our task, because sometimes we cannot fight alone,\" she stressed.</p><p>Every tiny urban wetland patch that remains is important, and we all, in our personal as well as professional capacities, have a role to play for their protection, was the take home message of her well-articulated and well-organised lecture.</p><p>People come to the Beddagana Wetland Park for recreation.Colombo is vulnerable to floods.The Colombo Wetland Complex comprises many paddy fields.The wetland ecosystems are polluted due to haphazard dumping. These pictures were taken recently in the stretch between the Beddagana Wetland Park and the newly opened Rampart Wetland Park in Ethul Kotte.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

As highlighted by the leading international science body for climate change, the IPCC, the scale of climatic changes is vast, and every fraction of a degree of temperature rise has huge implications. The Paris Agreement, which has been adopted by 197 countries, aims to limit global warming (as compared to pre-industrial temperatures) to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally to 1.5 degrees. However, to achieve this target, urgent action on the global, regional, national, and local level is needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Already, climate-related events (such as floods, storms, droughts, or heat waves) and processes (such as sea level rise, soil degradation, and increasing pests and diseases) impact lives and livelihoods in Sri Lanka. Food systems, water resources, and the coastal sector are among the most vulnerable sectors, but climate change affects many other sectors as well, for example health, human settlements, infrastructure, ecosystems and biodiversity, forestry, tourism, industry, or SMEs.</p><p>Climate change not only causes direct losses and damages in these sectors but also exacerbates other risks and disasters, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, both climate change and COVID-19 present more than just challenges: they also open up a range of chances and opportunities for individuals, households, companies, and governments.</p><p>Sustainable and green development</p><p>Climate change raises pressure and incentives to transform economies and societies. Action can be taken on all levels to change production and consumption patterns and adopt more sustainable, climate- and nature-friendly systems, but it needs to be taken now.</p><p>Reducing environmental and climate footprints-that is, the use of natural resources such as water, but also the output of greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, or waste-is crucial to mitigate climate change and offers other important benefits as well. If households, companies, and countries improve their energy and resource use efficiency, invest in renewable energy sources, and turn their production systems cleaner, leaner, and less wasteful, it will render them more competitive, more productive, and less reliant on scarce resources. In addition, sustainable and green development will improve human health and wellbeing, ensure long-term survivability, and keep natural ecosystems and their services intact.</p><p>The global challenge of climate change also provides opportunities for sustainable, green, nature-positive, and socially responsible entrepreneurship on the national or local level in Sri Lanka. This includes entrepreneurship and start-ups focusing on renewable energy and clean tech, but also a much larger spectrum including food system innovation, sustainable fashion, ecotourism, holistic waste management, digitisation, re- or upcycling, and green finance.</p><p>Adaptation and resilience</p><p>As outlined in recent publications such as the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2021, climate-related risks, including the failure of climate action, are among the biggest threats to human survival and wellbeing worldwide. Climate risks are often complex, as they interact with other risks and vulnerabilities such as market risks or poverty and can affect large numbers of people at the same time.</p><p>Resilience is the ability to bounce back from shocks without losing everything. If a household, company, or country is climate-resilient, it can mobilise resources and recover from an unexpected event-a flood, a drought, the loss of a harvest-, for example through a budget reserve, a relief fund, an insurance scheme, or mutual cooperation. Through anticipatory planning, small investments (such as regular insurance premium payments) can prevent huge losses and make a significant difference. If resilience is strengthened, it can pay off not only against climate change but will be beneficial to deal with other shocks as well, including COVID-19 or market-related risks.</p><p>Science-based projections and probabilities for climatic changes are available for the years and decades to come. By investing in infrastructure, establishing risk management systems, and altering business practices now, companies and countries can adapt to these changes and position themselves to thrive under the anticipated new conditions. Adaptation measures can take many forms and incorporate ecosystems as well as social systems, ranging from more resistant infrastructure to better cultivation methods and nature-based solutions such as mangrove conservation or tree planting.</p><p>Building back better</p><p>Climate-related disasters continue to cause enormous losses and damages on a global scale, with the extreme weather events in 2021 alone causing hundreds of billions of USD in damages, not counting non-economic losses and impacts. With disasters like these becoming more frequent and intense, \"building back better\" could turn into a key principle. It recognises that the time following a disaster is an optimal period to make changes: to recover and reconstruct in a more resilient, sustainable way that will avoid a repeat of the same catastrophe in the future.</p><p>The \"building back better\" concept overlaps with adaptation and resilience-building but focuses on learning lessons from previous impacts to optimise the interventions taking place in the aftermath. This includes not only physical rebuilding but also adjustments to the enabling environment, such as policies, legal frameworks, guidelines, recovery packages, financial incentives, or subsidies, both within countries and through the international processes related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p>Looking forward</p><p>Climate change represents an immense challenge, but it also provides chances and possibilities. With proper support and enabling environment, entrepreneurs and start-ups can capitalise on the need for climate action and the business opportunities it unlocks. The transition toward sustainability, climate-friendliness, and green growth allows for the reconfiguration of policies, business practices, and infrastructure to render societies and economies more resilient, better adapted, and able to build back better in case of disasters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT14012022000512</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64J4-TMK1-F00C-63JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1038\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 14, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;

It is home to numerous threatened fish, amphibians, mammals, reptiles and birds including migratory birds.</p><p>With the DWC looking at restoring the 44.5 ha of degraded mangrove forest patches within the sanctuary, BSL is to take the lead in restoring up to 10 ha (25 acres), using accepted scientific principles.</p><p>Mangrove ecosystems provide critical services for the maintenance and wellbeing of biodiversity and are of equal importance to people living in the tropical belt through the ecosystem services that they provide and the options offered by them as livelihoods.</p><p>This is while mangroves play a significant role in fighting climate change as 'unique' and productive carbon sinks and by acting as a protective barrier for human settlements, against natural disasters resulting from increased global temperatures.</p><p>Explaining that carbon sequestration is a key aspect in mangroves, BSL's Programme Manager Roshan Salinda said that 'our efforts' would holistically look at the social, economic and environmental dynamics to derive other co-benefits as well.</p><p>'The project will contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Importantly, it will be designed and executed in keeping with the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Global Standards for Nature-based Solutions (NbS),' he said.</p><p>NbS are designed to address major challenges such as food security, climate change, water security, human health, disaster risk and social and economic development.</p><p>Mr. Salinda went onto give the objectives of 'LIFE to Our Mangroves' as: to enhance resilience and ecosystem services by the identified mangroves; to demonstrate the value of mangrove restoration as an NbS to address the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development challenges, building resilience and community readiness; and to showcase the value of partnership building in contributing towards the reduction of Sri Lanka's climate change vulnerability.</p><p>The first two years of the five-year project will focus on planning, forging community partnerships, land preparation, nursery establishment and planting activities and the years three to five on gap filling and maintenance.</p><p>A crucial feature is that the physical restoration of the site will be carried out by BSL with the technical support and logistical assistance of the DWC and communities in the area. BSL is to employ local field personnel to work with communities in the successful implementation of project activities. Goods and services, including labour and planting materials are to be procured as much as possible from local sources.</p><p>Meanwhile, the keynote speech titled 'Investing in biodiversity in a risk-prone world' was delivered by Environmental Economist Lucy Emerton who focused on the value of biodiversity and ecosystems, the economic and business return on investing in natural capital and the costs, losses and damages associated with failing to do so - including in relation to climate adaptation and mitigation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM2609202100095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63ST-KCP1-F00C-64WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 26, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000D2IF</classCode><className>CITIZENS DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS FINANCE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS522120 SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC6036 SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS, NOT FEDERALLY CHARTERED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>CDB (CSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001431</classCode><className>PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000900</classCode><className>TSUNAMIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Management of the environment, its natural resources and biodiversity is vital in achieving sustainable development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Population pressure, increasing demand on natural resources, absence of environmentally sensitive development planning, practices and infrastructure, environmental pollution and illegal trades are among the major contributors for depletion of natural resources and decline of biodiversity.</p><p>In this scenario, Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) require special protection as they are environmentally, ecologically, economically and socially significant in ensuring the resilience of communities and economies for long-term sustainable development.</p><p>To this end, a new National Policy on Environmentally Sensitive Areas in Sri Lanka is being launched, spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment, with the development and formulation of the policy supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka with funding from the Global Environment Facility (GEF).</p><p>To introduce the new ESA policy and highlight the way forward for Sri Lanka, a virtual media briefing was held this morning in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Mass Media, as a part of its ongoing high-level Sustainable Development Discussion series organized by the Media Centre for National Development.</p><p>Speaking at the high-level forum, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary, Ministry of Environment stated, \"The ESA Policy addresses the need for dealing with the natural capital outside the formal protected areas system, which is key for the prosperity and future of this country, by aligning the rightful owners for decision making with regards to land. The contentious issues with land we face today can be addressed whilst protecting nature's bounties, if we act accordingly, together.\"</p><p>Building on the pilot project launched in 2015 by the MoE and UNDP to protect ESAs from the threats that they face, the policy shall guide to designate an Environmentally Sensitive Area based on the best scientific data available and consideration of the economic and any other relevant impact of such designation.</p><p>Highlighting UNDP's role, Robert Juhkam, Resident Representative UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, \"The ESA policy ensures that communities are a part of economic growth without compromising environmental conservation. A blueprint to the innovative public-private-community partnerships that underpin the much-needed paradigm shift, to support and encourage stewardship and innovation in green growth, while raising awareness to enable the pursuit of economic growth in balance with the planet for Sustainable Development.\"</p><p>Sharing her insights on the concept of ESA in Sri Lanka, Prof. Sevvandi Jayakody of the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka stated, \"The balanced decision making about land comes only through acute investigation of what value it possess, what potential it holds and how strategic we are in utilising them with due diligence for both values and users. That's the process the ESA Policy tries to bring in.\"</p><p>The policy will aim to create enabling platforms at all levels for a participatory and conscious decision-making process for the public and private sector, and communities in land use planning and sustainable land management in ESAs. Speaking on the significance of the 'Environmentally Sensitive Areas' in conserving biodiversity outside the 'Protected Areas' in Sri Lanka, Somarathne Vidanapathirana, Secretary, Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation stated, \"All significant biodiversity are not within the Protected Areas. Therefore, the ESAs are the alternative and most effective approach that can be used to conserve and manage biodiversity outside protected areas scattered around the country. \"</p><p>Further, adding on the strategic importance of land use planning in environmental conservation and ensuring resilient communities and development, R.A.A.K. Ranawaka, Secretary, Ministry of Land stated, \"ESAs are about land management, which has been recognized by the Land Use Policy in 2007. The ESAs reduce pressure on land by balancing interest in biodiversity, development and resilient communities through consensus land management.\"</p><p>The ESA policy will suggest nature-based solutions to enhance the integrity of conservation, resilience to climate change, and wise use of natural capital for development in Sri Lanka. The draft ESA policy is set to be rolled out by November 2021 following the approval from the Cabinet of Ministers.</p><p>UNDP partners with people at all levels of society to help build nations that can withstand crisis, and drive and sustain the kind of growth that improves the quality of life for everyone. On the ground in 170 countries and territories, we offer global perspective and local insight to help empower lives and build resilient nations.</p><p>More details could be obtained from: [emailprotected]</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Fall armyworm - known in Latin form as frugiperda, or \"lost fruit,\" for its crop-wrecking potential - has dramatically spread eastwards from the Americas in the past five years Having established itself in most of Africa, and large swaths of Asia, it has lately been reported in Australia and parts of Oceania. Over 70 countries are now affected; there are fears that the Mediterranean fringes of Europe could be next.</p><p>Thriving in warmer climates, FAW primarily feeds on maize crops - but also on wheat, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetables and cotton. The pest's voracious appetite means that in many parts of the world, food, fuel and fibre are at severe risk.</p><p>FAO estimates that FAW has contributed to worsening food security for 26 million people. While the bug cannot be eradicated, managing it is vital and possible through a coordinate approach.</p><p>In his address, the Director-General commended the steps taken to date: Eight \"demonstration\" countries have been chosen as hubs for the Global Action, one for each geographical zone where the threat is most acute - China, India and the Philippines in Asia; and in Africa - Egypt, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Kenya and Malawi. All have set up National FAW Task Forces, and are developing detailed work plans for monitoring, technology evaluation and capacity building. FAO'S Technical Cooperation Program has been a \"catalytic force to support a number of these efforts,\" Qu told participants.</p><p>The integrated pest management packages are based on the Organization's guidelines. He added that \"it is thanks to the excellent network among key stakeholders in the different countries that we have achieved these results together.\"</p><p>Apart from the institutional level, FAO has been working to assist those whose livelihoods are most directly threatened. In 2020, despite limitations posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, nearly a million and a half African farmers were trained on scouting and monitoring the appearance and spread of FAW. They also learned about using bio-pesticides and pesticides, as well as nature-based solutions for FAW management. Those benefitting from this outreach include farmers such as Cyril Nzagumandore, in Rwanda's Nyamagabe district. \"Before, from this 10-hectare marshland, we used to harvest 5 to 6 tons,\" he explained.</p><p>\"But in 2017, this dropped to 3.5 tons. We did our best to fight the worm, but had nothing to show for it. When the FAO project came, we understood more about FAW and the technologies it takes to fight it.

With less than a year to go, the British High Commission in Colombo hosted a virtual conference on December 9 to introduce COP26 to Sri Lanka.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UK and partners from Sri Lanka, France, Italy and the UN set out their climate, COP and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ambitions.</p><p>As the incoming COP Presidency, the UK is leading by example and raising global ambition to tackle climate change. On 12 December, the UK set out its own ambitious Nationally Determined</p><p>Contributions (NDCs) at an international Climate Ambition Summit, highlighting the UK's climate related targets, policies and measures towards global climate action.</p><p>Under the UK's COP Presidency the overall aim is to accelerate global progress towards the goals of the Paris Agreement through increased ambition in three key domains: Adaptation, Mitigation and Finance.</p><p>Sri Lanka is rich in biodiversity but vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, such as temperature rise, rainfall variability and sea level rise. The UK recognises Sri Lanka's climate leadership through its work to promote nature-based solutions to protect, restore and manage</p><p>ecosystems and biodiversity in a way that also benefits livelihoods. The UK also welcomes President Rajapaksa's recent climate commitments, which include a move to generate 80% of all power through renewable energy by 2030, banning single-use plastic by 2021, and its work on the 'Colombo Declaration', which aims to halve Nitrogen waste by 2030.</p><p>The British High Commission is supporting Sri Lankan environmental organisations through initiatives such as the Commonwealth Blue Charter and Darwin Fund, to reduce plastic pollution and preserve Sri Lanka's unique environmental heritage, including mangroves, wetlands and wildlife.</p><p>Under its COP26 Presidency, the UK aims to generate significant momentum on climate action. Sri Lanka is a key part of this equation. \"The UK is proud to host COP26 in Glasgow next year. We need to continue working together to address the impact of climate change and create a more sustainable, secure and prosperous planet for all.''</p><p>\"World leaders will come together at COP26 in Glasgow next November to make progress on climate change. It is essential that governments, business and communities worldwide take strong climate action now to set the world on a Net Zero trajectory. Sri Lanka is an important partner for the UK in delivering this change,\" British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Sarah Hulton said. Ken O'Flaherty, COP26 Regional Ambassador for the Asia-Pacific region \"Sensibilization and education on Climate Change needs to be a key part of the national and international response to the big issue of our time and we must teach our children that there is no 'planet B'.</p><p>Rita Giuliana Mannella, Italian Ambassador to Sri Lanka said: \"We must use the experience of COVID-19 as an impetus to speed up our efforts to secure a safe and sustainable future for all. International cooperation and multilateralism will remain more important than ever.\"</p><p>United Nations Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka Hanaa Singer said: \"Sri Lanka will continue its important journey to transition to renewable energy, with the target of increasing the renewable energy mix to be 40% of the total energy portfolio by 2030. But it's not just about targets it's about real action, and it is indeed significant that only last week our Prime Minister declared open Sri Lanka's largest wind farm with a capacity of 100 MW in the Mannar District.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

In a series of meetings with officials of the Foreign Affairs Ministry and the Environment Ministry, Mr. O'Flaherty discussed the progress made by Sri Lanka with regard to its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Sri Lanka recently submitted its 2021 Nationally Determined Contributions and is set to submit a revised version of the document ahead of the COP26 summit. 'The Environment Minister told me that the revision will contain a more ambitious level of emission cuts and a revised Net Zero target - which I very much hope can be set at 2050, in line with other countries in the region.'</p><p>Mr. O'Flaherty commended</p><p>Sri Lanka's recent 'no more coal' policy and noted that the energy sector would be the key driver of Sri Lanka's Net Zero Carbon commitments.</p><p>Investment in renewable energy is pro-development, but it will also require considerable investment in Sri Lanka's energy infrastructure over the next decade. 'During my talks, I encouraged the Sri Lankan Government to develop detailed plans of the investment needed and set out clear projects where it wants to attract foreign investment,' he said.</p><p>He added that he had talks with business leaders - as COP26 Presidency and investors consistently communicate their desire to invest in Asia - but needed clear signals from the Government that such investment would be facilitated and that there would be a return on investment. 'I am confident that if Sri Lanka is able to develop a clear implementation plan for its Net Zero target then investment will follow.'</p><p>'Sri Lanka has immense potential for cheap, abundant solar and wind energy. So there is scope to rapidly reduce emissions in the years ahead.' This will require investment in energy infrastructure to facilitate the transmission of this new renewable energy.</p><p>The envoy said that if these efforts were coupled with moves to protect Sri Lanka's forests and supported by nature-based solutions such as the protection and restoration of mangroves, then there would be considerable potential for major cuts in Sri Lanka's overall emissions.</p><p>He said he believed that net zero carbon by 2050 was an achievable and welcome target if a coordinated and joined-up approach was taken along with detailed plans for specific sectors such as energy, transport and forestry. 'But I am convinced that the leadership being shown by President Rajapaksa means that this is highly achievable.'</p><p>Speaking on the impact that Sri Lanka could have on the global climate change movement, Mr. O'Flaherty said Sri Lanka's position as a country, which is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, potentially gave it a strong moral voice - one that he noted delegates would be keen to amplify ahead of COP26. 'By delivering an even more ambitious NDC with a 2050 Net Zero emissions target, Sri Lanka can lead by example in showing the actions which can be taken to limit global warming to 1.5C - and ensure that the world we pass on to our children is a sustainable one.'</p><p>He also said there were also measures underway to respond to the X-press Pearl marine catastrophe; on programme activities to support marine and wetland biodiversity (Commonwealth Litter Programme, Blue Planet Fund and Darwin initiative) and through jointly delivered events (e.g. on nitrogen pollution).</p><p>While recognising that countries were currently working hard to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, he noted that it was vital that the ongoing climate crisis was not forgotten. 'As governments enact stimulus packages to relaunch their economies in the wake of the pandemic, we are encouraging them to heed the advice of the UN Secretary General who is calling for them to invest in renewable energy and green technologies - which have been shown to provide more jobs for citizens and higher growth for economies worldwide.'</p><p>He disagreed that environmental damage was a cost of economic growth. 'There is no contradiction between strong climate ambition and growth.' On the contrary, Mr. O ' Flaherty held that economies in South and South East Asia had an even greater opportunity given that they would in any case be building much larger volumes of infrastructure over the next decade. 'So they have the opportunity to gain a competitive edge by leapfrogging the technologies of the last century and investing in the green technologies of the future.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1508202100021</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63CY-56R1-F00C-6470-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 15, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of all global withdrawals. Failure to use it wisely will lead to a sorry fate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, one of every six people on the planet live in areas facing severe water constraints. The vast majority of these are in Asia, even if Northern Africa, where one in five people confront very high water shortages and scarcity, represents the most urgent situation. Globally, the per capita availability of freshwater resources has declined by more than 20 percent in the past two decades.</p><p>Countries with ample water availability have a free lunch. Take Brazil, where for each resident there are almost 42,000 cubic metres of renewable freshwater annually. But much of it is in the Amazon Basin, little used by people. Large food-producing countries such as China and the United States of America are significantly reliant, both domestically and through trade, on rapidly depleting aquifers - the absence of evident water stress today is not evidence it will be absent tomorrow.</p><p>Africa's Sahel region and Central Asia are among the world's 51 Low-Income Food Deficit Countries. Central Asia and Africa's Sahel region, both face high water stress.</p><p>What is to be done?</p><p>Doing more with less is the short answer.</p><p>That means recognizing water's value. It has a price, and leveraging that price signal can demonstrably spur farmers to improve their water productivity. There is a range of methods: improved irrigation, better selection of crops, innovative storage and conservation methods, and a variety of nature-based solutions, often integrating aquaculture. All of them require robust and inclusive governance so that the basic needs of all, especially rural smallholders, can be met.</p><p>Any sustainable approach requires a solid grasp of existing conditions and needs - including access to safe drinking water, water for industrial development and the water requirements of ecosystems on a territorial scale, which are inadequately supplied by almost half of the irrigation systems in use today.</p><p>Water accounting and auditing, which are rarely done, should therefore be the starting point of any effective strategy for addressing water shortages and scarcity.</p><p>The State of Food and Agriculture 2020, a new flagship report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, takes an in-depth look at the question, mapping the flashpoints, surveying the world's varied water-management systems, and pointing to pathways for improvement.</p><p>Read it.</p><p>There is no time to weep, nor a need to do so. There are some upside scenarios. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa - where food insecurity and population growth are greatest - has quite ample horizons to expand irrigation, which can substantially boost agricultural productivity and at the same time assure efficient use of water. Currently, only three percent of cropland in that region is equipped for irrigation, but that is destined to grow and smart expansion can be fostered through targeted programmes that offer rural smallholders greater access to energy and credit. To be sure, that must be accompanied by equitable, inclusive and effective governance systems in order to avoid problems of excess groundwater extraction that are plaguing some other part of the world.</p><p>Lao Tzu, the sage of classical Taoism, noted that water \"greatly benefits all things, without conflict.\" He observed how it is fluid, soft and yielding, which as FAO's SOFA report notes does make it inherently rather difficult to manage. Paradoxically, he added, it will also wear away rock, overcoming whatever is hard.</p><p>We can and must learn and apply that skill to assure that it can continue to work its magic for the nearly 10 billion people who will live on our planet in 2050.</p><p>(The writer is Chief Economist, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Yet there is no time for complacency.</p><p> Because Sri Lanka is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change ranking 6th on the Climate Risk Index the country is at crossroads with a choice to exercise  of choosing a development trajectory that progresses human development while easing pressure on the planet.The Global Human Development Report (HDR) was launched by the UNDP in Sri Lanka bringing together a wide range of high-level participation from the Government, Public and Private sector, Development partners and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs).</p><p>The 30th anniversary edition of the HDR 2020, titled 'The Next Frontier: Human Development and the Anthropocene,' includes a new experimental index the Planetary Pressures-Adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) on human progress which takes into account countries' carbon dioxide emissions and material footprint. Human development has historically taken place at the cost of the land and environment around us.</p><p> The COVID-19 pandemic is the latest crisis facing the world, but unless humans release their grip on nature, it won't be the last, according to the recently launched HDR.Ceremoniously receiving the report at the virtual launch in Sri Lanka, Power Minister Dullas Alahapperuma stated: \"The Government of Sri Lanka aims to build a Green Economy that will generate new industries by local entrepreneurs.</p><p> Through renewable energy, we can create low-cost, low-carbon energy. A Green Economy will improve energy security, improve environmental and public health, and create better and more jobs.</p><p> And with the vision of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, we commit to ensure that the environment is protected in all our development plans. It is with great pleasure that we welcome UNDPs coordinated support to ushering in aspects of a Green Economy.</p><p>\"Speaking at the event, UNDP Resident Representative Robert Juhkam, stated: \"UNDP stands committed in supporting Sri Lanka to define and operationalize its national development plan in a way that is underpinned by Green Development thinking, with consideration for socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. UNDP commits to helping establish a platform for all partners and stakeholders to come together in achieving a Green development pathway: government, private sector, civil society, academia, development partners, and our sister UN agencies.\"Also speaking at the launch, United Nations Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, said: \"Given the deep interconnection of planetary and social imbalances noted in the Report, I want to emphasise today the importance of ensuring justice, equality and human rights as part of this process.</p><p> Seeing as no country anywhere in the world has yet achieved the ideal combination of high human development and low planetary pressure, we need such an inclusive and participatory approach where all voices are heard. Only in this way can we address the enormously complex challenge ahead of us.</p><p>\"The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues. In her remarks, British High Commissioner Sarah Hulton, emphasised that, \"climate action is extremely tangible and relevant to Sri Lanka, with its rich biodiversity, climate vulnerability, reliance on nature and environment for many livelihoods whether through agriculture, fishing or tourism.</p><p> In fact, maintaining the environment and protecting biodiversity through nature-based solutions is one of the key shared objectives for many of us working here in Sri Lanka including the UK and UN, in supporting the people and Government of Sri Lanka on this.\"According to the report, easing planetary pressures in a way that enables all people to flourish in this new age requires dismantling the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of transformation.</p><p> Highlighting this through an interactive talk, Jetwing Symphony Chairman Hiran Cooray, stated: \"We need to change the way we think if we are really focused on human development and switching to a green economy. Greater collaboration and encouragement to Sri Lankans across the country who really want to make a difference is essential.</p><p>\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT07012021007602</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61R1-PK61-F00C-60W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 7, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Ceremoniously receiving the report at the virtual launch in Sri Lanka, Dullas Alahapperuma, Minister of Power stated, \"the Government of Sri Lanka aims to build a Green Economy that will generate new industries by local entrepreneurs.</p><p> Through renewable energy, we can create low-cost, low-carbon energy. A Green Economy will improve energy security, improve environmental and public health, and create better and more jobs.</p><p> And with the vision of H.E.</p><p> President Gotabaya Rajapakse, we commit to ensure that the environment is protected in all our development plans.It is with great pleasure that we welcome UNDPs coordinated support to ushering in aspects of a Green Economy.</p><p>\" Speaking at the event, Robert Juhkam, Resident Representative of UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, \"UNDP stands committed in supporting Sri Lanka to define and operationalize its national development plan in a way that is underpinned by Green Development thinking,with consideration for socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. UNDP commits to helping establish a platform for all partners and stakeholders to come together in achieving a Green development pathway: government, private sector, civil society, academia, development partners, and our sister UN agencies.\" p class=\"x_MsoNormalAlso speaking at the launch, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, Resident Coordinator of the United Nations in Sri Lanka stated, \"given the deep interconnection of planetary and social imbalances noted in the Report, I want to emphasize today the importance of ensuring justice, equality and human rights as part of this process.</p><p> Seeing as no country anywhere in the world has yet achieved the ideal combination of high human development and low planetary pressure, we need such an inclusive and participatory approach where all voices are heard. Only in this way can we address the enormously complex challenge ahead of us.</p><p>\" p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"x_EmailStyle24The next frontier for human development will require working with and not against nature, while transforming social norms, values, and government and financial incentives, the report argues.  p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"x_EmailStyle24In her remarks, Sarah Hulton, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka emphasized that, \"climate action is extremely tangible and relevant to Sri Lanka, with its rich biodiversity, climate vulnerability, reliance on nature and environment for many livelihoods whether through agriculture, fishing or tourism.</p><p> In fact, maintaining the environment and protecting biodiversity through nature-based solutions is one of the key shared objectives for many of us working here in Sri Lanka including the UK and UN, in supporting the people and Government of Sri Lanka on this.\"  p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"x_EmailStyle24According to the report, easing planetary pressures in a way that enables all people to flourish in this new age requires dismantling the gross imbalances of power and opportunity that stand in the way of transformation.</p><p> (Colombo Gazette)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLGAZ-COLGAZTT06012021008925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLGAZ2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61PF-7M11-F00C-60BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461128</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Colombo Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Colombo Gazette (Pittakotte, Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 6, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000948</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

We will work with our international partners to achieve a world that is human-centered, inclusive and resilient, leaving no one behind. In that spirit, we welcomed the participation of the Leaders of Australia, Brazil, Comoros, Cook Islands, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Vietnam.</p><p>Ukraine</p><p>We once again condemn in the strongest possible terms the war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine, which constitutes a serious violation of international law, including the UN Charter. Russia's brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community. We reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace. We issued the G7 Leaders' Statement on Ukraine, and with the clear intention and concrete actions set forth in it, we commit to intensifying our diplomatic, financial, humanitarian and military support for Ukraine, to increasing the costs to Russia and those supporting its war efforts, and to continuing to counter the negative impacts of the war on the rest of the world, particularly on the most vulnerable people.</p><p>Disarmament and Non-proliferation</p><p>Together with the G7 Leaders' Hiroshima Vision on Nuclear Disarmament, we express our commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all, through taking a realistic, pragmatic, and responsible approach. We reaffirm the importance of disarmament and non-proliferation efforts to create a more stable and safer world. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We remain committed to the universalization, effective implementation, and strengthening of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, as well as the Chemical Weapons Convention. We welcome the steps taken to strengthen effective and responsible export controls on materials, technology, and research that could be used for military purposes in a way that keeps pace with rapid technological developments and recognize the central role of multilateral export control regimes in this regard.</p><p>Indo-Pacific</p><p>We reiterate the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific, which is inclusive, prosperous, secure, based on the rule of law, and that protects shared principles including sovereignty, territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of disputes, and fundamental freedoms and human rights. Given the importance of the region, G7 members and our partners have taken respective Indo-Pacific initiatives to help strengthen our engagement. We underscore our commitment to strengthen coordination with regional partners, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its member states. We reaffirm our unwavering support for ASEAN centrality and unity and our commitment to promoting cooperation in line with the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We also reaffirm our partnership with Pacific Island countries and reiterate the importance of supporting their priorities and needs in accordance with the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We welcome and further encourage efforts made by the private sector, universities and think tanks, which contribute to realizing a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p><p>Global Economy, Finance and Sustainable Development</p><p>The global economy has shown resilience against multiple shocks including the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and associated inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, we need to remain vigilant and stay agile and flexible in our macroeconomic policy amid heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook. In striving for strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth, we are committed to a stability- and growth-oriented macroeconomic policy mix that supports medium-term fiscal sustainability and price stability. Inflation remains elevated and central banks remain strongly committed to achieving price stability, in line with their respective mandates. Meanwhile, fiscal policy should continue to provide, as appropriate, temporary and targeted support to vulnerable groups suffering from the increase in cost of living and catalyze investment needed for the green and digital transformations while the overall fiscal stance should ensure medium-term sustainability. We also reaffirm our existing G7 exchange rate commitments. We reemphasize the importance of supply-side reforms, especially those that increase labor supply and enhance productivity. We also stress the crucial role of women and under-represented groups for the long-term success of our economies through promoting inclusion, diversity and innovation. We look forward to a successful review of the G20/Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles of Corporate Governance to strengthen sustainability and resilience of the private sector. Recognizing that our economic and social structures have undergone dynamic and fundamental transformation, we underscore the multidimensional aspects of welfare and that these aspects should be brought into policymaking in a practical and effective manner. Such efforts will help preserve confidence in democracy and a market-based economy, which are the core values of the G7.</p><p>We will continue to closely monitor financial sector developments and stand ready to take appropriate actions to maintain financial stability and the resilience of the global financial system. We reaffirm that our financial system is resilient, supported by the financial regulatory reforms implemented after the 2008 global financial crisis. We strongly support the work of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and standard-setting bodies on enhancing the resilience of non-bank financial intermediation. We will continue policy deliberation on digital money to harness the benefits of innovation such as payment efficiency as well as financial inclusion while addressing potential risks to the stability, resilience and integrity of the monetary and financial system. Effective monitoring, regulation and oversight are critical to addressing financial stability and integrity risks posed by crypto-asset activities and markets and to avoid regulatory arbitrage, while supporting responsible innovation.</p><p>We re-emphasize our strong political commitment towards the swift global implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Two-Pillar Solution to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy and to establish a more stable and fairer international tax system. We recognize significant progress in the negotiation of the Pillar 1 Multilateral Convention (MLC) and reaffirm our commitment to the swift completion of the negotiation so that the MLC can be ready for signature within the agreed timeline. We welcome the progresses in domestic legislation toward the implementation of Pillar 2. We will further provide developing countries with support for strengthening their tax capacity to build sustainable tax revenue sources, highlighting the importance of assistance for the implementation of the Two-Pillar Solution.</p><p>We recognize that achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030, reducing poverty, responding to global challenges including the climate crisis, and addressing debt vulnerabilities in low and middle-income countries are urgent, interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We are determined to do our part to mobilize the private and public resources needed to meet these challenges and support a just transition. Recognizing the importance of providing and protecting global public goods, we will support efforts to embed building resilience, sustainability and inclusiveness as integral elements in MDBs' efforts to reduce poverty and promote shared prosperity. We will strive to enhance the development finance toolkit to mobilize additional financing from international financial institutions, bilateral partners, and the private sector to more effectively reduce poverty by better addressing vulnerabilities including climate change. We will work together and with partners to deliver this ambition and make concrete progress on this agenda at key moments over the coming year starting with the Summit organized in Paris on June 22-23 to revitalize global development financing, and continuing the momentum through the G20 Summit in New Delhi, the SDG Summit in New York, the 2023 World Bank Group (WBG) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Meetings in Marrakech, the G20 Compact with Africa Conference in Berlin, and the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC-COP 28) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p>We are determined to take on a leading role in reversing the setback of progress towards the SDGs. Recognizing that 2023 is the halfway point to achieve the SDGs, we highlight the importance of the SDG Summit in September and will ambitiously contribute to a successful outcome. We reaffirm our commitment to revitalizing international cooperation and strengthen multilateralism. We will accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA), and will do so in a comprehensive and gender-transformative manner including through locally-led development. We will also promote the concept of human security in the new era aiming to realize a society that leaves no one behind. We stress the critical role of development cooperation and international partnerships in addressing global challenges and the need to engage with international partners in solidarity. We also call for further domestic resource mobilization and efficient use of existing resources as well as mobilizing private financial assets to address financing gaps for sustainable development. We underscore the need for continued efforts to scale up official development assistance (ODA) and expand its catalytic use including through innovative financing mechanisms, recognizing the importance of respective commitments, such as the 0.7% ODA/GNI target that some countries adopted.</p><p>We remain concerned that serious challenges to debt sustainability are undermining the progress towards the SDGs and low-and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and wider global challenges. We reiterate the urgency of addressing debt vulnerabilities in these countries and fully support the G20's effort to improve the implementation of the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in a predictable, timely, orderly and coordinated manner, providing clarity to participants. We welcome the recent approval by the IMF board of a program for Ghana. Beyond the Common Framework, debt vulnerabilities in middle income countries (MICs) should be addressed by multilateral coordination. In this respect, we welcome the launch of the creditors' meeting for Sri Lanka under the three co-chairs, France, India, and Japan, and look forward to a swift resolution as a successful model for future multilateral efforts to address MICs' debt issues. We also stress the importance of private creditors providing debt treatments on terms at least as favorable to ensure fair burden sharing in line with the comparability of treatment principle. We welcome the development of Climate Resilient Debt Clauses (CRDC) to enhance the safety net for borrowers facing the impacts of climate change. We welcome work by our finance ministers on this topic and encourage more creditors to offer CRDC for loan agreements. In order to enhance debt data accuracy and transparency, we invite all official bilateral creditors to join the data sharing exercise for debt data reconciliation, including through further advancing the G20's initiative in the area of debt data accuracy.</p><p>We encourage MDBs and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) to accelerate their efforts to increase their capacity to leverage private finance, including through implementing MDB reforms. In this regard, we strongly support and encourage to expedite the ongoing work on the evolution of the MDBs to review and transform their business models to better address transboundary challenges such as climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict, which are integral to achieving poverty reduction and shared prosperity. This evolution should come with the most efficient use of their existing capital. To this end, we will contribute to developing an ambitious G20 Roadmap on implementing the recommendations of the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework Review and call on MDBs to make further progress in a comprehensive manner while safeguarding MDBs' long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings and preferred creditor status. Building on key reforms to the WBG's mission and operational model along with financial reforms that can add up to $50 billion of financing capacity over the coming decade, we look forward to further progress at the WBG toward the 2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and beyond so that ambitious reforms can be made on a continual basis. We encourage other MDBs to join this initiative for a coordinated approach of MDBs as a system. We also call on MDBs to make the best use of policy and knowledge support, and explore strengthened approaches to promote mobilizing domestic resources and private capital as well as private sector engagement. We have further advanced our joint efforts to support countries most in need through the voluntary channeling of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) or equivalent contributions. We welcome that additional pledges by Japan and France, amongst others, together with our previous contributions and commitments, put the global ambition of $100 billion within reach and call for the delivery of existing pledges and for further pledges from all willing and able countries to fulfill the ambition. We support the IMF achieving its agreed 2021 fundraising targets by the 2023 WBG and IMF Annual Meetings and identifying all available options to put the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) which supports Low Income Countries (LICs), on a sustainable footing with a view to meeting the growing needs of LICs in the coming years. We will further explore viable options for enabling the voluntary channeling of SDRs through MDBs, while respecting national legal frameworks and the need to preserve the reserve assets character and status of SDRs.</p><p>We stress the importance of narrowing the infrastructure investment gap in low and middle income partner countries, including by delivering financing for quality infrastructure, supporting efforts to advance policy reforms needed to attract investment, operationalizing country-led partnerships, and promoting upstream support including project preparation support. We reaffirm our shared commitment to the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) and to working together and aiming to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027.We will continue strengthening global partnerships for public and private investments in sustainable, inclusive, resilient and quality infrastructure with partner countries. We will mobilize the private sector for accelerated action to this end. Our offer is fair and transparent and aims at accelerating global sustainable development with the focus on delivering impact at local level. We welcome the Factsheet on PGII that demonstrates how the G7 and partners have made concrete progress in fostering investments that will create lasting positive impacts and promote sustainable development. We reiterate our support to the G20 Compact with Africa as a key framework to enhance the business environment in Africa and call on reform-oriented partners to join and strengthen this initiative.</p><p>We shared our determination to promote transparent and fair development finance and work together to address the gap in implementing existing principles such as debt transparency and sustainability, fair appraisal, selection, and lending practices for quality infrastructure investment. In this regard, we call on all actors to adhere to international rules, standards and principles, including the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These rules, standards and principles also include measures to safeguard the integrity of infrastructure investments.</p><p>We note the importance of addressing development, humanitarian, peace and security issues together. We are determined to address the unprecedented number of humanitarian crises, focusing on women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. In this regard, we commit to providing over $21 billion in total to address the worsening humanitarian crises this year, including in response to urgent food crises. Bearing in mind that many countries are vulnerable to disasters, including Small Island Developing States, we will accelerate international disaster risk reduction cooperation in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the output of its midterm review conducted by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). We emphasize the importance of a disaster preparedness approach and investment in human capital, goods and infrastructure that contribute not only to 'risk transfer' but also to 'risk reduction,' resulting in the strengthening of anticipatory actions. We remain committed to holding ourselves accountable, in an open and transparent way, for the promises we have made. In this regard, we endorse the 2023 Hiroshima Progress Report, following up on the G7's development-related commitments on food security and nutrition as well as refugees and migration.</p><p>We emphasize the transformative power of cities worldwide as drivers for every aspect of sustainable development. We will continue our cooperation on sustainable urban development and task our relevant Ministers to consider the development of principles on carbon neutral, resilient and inclusive cities and on the digitalization in cities, and to accelerate the use of data and technologies for cities. This work will support exchanges with our global partners, whose cities face some of the most significant challenges relating to climate change.</p><p>Climate Change</p><p>Our planet is facing unprecedented challenges from the triple global crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution as well as from the ongoing global energy crisis. We are steadfast in our commitment to the Paris agreement, keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C global temperature rise within reach through scaled up action in this critical decade, halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, and ensuring energy security, whilst leveraging synergies and recognizing the interdependent nature of these challenges. While Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine impacts energy markets and supply chains globally, our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 at the latest remains unchanged. We emphasize our strong concern, amplified by the latest finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), at the accelerating and intensifying impacts of climate change, and highlight the increased urgency to reduce global GHG emissions by around 43 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035, relative to the 2019 level, in light of its latest findings. We reiterate our commitment made in Elmau last year to rapidly implement domestic mitigation measures aimed at achieving our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets and to increase our ambition including, for example, by adopting or strengthening sectoral targets, by developing non-CO2 sub targets, and by adopting stringent implementation measures. Mindful of our leadership role, and noting that emissions have already peaked in all G7 countries, we recognize the critical role of all major economies in limiting increases in global temperature over this critical decade and in subsequent decades. In this context, we underscore that every major economy should have significantly enhanced the ambition of its NDC since the Paris Agreement; already peaked its GHG emissions or indicated that it will do so no later than 2025; and in particular, included economy-wide absolute reduction targets and that cover all GHGs in its NDC. Accordingly, we call on all Parties - especially major economies - whose 2030 NDC targets or long-term low GHG emission development Strategies (LTSs) are not yet aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and net zero by 2050 at the latest, to revisit and strengthen the 2030 NDC targets and publish or update their LTSs as soon as possible and well before UNFCCC-COP28, and to commit to net zero by 2050 at the latest. Furthermore, we call on all Parties to commit at UNFCCC-COP28 to peak global GHG emissions immediately and by no later than 2025. We reaffirm our commitment to the Global Methane Pledge and we will step up efforts to collectively reduce global anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. We commit to actively contributing to securing the most ambitious outcomes of the first global stocktake (GST) at UNFCCC-COP28, which should result in enhanced, immediate and ambitious actions across mitigation, adaptation, means of implementation and support. We call on all Parties to submit their next round of NDCs and LTSs well ahead of UNFCCC-COP30 that are informed by the outcomes of the GST, reflecting economy-wide absolute reduction targets including all GHGs, sectors and categories. These should reflect significantly enhanced ambition aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and should also include their revisited and strengthened 2030 targets.</p><p>Noting the importance of increasing the pace and scale of action on climate change, biodiversity loss and clean energy transitions, we will globally advance and promote a green transformation, working together to realize transformation of our economies to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 at the latest. We will engage with developing and emerging countries to accelerate emission reduction, including by supporting their transitions to climate resilient, circular, and nature positive economies and net-zero GHG emissions through various and practical pathways taking into account national circumstances. To that end, we reaffirm our strong commitment to supporting developing countries' just energy transitions, which will be supported by coordinated actions, including through the PGII. We welcome progress achieved on JETPs with South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, and also continue our discussions with India and Senegal. We take note of initiatives that are intended to support clean energy transition in countries around the world, such as Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) initiative, the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), 2050 Pathways Platform, Net Zero World (NZW), and the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge and underscore the importance of actions taken through such initiatives being aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. We will take further action on supply-side measures and recognize the need for further decarbonization efforts on the demand-side such as promoting changes in infrastructure and material use and end-use technology adoption as well as promoting sustainable consumer choice. We also recognize the vital role of sub-national governments in collaboration with other stakeholders and partners to advance climate and energy actions based on local needs and environmental conditions. We reaffirm the important role of high integrity carbon markets and carbon pricing to foster cost-efficient reductions in emission levels, drive innovation and enable a transformation to net zero, through the optimal use of a range of policy levers to price carbon. We support appropriate policy mixes including carbon pricing, non-pricing mechanisms, and incentives that effectively reduce emissions, and note that these could vary reflecting country-specific circumstances. We strongly support the OECD Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA). We look forward to advancing the open, cooperative, and inclusive Climate Club, in collaboration with international partners, to advance industrial decarbonization. We encourage private entities to commit to GHG net-zero emissions throughout the value chain via credible net zero pledges and transparent implementation strategies. We also encourage and promote private entities' work to foster innovation contributing to the emission reduction of other entities through decarbonization solutions. We welcome the progress of the Industrial Decarbonization Agenda (IDA) that decided to start working on implementation of the new Global Data Collection Framework for steel production and product emissions. We reaffirm our commitment to a highly decarbonized road sector by 2030, and recognize the importance of reducing GHG emissions from the global fleet and the range of pathways to approach this goal in line with trajectories required for keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C within reach. We are committed to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the road sector by 2050. In this context, we highlight the various actions that each of us is taking to decarbonize our vehicle fleet, including such domestic policies that are designed to achieve 100 percent or the overwhelming penetration of sales of light duty vehicles (LDVs) as zero emission vehicles (ZEV) by 2035 and beyond; to achieve 100 percent electrified vehicles in new passenger car sales by 2035; to promote associated infrastructure and sustainable carbon-neutral fuels including sustainable bio- and synthetic fuels. We note the opportunities that these policies offer to contribute to a highly decarbonized road sector, including progressing towards a share of over 50 percent of zero emission LDVs sold globally by 2030. Considering the findings of the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s Energy Technology Perspective 2023, we also note the opportunity to collectively reduce by at least 50 percent CO2 emissions from G7 vehicle stock by 2035 or earlier relative to the level in 2000 as a halfway point to achieving net zero and to track the progress on a yearly basis. We reaffirm our commitment to strengthen global efforts to achieve GHG lifecycle zero emissions from international shipping by 2050 at the latest. We commit to support this target and introducing intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 for the revised International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG reduction strategy, in line with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels through a credible basket of measures. We commit to accelerate global efforts to achieve the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)'s goal of net-zero emissions in international aviation by 2050, including making an effort for promoting and introducing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), introducing new technologies and improving operations, also building on ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).</p><p>In the face of the increasing threats posed by climate change, supporting climate-vulnerable groups is essential for ensuring human security and achieving resilient and sustainable development. We will continue to scale up and enhance support to strengthen the resilience of climate-vulnerable groups through enhancing climate change adaptation and climate disaster risk reduction, response and recovery and early-warning systems including through the Global Shield against Climate Risks and other initiatives related to early warning systems and the adoption of climate-resilient debt clauses. We reaffirm our commitments to the developed country Parties' goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually in climate finance by 2020 through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation. We will work together with other developed country Parties in order to fully meet the goal in 2023. We welcome discussions on an ambitious and fit-for-purpose new collective quantified goal (NCQG) which contributes as a global effort, from a wide variety of sources, public and private, to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement, including making finance flows consistent with a pathway toward low GHG emissions and climate resilient development. Recognizing the critical role of the G7 and that developed country parties should take the lead in mobilizing climate finance, we underscore the need for all countries and stakeholders, who have the capabilities and are not yet among the current providers of international climate finance, to contribute to global efforts in this regard.</p><p>We are committed to accelerating our own efforts to making financial flows consistent with a pathway toward low GHG emissions and climate resilient development, in line with Article 2.1c of the Paris Agreement. We stress the importance of mobilizing finance especially including private finance focusing on further implementation and development of clean technologies and activities. We underline our commitment to consistent, comparable and reliable disclosure of information on sustainability including climate. We support the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) finalizing the standards for general reporting on sustainability and for climate-related disclosures and working toward achieving globally interoperable sustainability disclosure frameworks. We also look forward to the ISSB's future work on disclosure on biodiversity and human capital, in line with its work plan consultation. We remain committed to supporting the implementation and monitoring of the G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap. We highlight the need for corporates to implement their net-zero transitions in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement based on credible corporate climate transition plans. We also highlight that transition finance, in line with keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise within reach, avoiding carbon lock-ins and based on effective emissions reduction, has a significant role in advancing the decarbonization of the economy as a whole. We look forward to an ambitious and successful second replenishment for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and reaffirm the need for robust G7 pledges. We urge other countries to do the same and underscore the need to broaden the GCF's contributor base by encouraging all potential contributors. We continue to accelerate efforts to respond to the Glasgow Climate Pact that urges developed countries to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing countries from the 2019 level by 2025, in the context of achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled-up financial resources. We also urge MDBs to commit to ambitious adaptation finance targets, announcing revised and enhanced 2025 projections, and call on non-G7 countries to enhance provision and mobilization including private finance for adaptation. We stress the key role of International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in mobilizing finance and call on them to mainstream climate and environment issues in their policies, investments, operations and governance. We also urge MDBs to increase finance for global public goods including climate finance and support ambitious regulatory reforms in developing countries via policy-based finance in order to foster the transition to net zero and enable private sector investment. Furthermore, in order to promote the development of carbon markets while ensuring their environmental integrity, we endorse the 'Principles of High Integrity Carbon Markets' to facilitate their implementation in carbon credit markets. We emphasize our extreme concern at the scale of impacts that are already resulting in economic and non-economic loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change and being felt globally, particularly by the most vulnerable. Alarmed by the adverse effects of climate change globally, we will scale up action and support to avert, minimize and address loss and damage, especially for the most vulnerable countries. This will include implementing the UNFCCC-COP27/The 4th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA4) decision to establish new funding arrangements, including a fund, for developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, in the context of article 8 of the Paris Agreement, and providing support identified in the 'G7 Inventory on Climate Disaster Risk Reduction, Response and Recovery'.</p><p>Environment</p><p>We commit to realizing the transformation of the economic and social system towards net-zero, circular, climate-resilient, pollution-free and nature-positive economies and to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030, in an integrated manner, while ensuring sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development and enhancing the resilience of our economies. Highlighting that enhancing resource efficiency and circularity along value chains reduces primary resource use and contributes to achieving our climate and other environmental goals, we encourage stakeholders and in particular businesses to strengthen their action. Thus, we endorse the Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency Principles (CEREP). We will increase domestic and international environmentally-sound, sustainable and efficient recovery and recycling of critical minerals and raw materials and other applicable materials while increasing circularity along the supply chains. We reaffirm that management and governance of water-related ecosystems are essential for all life on earth. We are actively engaging in relevant international fora including following up on the UN Water Conference successfully held this year.</p><p>Building on the G7 Ocean Deal, we commit to act towards realizing clean, healthy and productive oceans. We reaffirm our commitment to end illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and will take further actions to address this phenomenon in all its dimensions, including supporting developing countries and strengthening policy coordination among our relevant agencies and task them to take stock of their progress on this issue by the end of this year. In particular, we encourage non-parties to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) to join for further global acceptance and effective implementation of the PSMA. We welcome the conclusion of the negotiations for an international legally binding instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) and call for its rapid entry into force and implementation. We will continue to actively engage in the development of a regulatory framework on deep seabed mineral exploitation under the International Seabed Authority (ISA) that ensures effective protection for the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from such activities, as required under the UNCLOS. We are committed to end plastic pollution, with the ambition to reduce additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040. With this in mind, we are determined to continue and step up our actions based on the comprehensive life cycle approach. We support the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) process, look forward to the next round of negotiation in Paris with a view to completing its work with an international legally binding instrument covering the whole life cycle of plastics by the end of 2024 and call for ambitious outcomes. We will make as much progress as possible on these issues and on the broader agenda of ocean protection by the UN Ocean Conference in 2025.</p><p>We welcome the adoption of the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, which is fundamental to human well-being, a healthy planet and economic prosperity, and commit to its swift and full implementation and to achievement of each of its goals and targets. In this regard, G7 members that are parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) commit to revise, update and submit our National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) aligned with the GBF and its goals and targets, or to communicate national targets reflecting as applicable all the goals and targets of the GBF in 2023 or sufficiently in advance of CBD-COP16. We will identify incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity by 2025, and redirect or eliminate them while scaling up positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity by 2030 at the latest, taking initial steps without delay. We call on all signatories to swiftly implement their commitments under the GBF and stand ready to provide support to developing countries. We reiterate our commitment to substantially increase our national and international funding for nature by 2025. We will ensure that our international development assistance aligns with the GBF. We call on the MDBs to increase support for biodiversity including through leveraging financial resources from all sources and deploying a full suite of instruments. To implement the GBF, we commit to substantially and progressively increasing the level of financial resources from all sources, and to align all relevant fiscal and financial flows with the GBF and call on others to do the same. We commit to supporting the establishment of the GBF Fund within the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its successful launch at the GEF Assembly in Vancouver in August 2023, noting the importance of financial contributions from all sources to capitalize the new fund. We reaffirm our commitment to enhance synergies between finance for climate and biodiversity, including increased funding for Nature-based Solutions. We also commit to supporting and advancing a transition to nature positive economies, including through sharing knowledge and creating information networks among the G7 such as the G7 Alliance on Nature Positive Economy. We call on businesses to progressively reduce negative and increase positive impacts on biodiversity. We look forward to the publication of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures' (TNFD's) market framework and urge market participants, governments and regulators to support its development. We stress our commitment to achieving the target of effectively conserving and managing at least 30 percent of terrestrial and inland water areas, and at least 30 percent of marine and coastal areas by 2030 (30 by 30), nationally and globally, according to national circumstances and approaches through promoting the designation and management of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). We commit to conserving and protecting global marine biological diversity and sustainably using its resources based on the best available scientific evidence. In this context, we reconfirm our commitment under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to adopt, as a matter of urgency, proposals to designate Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Eastern Antarctica, the Weddell Sea and the Western Antarctic Peninsula, based on the best available scientific evidence. In this regard, we will support other countries by sharing best practices for protected areas and OECMs to achieve the GBF target of 30 by 30. We will enhance international cooperation on measures against invasive alien species. We reiterate our commitment to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030, and are committed to conserving forests and other terrestrial ecosystems and accelerating their restoration, supporting sustainable value and supply chains as well as promoting sustainable forest management and use of wood. We will work together, with high ambition to deliver integrated solutions to support the protection, conservation and restoration of high-carbon, high-biodiversity ecosystems, including by coordinating our offers through Country Packages on Forests, Nature and Climate, especially in countries which host vital reserves of carbon and biodiversity, with an initial focus on forests. We commit to continuing our efforts to reduce risk of deforestation and forest and land degradation linked to the production of relevant commodities and enhance cooperation with various stakeholders on this issue. We will, if appropriate, develop further regulatory frameworks or policies to support this.</p><p>Energy</p><p>We commit to holistically addressing energy security, the climate crisis, and geopolitical risks. In order to address the current energy crisis caused by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and achieve our common goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, we highlight the real and urgent need and opportunity to accelerate clean energy transitions also as a means of increasing energy security at the same time. While acknowledging various pathways according to each country's energy situation, industrial and social structures and geographical conditions, we highlight that these should lead to our common goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest in order to keep a limit of 1.5 \u00b0C within reach. In this regard, we invite the IEA to make recommendations by the end of this year on options how to diversify the supplies of energy and critical minerals as well as clean energy manufacturing. Through this, together with our partners, we seek to holistically address energy security, climate crisis, and geopolitical risk including the expansion of global use of renewable energy in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and keep a limit of 1.5 \u00b0C temperature rise within reach. Through our experience in coping with past and current energy crises, we highlight the importance of enhanced energy efficiency and savings as the 'first fuel,' and of developing demand side energy policies. We also need to significantly accelerate the deployment of renewable energies and the development and deployment of next-generation technologies. The G7 contributes to expanding renewable energy globally and bringing down costs by strengthening capacity including through a collective increase in offshore wind capacity of 150GW by 2030 based on each country's existing targets and a collective increase of solar PV to more than 1TW by 2030 estimated by the IEA and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) through means such as each country's existing targets or policy measures. We recognize that low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives such as ammonia should be developed and used, if this can be aligned with a 1.5 \u00b0C pathway, where they are impactful as effective emission reduction tools to advance decarbonization across sectors and industries, notably in hard-to-abate sectors in industry and transportation, while avoiding N2O as a GHG and NOx as air pollutant. We also note that some countries are exploring the use of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen and its derivatives in the power sector to work towards zero-emission thermal power generation if this can be aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and our collective goal for a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035. We will enhance our efforts to develop the rule-based, transparent global market and supply chains for low carbon and renewable hydrogen based on reliable international standards and certification schemes adhering to environmental and social standards. We affirm the importance of developing international standards and certification including for a GHG calculation methodology for hydrogen production and mutual recognition mechanism for carbon intensity-based tradability, transparency, trustworthiness and sustainability. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving a fully or predominantly decarbonized power sector by 2035, and prioritizing concrete and timely steps towards the goal of accelerating the phase-out of domestic unabated coal power generation in a manner consistent with keeping a limit of 1.5\u00b0C temperature rise within reach and urge others to join us. We will work towards ending the construction of new unabated coal fired power generation as identified in the IEA's Coal in Net Zero Transitions report in 2022 as one of the primary actions to be taken in line with the IEA net zero by 2050 scenario. We call on and will work with other countries to end new unabated coal-fired power generation projects globally as soon as possible to accelerate the clean energy transition in a just manner. We highlight that we ended new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation in 2021. We call on other countries, especially major economies to join us in fulfilling their commitments to do the same. We acknowledge that Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS)/carbon recycling technologies can be an important part of a broad portfolio of decarbonization solutions to reduce emissions from industrial sources that cannot be avoided otherwise and that the deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) processes with robust social and environmental safeguard, have an essential role to play in counterbalancing residual emissions from sectors that are unlikely to achieve full decarbonization.</p><p>We underline our commitment, in the context of a global effort, to accelerate the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels so as to achieve net zero in energy systems by 2050 at the latest in line with the trajectories required to limit global average temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels, and call on others to join us in taking the same action. We reaffirm our commitment to the elimination of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 or sooner, and reaffirm our previous calls for all countries to do so. In view of the emerging need for net-zero and circular industrial supply chains in the transformation towards a 1.5\u00b0C pathway, we recognize the opportunities associated with decarbonized, sustainably and responsibly produced non-combustion feedstocks, and are committed to supporting our workers and communities in this transformation. We also highlight that we ended new direct public support for the international unabated fossil-fuel energy sector in 2022, except in limited circumstances clearly defined by each country consistent with a 1.5 \u00b0C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement, recognizing the importance of national security and geostrategic interests. It is necessary to accelerate the phase out of our dependency on Russian energy, including through energy savings and gas demand reduction, in a manner consistent with our Paris commitments, and address the global impact of Russia's war on energy supplies, gas prices and inflation, and people's lives, recognizing the primary need to accelerate the clean energy transition. In this context, we stress the important role that increased deliveries of LNG can play, and acknowledge that investment in the sector can be appropriate in response to the current crisis and to address potential gas market shortfalls provoked by the crisis. In the exceptional circumstance of accelerating the phase out of our dependency on Russian energy, publicly supported investment in the gas sector can be appropriate as a temporary response, subject to clearly defined national circumstances, if implemented in a manner consistent with our climate objectives without creating lock-in effects, for example by ensuring that projects are integrated into national strategies for the development of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen. We will further utilize neutral and impartial statistical data made available by international organizations such as the IEA and strengthen their data-collection and analysis functions, with a view to stabilizing energy markets. We emphasize the importance of strengthening forums for communication and cooperation between producing and consuming countries with a view to stabilizing energy markets and mobilizing necessary investment consistent with climate goals. Those G7 countries that opt to use nuclear energy recognize its potential to provide affordable low-carbon energy that can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, to address the climate crisis and to ensure global energy security as a source of baseload energy and grid flexibility. They commit to maximizing the use of existing reactors safely, securely, and efficiently, including by advancing their safe long-term operation, in addressing the current energy crisis. They also commit, domestically as well as in partner countries, to supporting the development and construction of nuclear reactors, such as small modular and other advanced reactors with advanced safety systems, building robust and resilient nuclear supply chains including nuclear fuel, and maintaining and strengthening nuclear technology and human resources. They will work with like-minded partners to reduce dependence on Russia. The G7 underlines that the highest standards of nuclear safety and security are important to all countries and their respective publics. We welcome the steady progress of decommissioning work at Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO)'s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, and Japan's transparent efforts with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based on scientific evidence. We support the IAEA's independent review to ensure that the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water will be conducted consistent with IAEA safety standards and international law and that it will not cause any harm to humans and the environment, which is essential for the decommissioning of the site and the reconstruction of Fukushima.</p><p>Clean Energy Economy</p><p>Emphasizing that the global climate and energy crisis highlights the urgent need to accelerate the clean energy transition towards achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and to transform our energy systems, we underline the necessity of economic diversification and transformation, including in supply chains. In order to further promote clean energy transitions on a global scale, we are determined to increase our efforts and, in particular, will pursue secure, resilient, affordable, and sustainable clean energy supply chains, including those for critical minerals and clean energy technologies. In implementing energy transitions, we also reaffirm the importance of working collectively to avoid market distortions and ensuring a global level playing field. We will continue to work with international partners to realize a clean energy economy through concrete actions as laid out in the Clean Energy Economy Action Plan.</p><p>Economic Resilience and Economic Security</p><p>Ensuring economic resilience and economic security globally remains our best protection against the weaponization of economic vulnerabilities. Recalling our commitment from the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we will advance economic policies that enhance global economic resilience and economic security to protect against systemic vulnerabilities. To this end, we will engage in dialogue and follow a cooperative approach within the G7 as well as with partners beyond the G7 and globally, including in collaboration with developing countries. In so doing, we will promote international rules and norms in order to facilitate trade and promote economic resilience, based on the rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. Our efforts will include taking action to make our supply chains and those of our partners around the world more resilient, sustainable and reliable, as well as appropriate measures to promote prosperity for all. We will also promote trust and security in critical infrastructure. We will enhance ongoing collaboration to address non-market policies and practices that exacerbate strategic dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities, harm our workers and businesses, and can undermine international rules and norms. Building on our resolve in Elmau to increase vigilanceand enhance our cooperation to address risks that undermine global security and stability, we will enhance collaboration by launching the Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion to increase our collective assessment, preparedness, deterrence and response to economic coercion, and further promote cooperation with partners beyond the G7. We will deepen our strategic dialogue against malicious practices to protect global supply chains from illegitimate influence, espionage, illicit knowledge leakage, and sabotage in the digital sphere. We affirm our shared responsibility and determination to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. In this context, we hereby adopt the G7 Leaders' Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security.</p><p>We reaffirm the growing importance of critical minerals in various fields, especially for the global clean energy transition, and the need to manage economic and security risks caused by vulnerable supply chains. We support open, fair, transparent, secure, diverse, sustainable, traceable, rules- and market-based trade in critical minerals, oppose market-distorting practices and monopolistic policies on critical minerals, and reaffirm the need to build resilient, robust, responsible, and transparent critical mineral supply chains. We are committed to strengthening our preparedness and resilience against emergencies such as market disruptions, and considering ways to jointly address any such disruptions, including through the support of the IEA's 'Voluntary Critical Mineral Security Program.' We welcome joint progress in efforts to diversify supply chains, including the refining and processing of critical minerals, such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP). We will support local value creation in critical minerals supply chains in line with the WTO rules. We will promote domestic and international recycling of critical minerals in collaboration with developing countries. We affirm that strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards will ensure benefits to local communities, including people living in the vicinity of areas with mineral reserves and refining and processing plants, protect workers' rights, and promote transparency, while giving due consideration to upstream and midstream environments. In order to further promote the clean energy transition we reiterate the need to establish sustainable an resilient supply chains for critical mineral resources and products manufactured using such resources. We welcome the 'Five-Point Plan for Critical Mineral Security' adopted by G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers and instruct them to implement the plan.</p><p>Trade</p><p>We stand united in our commitment to free and fair trade as foundational principles and objectives of the rules-based multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core, which proves more important than ever in the current geopolitical environment. We confirm that honoring these foundational principles is essential to creating resilient global supply chains that are transparent, diversified, secure, sustainable, trustworthy, and reliable, and that are fair for all and responsive to the needs of global citizens. We affirm our attachment to transparency, coordination and to the respect of WTO rules in our respective policies. This global trading system must be inclusive and ensure that the prosperity it can bring is felt by all, including those that have been traditionally underrepresented. To this end, we will continue to work with non-G7 partners, in particular developing country partners, which are integral partners in supply chains and in the global trading system. Based on the outcome of the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC12) and looking ahead to achieving a successful MC13, we underscore the importance of working towards WTO reform, including by conducting discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system accessible to all Members by 2024 and by reinforcing deliberation to respond to global trade policy challenges. In addition, we call on all WTO members to work together to secure the prompt entry into force of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, to engage constructively on recommendations for additional provisions that would achieve a comprehensive agreement on fisheries subsidies, and the plurilateral initiatives including the joint statement initiatives (JSIs), and to make permanent the Moratorium on Customs Duties on Electronic Transmissions. We are committed to accelerating the WTO JSI E-Commerce negotiations and working to conclude an ambitious outcome by the end of 2023. The outcome should be high standard and commercially meaningful. Free and fair trade flows, consistent with our commitment to our multilateral trading system, play an important role in the green and just transition. We will continue our collaboration at the WTO including to facilitate and promote trade in environmental goods and services, and technologies. We reaffirm our shared concerns with non-market policies and practices, including their problematic evolution, that distort global competition, trade and investment. We will further step up our efforts to secure a level playing field through the more effective use of existing tools, as well as development of appropriate new tools and stronger international rules and norms. We will seek to ensure that our responses to unfair trading practices will not create unnecessary barriers to our partners' industries and are consistent with our WTO commitments. We reaffirm that export controls are a fundamental policy tool to address the challenges posed by the diversion of technology critical to military applications as well as for other activities that threaten global, regional, and national security. We affirm the importance of cooperation on export controls on critical and emerging technologies such as microelectronics and cyber surveillance systems to address the misuse of such technologies by malicious actors and inappropriate transfers of such technologies through research activities. We task our Trade Ministers to deepen these discussions towards the G7 Trade Ministers' Meeting in October, and to explore, both within and beyond the G7, coordinated or joint actions where appropriate against trade-related challenges, including economic coercion.</p><p>Food Security</p><p>We remain deeply concerned with the ongoing and worsening global food security and nutrition situation, with the world facing highest risk of famine in a generation. Multiple factors including the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring energy prices, the climate crisis and shocks, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water security and armed conflicts have contributed to the global disruption and disorder in food systems and supply chains and the deterioration in global food security in recent years. In particular, Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine has drastically aggravated the global food security crisis. We are committed to continuing our efforts to address pressing issues to improve global food security including through initiatives already launched by the G7 and relevant international organizations, building on the positive outcomes achieved. Stressing that we have exceeded our joint commitment of $14 billion to the global food security announced at the 2022 G7 Elmau Summit, we will continue to provide assistance in the food and nutrition related sectors to vulnerable countries and regions affected by the current food security crisis, in particular in Africa and the Middle East. Given the scale of the needs across the Horn of Africa, we have collectively met our commitment from Elmau and have effectively delivered assistance to tackle one of the worst droughts in the region's history. We also call on other international donors to step up their contributions in this regard. We further call on Russia to lift its measures that hinder the exports of Russian grain and fertilizers. Given Ukraine's essential role as a major exporter of food to the world, we are seriously concerned about the current and future impact of Russia's deliberate disruption of Ukraine's agricultural sector on food security in the most vulnerable countries. Building on our commitment made at Elmau, we continue to provide support for the restoration of Ukraine's agriculture sector, including support to its efforts in identifying and evidencing illegal seizure of Ukrainian grains by Russia, through the creation of a grain database which can be used to verify the origin of grain shipments. We reaffirm the importance of the EU-Ukraine Solidarity Lanes and President Zelenskyy's Grain from Ukraine Initiative. We reiterate the critical importance of continued and scaled-up implementation of the UN and Trkiye-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative (BSGI) in order to further facilitate grain exports from Ukraine and enable stable supply to those in need. We call on Russia to stop threatening global food supplies and to allow the BSGI to operate at its maximum potential and for as long as necessary. We reiterate the importance of ensuring rules-based, open, fair, transparent, predictable, and non-discriminatory trade and avoiding unjustified restrictive trade measures to keep the food and agricultural markets open and call on our G20 partners to do the same. We welcome the Ministerial Decision on World Food Programme (WFP) Food Purchases Exemption from Export Prohibitions or Restrictions adopted at the MC12 and call for its full implementation. We call for more concrete actions to address export restrictions imposed by agricultural producer countries on global food security, recognizing that such measures have a disproportionate effect on countries at greater risk of famine and acute food insecurity. We emphasize the necessity of market transparency and accurate information backed by neutral and impartial data and analysis to prevent arbitrary measures and reduce market volatility in addressing ongoing and future food crises, and commit to strengthening the G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as well as various efforts by international organizations in this regard. We underscore the importance of strengthening the capacity of low and lower-middle income countries to collect, analyze and use high quality agricultural, market and food security data and maintain the quality of data. We also recognize the value of dialogue between food exporting countries and importing countries to develop a shared understanding on crisis responses.</p><p>We share the view that it is essential to focus on each human and enable stable access to affordable, safe, sufficient and nutritious food for each and every individual. In our pursuit to ensure that all people can progressively realize their right to adequate food, we affirm the need to protect and assist members of the most vulnerable populations, including women and children, in all aspects of food security from short-term food crisis responses through medium to long-term efforts to make food systems sustainable. Nutrition is also fundamental from the viewpoint of a human centered approach, and we highlight the importance of improving access to healthy diets, including through school meal programs. We recognize the urgent need of establishing inclusive, resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems including through enhancing, diversifying and ensuring sustainability of local, regional and global food supply chains as well as through solving structural bottlenecks. This includes increasing local production capacities by making use of existing domestic agricultural resources and by facilitating trade, sustainable productivity growth with climate adaptation and mitigation and biodiversity conservation, and sustainable food consumption. We promote a wide range of innovations and technology which is suitable for local, environmental and farming conditions and benefits all stakeholders including smallholder farmers. We also underscore the role of the private sector, including small and medium enterprises and startups, in research and development (R and D) as well as responsible investment. We recognize the need to maintain the availability, affordability and accessibility of fertilizers, to diversify the production to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions, and to promote more efficient and responsible use of fertilizers and soil health, including through the use of appropriate and safe fertilizers, for stable and sustainable agricultural production. We acknowledge the importance of supporting fertilizer value chains including local fertilizer production in line with WTO rules and through supporting the use of local sources of energy in consistency with a 1.5\u00b0C warming limit and the goals of the Paris Agreement. We strengthen broader partnerships on those efforts including through the UN Food Systems Stocktaking Moments. We commit to taking concrete steps with partner countries as outlined in the annexed 'Hiroshima Action Statement for Resilient Global Food Security', and call for broader cooperation in the international community.</p><p>Health</p><p>We renew our strong commitment to developing and strengthening the global health architecture (GHA) with the World Health Organization (WHO) at its core for future public health emergencies to break the cycle of panic and neglect, recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic has made an unprecedented impact on the international community. To this end, we commit to further enhancing political momentum toward more coordinated and sustained leader-level governance for health emergency prevention, preparedness and response (PPR) that ensures legitimacy, representation, equity, and effectiveness, noting the ongoing discussions including on a new instrument on pandemic PPR (WHO CA+), targeted amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), and the UN General Assembly (UNGA) High-Level Meeting (HLM) on pandemic PPR in September 2023 and the need to avoid duplication and ensure coherence between these processes, stressing the leading role of WHO. We also applaud the landmark decision at the 75th WHA to work towards increasing the share of assessed contributions to 50 percent of WHO's 2022-2023 base budget, and which takes into account the importance of monitoring of budgetary proposals as well as progress on reforms, with a view to sustainably finance the organisation to fulfil its leading and coordinating role in global health. We also reaffirm our commitment to strengthening collaboration between Finance and Health Ministries for pandemic PPR including through the ongoing and essential work of the G20 Joint Finance and Health Task Force (JFHTF). We welcome the launch of the Pandemic Fund (PF), look forward to the successful execution of its first call for proposals, and encourage active participation and increasing contributions to the PF from a broader donor base. We also commit to working together, including by sharing work plans and tracking, encouraging efforts and progress in priority countries to achieve the G7's target of supporting at least 100 Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) in implementing the core capacities required in the IHR, for another 5 years until 2027 as committed in 2022. We also highlight the need for strengthening financing for pandemic response. To this end, we commit to thoroughly assess how existing financing sources can be used in pandemic response and to explore a surge financing framework that allows us to complement existing mechanisms through better coordination and deploy necessary funds quickly and efficiently in response to outbreaks without accumulating idle cash. In this respect, we welcome the G7 Shared Understanding on Finance-Health Coordination and PPR Financing endorsed by the G7 Finance and Health Ministers at their joint session. Reaffirming that strengthening international norms and regulations is essential to enhance pandemic PPR, guided by equity, we reiterate our commitment to contributing to and sustaining momentum on the negotiations of WHO CA+ with a view to adopting it by May 2024 and on the negotiations of targeted amendments to strengthen the IHR, together with all stakeholders. Furthermore, we reiterate the importance of timely, transparent and systematic sharing of pathogens, data and information in a safe and secure manner, ensuring the respect of relevant data protection rules, for multisectoral and integrated surveillance of emerging and ongoing health threats both in ordinary times and in emergencies, in line with the G7 Pact for Pandemic Readiness. We also recognize the importance of strengthening and maintaining sufficient and high-quality human resources for health worldwide at all times, such as the public health and emergency workforce including consideration of Global Health Emergency Corps. We will support the further enhancement of a global network of experts and trainings, including through initiatives such as the WHO Academy, promote decent work with equal payment for work of equal value and protect health workers during emergencies and conflicts among others. We recognize the integral role civil society plays, including by reaching those in vulnerable situations, and recommit to working together for a healthier future for all.</p><p>We commit to reverse the first global decline in life expectancy in more than seven decades emphasizing the importance of achieving UHC by 2030 and accelerating progress toward SDG 3. We recommit to working alongside global partners to assist countries to achieve UHC by supporting primary health care (PHC) and developing and restoring essential health services, to achieve better than pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2025, as part of our effort to strengthen health systems in ordinary times. We commit to supporting countries to strengthen PHC delivery, including through health workforce strengthening We also commit to support bringing survival rates back to better than pre-pandemic levels, including by reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality, and consistent with the full range of SDG targets and indicators related to UHC on which we will also support progress. We recognize the importance of financial risk protection to prevent people from slipping into poverty due to health care costs. To this end, we endorse the 'G7 Global Plan for UHC Action Agenda' and note the importance of a global hub function, in support of relevant international organizations, including for financing, knowledge management, and human resources on UHC. We reaffirm the essential role of UHC in addressing various health challenges significantly set back by the pandemic, including in humanitarian contexts, such as tackling communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, polio, measles, cholera, and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR), non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including mental health conditions, realizing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all, and promoting routine immunization, healthy ageing, and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). We are committed to spearheading research in this regard, including with a focus on understanding post COVID-19 conditions. We noted the historic outcome of the Global Fund's 7th replenishment and welcome the financial support from the G7 and further countries towards ending the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. We call for continued support to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) to stay on track for polio eradication by 2026. We will build on the success of the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit in 2021 for the Paris N4G in 2024 to improve nutrition. We also commit to further promoting comprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) for all individuals, including maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, especially in vulnerable circumstances. Recognizing the increasing need for overarching, system-level coordination and alignment of global health partnerships including the Global Health Initiatives and their interface, we will take collective actions to avoid fragmentation and duplication, ensure accountability, maximize impacts, and reinforce country leadership with a view to enhancing governance in global health and to supporting the achievement of UHC. In this regard, we look forward to the outcome of the Future of Global Health Initiatives. We reiterate our determination to further contribute to achieving UHC, including through making the most of and ensuring synergies among the upcoming UNGA HLMs on UHC, tuberculosis, and pandemic PPR. In order to contribute to global health towards the post COVID-19 era, with a view to supporting the achievement of UHC as well as strengthening PPR, we highlight our financial contributions totaling more than $48 billion from the public and private sectors. We also call for further domestic resource mobilization as well as efficient use of existing resources. We emphasize the important role of the private sector towards sustainable financing in global health, including through impact investments and endorse the Triple I (Impact Investments Initiative) for Global Health.</p><p>We reaffirm that innovative initiatives including those related to digital health are keys to strengthening GHA and achieving UHC. We will reiterate the urgent need to foster innovation and to strengthen research and development of safe, effective, quality-assured and affordable medical countermeasures (MCMs) as underlined by the 100 Days Mission. We commit to enhancing equitable access to MCM, including by addressing issues relating to manufacturing and delivery. In this regards, we will continue to contribute to ongoing processes, including in the G20, on an end-to-end MCM ecosystem, aligned with the ongoing discussions on the WHO CA+ and which should actively contribute to the diversification of MCM production and address the priority of the most vulnerable partner's needs and expectations, including in terms of global governance, in cooperation with relevant partners including the WHO, the WB, UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Global Fund, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) and Unitaid and Medicines Patent Pool, regional organizations and the private sector. To this end, we announce the G7 Hiroshima Vision for Equitable Access to MCMs and launch the MCM Delivery Partnership for equitable access (MCDP) to contribute to more equitable access to and delivery of MCMs based on the principles of equity, inclusivity, efficiency, affordability, quality, accountability, agility and speed. We commit to work across providers of development finance, for the purpose of identifying concrete options this summer for providing for the liquidity for global health organizations to procure and deliver MCMs earlier in a crisis. This supports the mapping exercise for surge financing to be conducted by the WHO and World Bank and presented at the G20 Finance and Health Task Force and the UNGA HLM, contributing to ongoing negotiations on the WHO CA+. We also reiterate our commitment to addressing global health threats including those exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution through integrated measures and by applying a holistic One Health approach. Recognizing the rapid escalation of AMR globally, we continue to commit to exploring and implementing push and pull incentives to accelerate R and D of antimicrobials as well as promoting antimicrobial access and stewardship for their prudent and appropriate use toward the UNGA HLM on AMR in 2024. We remain committed to promoting policies and resources to care for people living with dementia and welcome the development of potentially disease modifying therapies for the various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Labor</p><p>We emphasize the importance of investment in human capital to ensure a just transition, in response to structural changes such as digital and green transformations as well as demographic changes including societies that are ageing, in part due to declining birth rates. In order to facilitate these transformations, we commit to supporting individuals through reskilling and upskilling measures, along with a combination of appropriate social protection and active labor market policies. As reskilling and upskilling to support workers to adapt to these changes are investments in human capital and should not be seen as a cost, we must continue to provide adequate investment necessary to address workforce transition needs including vocational training and life-long learning. We commit to efforts towards achieving a virtuous cycle of workers' well-being and social and economic vitality, which will lead to sustainable growth and real wage growth in line with productivity, contributing in turn to further investment in human capital. We emphasize that freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining play an important role in promoting decent work and wage growth. We are resolved to build an inclusive labor market that ensures decent and good quality jobs for all and leaves no one behind, especially, women and under-represented groups, including persons with disabilities, older persons and youth, while engaging constructively with social partners and other stakeholders. We also work towards quality job creation, universal access to social protection, and further improving gender equality in the labor market. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women and girls, and has highlighted the unequal distribution of care work as a key cause of gender inequalities, while showing the essential role paid and unpaid care work plays in the functioning of our societies and economies. We commit to addressing underlying discriminatory social and gender norms, such as unequal sharing of paid and unpaid care-work and housework, promoting and protecting social security including parental leave, providing support for childcare and other field of care work and care economy, including by facilitating access to infrastructures and long-term care. In particular, we reaffirm the need to support and promote parenthood protection to ensure parents can combine work and family and personal life and actively contribute to all spheres of our society. We also highlight the need to recognize, reduce and redistribute unpaid care, reward care workers fairly, while generating sufficient care jobs to meet the demand for care, and give care workers representation in social dialogue and collective bargaining. We recognize the importance of enhancing work engagement and worker retention through various measures such as promoting health and well-being at work, ensuring occupational safety and health, and supporting the inclusive and equitable career development of workers. We commit to promoting decent work in line with SDG 8, including through technical cooperation, as well as ensuring respect for international labor standards and human rights in global value chains, in particular the fundamental conventions adopted by the International Labor Organisation (ILO). We reiterate our commitment to the effective abolition of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and child labor. We reaffirm our commitment to taking measures to strengthen our cooperation and collective efforts towards eradicating all forms of forced labor from global supply chains. We commit to continuing to promote decent work and protect rights-holders in global supply chains through a smart mix of mandatory and voluntary measures, including through legislation, regulations, incentives and guidance for enterprises and to engage constructively in discussions at the UN and the ILO in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders to explore ideas and options for a consensus-based legally binding instrument at the international level that adds value to the existing legal and policy approaches and is implementable. We endorse the Action Plan for Promoting Career Development and Greater Resilience to Structural Changes developed by Labor and Employment Ministers.</p><p>Education</p><p>We commit to making progress for ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education, including vocational education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all to build resilient, just and prospering societies. Recent crises have led to decreased access to education and increased learning loss amongst children and youth, especially girls, and those in the most marginalized and vulnerable situations. As education is a catalyst to achieving all of the SDGs, we reaffirm the importance of upholding education and building more resilient education systems, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. We reiterate our firm determination to uphold the G7's previous commitments to protecting educational opportunities for all learners, and to promoting gender equality as well as the empowerment of all women and girls in all their diversity, in and through education including by prioritizing global ODA in this regard. We welcome the UNSG's Transforming Education Summit (TES) in September 2022, and call for continued support to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), Education Cannot Wait (ECW) and UN agencies including the UNESCO and UNICEF as key partners in helping countries to build stronger education systems for the most marginalized children. We also reiterate the importance of foundational learning and the need for the G7 to increase investment in people in a more equitable and efficient way to provide quality learning opportunities that prepare all learners, especially children with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive and improve their own well-being, noting that education is a human right. We continue to break down gender-related barriers and underlying discriminatory social norms from pre-primary through higher education for more resilient, inclusive and gender-transformative education. We continue to encourage international exchanges between youth and international talent mobility and circulation among academics, students, and researchers, as well as cooperation between higher education and research institutions. We acknowledge the importance of investment in support of human resources that can contribute to resolving social issues while simultaneously achieving economic growth through education. We will strive for an educational environment and lifelong learning opportunities where every child can fulfil their own potential, including through the improvement of instruction. This could include promoting small class size, an improved Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environment and the effective use of digital technology to support teaching and learning, while not exacerbating the digital equality gaps.</p><p>Digital</p><p>We recognize that, while rapid technological change has been strengthening societies and economies, the international governance of new digital technologies has not necessarily kept pace. As the pace of technological evolution accelerates, we affirm the importance to address common governance challenges and to identify potential gaps and fragmentation in global technology governance. In areas such as AI, immersive technologies such as the metaverses and quantum information science and technology and other emerging technologies, the governance of the digital economy should continue to be updated in line with our shared democratic values. These include fairness, accountability, transparency, safety, protection from online harassment, hate and abuse and respect for privacy and human rights, fundamental freedoms and the protection of personal data. We will work with technology companies and other relevant stakeholders to drive the responsible innovation and implementation of technologies, ensuring that safety and security is prioritized, and that platforms are tackling the threats of child sexual exploitation and abuse on their platforms, and upholding the children's rights to safety and privacy online. We continue to discuss ways to advance technology for democracy and to cooperate on new and emerging technologies and their social implementation, and look forward to an inclusive, multi-stakeholder dialogue on digital issues, including on Internet Governance, through relevant fora, including the OECD Global Forum on Technology. We commit to further advancing multi-stakeholder approaches to the development of standards for AI, respectful of legally binding frameworks, and recognize the importance of procedures that advance transparency, openness, fair processes, impartiality, privacy and inclusiveness to promote responsible AI. We stress the importance of international discussions on AI governance and interoperability between AI governance frameworks, while we recognize that approaches and policy instruments to achieve the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary across G7 members. We support the development of tools for trustworthy AI through multi-stakeholder international organizations, and encourage the development and adoption of international technical standards in standards development organizations through multi-stakeholder processes. We recognize the need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI, which is increasingly prominent across countries and sectors, and encourage international organizations such as the OECD to consider analysis on the impact of policy developments and Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) to conduct practical projects. In this respect, we task relevant ministers to establish the Hiroshima AI process, through a G7 working group, in an inclusive manner and in cooperation with the OECD and GPAI, for discussions on generative AI by the end of this year. These discussions could include topics such as governance, safeguard of intellectual property rights including copy rights, promotion of transparency, response to foreign information manipulation, including disinformation, and responsible utilization of these technologies. We welcome the Action Plan for promoting global interoperability between tools for trustworthy AI from the Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting. We recognize the potential of immersive technologies, and virtual worlds, such as metaverses to provide innovative opportunities, in all industrial and societal sectors, as well as to promote sustainability. For this purpose, governance, public safety, and human rights challenges should be addressed at the global level. We task our relevant Ministers to consider collective approaches in this area, including in terms of interoperability, portability and standards, with the support of the OECD. We express our interest in possible joint cooperation in research and development on computing technologies. We also task our relevant Ministers to consider ways to further promote digital trade.</p><p>We reaffirm that cross-border data flows, information, ideas and knowledge generate higher productivity, greater innovation, and improved sustainable development, while raising challenges related to privacy, data protection, intellectual property protection, and security including that of data and cloud infrastructure. We reiterate the importance of facilitating Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) to enable trustworthy cross-border data flows and invigorate the digital economy as a whole, while preserving governments' ability to address legitimate public interest. We stress our intention to operationalize this concept and our support for cooperation within the G7 and beyond to work towards identifying commonalities, complementarities and elements of convergence between existing regulatory approaches and instruments enabling data to flow with trust, in order to foster future interoperability such as through supporting multi-stakeholder engagement, leveraging the role of technologies, and clarifying domestic and municipal policies and due processes. In this regard, we endorse the Annex on G7 Vision for Operationalising DFFT and its Priorities from the Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting, and the establishment of the Institutional Arrangement for Partnership. We task our relevant Ministers to continue working to deliver substantive outcomes and subsequently report back to us. We welcome the OECD Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities as an instrument to increase trust in cross-border data flows among countries committed to democratic values and the rule of law. We emphasize our opposition to internet fragmentation and the use of digital technologies to infringe on human rights. In this context, we should counter unjustified obstacles to the free flow of data, lacking transparency, and arbitrarily operated, which should be distinguished from our measures implemented to achieve the legitimate public policy interests of each country. We seek to increase trust across our digital ecosystem and to counter the influence of authoritarian approaches. We recognize the importance of secure and resilient digital infrastructure as the foundation of society and the economy. We are committed to deepen our cooperation within the G7 and with like-minded partners to support and enhance network resilience by measures such as extending secure routes of submarine cables. We welcome supplier diversification efforts in ICTS supply chains and continue to discuss market trends towards open, interoperable approaches, alongside secure, resilient and established architecture in a technology neutral way. Under the JapaneseG7 Presidency and against the background of early deployments of Open Radio Access Network (RAN), we have exchanged views on open architectures and security-related aspects and opportunities. We recognize the need to bridge the digital divides, including the gender digital divide, and the importance of initiatives to use data and technology for cities, such as smart city initiatives, to promote digital inclusion and address challenges in urban development. We will facilitate inclusive development and enable greater employability and movement of digital experts, and restate our commitment to supporting other countries to increase digital access under principles of equity, universality and affordability while ensuring that security, interoperability, the protection of personal data and respect for human rights including gender equality are built into global connectivity.</p><p>Science and Technology</p><p>We support the development of advanced technologies, research infrastructures and highly-skilled human resource networks that will drive innovation to solve global challenges and enable the next stage of economic growth. To this end, we promote international talent mobility and circulation. The G7 will promote open science by equitably disseminating scientific knowledge, publicly funded research outputs including research data and scholarly publications following the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles. This will enable researchers and people to benefit from and contribute to creating knowledge, innovation and solutions to global challenges. We further commit to working together to promote responsible global science and technology cooperation and use of emerging technologies such as advanced computing and biotechnology with partners sharing common values and principles in research and innovation. This includes a better understanding of the seas and the ocean in the context of climate change and utilizing very large research infrastructures. We are committed to fostering and promoting a common understanding of values and principles in research and innovation through dedicated multilateral dialogues, including in the area of research security and research integrity, and international joint research based on the philosophy of open science. We welcome the forthcoming launch of the G7 Virtual Academy and release of the Best Practices Paper on Research Security and Integrity. These efforts will contribute to addressing the various challenges that arise at the intersection of security, economy, and scientific research.</p><p>We reiterate our commitment to promoting the safe and sustainable use of outer space, given our ever-greater reliance on space systems. Restating the importance of addressing the issues of space debris, we strongly support the implementation of international guidelines adopted at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space as urgent and necessary. We welcome national efforts to develop further solutions for space debris mitigation and remediation as well as further research and development of orbital debris mitigation and remediation technologies. Furthermore, we commit not to conducting destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile testing and encourage others to follow suit in order to ensure the security, stability and sustainability of outer space.</p><p>Gender</p><p>Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls is fundamental for a resilient, fair, and prosperous society. We endeavor to work with all segments of society to ensure full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls in all their diversity as well as LGBTQIA+ persons in politics, economics, education and all other spheres of society, and to consistently mainstream gender equality in all policy areas. In this respect, we commit to redoubling our efforts to overcome longstanding structural barriers and to addressing harmful gender norms, stereotypes, roles, and practices through such means as education and achieve a society where diversity, human rights and dignity are respected, promoted and protected and all people can enjoy vibrant lives free from violence and discrimination independent of gender identity or expression or sexual orientation. We welcome the work of the Gender Equality Advisory Council (GEAC) and look forward to strengthening it further. We look forward to the first revision of the G7 Dashboard on Gender Gaps and the publication of the first implementation report this year, which aims to monitor past G7 commitments to make progress on gender equality.</p><p>We express our strong concern about the rollback of women's and girls' rights in particular in time of crisis and we strongly condemn all violations and abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms for women and girls and LGBTQIA+ people around the world. We further recognize the essential and transformative role of comprehensive SRHR in gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment, and in supporting diversity, including of sexual orientations and gender identities. We reaffirm our full commitment to achieving comprehensive SRHR for all , including by addressing access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care. We are committed to championing, advancing and defending gender equality and the rights of women and girls in all their diversity, at home and abroad, and will work together to thwart attempts to undermine and reverse hard-won progress in this area. In this regard, we commit to advancing, implementing and strengthening the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda including its application to disaster risk reduction (DRR), through partnership with the WPS-Focal Points Network and support for National Action Plan development, and to promote intersectional approaches. We highlight the leading role of women in preventing violent conflict, delivering relief and recovery efforts, and forging lasting peace, and pledge to champion the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace and political processes. We commit to strengthening our efforts to eliminate conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, and the importance of providing comprehensive support and meaningful participation for victims and survivors, using a survivor-centered approach. We further commit to eliminating all forms of sexual and gender-based harassment and abuse both offline and online as well as aid-related sexual exploitation and abuse. We are committed to ensuring the right to education for all, and emphasize the importance of promoting equitable access to safe, gender-transformative quality education as well as to taking measures to close the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sectors and education, and close the gender digital gap. We see this as key to promote women's entrepreneurship, which is an essential building block to address the climate, nature and development challenges. We also commit to promoting reskilling and upskilling, fostering decent work conditions, strengthening financial inclusion of women in all their diversity, and eliminating the gender pay gap. We further reiterate our commitments to promoting women's full empowerment as well as their full and equal participation in decision-making processes at all levels, including in leadership positions. We recognize that quality care plays an essential role in the functioning of our societies and economies, but is a key cause of gender inequalities due to its gender unequal distribution.</p><p>To advance our commitments, we emphasize the need to overcome the fragmentation and marginalization of gender equality issues by enhancing our efforts to integrate and deepening gender mainstreaming for a substantial transformation of our societies. In this regard, we call for a continuous, holistic and comprehensive approach to promote gender equality by creating a 'nexus' that bridges the political and security, economic and social spheres and advocate for maximizing the efficiency and the impact of multi-sectorial policies and of our actions across diverse dimensions of policy implementation. We stress the importance of such a nexus approach in our foreign and sustainable development policy and in our ODA and endeavor to support the nexus. We reaffirm our commitment to make every effort to collectively increase the share of our bilateral allocable ODA advancing gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment over the coming years. In this regard, we welcome 'the Fact Sheet: Promoting Gender Mainstreaming through the nexus approach' made by our experts and look forward to further progress in this area.</p><p>Human Rights, Refugees, Migration, Democracy</p><p>We reaffirm our commitment to upholding human rights and dignity of all, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, so that everyone can participate fully and equally in society. We commit to firmly speaking out against human rights violations and abuses, and at the same time, listening to and assisting the countries and civil society organizations that seek to defend and promote human rights through dialogue and cooperation. Recognizing the need to deepen discussions within and beyond the G7 on business and human rights, we intend to strengthen cooperation and collective efforts, including by accelerating exchange of information, towards ensuring respect for human rights and international labor standards in business activities and global supply chains, and further enhancing resilience, predictability and certainty for businesses, and call upon others to join us in these efforts. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting refugees, supporting forcibly displaced persons and supporting host countries and communities, ensuring the full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of refugees and displaced persons, and defending and promoting the rights of marginalized people or persons facing vulnerable conditions exacerbated by conflict, crisis, and displacement, including freedom from sexual and gender-based violence. We call upon the international community to follow suit. We commit to fighting against impunity and holding perpetrators to account for the most serious crimes of international concern, including conflict-related sexual violence, together with improving documentation. In this regard, we recall the need to strengthen international architecture to prevent conflict-related sexual violence in the future. We acknowledge the importance of the discussions of the International Law Commission's draft articles on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity. We continue to work with the international community towards the second Global Refugee Forum in December 2023. We reaffirm our commitment to support the full inclusion of refugees, in the spirit of international cooperation and in line with the Global Compact on Refugees, national policies, legislation, and circumstances, ensuring full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p><p>We reaffirm our commitment to ensuring the safe, orderly, and regular migration around the world. We recognize the important economic and social benefits that migrants can bring to our countries. We commit to ensure full respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their migration status. We remain committed to preventing irregular and often highly dangerous migration whether by land or sea. We commit to joint efforts to tackle the organized criminal networks which facilitate illegal migration and the dangerous journey of migrants and asylum seekers, profiting off some of the most vulnerable. We call for firmness in dealing with this ruthless criminality that puts lives in danger and poses risks to the internal security of G7 partners. In this regard, we will intensify efforts to break the business model of organized criminal networks, including through cooperation to disrupt the supply chains that enable the criminal and exploitative operations of those engaged in the trafficking and smuggling of human beings. To this end, we will task relevant Ministers to deepen partnerships to enhance our understanding of the root causes and work together with partners around the world to address this complex challenge.</p><p>We reaffirm our shared belief that democracy is the most enduring means to advance peace, prosperity, equality and sustainable development. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting the information environment by supporting media freedom and online freedom, including protection from online harassment and abuse, internet shutdowns and disruptions, as well as addressing foreign information manipulation and interference, including disinformation, which is designed to undermine trust in democratic institutions, and sow discord in the international community. We strongly condemn the widespread use of information manipulation and interference by Russia in order to gain support for its war of aggression against Ukraine and to obscure the facts of its aggression. Through the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM), we will work to strengthen our collective efforts to counter threats to democracy, including such manipulation, with full respect for international human rights law, in particular freedom of expression. We will work towards ensuring that fact-based, quality and trustworthy information is promoted, and call on digital platforms to support this approach. We will increase cooperation on these issues with government and non-governmental partners from all regions who share the determination to promote access to such information, including through supporting relevant international initiatives, such as the Partnership for Information and Democracy, and efforts by the UN and OECD.</p><p>Countering Terrorism, Violent Extremism and Transnational Organized Crime / Upholding the Rule of Law / Anti-Corruption</p><p>We reiterate our strong commitment to working together with all relevant actors to counter all forms of terrorism and violent extremism, both online and offline, as well as transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, child sexual abuse and exploitation, corruption, fraud, intellectual property theft, ransomware threats, cybercrime and environmental crimes, as well as money laundering and terrorist financing in a unified, coordinated, inclusive, transparent and human-rights-based, gender-responsive manner. In countering the exploitation of new and emerging technologies for terrorist purposes and countering the misuses of technologies for criminal purposes, we will continue our utmost efforts to enhance global cooperation and digital response capacity. In this regard, building on our collaboration and on efforts through existing frameworks such as the Christchurch Call, and recalling previous commitments, including maintaining tightly controlled lawful access, we call on the private sector to step up their efforts to address the problem of dissemination of terrorist and violent extremist content online and to prioritize safety by design, and stop, in particular, child sexual exploitation and abuse on their platforms. We support the efforts of our partner countries to sign and ratify the relevant international agreements such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), and those of the Council of Europe such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, in the wide spectrum of cooperation by criminal justice and other relevant authorities that form the basis for efficient cross-border cooperation. We also recognize the significant public health and security threat of illicit synthetic drugs and will strengthen our cooperation to address it, engaging with other willing countries and the private sector.</p><p>We will also strengthen bilateral, regional and multilateral coordination and cooperation in the field of law and justice, such as providing technical assistance to countries to develop and implement laws, and capacity building related to the justice sector. We will continue to step up our fight against corruption, promoting good governance and strengthening accountable, transparent, equitable and community-oriented law enforcement to make progress on many of our shared priorities, which will lead to safer and more secure societies and thus contribute to the promotion of the rule of law and respect for human rights. We further recognize that corruption and related illicit finance and proceeds of crime drain public resources, can often fuel organized crime, enable kleptocratic systems to accumulate wealth and power at the expense of citizens, and undermine democratic governance. We will pursue a stronger and more unified approach in rigorously enforcing international anti-corruption obligations and standards, and enhancing law enforcement cooperation, including through relevant regional and international organizations, and holding corrupt actors accountable. Recalling the importance of beneficial ownership transparency for the integrity and transparency of democratic systems, we reaffirm the importance of supporting African partners in establishing and strengthening registers of beneficial ownership.</p><p>Regional Affairs/China</p><p>We stand together on core foreign policy and security challenges to build a more secure and prosperous future. We also reaffirm our determination to work with a wide range of partners to address pressing global challenges and to ensure that the international system is able to respond effectively to these issues.</p><p>We stand together as G7 partners on the following elements, which underpin our respective relations with China:</p><p>We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China, recognizing the importance of engaging candidly with and expressing our concerns directly to China. We act in our national interest. It is necessary to cooperate with China, given its role in the international community and the size of its economy, on global challenges as well as areas of common interest.</p><p>We call on China to engage with us, including in international fora, on areas such as the climate and biodiversity crisis and the conservation of natural resources in the framework of the Paris and Kunming-Montreal Agreements, addressing vulnerable countries' debt sustainability and financing needs, global health and macroeconomic stability.</p><p>Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China's economic progress and development. A growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. We are not decoupling or turning inwards. At the same time, we recognize that economic resilience requires de-risking and diversifying. We will take steps, individually and collectively, to invest in our own economic vibrancy. We will reduce excessive dependencies in our critical supply chains.</p><p>With a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China, and strengthening the international trading system, we will push for a level playing field for our workers and companies. We will seek to address the challenges posed by China's non-market policies and practices, which distort the global economy. We will counter malign practices, such as illegitimate technology transfer or data disclosure. We will foster resilience to economic coercion. We also recognize the necessity of protecting certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten our national security without unduly limiting trade and investment.</p><p>We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas. We strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.</p><p>We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to security and prosperity in the international community. There is no change in the basic positions of the G7 members on Taiwan, including stated one China policies. We call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.</p><p>We will keep voicing our concerns about the human rights situation in China, including in Tibet and Xinjiang where forced labor is of major concern to us. We call on China to honor its commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, which enshrine rights, freedoms and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong.</p><p>We call on China to act in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular relations, and not to conduct interference activities aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities, the integrity of our democratic institutions and our economic prosperity.</p><p>We call on China to press Russia to stop its military aggression, and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw its troops from Ukraine. We encourage China to support a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on territorial integrity and the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, including through its direct dialogue with Ukraine.</p><p>There is no legal basis for China's expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea, and we oppose China's militarization activities in the region. We emphasize the universal and unified character of the UNCLOS and reaffirm UNCLOS's important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the oceans and the seas. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 12, 2016, is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings, and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties.</p><p>North Korea</p><p>We strongly condemn North Korea's unprecedented number of unlawful ballistic missile launches, each of which violated multiple UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs). We demand that North Korea refrain from any other destabilizing or escalatory actions, including any further nuclear tests or launches that use ballistic missile technology, which undermine regional stability and pose a grave threat to international peace and security. Such reckless actions must be met with a swift, united, and robust international response. This must include further significant measures to be taken by the UN Security Council. We reiterate our unwavering commitment to the goal of North Korea's complete, verifiable, and irreversible abandonment of its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in accordance with relevant UNSCRs. We are concerned about North Korea's choice to prioritize its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs over the welfare of the people in North Korea. We call on North Korea to accept repeated offers of dialogue, including from Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. We urge North Korea to respect human rights, facilitate access for international humanitarian organizations, and resolve the abductions issue immediately.</p><p>Myanmar</p><p>We remain deeply concerned about the deteriorating security, humanitarian, human rights, and political situation in Myanmar, and we express our solidarity with its people. We continue to support ASEAN's efforts including its continued engagements with all stakeholders in Myanmar to implement the Five-Point Consensus, including through Indonesia as the ASEAN Chair and ASEAN special envoy to Myanmar. We continue to call on the Myanmar military to immediately cease all violence, release all political prisoners and those arbitrarily detained, create an environment for an inclusive and peaceful dialogue, and return the country to a genuinely democratic path. We reiterate our call on all states to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar. We also call for full, safe, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people, especially the most vulnerable.</p><p>Afghanistan</p><p>We note with grave concern increased threats to stability and the dire humanitarian and economic situation in Afghanistan. We call on the Taliban to uphold its counterterrorism commitments and to ensure the territory of Afghanistan cannot be used to threaten or attack any country, to plan or finance terrorist acts, or to shelter and train terrorists. We express our strongest opposition to the Taliban's systematic violations on human rights and fundamental freedoms, and call for the immediate reversal of unacceptable decisions, especially those against women and girls. All Afghans must enjoy full, equal, and meaningful participation in all spheres of public life, and have access to humanitarian assistance and basic services. We call upon the Taliban to respect UNSCR 2681/2023 and the UN Charter, including Article 8, and to ensure unrestricted operations of the UN in Afghanistan. To remedy the persistent lack of political inclusivity and representation, we urge the Taliban to take significant steps to engage in credible, inclusive and Afghan-led national dialogue, in which all Afghans can be involved. We recognize the need for conveying unified messages to the Taliban in coordination with other international partners.</p><p>Iran</p><p>We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon. We remain deeply concerned about Iran's unabated escalation of its nuclear program, which has no credible civilian justification and brings it dangerously close to actual weapon-related activities. A diplomatic solution remains the best way to resolve this issue. In that context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action continues to provide a useful reference. We call on Iran to take prompt and concrete actions to fulfill its legal obligations and political commitments, including nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards obligations. We reiterate our profound concern over Iran's systemic human rights violations and abuses, including its repression of popular feminist protest as well as the targeting of individuals, including women, girls, minority groups, and journalists, in and outside of Iran. We call on Iran's leadership to end all unjust and arbitrary detentions.</p><p>We express our grave concern regarding Iran's continued destabilizing activities, including the transfer of missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies to state and non-state actors and proxy groups, in breach of UNSCRs including 2231 and 2216. Iran must stop supporting Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. In particular, we call upon Iran to cease transferring armed UAVs, which have been used to attack Ukraine's critical infrastructure and kill Ukrainian civilians. We welcome initiatives to improve bilateral relations and de-escalate tensions in the region, including Iran and Saudi Arabia's recent agreement to restore ties. We emphasize the importance of ensuring maritime security in the Middle East's waterways and call on Iran not to interfere with the lawful exercise of navigational rights and freedoms by all vessels.</p><p>Israel and Palestine</p><p>We call on Israelis and Palestinians to take steps to build trust toward the realization of a two-state solution. To this end, all parties must refrain from unilateral actions, including settlement activities and incitement to violence. We reiterate our support for the historic status quo in Jerusalem. We welcome the recent meetings between Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, and the United States and hope their commitments will be fulfilled in good faith. We will continue our support for Palestinian economic self-reliance and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.</p><p>Syria</p><p>We remain firmly committed to an inclusive, UN-facilitated political process consistent with UNSCR 2254 in Syria. We reaffirm that the international community should only consider normalization and reconstruction assistance once there is authentic and enduring progress towards a political solution. We express our continued support for the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and are committed to accountability for those responsible for the use of chemical weapons and violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable. We call for full and unhindered humanitarian access to all Syrians in need, particularly through UN cross-border aid for which there is no alternative in scope or scale. We remain committed to the enduring defeat of ISIS, including durable solutions for ISIS detainees and displaced persons remaining in Northeast Syria.</p><p>Middle East and North Africa</p><p>We further express our support to preserve stability and prosperity in other parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Regarding Yemen, we call on all parties to secure a durable ceasefire and work towards a comprehensive, durable, and inclusive Yemeni-led political process under UN auspices. We encourage the Tunisian government to meet the democratic aspiration of its people, to address its economic situation and to reach an agreement with the IMF. We also support efforts to achieve stability and unity in Libya under the auspice of the UN in coordination with the African Union and the Arab League. We urge all Libyan stakeholders to work constructively on the political process in order to hold free, fair, and inclusive presidential and parliamentary elections by the end of 2023.</p><p>Central Asia</p><p>We reaffirm our engagement with Central Asian countries to address various regional challenges, including the consequences of Russia's war of aggression, the destabilizing effect of the situation in Afghanistan, food and energy security, terrorism, and climate change. We are determined to foster trade and energy links, sustainable connectivity and transportation, including the 'Middle Corridor' and associated projects to enhance regional prosperity and resilience.</p><p>Africa</p><p>We are deepening our partnerships with African countries and regional organizations, including the African Union. We have each expressed support to African calls for stronger representation in international fora, notably the G20. We reiterate our strong commitment to supporting governments in the region to address, in a manner consistent with international law, the underlying conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, violent extremism, and instability across Africa. We are seriously concerned about the growing presence of the Russia-affiliated Wagner Group forces on the continent and their destabilizing impact and human rights abuses. Keeping in mind the situations in West Africa and the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes regions, we will work together to support African-led efforts on peace, stability and prosperity on the continent. In this regard, we welcome the positive developments stemming from the cessation of hostilities agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front, and call on both parties to remain committed to full implementation. We also call for international support for the Somali President's reform priorities and the fight against al-Shabaab. We reaffirm our commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Congo. We welcome the cessation of hostilities agreed in March and call for its full implementation. We condemn the advance of the UN-sanctioned March 23 Movement armed group (M23) and join African leaders in calling for M23 to withdraw unconditionally from all territories it controls. We are also seriously concerned about the spread of terrorist threats and activities towards coastal countries in West Africa, and are available to lend our support in addressing those threats.</p><p>Sudan</p><p>We strongly condemn the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. This threatens the security and safety of civilians, undermines efforts to restore Sudan's democratic transition, and could affect the stability of the region. We urge the parties to end hostilities immediately without pre-conditions and return civilian-led democratic government. We call on all actors to renounce violence and take active steps to reduce tensions, and ensure the safety of all civilians, including humanitarian personnel. The parties to the conflict must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law, ensure the safety of all civilians, including humanitarian personnel, and not impede or restrict the delivery of life-saving aid. We commend the bravery and fortitude of humanitarian agencies working in Sudan. We acknowledge the generosity of Sudan's neighbors who, despite facing significant humanitarian challenges of their own, host a growing number of Sudanese refugees. We commit to supporting response operations in Sudan and across East and North Africa and the Sahel region for refugees and returnees.</p><p>Latin America and Caribbean</p><p>We highlight the importance of enhancing cooperation with countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to uphold shared interests as well as values. We are committed to working with regional partners to address economic challenges, climate change, biodiversity loss, natural disasters, and other global issues. We reiterate our commitment to strengthen coordination with Latin American and Caribbean partners and other actors to promote the rule of law, respect for human rights, and meet the elevated humanitarian and security needs in the region, especially in Venezuela, Haiti, and Nicaragua. With respect to the ongoing crisis in Haiti, we underscore the importance of working towards Haitian-led solution for a return to stability and need to hold accountable those who cultivate violence, corruption and instability.</p><p>Kosovo and Serbia</p><p>We welcome the Agreement on the path to normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia and its Implementation Annex, reached under the EU facilitated dialogue in Brussels on February 27 and in Ohrid on March 18 respectively.

The message is clear, we are in a planetary emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, 2021 is pivotal because this is also the year that significant global conferences on climate change and biodiversity take place. Widely considered the last chance for world leaders to commit to desperately needed climate action and biodiversity conservation before we reach the 2030 deadline, the decisions made at these conferences and the actions that follow will definitively decide the future of our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A global movement on much needed radical climate action</p><p>At the recently concluded high-level event at United Nations General Assembly that outlined transformative actions and financing to reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, emphasized that protecting, conserving, restoring biodiversity and sustainable usage can be nature positive and deliver multiple co-benefits for the environment, climate and sustainable development as a whole. The ongoing COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity will see the adoption of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework-a strategic vision and a global roadmap for the conservation, protection, restoration and sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems for the next decade-is a promising sign of a global movement that is pressing on much needed radical action.</p><p>The answer to our planetary emergency and economic growth largely lies in nature and biodiversity, in immediate, sustained and transformative change in our societies and way of life; but most importantly, in our policy, economic and finance infrastructures. The choices made at this juncture as we are recovering from the COVID-19 hit economic downturn, and in the wake of time-critical climate findings will determine development and fiscal policies for the next decade and the future of our planet. Yet, even today, investments in nature and biodiversity are few and far between.</p><p>The world has not yet learnt its lessons</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme's Biodiversity Finance Initiative's (BIOFIN) 2021 iteration of the Little Book of Investing in Nature reports that the current annual biodiversity conservation financing still produces a biodiversity financing gap of USD 598-824 billion per year by 2030. Even though COVID-19 starkly reinforced the need to fund actions that enhance the resilience of ecosystems and address the shortcomings in areas such as food security, climate action, water security, human health and enhanced resilience to disaster risk, it is evident that the world has not yet learnt its lessons.</p><p>According to research by the World Economic Forum, half of the gross world product is highly or moderately dependent on nature. Agriculture, construction, food and beverages are the largest sectors that are dependent on nature, and these generate USD 8 Trillion in gross value added. Yet, there seems to be a lack of understanding that our biodiversity underpins our global economic systems and our climate solutions.</p><p>The 2021 State of Finance for Nature report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has found that investments in nature-based solutions will have to triple by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050 if we are to have a shot at solving the planetary emergency. A move towards green development is the only sustainable growth trajectory for our societies and economies, and green financing is at the core of it.</p><p>Investing in and financing nature is the way forward</p><p>So, what is green financing? A relatively new concept to Sri Lanka, green financing is any structured finance activity put towards an environmental outcome. UNEP defines it as an increasing level of financial flows (including banking, micro-credit, insurance and investment) from the public, private and not-for-profit sectors to better manage environmental and social risks, take up opportunities that bring both a decent rate of return and environmental benefit, and deliver greater accountability. For our societies and economies to thrive, we also need the natural systems that we depend on to thrive. And, investing in and financing nature is the way forward.</p><p>This is true to Sri Lanka, as well. As a country heavily dependent on nature and biodiversity, both socially and economically, the cost of deprioritizing investments in it is high. Although Sri Lanka has historically pursued low-carbon development and has balanced achieving high levels of human development with the lowest per capita emission rates, recent policy inconsistencies and structural issues have limited the country's sustainability. According to the Financial Needs Assessment conducted through the BIOFIN programme, Sri Lanka will need a total of LKR 31 billion (USD 250 Million) for the period of 2018 - 2024 to reach the country's critical biodiversity targets.</p><p>Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN)</p><p>Currently, the BIOFIN programme-a UNDP managed global collaborative partnership is striving to bridge this financing gap. The programme follows four approaches; to generate new income; increase the efficiency of existing resources; realign existing resources; and avoid future expenses.</p><p>Through this programme, a Biodiversity Finance Plan has been formulated consisting of 16 financial solutions that fit into each of these four strategic approaches. Sri Lanka is currently piloting three of these solutions.</p><p>1. Payment for ecosystems services that generate new income, where mini-hydropower plants invest part of their profits into conserving their catchment area.</p><p>2. A sustainable tourism certification scheme, which is a future cost avoidance strategy working with key government partners like the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and a host of private sector partners including hotels, to impact the environment positively through tourism operations or reduce their negative impacts significantly.</p><p>3. In partnership with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), a finance programme that works to mainstream sustainable financing initiatives and promote sustainable investments within the island's finance landscape. This works to realign existing resources and incentivize sustainable and green activities within all levels of society.</p><p>A push towards Green Development</p><p>Delving further into the third solution, for instance, if a business owner seeks a loan to fund their operations, the bank could offer lower interest rates if the business owner makes changes to his business plan to have no impacts on the environment or if they actively work towards conserving the environment.</p><p>Currently, the programme, with the CBSL, has developed a Roadmap for Sustainable Financing in Sri Lanka, established a knowledge-sharing platform through the Sustainable Banking Initiative which advances sustainable banking principles and implementation, compiled case studies, and developed an e-learning course.</p><p>At least six banks in the country have initiated sustainable financing activities voluntarily at the moment, and coupled with this momentum the BIOFIN programme hopes to engage more smaller banks in Sri Lanka to develop similar financing products. Further, as a national effort, the programme is in the process of developing the sustainable financing taxonomy with the CBSL with the aim of contributing to the country's broader policy push towards green development.</p><p>Yet, Sri Lanka needs more. As a country with significant vulnerabilities to climate change impacts, now severely fiscally restricted due to our two-year-long struggle with COVID-19, Sri Lanka's green and biodiversity financing is not near enough to meet the set biodiversity targets. Although there's no formal evidence, given the pace of climate change and impacts, we can deduce that our adaptation costs too are rising disproportionately to our adaptation finances.</p><p>We have not yet fully understood the value of nature and biodiversity, and it is high time we fought to build forward better as our resilience is in our biodiversity and nature.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Lanka Business Report.
