Up to 115 million people worldwide will fall into extreme poverty this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, this particular 'End Poverty Day' was marked not with celebration as in years past but with reflection and recommitment. We can reflect on the achievements of this island nation over the past few decades.</p><p>Indeed, Sri Lanka has carved out a special place in the region. Its economy has undergone important transformations. Sri Lanka ranks the highest in the South Asia region in the World Bank Human Capital Index for the second time in a row.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, as in other countries, the loss of jobs and incomes incurred by the pandemic has been severe. While workers in almost every sector have been affected, informal workers, who make up about 70 percent of the workforce and especially those in the industries and low-end services such as trade, are likely to be the most affected.</p><p>The apparel industry, which employs about half a million workers, has been reportedly forced to cut a significant number of jobs.

This implies that about 890,000 more people would become newly poor and many of them from the poorest regions in Sri Lanka. This is a significant setback that would imply a reversal of more than five years' worth of progress in improving welfare.</p><p>The Government of Sri Lanka took swift action to enact measures to safeguard people's health and counter their reversal of fortunes.

To help the country get back on the road to resilience, we are working closely with the government on three ways to reverse the rising tide of poverty brought on by the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>First, by protecting the poor and vulnerable. The economic burden induced by the pandemic is not borne evenly and it is critical to protect the poorest and the most vulnerable from falling into greater hardships.

Agriculture has been a silver lining during the pandemic. Production has remained largely undisrupted, although lower demand for exported produce is likely to impact wages in some sectors.</p><p>About 80 percent of Sri Lanka's agricultural land is cultivated by smallholder farmers. To raise their incomes, the World Bank is helping them to diversify into more commercially profitable crops, adopt new technologies, improve marketing and adapt to climate change. This work also involves changing the mindsets of public sector institutions to recognise that their role is to create the necessary conditions and lay the groundwork for the private sector to bring in the necessary financing and solutions.</p><p>Third, by investing in people.

While schools and universities closed during the pandemic, online learning, including through television and radio and e-learning, supported students in schools and universities.</p><p>For decades, the World Bank has supported the government's efforts in health and education and we will continue to support these two areas to improve the productivity of workers to help them move into higher-paying jobs and out of poverty.</p><p>The World Bank-supported Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project and Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project are helping to innovate agriculture by inter-cropping big onions within mango orchards, growing cassava in village clusters and cultivating hybrid chili seeds in polytunnels.

Yet, even with high uncertainty about the path of the pandemic, a way out of this health and economic crisis is increasingly visible. Thanks to the ingenuity of the scientific community hundreds of millions of people are being vaccinated and this is expected to power recoveries in many countries later this year. Economies also continue to adapt to new ways of working despite reduced mobility, leading to a stronger-than-anticipated rebound across regions. Additional fiscal support in large economies, particularly the United States, has further improved the outlook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In our latest World Economic Outlook, we are now projecting a stronger recovery for the global economy compared with our January forecast, with growth projected to be 6 percent in 2021 (0.5 percentage point upgrade) and 4.4 percent in 2022 (0.2 percentage point upgrade), after an estimated historic contraction of -3.3 percent in 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nonetheless, the future presents daunting challenges. The pandemic is yet to be defeated and virus cases are accelerating in many countries. Recoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support and more reliance on tourism do less well.</p><p>The upgrades in global growth for 2021 and 2022 are mainly due to upgrades for advanced economies, particularly to a sizeable upgrade for the United States (1.3 percentage points) that is expected to grow at 6.4 percent this year. This makes the United States the only large economy projected to surpass the level of GDP it was forecast to have in 2022 in the absence of this pandemic. Other advanced economies, including the euro area, will also rebound this year but at a slower pace. Among emerging markets and developing economies, China is projected to grow this year at 8.4 percent. While China's economy had already returned to pre-pandemic GDP in 2020, many other countries are not expected to do so until 2023.</p><p>Daunting challenges ahead</p><p>These divergent recovery paths are likely to create wider gaps in living standards across countries compared to pre-pandemic expectations. The average annual loss in per capita GDP over 2020-24, relative to pre-pandemic forecasts, is projected to be 5.7 percent in low-income countries and 4.7 percent in emerging markets, while in advanced economies the losses are expected to be smaller at 2.3 percent. Such losses are reversing gains in poverty reduction, with an additional 95 million people expected to have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections.</p><p>Uneven recoveries are also occurring within countries as young and lower-skilled workers remain more heavily affected. Women have also suffered more, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Because the crisis has accelerated the transformative forces of digitalisation and automation, many of the jobs lost are unlikely to return, requiring worker reallocation across sectors-which often comes with severe earnings penalties.</p><p>Swift policy action worldwide, including US $ 16 trillion in fiscal support, prevented far worse outcomes. Our estimates suggest last year's severe collapse could have been three times worse had it not been for such support.</p><p>Because a financial crisis was averted, medium-term losses are expected to be smaller than after the 2008 global financial crisis, at around 3 percent. However, unlike after the 2008 crisis, it is emerging markets and low-income countries that are expected to suffer greater scarring given their more limited policy space.</p><p>A high degree of uncertainty surrounds our projections. Faster progress with vaccinations can uplift the forecast, while a more prolonged pandemic with virus variants that evade vaccines can lead to a sharp downgrade.</p><p>Multispeed recoveries could pose financial risks if interest rates in the United States rise further in unexpected ways. This could cause inflated asset valuations to unwind in a disorderly manner, financial conditions to tighten sharply and recovery prospects to deteriorate, especially for some highly leveraged emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>Working together to give people a fair shot</p><p>Policymakers will need to continue supporting their economies while dealing with more limited policy space and higher debt levels than prior to the pandemic. This requires better-targeted measures to leave space for prolonged support if needed. With multispeed recoveries, a tailored approach is necessary, with policies well-calibrated to the stage of the pandemic, the strength of the economic recovery and the structural characteristics of individual countries.</p><p>Right now, the emphasis should be on escaping the health crisis by prioritising healthcare spending-on vaccinations, treatments and healthcare infrastructure. Fiscal support should be well targeted to affected households and firms. Monetary policy should remain accommodative (where inflation is well behaved), while proactively addressing financial stability risks using macroprudential tools.</p><p>As the pandemic is beaten back and labour market conditions normalise, support such as worker retention measures should be gradually scaled back. At that point, more emphasis should be placed on reallocating workers, including through targeted hiring subsidies and reskilling of workers. As exceptional measures such as moratoria on loan payments are withdrawn, firm insolvencies could rise sharply and put one in 10 jobs at risk in many countries. To limit long-term damage countries should consider converting previous liquidity support (loans) into equity-like support for viable firms, while developing out-of-court restructuring frameworks to expedite eventual bankruptcies. Resources should also be devoted to helping children catch-up on lost instructional time during the pandemic.</p><p>Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output. The priorities should include green infrastructure investment to help mitigate climate change, digital infrastructure investment to boost productive capacity and strengthening social assistance to arrest rising inequality.</p><p>Financing these endeavours will be more difficult for economies with limited fiscal space. In such cases, improving tax capacity, increasing tax progressivity (on incomes, property and inheritance taxation), deploying carbon pricing and eliminating wasteful expenditures will be essential. All countries should anchor policies in credible medium-term frameworks and adhere to the highest standards of debt transparency to help contain borrowing costs and eventually reduce debt and rebuild buffers for the future.</p><p>On the international stage, first and foremost, countries need to work together to ensure universal vaccination. While some countries will get to widespread vaccinations by this summer, most, especially low-income countries will likely have to wait until end-2022. Speeding up vaccinations will require ramping up vaccine production and distribution, avoiding export controls, fully funding the COVAX facility on which many low-income countries rely for doses and ensuring equitable global transfers</p><p>of excess doses.</p><p>Policymakers should also continue to ensure adequate access to international liquidity. Major central banks should provide clear guidance on future actions with ample time to prepare, to avoid \"taper-tantrum\" kinds of episodes as occurred in 2013. Low-income countries will benefit from further extending the pause on debt repayments under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and operationalising the G20 Common Framework for orderly debt restructuring. A new allocation of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights will provide needed liquidity protection in highly uncertain times.</p><p>Even while all eyes are on the pandemic, it is essential that progress is made on resolving trade and technology tensions. Countries should also cooperate on climate change mitigation, on modernising international corporate taxation and on measures to limit cross-border profit shifting, tax avoidance</p><p>and evasion.</p><p>Over the past year, we have seen significant innovations in economic policy and massively scaled-up support at the national level, particularly among advanced economies that have been able to afford these initiatives. A similarly ambitious effort is now needed at the multilateral level to secure the recovery and build forward better. Without additional efforts to give all people a fair shot, cross-country gaps in living standards could widen significantly and decades-long progress in global poverty reduction could reverse.</p><p>(Gita Gopinath is Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

We are confined to our homes. Weaknesses in healthcare systems have been exposed. Jobs are uncertain. Women are bearing the burden of providing informal care within families. Millions are being pushed back into poverty. Stock markets are reeling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We long for normality. But when life was normal we were already in crisis - a climate crisis. Returning to that status quo isn't an option. Instead, we should ensure our decisions to tackle this pandemic do not compound the climate crisis. Rather, they should help shape an inclusive and sustainable future for all.</p><p>Now is the time to ramp up our actions on resilience so that our society can beat the COVID-19 crisis and reduce the impact of climate threats.</p><p>Following five approaches can drive this shift</p><p>First, use the opportunity to tackle the climate crisis head-on, as well as the pandemic. Though national borders are closed, global solidarity is high. Time and resources are in short supply. We do not have the luxury nor the financing to deal with each crisis separately. More importantly, dealing with the impact of both requires us to urgently address underlying vulnerabilities - poverty, limited social safety nets, weak health systems and structural gender inequalities.</p><p>Tackling issues together can redouble resilience. For example, more resilient healthcare systems would cope better during pandemics. They could also deal more effectively with diseases caused by climate change, such respiratory ailments due to higher temperatures and waterborne illnesses from changes in precipitation.</p><p>Second, reforms, tax cuts, subsidies and incentives designed to help economies recover should also examine the implications for longer-term climate-resilient development. Sustainable recovery will require a long-term systemic shift so that short-term fixes don't have adverse consequences for the environment and equity.</p><p>Actions for climate resilience have always prioritised long-term thinking. Still, climate risk information has only very rarely found its way into fiscal policy and management processes. Now is the time to make this happen. Proposed reforms to meet immediate needs should also promote green infrastructure, create jobs in sectors that reduce carbon emissions and incentivise actions such as business continuity planning across supply chains that promote longer-term sustainability and equity by addressing climate risks.</p><p>Third, measures should have an explicit focus on the poor and marginalised. The pandemic is having a disproportionate impact on poor and marginalised populations. These people are already burdened with the ill-effects of climate-related shocks and stresses such as salinity intrusion at coastal areas and urban \"heat islands\" endured by outdoor workers.</p><p>To prevent millions slipping back into poverty, a sharp focus on strengthening the resilience of the poor will be needed. This calls for tailored solutions to support the chronic and near poor in both urban and rural areas. Large-scale pro-poor development programmes should proactively introduce explicit resilience-building measures. Technical and vocational education and training programmes can build skills for climate-friendly livelihoods, such as producing drought-resistant high-value crops. Cash-for-work programmes can help protect wetlands and mangroves.</p><p>Equally important is to invest in social protection systems with adaptive features. For example, using climate risk information to target vulnerable populations and flexibly allowing cash transfer programmes to add temporary new beneficiaries can cushion the impacts of a crisis. It will be important to strengthen linkages between various programmes - public health, community infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods, microfinance - to deliver resilience solutions.</p><p>Fourth, let's take a transformational approach to resilience. The effects of climate change are not linear. Therefore, additive incremental actions taken to combat a pandemic won't necessarily protect assets, livelihoods and well-being over the long term.</p><p>Instead, we need to address the systemic, structural and gendered dimensions of vulnerability. The focus should be on underlying inequalities, balancing bottom-up and top-down planning approaches and requiring behavioural and lifestyle changes. For example, investments to support populations in urban informal settlements should involve communities, especially women, in decision-making about selection, construction and maintenance of water supply and sanitation infrastructure.</p><p>We can promote behavioural change through improved hygiene and by forming self-help groups to kick start sustainable livelihoods in climate-friendly roles such as management of wetlands and mangroves.</p><p>Finally, invest in communities. Managing any crisis boils down to individual communities - their capacity, resources and level of preparedness. Communities that are well informed about risks and involved in local decision-making can play critical roles in helping local governments to identify and serve vulnerable populations.</p><p>This can improve the targeting of resources and distribution of food. Self-help groups have spread awareness about climate and disaster risks, performed caregiving roles and implemented farm-to-home models to deliver agricultural produce. Grassroots women's groups are better aware of local vulnerabilities and can ensure that government support reaches the last mile.</p><p>Building the adaptive capacity of communities requires sustained investments in organising communities and empowering them economically and socially. The Global Commission on Adaptation has estimated that investing US $ 1.8 trillion globally from 2020 to 2030 in resilience-building measures could generate US $ 7.1 trillion in total new benefits.</p><p>It pays to invest in resilience. Let's make those investments now so our communities can thrive-before, during and after crises.</p><p>(Preety Bhandari is Chief of the Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Thematic Group concurrently Director, SDCD.

Furthermore, this joint initiative once implemented in compliance with IMF conditions, is expected to increase investors' confidence and also in securing additional resources from the IMF, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other such agencies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amidst all these, there appears to be a silver lining in the dark financial clouds that hovering over Sri Lanka at present where even an adversity of this magnitude could be turned into an excellent medium or long-term investment opportunity. The silver lining in the dark horizon is that the leading international donor agencies are steadily moving towards 'sustainable financing' in compliance with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in the present green economic era.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sustainable finance roadmap for Sri Lanka</p><p>Sustainable finance refers to the process of taking environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria (developed by the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment - PRI) into account, when making investment decisions in the financial sector. These in turn will lead to more long-term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects.</p><p>Sri Lanka too joined this bandwagon in developing a Roadmap for Sustainable Finance way back in 2016/2017. It is aimed at integrating ESG criteria into financial decision-making processes in order to help build a more resilient and sustainable green economy. These sustainable finance practices are expected to promote assistance to make the businesses greener, climate-friendly, and socially inclusive.</p><p>This Sustainable Finance Road Map for Sri Lanka was prepared through an inclusive multi-stakeholder process and launched in 2019 with financial assistance from the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) from the UNDP and technical support from the International Finance Corporation. In this 'new normal' era of post-pandemic banking, sustainable finance is expected to become a key mover in achieving social, economic, and environmental goals in a green economic milieu.</p><p>The Biodiversity Finance Plan (BFP) for Sri Lanka (2018-2024) prepared collectively by the then Ministry of Finance and Media, The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment in 2019, intends to support sustainable biodiversity management efforts of Sri Lanka by mobilising finance for investing in biodiversity by both the public and private sector.</p><p>A considerable amount of background preparatory work detailed in three technical reports (i.) Policy and Institutional Review, (ii.) Biodiversity Expenditure Review, and (iii) Financial Need Assessment, has gone into developing this Biodiversity Finance Plan for Sri Lanka. It is expected to achieve national biodiversity targets that include conservation, sustainable management, and equitable distribution of benefits among all stakeholders, the three main pillars of the Convention on Biodiversity.</p><p>During this process, the national biodiversity and climate change-related strategic plans viz. National Biodiversity Action plan (NBSAP 2016-2022), National REDD+ Investment Framework and Action Plan (NRIFAP 2018-2022), National Action Program for Combating Land Degradation in Sri Lanka (NAP-CLD 2015-2024), and National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change Impacts in Sri Lanka (2016-2025) have been consulted for estimating the financial gap constraining investment needed for their effective implementation.</p><p>In addition, the vision of the BFP is directly linked to the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 13: Climate Action; Goal 14: Life below Water, and Goal 15: Life on Land. It is indirectly linked to several other SDGs such as Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation, Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.</p><p>The BFP has been designed to meet the biodiversity financing needs of the country by mobilising resources for investing in conserving biodiversity, promoting its sustainable use, and equitable sharing of its benefits. This is to be achieved with the participation of all major stakeholders - the Government, the corporate sector, and the community.</p><p>Thirteen different finance solutions viz. sustainable standards and certification, eco-labels, green lending, corporate social responsibility, lotteries, payment for ecosystem services, green bonds, ecotourism, conservation license plates, carbon markets, lobbying for public budget allocations, and diaspora savings and investment, have been identified based on the information given in national and sectoral planning documents of Sri Lanka. Each of these has been elaborated on in some detail with action plans in the BFP 2018-2022 document.</p><p>Most of the prioritised financial solutions listed above are already in operation, though at a modest scale. They need to be scaled up with judicious resource mobilisation to be more responsive to the conservation and sustainable development, equitable sharing of biodiversity and ecosystem service benefits. Consequently, with all this background preparative work accomplished, Sri Lanka is in a strong position to make the current adversity into an opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>Green bonds</p><p>One of the fastest developing financial or refinancing solutions on a global scale is coming from issuance of sustainability-linked international sovereign green bonds and other similar instruments such as sustainability-linked bonds, climate bonds and social bonds (Figures 2 and 3). The repayment of debt using these green bonds and the like is tied to the achievement of institutional environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets, such as greenhouse gas emission reductions. The growth of green bonds in the global capital markets has been explosive in recent times and is increasingly attracting attention of the corporate entities around the globe. Global Green Bond investments have topped $ 500 billion in 2021 for the first time and it is expected to reach $ 1 trillion this year.</p><p>Most of the green bonds in the world have been issued to finance relatively large projects in the areas of Renewable Energy, Transport, Pollution Prevention and Control, Water and Waste Management, Environmentally Sustainable Land-use, Agriculture and Forestry, Reduction in Carbon Emission, and Green Infrastructure, and since of late for Biodiversity Conservation.</p><p>Governments, major financial centres and central banks world over are greening their financial systems by developing green bond guidance, green taxonomies, regulation, and reporting guidelines. Investors worldwide are waking up to the importance of incorporating biodiversity as part of ESG risk assessments and their effective management. This is due in part to the increasing focus on this topic since the United Nation's Intergovernmental Science-Policy platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (UN-IPBES) produced its landmark Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services in May 2019, casting the spotlight on the alarming declines of biodiversity worldwide.</p><p>Although Sri Lanka has not yet availed herself of this innovative financial solution of investing in Green Bonds, it is ideally placed to benefit from this emerging opportunity, for Sri Lanka being one of 36 global hotspots of biodiversity. Sri Lanka has actively participated in sustainability-focused investments through the Sustainable Banking Network of the International Finance Corporation, and it is a fortuitous coincidence that the present Governor of the Central Bank, himself, has taken an active role in this global network activities in the past (see photo).</p><p>The Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the financial sector, in general, have been moving in the direction of sustainable financing with the preparation of the required technical details listed earlier. The latest addition to it is the 'Sri Lanka Green Finance Taxonomy' (a classification system established to provide guidelines for integrating sustainability into investment decisions), published by the Central Bank on 6 May 2022. Green Bond Principles (GBP) is one of several well-known taxonomies that provide guidelines specific to green bonds.</p><p>Consequently, Sri Lanka has already put in place the necessary institutional infrastructure in financial markets for entering into green bond initiatives. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has been raising international finance by issuing bonds since 2007. As such, the government and the financial institutions are quite familiar and well equipped with the necessary groundwork to enter the international (green) bond market. The BFP reports that the Government of Sri Lanka recommends the issuing of international sovereign green bonds as a sustainable finance solution to mobilise relatively large sums of debt capital for investing in large-scale biodiversity projects, combatting land degradation, arresting habitat and species loss, maritime reef conservation, coastal conservation, and sustainable energy.</p><p>All these project documents (viz. NBSAP, NRIFAP, NAPCLD, and NAPCCI) prepared with broader consultation and supported by the respective UN agencies are therefore, consistent with the global conventions as well as national-level policies and strategies on biodiversity, climate change, and land degradation. The Wildlife and Forest Conservation Departments have carried out several biodiversity and ecosystem management projects including the preparation of two pilot scale novel Landscape Management Plans - one for Sinharaja Rain Forest Complex and the other for Hurulu-Kaudulla-Kantale forest complex with financial support from the Ecosystem Conservation and Management Project (ESCAMP 2018-2022) of the World Bank. These plans are available as excellent opportunities for consideration in raising funds from international capital markets for restructuring at least some of the ISBs into Green Bonds. Similarly, Forestry Sector Master Plan first prepared in 1995 is being revised to meet the present-day forestry sector needs which again, together with NBSAP, NRIFAP, NAPCLD, and NAPCCI are good candidates for similar capital investment considerations during the debt restructuring process.</p><p>Green energy</p><p>With respect to sustainable energy, especially the generation of electricity has become one of the most critical issues at present in Sri Lanka. The UNDP and ADB joint assessment of 'Sri Lanka's Power Sector - 100% Electricity Generation through Renewable Energy by 2050' provides opportunities for green-bond solutions, among others in this area. Sri Lanka being one of the forty-three countries of the Climate Vulnerable Group which are disproportionately affected by climate change, has signed the declaration at the 22nd COP meeting of UNFCCC in Marrakech, Morocco in 2016 to reach these ambitious renewable electricity generation targets by 2050.</p><p>However, the UNDP-ADB joint assessment records that the Long-term Generation Expansion Plan (LTGEP) for Sri Lanka, 2015-2034 (http:// pucsl.gov.lk/english/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Long-Term-Generation-Plan-2015-2034-PUCSL.pdf) envisages adding at least two more coal-fired power plants, one in Trincomalee (2 x 300 MW) in 2029 onwards and the other in the Southern Region (3 x 300 MW) from 2027 onwards. The report however cautions that stiff resistance from local communities and possible litigation moves by environmental groups may lead to change this long-term generation plan.</p><p>According to the same report (table 41: p 113), several thermal power plants are likely to be retired from operation due to their age-related malfunctioning and these capacities also will need urgent replacements to ensure Sri Lanka's growing electricity demands. Therefore, actual future coal-based capacity addition to our national grid may be much lower than planned. The same report adds that by 2050, the 100% Renewable Energy scenario can potentially save $ 18-$ 19 billion on imported coal as compared with the base case scenario, which relies heavily on coal.</p><p>The Ceylon Electricity Board's long-term generation planning is based on the 'least cost principle' which has led to its focus on significantly cheap coal-based capacity development. However, they have not considered the environmental and health cost externalities in their calculations. Inclusion of the cost of carbon emission, air-quality and health related issues and other externalities would provide a more realistic picture of benefit/cost of the use of coal for electricity generation. Unfortunately, the natural resource economists have not yet brought these environmental and health costs associated with coal-fired power plants in Sri Lanka to the attention of the CEB. Alternatively, it may be that the information available either from Sri Lanka or our neighbouring countries have not been taken into consideration in the calculation of 'least cost'.</p><p>Unless these developments are taken into consideration, the roadmap developed as a part of the LTGEP, while making provisions for increased adoption of renewable energy in the electricity generation mix, is unlikely to be the basis on which the Sri Lanka can transform its power sector into a 100% RE sector by 2050. Consequently, there is a pressing need for updating the LTGEP with the global shifts to renewable energy sources mandated by the Sri Lankan government in compliance with the UNFCCC recommendations. Such projects could be very attractive for international donors, and they may rank very high in eligibility for Green Bond investments.</p><p>Furthermore, the COP 26 meeting of the UNFCCC held in Glasgow in 2021 set a new gold standard on the 'Paris Alignment of international public finance' to move away from Coal - the single biggest contributor to climate change - by the end of 2021. Sri Lanka along with Chile, Montenegro and their European partners pledged that no new Coal Power Plants to be constructed in their respective countries. Alok Sharma, the British minister of State at the cabinet office who was also the COP 26 president announced that more than 40 countries reached a deal and pledged to phase out coal - the dirtiest fossil fuel - by the 2040s. Two notable exceptions apparently had been the USA and China although the US has pledged to end public financing for fossil fuel projects abroad without any carbon capture and storage technology, by the end of 2022.</p><p>In light of these recent developments, there is more than a silver lining in our gloomy horizon that Sri Lanka can capitalise on its current debt restructuring process to transform some of her International Sovereign Bonds to Green Bonds for funding Non-conventional Renewable Energy projects through effective engagement at the future negotiations with the IMF and the lenders/creditors. These projects typically involve renewable energy generation and emission reductions among a host of other benefits. Shifting from a coal power to a solar power project in Sampur in eastern Sri Lanka may be one such project put forward by the National Thermal Power Corporation of India recently although the details of the agreement have not been made public, as yet.</p><p>There is an enormous potential for Sri Lanka to tap into these green/sustainability bond markets to finance its infrastructure projects/investments such as in waste management, renewable energy projects, biodiversity conservation, public transportation, climate change adaptation and mitigation. As shown above, large/medium/small scale green investment project plans have already been prepared and the sustainable financing infrastructure is already in place, and what is needed is a matter of prioritising these differently sized projects in consultation with appropriate stakeholder groups.</p><p>Sri Lanka is a relatively small island with unparalleled diversity of physical, biological and cultural features. Most of her leading agricultural exports (tea, rubber and spices) are in the hands of a diverse set of smallholders which, in a way, are more resilient to cataclysmic changes that may come with the vagaries of the climate from time to time. Therefore, the biodiversity finance projects need not only conserve and sustainably utilise the natural resources but also take adequate measures to distribute the benefits equitably among these smallholders who had been the backbone of the Sri Lankan enterprise. Sri Lanka is known world over as a 'paradise of smallholders' and the preservation of that cultural tradition is more important in the future.</p><p>Finally, although Sri Lanka has been caught somewhat unawares in a violent tropical thunderstorm (its origin perhaps be rooted in extra-tropical climes), the charting out of it seems to be reasonably well laid out by the technocrats with the support from the international agencies. In order to steady the ship in these viciously turbulent waters, we obviously need a matching political leadership with a clear vision, honesty, integrity, calm but stern demeanour and above all strong and selfless commitment to steer the ship out of the rough seas to calmer waters. The least we need at this critical moment of despondency is a mutiny on board the ship which will only help those prying to grab the best of - as some would call it - 'this unsinkable aircraft carrier' in the Indian Ocean.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT07062022000536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65MV-GD11-F00C-610K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 7, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

Protecting the poor and vulnerableFirst, by protecting the poor and vulnerable.</p><p> The economic burden induced by the pandemic is not borne evenly and it is critical to protect the poorest and the most vulnerable from falling into greater hardships. This requires efforts to regularly monitor the impact of the crisis on firms and the labor market in order to support timely interventions.</p><p>The World Bank is rolling out a phone-based monitoring survey in the South Asia region to track the crisis impact on jobs and earnings that can inform its operational response to the crisis. As part of the crisis response, we are grateful for the opportunity to support Government's efforts to revisit its social safety net program and develop a long-term strategy for social protection.</p><p>One critical success will be the creation of the central online portal, a \"one-stop shop\" for all the country's welfare programs, in order to better identify the needs of poorer households, reduce overlaps, eliminate leakages, and make it easier for the Government to deliver rapid assistance to those in need. Investing in agriculture and food securitySecond, by investing in agriculture and food security.</p><p> Agriculture has been a silver lining during the pandemic. Production has remained largely undisrupted, although lower demand for exported produce is likely to impact wages in some sectors.</p><p>About 80% of Sri Lanka's agricultural land is cultivated by smallholder farmers. To raise their incomes, the World Bank is helping them to diversify into more commercially profitable crops, adopt new technologies, improve marketing, and adapt to climate change.</p><p>This work also involves changing the mindsets of public sector institutions to recognise that their role is to create the necessary conditions and lay the groundwork for the private sector to bring in the necessary financing and solutions. Investing in peopleThird, by investing in people.</p><p> Human capital has been and continues to be Sri Lanka's real wealth and a great source of potential. While schools and universities closed during the pandemic, online learning, including through television and radio and e-learning, supported students in schools and universities.</p><p>For decades, the World Bank has supported the Government's efforts in health and education, and we will continue to support these two areas to improve the productivity of workers to help them move into higher-paying jobs and out of poverty.The World Bank-supported Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project and Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project are helping to innovate agriculture by inter-cropping big onions within mango orchards, growing cassava in village clusters and cultivating hybrid chili seeds in poly tunnels.</p><p> Farmers in 11 districts of Sri Lanka are receiving support including knowledge in climate-smart agriculture practices. You can read their stories at www.</p><p>smp.lk and www.</p><p>csiap.lk.</p><p> Vulnerability to new threatsThe COVID-19 pandemic shows the global vulnerability to new threats. In Sri Lanka, this is in addition to existing vulnerabilities to climate shocks, including floods and droughts, which disproportionately impact the lives of the poor.</p><p>The World Bank is already engaged in creating more resilience livelihoods, including through improved flood protection, landslide prevention and improving weather forecasting services. COVID-19 teaches us that we need to do more and develop the tools and approaches to ensure the recovery from the pandemic leads to greater longterm resilience.</p><p>There are opportunities for a green recovery, to enhance the sustainability of the country's abundant natural resources in its land, forests, wildlife and oceans, to push ahead with cleaner energy and green infrastructure, and use technology and financial instruments such as insurance to make Sri Lanka better able to reduce risks and withstand shocks.When I arrived in Colombo a few weeks ago, soon after taking up my new role as World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka, I was struck by the unfailing warmth, grace and hospitality of the Sri Lankan people  even in this time of crisis.</p><p> Beneath this warmth lies resilience. It is this resilience that will carry you, the people of Sri Lanka, forward.</p><p> The World Bank's team in Sri Lanka stands ready to walk this road with you.

Agriculture has been a silver lining during the pandemic.</p><p> Production has remained largely undisrupted, although lower demand for exported produce is likely to impact wages in some sectors.About 80% of Sri Lanka's agricultural land is cultivated by smallholder farmers.</p><p> To raise their incomes, the World Bank is helping them to diversify into more commercially profitable crops, adopt new technologies, improve marketing, and adapt to climate change.This work also involves changing the mindsets of public sector institutions to recognise that their role is to create the necessary conditions and lay the groundwork for the private sector to bring in the necessary financing and solutions.</p><p>Investing in peopleThird, by investing in people. Human capital has been and continues to be Sri Lanka's real wealth and a great source of potential.</p><p> While schools and universities closed during the pandemic, online learning, including through television and radio and e-learning, supported students in schools and universities.For decades, the World Bank has supported the Government's efforts in health and education, and we will continue to support these two areas to improve the productivity of workers to help them move into higher-paying jobs and out of poverty.</p><p>The World Bank-supported Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project and Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project are helping to innovate agriculture by inter-cropping big onions within mango orchards, growing cassava in village clusters and cultivating hybrid chili seeds in poly tunnels. Farmers in 11 districts of Sri Lanka are receiving support including knowledge in climate-smart agriculture practices.</p><p> You can read their stories at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.asmp\">www.asmp</url>.</p><p>lk and www.csiap.</p><p>lk.Vulnerability to new threatsThe COVID-19 pandemic shows the global vulnerability to new threats.</p><p> In Sri Lanka, this is in addition to existing vulnerabilities to climate shocks, including floods and droughts, which disproportionately impact the lives of the poor.The World Bank is already engaged in creating more resilience livelihoods, including through improved flood protection, landslide prevention and improving weather forecasting services.</p><p> COVID-19 teaches us that we need to do more and develop the tools and approaches to ensure the recovery from the pandemic leads to greater longterm resilience.There are opportunities for a green recovery, to enhance the sustainability of the country's abundant natural resources in its land, forests, wildlife and oceans, to push ahead with cleaner energy and green infrastructure, and use technology and financial instruments such as insurance to make Sri Lanka better able to reduce risks and withstand shocks.</p><p>When I arrived in Colombo a few weeks ago, soon after taking up my new role as World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka, I was struck by the unfailing warmth, grace and hospitality of the Sri Lankan people  even in this time of crisis. Beneath this warmth lies resilience.</p><p> It is this resilience that will carry you, the people of Sri Lanka, forward. The World Bank's team in Sri Lanka stands ready to walk this road with you.</p><p> (The writer is the Country Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

In the near future, the world may need to resort to lockdowns again - this time to tackle a climate emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shifting Arctic ice, raging wildfires in western US states and elsewhere, and methane leaks in the North Sea are all warning signs that we are approaching a tipping point on climate change, when protecting the future of civilisation will require dramatic interventions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under a 'climate lockdown,' governments would limit private-vehicle use, ban consumption of red meat, and impose extreme energy-saving measures, while fossil-fuel companies would have to stop drilling. To avoid such a scenario, we must overhaul our economic structures and do capitalism differently.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many think of the climate crisis as distinct from the health and economic crises caused by the pandemic. But the three crises - and their solutions - are interconnected.</p><p>COVID-19 is itself a consequence of environmental degradation: one recent study dubbed it 'the disease of the Anthropocene.' Moreover, climate change will exacerbate the social and economic problems highlighted by the pandemic. These include governments' diminishing capacity to address public-health crises, the private sector's limited ability to withstand sustained economic disruption, and pervasive social inequality.</p><p>These shortcomings reflect the distorted values underlying our priorities. For example, we demand the most from 'essential workers' (including nurses, supermarket workers, and delivery drivers) while paying them the least. Without fundamental change, climate change will worsen such problems.</p><p>The climate crisis is also a public-health crisis. Global warming will cause drinking water to degrade and enable pollution-linked respiratory diseases to thrive. According to some projections, 3.5 billion people globally will live in unbearable heat by 2070.</p><p>Addressing this triple crisis requires reorienting corporate governance, finance, policy, and energy systems toward a green economic transformation. To achieve this, three obstacles must be removed: business that is shareholder-driven instead of stakeholder-driven, finance that is used in inadequate and inappropriate ways, and government that is based on outdated economic thinking and faulty assumptions.</p><p>Corporate governance must now reflect stakeholders' needs instead of shareholders' whims. Building an inclusive, sustainable economy depends on productive co-</p><p>operation among the public and private sectors and civil society. This means firms need to listen to trade unions and workers' collectives, community groups, consumer advocates, and others.</p><p>Likewise, government assistance to business must be less about subsidies, guarantees, and bailouts, and more about building partnerships. This means attaching strict conditions to any corporate bailouts to ensure that taxpayer money is put to productive use and generates long-term public value, not short-term private profits.</p><p>In the current crisis, for example, the French government conditioned its bailouts for Renault and Air France-KLM on emission-reduction commitments. France, Belgium, Denmark, and Poland denied state aid to any company domiciled in a European Union-designated tax haven, and barred large recipients from paying dividends or buying back their own shares until 2021. Likewise, US corporations receiving government loans through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act were prohibited from using the funds for share buybacks.</p><p>These conditions are a start, but are not ambitious enough, either from a climate perspective or in economic terms. The magnitude of government assistance packages does not match firms' requirements, and the conditions are not always legally binding: for example, the Air France emissions policy applies only to short domestic flights.</p><p>Far more is needed to achieve a green and sustainable recovery. For example, governments might use the tax code to discourage firms from using certain materials. They might also introduce job guarantees at company or national level so that human capital is not wasted or eroded. This would help the youngest and oldest workers, who have disproportionately suffered job losses owing to the pandemic, and reduce the likely economic shocks in disadvantaged regions already suffering industrial decline.</p><p>Finance needs fixing, too. During the 2008 global financial crisis, governments flooded markets with liquidity. But, because they did not direct it toward good investment opportunities, much of that funding ended up back in a financial sector unfit for purpose.</p><p>The current crisis presents an opportunity to harness finance in productive ways to drive long-term growth. Patient long-term finance is key, because a three-to-five-year investment cycle doesn't match the long lifespan of a wind turbine (more than 25 years), or encourage the innovation needed in e-mobility, natural capital development (such as rewilding programmes), and green infrastructure.</p><p>Some governments have already launched sustainable growth initiatives. New Zealand has developed a budget based on 'wellbeing' metrics, rather than GDP, to align public spending with broader objectives, while Scotland has established the mission-oriented Scottish National Investment Bank.</p><p>Along with steering finance toward a green transition, we need to hold the financial sector accountable for its often-destructive environmental impact. The Dutch central bank estimates that Dutch financial institutions' biodiversity footprint represents a loss of over 58,000 square kilometers (22,394 square miles) of pristine nature - an area 1.7 times larger than the Netherlands.</p><p>Because markets will not lead a green revolution on their own, government policy must steer them in that direction. This will require an entrepreneurial state that innovates, takes risks, and invests alongside the private sector. Policymakers should therefore redesign procurement contracts in order to move away from low-cost investments by incumbent suppliers, and create mechanisms that 'crowd in' innovation from multiple actors to achieve public green goals.</p><p>Governments should also take a portfolio approach to innovation and investment. In the United Kingdom and the United States, wider industrial policy continues to support the information-technology revolution. Similarly, the EU's recently launched European Green Deal, Industrial Strategy, and Just Transition Mechanism are acting as the motor and compass for the pound 750 billion ($888 billion) 'Next Generation EU' recovery fund.</p><p>Finally, we need to reorient our energy system around renewable energy - the antidote to climate change and the key to making our economies energy-secure. We must therefore evict fossil-fuel interests and short-termism from business, finance, and politics. Financially powerful institutions such as banks and universities must divest from fossil-fuel companies. Until they do, a carbon-based economy will prevail.</p><p>The window for launching a climate revolution - and achieving an inclusive recovery from COVID-19 in the process - is rapidly closing. We need to move quickly if we want to transform the future of work, transit, and energy use, and make the concept of a 'green good life' a reality for generations to come. One way or the other, radical change is inevitable; our task is to ensure that we achieve the change we want - while we still have the choice.</p><p>Mariana Mazzucato, Professor of Economics of Innovation and Public Value at University College London and Founding Director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, is the author of The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy and The Entrepreneurial State: Debunking Public vs. Private Sector Myths.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM27092020000546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y8-H7W1-F00C-61Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 27, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000941G</classCode><className>AIR FRANCE-KLM SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>AF (PAR)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>AF (AMS)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Business &amp;

Another 17 million were affected by flooding in South Asia. Floods also impacted parts of Indonesia, and in the past month, Vietnam and the Philippines have also been hit. Altogether, they highlight the need to scale up solutions to help fast-growing cities build flood resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Low-lying developing countries and cities in Asia are facing a 1-2-3 punch,\" said Sally Yozell, Director of the Environmental Security Program at The Stimson Center, a Washington D.C., based research center. \"Massive storms, flooding, sea level rise, all on top of the social and economic issues that many coastal communities have - it's extreme.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there is a growing awareness that nature-based and community solutions are needed to increase flood resilience in the most vulnerable cities, scaling up and redirecting climate and adaptation finance remains a challenge across the region.</p><p>Climate change models predict that, in Asia, rainfall during the wet season will become more concentrated while the dry season becomes longer. \"We are talking about some 15 to 20 percent more intense events in terms of the accumulated rainfall,\" said Giriraj Amarnath, research group leader for the water risks and disasters program at the International Water Management Institute, based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. \"It's also estimated that these kinds of events are three times more likely, now, due to climate change.\"</p><p>Flooding alone is not an issue. It can provide benefits for agricultural and fishing production around and near cities. But climate change has made regular seasonal patterns less predictable, straining the capacity of landscapes and urban infrastructure to adapt.</p><p>While science has gotten better at connecting specific extreme weather events to climate change, for now, it is too soon to estimate just how much worse, or intense, this year's floods were due to climate change. One thing is clear, though - climate change will likely mean that these kinds of extreme flooding events will become more common in Asia.</p><p>\"The impact we have seen across parts of Asia this year fits very much with the trends we have been seeing for many years,\" said Matthew Cochrane, spokesperson at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \"Today, climate and weather-related events account for nearly nine out of all 10 disasters.\"</p><p>Human impacts and solutions</p><p>When it comes to flooding, Asia, due to the presence of large populations in vulnerable, coastal cities, and growing urbanization, is the continent of most concern.</p><p>A study published in \"Nature Communications\" last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable population found in China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. Another study published this past July in Nature's \"Scientific Reports\" found that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be in Asia, especially in growing coastal cities such as Shanghai, China with 27 million, Bangkok, Thailand with eight million, and Kolkata, India with 14 million.</p><p>\"When people migrate in Asia, they are more likely to end up staying in parts of the city that are not planned, areas that also tend to get flooded,\" said Soumya Balasubramanya, research group leader for economics at IWMI. \"More people moving to the cities essentially means more people who are vulnerable to these sorts of disasters.\"</p><p>While floods make headlines, even smaller changes in precipitation patterns have real social and economic impacts. Bangladesh is ranked high on lists of countries that will be most adversely impacted by climate change, due to its large population residing in low-lying, coastal, or delta regions. There, Kaiser Rejve with the humanitarian organization CAREBangladesh has seen these changes yearly.</p><p>\"The frequency of floods (since 1998) has increased with floods now starting earlier in the year and also later in the year, damaging agricultural pursuits and negatively affecting food security and livelihood,\" Rejve said. Of the 28 districts impacted were the cities of Sirajganj, Tangail, and suburbs of the capital, Dhaka.</p><p>Bangladesh is also a major recipient of aid aimed at both increasing resilience to floods and preparing for future climate-related disasters. There is growing awareness that traditional big project solutions, including building sea walls, are not enough. That is why, in 2019, The World Bank and the World Resources Institute released a report calling for a shift from a focus on gray infrastructure - sea walls, but also dams and traditional wastewater management systems - toward greater integration with green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, which they argue can, together, better flood resilience and water security. These include measures such as mangrove and wetlands restoration, absorbent urban surfaces, and building sponge cities that absorb water.</p><p>Another challenge is getting actionable data into decision-makers' hands. Climate-related flood risk is especially challenging as it often requires integration between various government ministries and international actors. That is why, in June, The Stimson Center released its Climate and Ocean Risk Vulnerability Index, or CORVI, tool.</p><p>\"CORVI is a planning tool,\" Yozell said. \"If you focus on just one focal area - sea level rise, or drought, or heat - but do not look at them all collectively, you are missing the forest for the trees.\"</p><p>CORVI hopes to help cities avoid scenarios, like that took place in Jakarta in 2015, when the Ciliwung river flooded. The capital of Indonesia, and a megacity with approximately 10 million residents in the city and around 34 million in the Greater Jakarta area as of 2018, has been subject to increasingly severe floods due to over-development and groundwater discharge, and embarked on a plan to restore river flow within the city.</p><p>\"The Ciliwung river flow was deemed essential to mitigating flooding in the short term, so thousands of households were displaced,\" said Gavin Shatkin, a professor at Northeastern University, who researches flood resilience in Indonesia.</p><p>The displaced were from low-income communities, and the resulting backlash led to several court cases, and played a role in the Jakarta Governor being voted out in 2017, showing the risk of ignoring socioeconomic factors when designing flood resilience programs. Jakarta is also sinking, so to help alleviate the problem, along with several related urbanization issues, the government is relocating the functions of government to a new capital city on the island of Borneo, a plan now on hold due to COVID-19. Jakarta will still be the financial and business center of Indonesia.</p><p>Financing resilience</p><p>A report released by the Flood Resilience Alliance in July 2020 found that adaptation funding was falling far short of promises, and that climate-vulnerable countries were not receiving preferential treatment from donors.</p><p>Balasubramanya believes that the millions who saw their homes destroyed and livelihoods damaged during 2020's historic floods is a wake-up call to the global community to do something now to quickly scale and fund flood resilience.</p><p>\"A disproportionate share of money, including public and private financing, has gone to the infrastructure side,\" Balasubramanya said. She said she would like to see the process for low-income countries to access development aid for flood risk prevention to be made much simpler and faster. Flexibility is also key.</p><p>\"The development of human capacity is going to require significant investments in increasing the capacities and capabilities of local populations to participate in things like early warning systems, climate-smart agriculture, and restoring wetlands.\"</p><p>Visit the resilientfutures.devex.com series for more coverage on the practical ways cities can build resilience and reduce disaster impact.

It is also NDB's first foreign equity placement agreement.Norfund will participate in the NDB's upcoming Rights Issue for Rs.</p><p> 8 billion (announced in October 2020 at Rs. 75 per share) by way of subscribing to unsubscribed rights and also by way of a private placement if required at Rs.</p><p> 82.50 per share which reflects a 10% premium on Rights Price. In the event Rights Issue is fully subscribed by existing shareholders, realisation of Norfund commitment would see NDB's capital being boosted by Rs.</p><p> 11 billion. This will increase its foreign shareholding percentage to around 21%.</p><p>The Norfund investment is subject to other conditions, including regulator and shareholders approvals.A symbolic agreement to this effect was exchanged between Norwegian Ambassador Trine Jaranli Eskedal and NDB Chairman and young business leader Eshana de Silva.</p><p>NDB described the Norfund investment as a game changer, as the latter will extend technical expertise where necessary in areas of private sector development especially SME sector, financial inclusion and digital technologies. NDB will also have access to a vast pool of long term funding from Norfund which has $ 2.</p><p>8 b investments in 163 projects in a number of countries and has defined 29 core strategy countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \"This investment comes at a time when most of the world is facing external macro-economic challenges especially due to the global COVID-19 pandemic with rating downgrades etc.</p><p> In that context it is extremely heartening to see we have Norway and its Norfund who believe in the resilience of NDB and Sri Lanka,\" De Silva said.NDB is one of the fastest growing and the fourth largest listed commercial bank with assets growing by 18.4% in 2020 to Rs.</p><p> 632.1 billion.Norwegian Ambassador Eskedal said: \"I believe that this is a good indication of the faith and trust Norfund has placed on the Sri Lankan private sector, and I hope it conveys a positive message to other potential investors in Sri Lanka, in particular in this challenging time.</p><p>\"Sri Lanka was added to Norfund's list of mandated countries in 2019 and before NDB it had invested in debt of Softlogic Life.NDB Chairman de Silva described the Norfund investment as a momentous occasion for the bank given the challenging times amidst global COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>However he said that NDB in 2020 continued its growth momentum showcasing a robust 21% growth in deposits, 8% growth in loans and advances and an 8% growth in after tax profit.\"As we evolve we understand we need a long-term partner with shared goals and bring in added expertise and support.</p><p> I am indeed delighted that Norfund is that ideal partner for NDB.\"Our aspirations to create an economic revival by encouraging financial inclusion and sustainable exports driven SMEs will get a big boost with Norfund investment and technical assistance.</p><p> I believe driving sustainable development is one of the Norfund's objectives and help boost Sri Lanka's competitiveness,\" NDB Chairman emphasised.He also said Norway has been a key development partner of Sri Lanka with assistance worth 5 billion Norwegian Krone (around Rs.</p><p> 115 billion).\"The two countries too have had strong cooperation between the private sectors.</p><p> I hope with this investment we will see more cooperation of this nature in other sectors of the economy as well.

Further on the back of the numerous global awards the bank has received in the recent past, this was a further endorsement of NDB's strong sustainable growth model and our close alignment to global standards,\" Seneviratne said.</p><p>The NDB Group MD also said the equity infusion together with the proposed Rights Issue will help buttress the Tier I capital of NDB bank enabling it to continue its growth momentum and support the economic revival in a post COVID environment.He said with one of the best Cost to Income Ratios in the industry, NDB continues to leverage on its technologic investments to deliver sustainable returns for the Bank, customers and other stakeholders.</p><p>Norfund Regional Director for Asia Fay Chetnakarnkul said: \"Financial inclusion is critical to support economic growth, job creation and reduce poverty in Sri Lanka. Norfund is pleased to support NDB's growth strategy that targets small and medium-sized businesses.</p><p> This is aligned with Norfund's mandate. We recognise and appreciate that NDB has a strong management team and a competent board who share our value in upholding high environmental, social and governance standards.</p><p>\"\"Norfund is a long term investor with no fixed exit horizon,\" said Fay, joining via video conferencing.She said Norfund has around $ 1 billion in investments in Asia and confirmed the NDB deal was the first for 2021.Norfund is the Norwegian Investment Fund for developing countries, which is owned and funded by the Norwegian Government.</p><p>Norfund is the Governments most important tool for strengthening the private sector in developing countries and thereby contributing to economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction.Ambassador Eskedal said financial inclusion is critical to support growth and to reduce poverty and vulnerability.</p><p> \"Investing in financial institutions, like the NDB, and thereby contributing to increased access to capital for small and medium-sized companies, is therefore one of the main investment areas for Norfund,\" she added.She said Norfund's utmost ambition is to actively support NDB to achieve its vision of becoming \"the driving force for a financially empowered Sri Lanka\".</p><p>In addition to supporting the SMEs sector and promoting financial inclusion of the unbanked in Sri Lanka, Norfund will provide technical assistance and global expertise assisting the bank to promote global environmental and social standards, and to achieve best in class corporate governance. Another significant contribution from Norfund is to support NDB on its way forward to further strengthen its already excellent reputation in the market, both locally and internationally, Ambassador Eskedal said.</p><p>Norfund prioritises investments in four investment areas aligned with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals Clean Energy, Financial Institutions, Green infrastructure, and Scalable enterprises.

We believe in leading from the front in the sphere of caring for the environment, even at a time when some stakeholders in the global industry are still said to be driven by costs rather than green ethics.</p><p>This is just one of several environment-related CICT projects in the pipeline, and we intend to continue investing on initiatives to reduce emissions.'</p><p>The electrification of CICT's rubber-tyred gantry cranes involved modification work of fitting electricity collector trolleys in the RTG cranes and constructing a Conductor bar system (Bus-Bar) in the terminal for the cranes to function with electricity. Recognised around the world as an innovative port technology, E-RTGs have been proven to deliver significant environmental, technological and financial benefits to terminals.</p><p>Their environmental benefits include reducing air and noise pollution; in economic terms they reducing operating and maintenance costs and in terms of technology represent an optimisation of productivity and performance.</p><p>From its inception in 2013, CICT took the first step towards addressing environmental concerns by specifying and installing state-of-the-art hybrid-diesel engines for the full fleet of rubber-tyred gantry cranes. These engines had minimal impact on the emission of environment-impacting gases.</p><p>However, with the growing emphasis on addressing and reducing environmental damage on a continuous and sustainable basis in the maritime and port industry, CICT decided to make further significant capital investments in its contribution to reduce green-house gases.</p><p>In recognition of the importance of the E-RTG project, the ceremonial commissioning of the electrified gantry cranes was attended by several dignitaries including SLPA Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake, Vice Chairman P.G. Dassanayake, BOI Director Investment Appraisal Ranjan Sibera, BOI Executive Director Imports Ananda Rajakaruna, CICT Chairman Hang Tian, and senior representatives of CICT, CMPort, Haiqin (the project consultant), and ZPMC International Group and ZPMC Lanka, the project constructor.</p><p>CICT, which commenced operations in July 2013, manages the Colombo South Terminal of the Port of Colombo, the first and currently the only deep water terminal in South Asia equipped with facilities to handle the largest vessels afloat. The commencement of CICT's operations is widely credited as the factor in the Port of Colombo achieving double digit growth in 2014 after a lapse of over 10 years.</p><p>In just three years of operation, CICT has brought some of the largest vessels plying the Asia-Europe routes to Colombo. Of these, Milan Maersk (20,568 TEU), MSC Maya (19,224 TEU), Mogens Maersk (18,300 TEU), MSC New York (16,652 TEU), CMA CGM Marco Polo (16,020 TEU), Edith Maersk and EMC Thalassa Hellas (each 14,000 plus TEUs) and their sister vessels are now regular callers at CICT.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2411201700002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R1H-M671-JCH9-G2BP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"612\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 24, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

The waterlogged urban space was a result of extreme weather but also the rapid loss of a vital natural asset to the metropolitan region - wetlands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the past, these wetlands were thought of as wastelands, hot spots for disease, ideal locations for infilling and urban development. That changed when a World Bank study, in collaboration with the Sri Lankan government, revealed that restoring and rehabilitating current wetlands could enable ponds and basins to absorb up to 40% of the water during some flood events. It was then that Colombo made it a goal to conserve its urban and peri-urban wetlands. There is now increasing recognition that the wetlands of Colombo provide not just important disaster risk-reducing functions but a range of other services that support peoples' livelihoods and wellbeing.</p><p>To conserve the vital green infrastructure, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation  and  Development Corporation's Wetland Management Division developed the Wetland Management Strategy (WMS) in 2016.Now, with the help of the Sri Lanka-based International Water Management Institute (IWMI), who have been conducting wetland research in South Asia and Africa for years,Colombo has been honoured as one of the first 18 sites awarded the Ramsar Wetland City Accreditation. It is the only capital city selected.</p><p>This has scientists, conservationists and the government excited. It's a landmark achievement in the efforts of Sri Lanka to conserve and use wetlands wisely. And it's a reflection of the hard work of the urban planners, agencies and scientists of Colombo.</p><p>But the hard work isn't over. The honour brings an obligation to adhere to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs), sustain the wetlands and the eco system services wetlands provide, and to continue to advocate that wetlands are far more than wastelands.</p><p>Benefits and pressures of leadership</p><p>The accreditation is recognition by the Ramsar Convention - an international environmental treaty dedicated to wise use of wetlands - that Colombo's efforts are commendable and should be emulated by other cities.</p><p>And while the accreditation brings recognition and investment potential for green infrastructure, eco-tourism and economic development, it's also associated with responsibilities.</p><p>First, Colombo will need to continue to prevent degradation of wetlands. Colombo's wetlands are finite, and loss has run as high as 60 percent since the 1980's. Colombo cannot spare the loss of any more of these valuable ecosystems. A cabinet moratorium on wetlands is an important milestone ordering the stoppage of land reclamation and destruction of wetlands. Now, Colombo must turn to green infrastructure for its ecosystem services. Beyond flood retention areas, wetlands also offer a vast number of ecological and livelihood benefits: food production, recreation, cultural heritage, and air and water quality regulation.</p><p>Second, the city is now doubly committed to its WMS - decision makers will have to consider both natural ecosystem and community impacts, integrating wetland values into urban development and wetland conservation. Adopting a strategy like this requires continued capacity building. Colombo will need to maintain its training of staff on wetland values,as well as identifying, empowering and securing local communities' benefits from wetlands.</p><p>Third, Colombo's new status brings an opportunity for greater international exposure. We have lessons learned on planning and design for other cities.IWMI and partners presented the Colombo 'success story' to urban planners from Lao PDR in a recent workshop. Forty planners from across Lao PDR learned about green infrastructure concepts, the practicalities of implementation and the potential opportunities for their cities.</p><p>Finally, Colombo will have to justify retention of its accreditation in six years' time. This means implementing systems that monitor and track progress.We contributed the Colombo case study to 'Ramsar's Good Practices Handbook for Integrating Urban Development and Wetland Conservation.' This global resource showcases actions taken to integrate urban development and wetland conservation.Colombo planners are already utilizing some of these best practices, implementing ecosystem-based master planning and frameworks for baseline surveys and mapping.</p><p>The challenges of wise use</p><p>Quantifying the significance of wetlands circles back to the very reasons Colombo and the other sites were accredited- the cities demonstrated the vital benefits wetlands have for their residents.</p><p>Rapid population growth, climate change and other disruptors greatly complicate urban development. Thus, the challenge now is to continue to strengthen and enhance wetland benefits. As Colombo aptly illustrates, wetlands can and need to be a critical part of our urban future.</p><p>Dr. Priyanie Amerasinghe is a Senior Researcher with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and its CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE).

This will leverage public funds and policies to catalyse a blend of financing from private sources for increasing green infrastructure investments. Mobilising additional funds from the capital markets is a major objective of these vehicles. Public funds will be used as risk mitigators to create bankable projects and crowd in private funds, technology and efficiency improvements.</p><p>GFCF's nature as a facility, rather than a fund, will enable a holistic approach to green finance, through raising private funds not just for projects but also at the portfolio level, providing project development and structuring support and establishing a financing mechanism which links financial incentives with green targets, leveraging, credit ratings and capital markets access.</p><p>'A paradigm shift in infrastructure planning and design is an imperative for dynamically changing Asia. The choice that Asia makes in bridging infrastructure gaps will have profound implications for its people and the planet,' said ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Bambang Susantono.</p><p>'The publication is timely in providing practical institutional solutions for enhancing countries' financial systems to help them chart a greener, more sustainable future.'</p><p>The report directly responds to ADB member countries' needs to address the persisting shortfalls in infrastructure investments, estimated at over $ 1.7 trillion annually until 2030, taking into account climate change mitigation and adaptation costs. The proposed national green financing vehicles will help meet these needs while ensuring the best use and conservation of scarce natural resources.</p><p>Green finance covers a much bigger scope than climate finance and includes all financing instruments and investment decisions that are geared towards low-carbon, sustainable and inclusive development. The private sector, regarded as a critical contributor to meeting the region's development financing needs, will have to contribute over 50% of required green investments in many countries. In China this contribution is estimated at 90%.</p><p>The report is targeted at government and private sector professionals and informs country-specific structures that can assist in strengthening green growth initiatives, while allowing countries to reduce their national-level fiscal burden.</p><p>The catalysing green finance concept emerged late last year during ADB meetings with key government officials, various G20 green finance task force members including from China and the United Nations Environment Programme, and experts from the private sector. ADB worked with several of these experts to develop the report.</p><p>ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members-48 from the region. In 2016, ADB assistance totalled $ 31.7 billion, including $ 14 billion in co-financing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT0409201700033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PDM-8SF1-F00C-62RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 4, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

May I also commend Singapore and the UNEP for the excellent arrangements made for the Forum.</p><p>In this era, in which the global community is trying to achieve Sustainable Development Goals while addressing environment challenges, I am privileged to deliver the Keynote speech at this Forum of Ministers and Environment Authorities of the Asia Pacific on behalf of Sri Lanka.</p><p>The attention of the world is drawn to environmental matters of regional significance which require solutions of global scale. Hence, I take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to the UN Environment - Asia Pacific for their lead role on global scale as well as their role in strengthening regional cooperation.</p><p>Mr President,</p><p>Economic, social and environmental sustainability of the world, particularly of our region, is severely affected by adverse impacts of climate change. In such an era, it is appreciative that the Fourth Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly is being thematically organized focusing on human knowledge and skills towards innovative solutions that successfully address environmental challenges.</p><p>Being a follower of the Buddhist philosophy, I firmly believe that we are responsible for securing the sustenance of, not only mankind, but also the life on earth as a whole.</p><p>Hence, I trust that the Fourth Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly, to be held in March, will be a productive venture to ensure global food security.</p><p>It is our prime duty to assure the right to live in a safe environment and introduce environmentally sound economic trends that build upon sustainable global economic indices. Therefore, it is important to strengthen our regional cooperation in order to fulfil all environmental responsibilities and our obligations.</p><p>As a descendent from a proud agricultural civilization, it gives me an immense pleasure to share Sri Lankan experiences with you for the betterment of the whole world. Our ancestors were blessed with food security as they respected nature.</p><p>While reaching for innovative dimensions towards global food security and encouraging sustainable consumption patterns, Sri Lanka has proposed a resolution on managing food waste at the forthcoming UN Environment Assembly.</p><p>Human activities should not threaten the regeneration capacity of nature and it is the sole responsibility of the mankind to implement activities which will strengthen the regenerative capacity of nature.</p><p>The fertile soil and associated soil life are the heart of nature. Forests, which nurture soil resources as well as the waterways, are the blood of mother-earth and should be gifted to future generations securely. I consider it is our responsibility.</p><p>We should stand together to protect the eco-systems, especially wetlands from chemical pollutants. Sri Lanka is always committed to play our role for global environment conservation. Championing the mangrove conservation in Commonwealth Blue Charter is a promising effort in this regard. As a way forward, and to implement a comprehensive programme on global scale, Sri Lanka has proposed a resolution on mangrove conservation for the Fourth Session of the UN Environment Assembly.</p><p>Mr President,</p><p>I emphasize the need for the implementation of the resolutions of previous UN Environment Assemblies in order to achieve expected outcomes. Further, as a regional body, Asia Pacific office would request UN Environment Programme, to intervene in establishing an effective mechanism to monitor the progress of implementing the resolutions.</p><p>In addition, I would like to highlight the importance of initiating action to revise environment conventions according to timely requirements.</p><p>Further, I propose to establish a system which encourages member countries to successfully achieve the expected commitments under environment conventions. A strong funding mechanism to assist countries like Sri Lanka, which are severely affected by adverse impacts of climate change, has to be established for achieving sustainable development goals. The support of developed countries and regional cooperation should be broadened in order to strengthen the sustainable industries to reap the benefits of blue green economies.</p><p>The UN Clean Seas Campaign has showcased remarkable achievements in protecting oceans around the world. In pursuant to the campaign, Sri Lanka has proposed another resolution for UNEA-4 in order to minimize ocean pollution from land based activities including micro plastic. As a region we should work hand in hand, to promote innovative environment friendly solutions to address the burning issue of marine pollution in our region.</p><p>With regret, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Sri Lanka has been ranked second in the Global Climate Risk Index 2019. Being a tropical island, Sri Lanka's dry zone covers 70% of its land area and receives less than 1,500 millimetres of rainfall per year.</p><p>Despite all the challenges of adverse impacts of climate change, Sri Lanka has commissioned the Moragahakanda and Kaluganga multipurpose water resources projects as one of the largest recent green investment. This was introduced to combat the adverse effects of climate change. It provides water for drinking and agricultural purposes for the communities in the dry zone. These twin reservoirs, with the capacity of 817 Million Cubic Meters, boost the economy through irrigating additional 84,000 hectares of farmlands. They generate 25 MW hydro-powers.</p><p>I gracefully invite the world community to observe Sri Lanka's courageous and ambitious efforts to combat the effects of climate change and to invest in green infrastructure.</p><p>While we conserve our traditional cascade irrigation system which is a UNESCO world heritage, we have invested on green infrastructure. This project rehabilitates 2500 irrigation tanks and irrigation canal more than 260 kilometres.</p><p>Though with very limited land, the Government of Sri Lanka has implemented the ambitious project, 'Wanaropa', to increase the forest cover from 29% to 32% by year 2030. I gracefully invite the world community to observe Sri Lanka's courageous and ambitious efforts to combat the effects of climate change and to invest in green infrastructure.</p><p>Mr President,</p><p>As a partner in the Asia Pacific region, Sri Lanka believes the outcome of this meeting will provide invaluable regional perspectives / for the forthcoming Session of the UN Environment Assembly. I am confident that this Forum will help to achieve our shared common regional goals and wish this forum a great success.</p><p>May the blessings of the noble triple gem be always with you!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM2601201900003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V97-1N81-F00C-61G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 26, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

Understanding the critical importance of flood preparedness, the city of New Orleans has developed a timeline-based disaster response and evacuation plan that includes improved planning and evacuation of high-risk citizens during emergency.</p><p>This includes improving capacity to evacuate the city's high-risk population on short notice, massive community awareness campaigns-such as NOLA Ready -- and training of volunteers. Innovative programs are in place for special needs citizens to ensure that they are alerted and evacuated in times of emergency.</p><p>A major focus is on communicating flood risk to individual homeowners so that they can make more informed decisions about retrofitting their homes. NOLA Ready's website has a dedicated webpage which provides homeowners with details of flood risk in their property, suggestions to improve flood resilience, and</p><p>available resources.</p><p>3.Consider green infrastructure.</p><p>Post Hurricane Katrina New Orleans is gradually starting to invest in the development of green areas that can absorb excess storm water to reduce flood impacts and help recharge ground water. Green infrastructure or Nature Based Systems not only support drainage (gray) infrastructure but can also potentially reduce flood risk in a cost effective way. Research is currently ongoing in New Orleans on measures to reduce impacts from mosquitoes and other water borne diseases in planned green areas.</p><p>No time left for poor decisions</p><p>As we left New Orleans, we couldn't help thinking about the Flooded House Museum, which has been preserved to remind people about the fatal impacts from Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>The city seemed to have learned many lessons from the bitter experience, and has improved planning, engineering design, coordination, and public awareness on flood risk management.</p><p>The study tour to New Orleans offered a great opportunity for the Sri Lankan delegation to learn from post Hurricane Katrina efforts. Eng. Sudharma Elakanda, the Project Director of Sri Lanka's Climate Resilience Improvement Project, summarized the visit: \"We are planning for large flood protection infrastructure in Kelani river basin, but we lack experience with large flood protection works. This visit gave us the exposure and confidence that we can carefully build and effectively maintain the embankments and pumping stations, learning from New Orleans' experience.\"</p><p>As climate change impacts worsen, there is no time for Sri Lanka to make poor decisions. It will be important to carefully design and implement flood mitigation measures and build inclusive and functioning flood warning and</p><p>response systems.</p><p>(Asmita Tiwari is Senior Urban and Disaster Risk Management Specialist at the World Bank.

On top of it, millions of saplings have been planted, although with an extremely low success rate, over the past several years to mark the birthdays of political leaders of the ruling party. The environmental situation in the country is, however, deteriorating day by day, with environmental issues assuming alarming proportions. Burgeoning population, migration from rural to urban areas, unscientific and irrational urbanisation, uncoordinated and ad hoc industrial growth and poor waste management along with poor implementation of environmental policies have, among others, contributed to the above situation.</p><p>Against this backdrop, it seems fitting that a 'blue-green budget' was recently presented for 2018. Under the circumstances, it is apposite to look at new concepts, strategies and emerging trends in infrastructure development in other countries to promote green cities and green growth, striking a balance between economic development and environment.</p><p>Cities and towns as a major source of environmental pollution and ecological footprint</p><p>Cities, which occupy only 3% of the Earth's land surface, accommodate half the human population, use 75% of the resources, and account for 70% of the CO2 emissions, contributing to an enormous carbon footprint (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cepal.org/en\">https://www.cepal.org/en</url>/ /37700-are-we-building-competitive-and-liveable-cities). Migration from rural to urban areas and urbanisation occur unabated adding to the ecological footprint, exerting unmanageable pressure on the planet.</p><p>Therefore it is a formidable challenge to provide essential services and amenities to a rapidly expanding urban population and maintain habitability and competitiveness of local cities in a globalised environment while minimising the ecological footprint. City infrastructure has a profound effect on environmental health, habitability and competitiveness of cities. Because of the long lifespan and heavy capital outlay involved, it is of utmost importance to correctly and smartly plan, design and build infrastructure, taking into account environmental sustainability, competitiveness and quality of life.</p><p>Global trends and developments in urban planning and development</p><p>Eco-efficiency is an important parameter used widely in infrastructure development. It is a management philosophy that seeks to develop synergy between economy and environment thereby reducing the use of resources such as land, water, energy and raw materials and generation of waste and pollution. It will thus maximise return on investment and promote green growth and green economy. Stated differently, eco-efficiency aims at maximising environmental sustainability, competitiveness and quality of life. This concept is being vigorously pursued in many cities of Europe, North America and Asia, especially Japan, Singapore and Malaysia, to establish eco-efficient and socially inclusive infrastructure with a view to building clean, green, healthy and smart cities.</p><p>People rarely think of forests, wetlands, groves, grasslands, water ways, ponds, coral reefs, and other natural ecosystems as forms of infrastructure. But, they are. Forests, for instance, prevent silt and pollutants from entering streams that provide freshwater to downstream cities and enterprises, and act as a natural water filtration system. Thus they are a form of 'green infrastructure' that can serve the same purpose as 'grey infrastructure' the human-engineered solution that often involves concrete, bitumen and steel.</p><p>Green infrastructure has been successfully used to improve the habitability and environmental sustainability of many cities in the world. Restoration of mangroves rather than building dikes to protect shorelines from storm damage in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, upstream landscape conservation and restoration as an alternative to conventional water treatment technologies in Bogota, Columbia, and conserving and fostering mangroves, dunes and coral reefs in the Andaman Islands instead of building a sea wall are to name, but a few.</p><p>Another noteworthy feature of green infrastructure is that it is often far less costly than grey infrastructure. For instance, New York City evaluated two schemes to manage its storm water flow, one a green infrastructure comprising stream buffer restoration, green roofs, bio-swales and landscape elements designed to remove silt and pollution from surface run off, and the other a grey infrastructure comprising tunnels and storm drains. Adopting the former helped to cut cost by more than $1.5 billion, but with comparable outcome.</p><p>Another emerging concept regarding infrastructure in urban areas is Blue Green Cities. Here water resources and green space are integrated for improved environmental health, quality of life and sustainability by combining and protecting hydrological and ecological functions and the values of urban landscape. That will enhance the evaporative cooling effect from a matrix of green corridors, street trees, green or living roofs and walls and water bodies. It will also improve hydrological performance through high evaporation, high infiltration and low surface run-off. All of these benefits are of prime importance.</p><p>Urban planning and development in Sri Lanka</p><p>While many countries in the world are responding to change by building liveable, competitive and sustainable green cities based on eco-efficient and socially inclusive infrastructure, we seem to be clinging on to grey infrastructure. A look at the infrastructure landscape including new constructions in many towns in our country will show that it predominantly constitutes grey infrastructure built of concrete, mortar, bitumen and steel along with impervious paving of gardens, paths and premises devoid of open areas and green spaces. Such infrastructure, in the name of 'development' and urbanisation, is progressively eating into the remaining limited green spaces of towns, adding to environmental issues and climate change. The highly contagious fashion and passion to pave indiscriminately roadsides, footpaths, jogging tracks, gardens, premises of offices and business establishments has taken grip of our country.</p><p>Recently I painfully observed how a long and wide stretch of green space on the coast of Weligama was replaced with impervious pavers, an environmental disaster. Impervious concrete and asphalt areas are rampant in the infrastructure landscape of our country. For instance, the Kotuwegoda Beach Park is practically the only resort for leisure, relaxation, recreation and social interaction at Matara; however, over 35% of its area is covered by impervious concrete and asphalt particularly for purpose of parking buses as well as heavy vehicles.</p><p>A survey by Dr. Chaminda Kumara and his team of the University of Ruhuna revealed that the visitors to the park disliked the concrete and asphalt covered areas as they were inhospitable, particularly during the day and desired more green space in the park. Studies by Dr. Sunanda Kodikara and his team of the same University found that, at noon, the ambient temperature over concrete paved areas was about 3-5\u00b0C higher than that over grass cover. Besides, such impervious cover seal off the soil preventing infiltration of rainwater and recharge of groundwater aquifers and increasing run-off to overstretch drains and sewers and thereby contribute to flash floods.</p><p>For this reason, prior permission from the relevant authorities is mandatory in some countries for paving land with impermeable material. For instance, in the UK prior permission from the relevant authority is necessary even in private property if the area to be paved exceeds 5 m2. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paving.org/index.php/planning-permission-for-paving-a-garden/\">https://www.paving.org/index.php/planning-permission-for-paving-a-garden/</url>). Why do we not adopt such practices as appropriate to curtail the menacing growth of paved areas which contribute to flash floods, poor recharge of ground water aquifers and rise in ambient temperature?</p><p>Sri Lanka being an island nation, the recharge of groundwater aquifers is of prime importance, particularly in coastal areas, to minimise the intrusion of salt water. This matter should receive utmost attention in the light of rising sea level and lowering water table owing to unplanned, ad hoc and uncoordinated infrastructure development including impervious paving, over-extraction of ground water, unsustainable land use practices, etc. As evident from Fig. 1, saltwater intrusion occurs naturally to some degree in most coastal aquifers, owing to the hydraulic connection between groundwater and seawater. Since saline water has a higher mineral content than freshwater, it is denser and has a higher hydraulic head (liquid pressure exerted by a water column). As a result, saltwater can push inland beneath the freshwater. This process has been held in check because of the greater height of fresh water columns than the sea water column. However, with the rise of sea level and the drop of the water table due to the said reasons, the equilibrium will be lost; consequently more sea water will diffuse into fresh water causing contamination of ground water aquifers thereby posing a serious threat to drinking water.</p><p>Therefore the subject of intrusion of sea water and its implications has assumed paramount importance, particularly in the island nations. Dr. Gregory De Costa, Senior Lecturer, Department of Civil Engineering at Unitech, New Zealand has done extensive research on this subject highlighting the consequences of intrusion of sea water on fresh water supplies in coastal areas where nearly half of the world population lives (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.unitec.ac.nz/about-us/rising-sea-levels-gregory-de-costa\">http://www.unitec.ac.nz/about-us/rising-sea-levels-gregory-de-costa</url>).</p><p>Translating scientific knowledge to design principles in Sri Lanka</p><p>There is growing awareness in cities throughout the world that green and blue infrastructure can offer a wide range of ecosystem services to support a healthy urban environment. For example, landscape architects explore possibilities in their design of the urban landscape to use the potential of green and blue elements for regulating air temperature, air quality, water storage and drainage, and noise reduction. Our politicians and officials travel abroad frequently to attend UN sessions and international conferences related to environmental management, urban planning and development and climate change, and to study modern eco-cities. Yet, hardly any concerted and concentrated effort is being made in our country to derive the potential benefits of green and blue infrastructure. Hence there is a crying need for translation of scientific knowledge on the functionality of green and blue infrastructure into design principles and to integrate these principles into the design of multifunctional green and blue infrastructure.</p><p>The quotation 'Politics is too serious a matter to be left to the politicians' is attributed to Charles de Gaulle. Likewise, coastal zone management is too serious a matter to be left to a few institutions because about half of the population and half of the GDP of the country come from the coastal areas since economic activities such as manufacturing, trade, tourism, banking, insurance, fisheries, port and shipping are concentrated in this region. Besides, this region is very important from environmental, social and cultural points of view as well.</p><p>Therefore a holistic approach is necessary for coastal zone management including infrastructure development in this area because of its far-reaching implications for ground water recharge and sea water intrusion affecting the supply of drinking water among other things. Mega projects already under way and proposed projects will make an unprecedentedly heavy demand on fresh water resources, and the success of the projects is highly contingent upon availability of quality fresh water in adequate quantity. This is a formidable challenge that has received scant attention. There is little time to waste and delay could prove to be disastrous. Therefore all relevant institutions such as the Coast Conservation Department, Central Environment Authority, Urban Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, and local government institutions as well as the academia should join forces and work in concert to plan, design and build infrastructure with the right blend of grey, green and blue for environmental sustainability, habitability and quality of life, leaving no room for unplanned and uncoordinated physical growth for protecting and fostering the precious ground water aquifers in the country.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2401201800002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGJ-J3X1-F00C-63D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2229\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 24, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

While conservationists and the government of Sri Lanka are excited about the landmark achievement, it should also be reminded that this award brings an obligation to all the parties to sustain the vital green wetlands and the eco-system services that these wetlands provide by abiding to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Which means, Colombo should monitor and track progress in conserving and sustainable use of the green infrastructure and will have to justify retention of the accreditation for the next six years - the Independent Advisory Committee will review the status of the accredited Wetland City in every six years (Resolution XII.10: Wetland City Accreditation of the Ramsar Convention, 2015).</p><p>The Asian Wetland Directory describes that the country has 41 wetland sites of international importance covering an area of 274,000 ha out of which the Colombo Wetland Complex covers 1,900 ha - which is almost eight percent of the city's total area. (S. S. Atapattu, S. D. Silva, S. S. Sellamuttu )</p><p>See table 1</p><p>What are wetlands?</p><p>According to (S. W. Kotagama, C. N. B. Bambaradeniya, 2006), wetlands are the habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated floral and faunal communities. The Ramsar convention further elaborated the term as \"areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.\"</p><p>Wetlands of Sri Lanka can be divided into three broad categories as inland natural fresh water wetlands (e.g. rivers, stream, marshes, swamp forests and villus), marine and salt-water wetlands (e.g. lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds, and coral reefs) and man-made wetlands (e.g. tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns).</p><p>Wetlands provide numerous services</p><p>Wetlands comprise of a combination of water, soils, flora and fauna and the interaction between the elements allow this green infrastructure to perform several functions that are beneficial to humankind as well as the environment. The combination of these functions, together with the rich bio-diversity and cultural heritage of wetlands makes these ecosystems invaluable to people all over the world. The services that a wetland provides can be classified into four broad groups including provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services.</p><p>See table 2</p><p>\"This green infrastructure plays vital hydrological regulating functions such as surface water holding, groundwater recharge, flow regulation, flood mitigation and water-quality control. Due to their importance in the hydrological cycle the wetlands are considered as a key component in strategies for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).\"</p><p>(M. M. Cartney, L. Rebelo, S. S. Sellamuttu, S. D. Silva, 2010)</p><p>Does these wetlands are vulnerable?</p><p>Whatsoever the wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that change over time as a consequence of natural phenomena such as soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding. However, human activities, both within the wetland or in the catchment can influence these natural processes and accelerate the rate of change, threatening the wetland's sustainability and even the existence. Kotagama S.W. summerised the threats to wetlands in Sri Lanka under four major categories; habitat deterioration/degradation, direct loss/exploitation of species, spread of invasive alien species and natural phenomena. Farming in the river basins and upstream combined with heavy usage of agrochemicals are major threats to both fresh water and man-made wetlands. The seeped and percolated chemicals are often responsible for the degradation of water quality in the downstream as well as deteriorate the wetland habitats. Soil erosion due to unprotected upstream agricultural practices enhances the sedimentation is seen as a potential threat that will increase with the intensification of agriculture.</p><p>Coastal erosion on the other hand is another problem, which is brought about by altered currents and sediment loads, and can also be caused by coastal land uses such as unauthorized constructions. Reclamation for urban development, solid waste/garbage disposal and sand mining contributes to alter the structure of the wetland. Wetland habitat deterioration can be occurred due to clearing vegetation especially in the coastal belt and unauthorized and untreated sewage dumping to urban wetlands. The unplanned irrigation structures, regulation of water flow through large water infrastructure i.e. dams and mini hydro resulted in degradation of the quality of wetlands.</p><p>Wetland dependent communities rely on them for their income generation as well as living. Overexploitation of associated fauna and flora by these communities resulted in risking the extinction of several species. The most visible example is fisheries and water birds that are being poached for consumption, while less visible but important changes may also take place in the micro faunal communities that support the ecology of the system and the food chain. Tourism as well as freshwater recreation and trade of ornamental plants and species polluted the eco-system, which leads to the loss of native species in the wetlands.</p><p>The introduced exotic aquatic animal and plant species can be eventually escaped into wild habitats can create serious threat to native aquatic biodiversity. The ornamental fish trade mostly established around water bodies has become the sole contributor to introducing invasive alien aquatic species in Sri Lanka. The most prominent examples that can be seen in local wetlands are these four species of fauna (Tilapia - Oreochromis mossambicus, Walking catfish - Clarias batrachus, Rainbow Trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss and Mosquito fish - Gambusia affinis) and two species of flora (Water Hyacinth - Eichhornia crassipes and Giant Mimosa - Mimosa pigra) that are also included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species. (100 of the World's worst invasive alien species, 2004). The spreading of alien invasive species can lead to direct exploitation of native species as it creates a competition for limited resources. The agricultural pests/weeds can also be threatened through this while deteriorating the quality of the wetlands.</p><p>\"Despite all the services they provide wetlands worldwide continuously threatened in different forms by human activities, and Sri Lanka is no exception. Reclamation and clearing for urban expansion, unsustainable solid waste disposal from domestic and industrial sources and the release of industrial, domestic and commercial waste have greatly diminished the health of the wetland ecosystem. Recent increases in flood damages and declining of aquatic biodiversity are, in part, the results of wetlands degradation and destruction. In this context, conservation of our natural heritage is the duty of any responsible citizen\", stated Prof Deepthi Wickramasinghe, Head/Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences, University of Colombo. Wetlands are also threatened by natural phenomena which is also common in Sri Lanka. For instance, the prolonged dry conditions in the dry zone results drying off of tanks, streams, salt marshes and lagoons, causing death to several species of flora and fauna. The rise of seawater temperature due to climate change bleaches the coral reefs, especially in the southwestern part of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Steps taken to protect the wetlands</p><p>The vigilance for wetland conservation reached high in Sri Lanka with the high intensity and frequent flash floods occurred in the last few years around the country. Consequently, a significant Cabinet decision was taken on August 21, 2018 by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, by providing the following recommendations,</p><p>- to impose a prohibitory order preventing all types of land reclamation and constructions in the Colombo Metropolitan Region for any other purpose other than the constructions necessary to be done which are of national importance and the constructions identified under the Transit Railway Line Network.</p><p>- to direct the Director General of Wildlife to declare the wetlands, other than the areas recognized adjacent to Kimbulaela and Diyawanna Oya in which the development activities have already been initiated, as protected areas.</p><p>Sri Lanka ratified the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1990 and established its National Wetland Steering Committee (NWSC) while the Committee was reconstituted in 2003 to integrate plans for wetland areas and to coordinate development and conservation activities. This resulted in the formal adoption of a National Wetland Policy under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in 2004.</p><p>Since 1897 with the broadcasting of \"protect the coastal belt systems\" Sri Lanka has taken major steps towards conserving its wetlands. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937 can be considered as another giant step. Using this legislation, wetlands of importance to birds have been declared as sanctuaries and other protected areas by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. In between, establishment of and Wetland Steering Committee, hosting international workshops on wetlands and declaring six Ramsar wetland sites (Bundala, Anaiwilundawa, Maduganga, Venkali Santuary, Kumana Wetland Cluster and Wilpattu Wetland showed the country's willingness to protect this valuable water bodies.</p><p>Currently, the Government of Sri Lanka, non-government organisations, research organisations and academia as well as the cooperate sector involved in wetland conservation and management related activities in the country.</p><p>\"The National Wetland Policy published in 2006 highlighted the need for an effective institutional mechanism to coordinate wetland conservation activities in the country. As a result, a wetland management unit has been established at the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) for overall coordination of wetland activities in the country. Accordingly, we have identified Environmental Protection Areas [EPA], as per provisions of the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1980, which also includes six wetlands sites. The CEA shall exercise, perform and discharge any powers, duties, functions related to planning and development, within such protection areas,\" stated by Priyangani Gunathilaka, Acting Director, Natural Resources and Catchment Programme, CEA.</p><p>A suggestion to wetland management</p><p>We all have a role to play in sustainable wetlands management -to ensure the wetland dependent communities continue to obtain the benefits that wetlands provide for reducing poverty and to ensure balanced ecosystems. The book on Wetlands and People suggestsa 'people-centred approach' to wetland management - a balanced approach that seeks to optimise the benefits for poor people, including through appropriate wetland agriculture, while simultaneously protecting vital ecosystem services - is essential if wetlands are to be conserved for future generations. This people-centred approach complements the 'wise use' principle put forward by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1987.</p><p>Wetland policies need to better reflect the realities of wetland agriculture - the dilemma remains how to maximize the benefits of agriculture whilst simultaneously minimizing the adverse impacts on other valuable ecosystem services. Research is required to better understand trade-offs and determine best management practices.</p><p>\"Moving from wetland protection alone to integrating conservation and development is a significant step - because managing wetlands to support people's livelihoods will not always be totally corresponding with managing them for conservation objectives. There will often be conflicts and trade-offs between livelihood requirements and conservation; these require skillful and innovative forms of management.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

While conservationists and the Sri Lankan Government are excited about the landmark achievement, it should also be borne in mind that this award brings an obligation to all parties to sustain the vital green wetlands and ecosystem services these wetlands provide by abiding to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Which means, Colombo should monitor and track progress in conserving and sustainable use of green infrastructure and will have to justify retention of the accreditation for the next six years -- the Independent Advisory Committee will review the status of the accredited Wetland City in every six years (Resolution XII.10: Wetland City Accreditation of the Ramsar Convention, 2015).</p><p>The Asian Wetland Directory describes that the country has 41 wetland sites of international importance covering an area of 274,000ha out of which the Colombo Wetland Complex covers 1,900ha - which is almost eight per cent of the city's total area (S.S. Atapattu, S.D. Silva, S.S. Sellamuttu).</p><p>The 18 Wetland Cities accredited at COP13:</p><p>China - Changde City, Changshu City, Dongying City, Haikou City, Haerbin City, Yinchuan City; France - Amiens, Courteranges, Pont-Audemer, Saint-Omer; Hungary - Tata; Republic of Korea - Changnyeong County, Inje County, Jeju City, Suncheon City; Madagascar - Mitsinjo; Sri Lanka - Colombo; Tunisia - Ghar el Melh (Source: COP13 Conference Report, 2018).</p><p>WHAT ARE WETLANDS?</p><p>According to (S.W. Kotagama, C.N.B. Bambaradeniya, 2006), wetlands are habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated floral and faunal communities. The Ramsar Convention further elaborated the term as \"areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.\"</p><p>Wetlands of Sri Lanka can be divided into three broad categories as inland natural fresh water wetlands (e.g. rivers, streams, marshes, swamp forests and villus), marine and salt-water wetlands (e.g. lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds and coral reefs) and man-made wetlands (e.g. tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns).</p><p>WETLANDS PROVIDE NUMEROUS SERVICES</p><p>Wetlands comprise of a combination of water, soils, flora and fauna and the interaction between elements allow this green infrastructure to perform several functions that are beneficial to humankind as well as the environment. The combination of these functions, together with the rich bio-diversity and cultural heritage of wetlands, makes these ecosystems invaluable to people all over the world. The services a wetland provides can be classified into four broad groups including provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services.</p><p>SERVICES - COMMENTS AND EXAMPLES</p><p>Provisioning; Food, fresh water, fibres and fuel, biochemical, genetic material</p><p>Regulating; Climate regulation, water regulation (hydrological flows), water purification and waste treatment, erosion regulation, natural hazard regulation, pollination</p><p>Cultural; Spiritual and inspirational ecosystems, recreational, aesthetic and educational</p><p>Supporting; Soil formation, nutrient cycling and biodiversity</p><p>Sediment retention and accumulation of organic matter</p><p>\"This green infrastructure plays vital hydrological regulating functions such as surface water holding, groundwater recharge, flow regulation, flood mitigation and water-quality control. Due to their importance in the hydrological cycle the wetlands are considered as a key component in strategies for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM)\" -- (M.M. Cartney, L. Rebelo, S.S. Sellamuttu, S.D. Silva, 2010).</p><p>ARE WETLANDS VULNERABLE?</p><p>Whatsoever the wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that change over time as a consequence of natural phenomena such as soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding. However, human activities, both within the wetland or in the catchment can influence these natural processes and accelerate the rate of change, threatening the wetland's sustainability and even the existence. Kotagama S.W. summerised the threats to wetlands in Sri Lanka under four major categories; habitat deterioration/degradation, direct loss/exploitation of species, spread of invasive alien species and natural phenomena. Farming in the river basins and upstream combined with heavy usage of agrochemicals are major threats to both fresh water and manmade wetlands.</p><p>The seeped and percolated chemicals are often responsible for the degradation of water quality in the downstream as well as deteriorate the wetland habitats. Soil erosion due to unprotected upstream agricultural practices which enhances the sedimentation is seen as a potential threat that will increase with the intensi?cation of agriculture.</p><p>Coastal erosion on the other hand is another problem, which is brought about by altered currents and sediment loads, and can also be caused by coastal land uses such as unauthorised constructions. Reclamation for urban development, solid waste/garbage disposal and sand mining contributes to alter the structure of the wetland. Wetland habitat deterioration can be occurred due to clearing vegetation especially in the coastal belt and unauthorised and untreated sewage dumping to urban wetlands. The unplanned irrigation structures, regulation of water flow through large water infrastructure i.e. dams and mini hydro resulted in degradation of the quality of wetlands.</p><p>Wetland dependent communities rely on them for their income generation as well as living. Overexploitation of associated fauna and ?ora by these communities resulted in risking the extinction of several species. The most visible examples are ?sheries and water birds that are being poached for consumption, while less visible but important changes may also take place in the micro faunal communities that support the ecology of the system and the food chain. Tourism as well as freshwater recreation and trade of ornamental plants and species polluted the eco-system, which leads to the loss of native species in the wetlands.</p><p>The introduced exotic aquatic animal and plant species can be eventually escaped into wild habitats can create serious threat to native aquatic biodiversity. The ornamental fish trade mostly established around water bodies has become the sole contributor to introducing invasive alien aquatic species in Sri Lanka. The most prominent examples that can be seen in local wetlands are these four species of fauna (Tilapia - Oreochromis mossambicus, Walking catfish - Clarias batrachus, Rainbow Trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss and Mosquito fish - Gambusia affinis) and two species of flora (Water Hyacinth - Eichhornia crassipes and Giant Mimosa - Mimosa pigra) that are also included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species (100 of the World's worst invasive alien species, 2004). The spreading of alien invasive species can lead to direct exploitation of native species as it creates a competition for limited resources. The agricultural pests/weeds can also be threatened through this while deteriorating the quality of the wetlands.</p><p>\"Despite all the services they provide wetlands worldwide continuously threatened in different forms by human activities, and Sri Lanka is no exception. Reclamation and clearing for urban expansion, unsustainable solid waste disposal from domestic and industrial sources and the release of industrial, domestic and commercial waste have greatly diminished the health of the wetland ecosystem. Recent increases in flood damages and declining of aquatic biodiversity are, in part, the results of wetlands degradation and destruction. In this context, conservation of our natural heritage is the duty of any responsible citizen,\" said Prof. Deepthi Wickramasinghe, Head/Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences, Colombo University.</p><p>Wetlands are also threatened by natural phenomena which are also common in Sri Lanka. For instance, the prolonged dry conditions in the dry zone results drying off of tanks, streams, salt marshes and lagoons, causing death to several species of flora and fauna. The rise of seawater temperature due to climate change bleaches the coral reefs, especially in the southwestern part of Sri Lanka.</p><p>STEPS TAKEN TO PROTECT WETLANDS</p><p>The vigilance for wetland conservation reached high in Sri Lanka with the high intensity and frequent flash floods that occurred in the last few years around the country. Consequently, a significant Cabinet decision was taken on August 21, 2018 by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister, by providing the following recommendations;</p><p>- to impose a prohibitory order preventing all types of land reclamation and constructions in the Colombo metropolitan region for any purpose other than the constructions necessary to be done which are of national importance and the constructions identified under the Transit Railway Line Network.</p><p>- to direct the Director-General of Wildlife to declare the wetlands, other than the areas recognised adjacent to Kimbulaela and Diyawanna Oya in which the development activities have already been initiated, as protected areas.</p><p>Sri Lanka rati?ed the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1990 and established its National Wetland Steering Committee (NWSC) while the committee was reconstituted in 2003 to integrate plans for wetland areas and to coordinate development and conservation activities. This resulted in the formal adoption of a national wetland policy under the auspices of the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry in 2004.</p><p>Since 1897, with the broadcasting of \"protect the coastal belt systems,\" Sri Lanka has taken major steps towards conserving its wetlands. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937 can be considered as another giant step. Using this legislation, wetlands of importance to birds have been declared as sanctuaries and other protected areas by the Wildlife Conservation Department. In between, establishment of a Wetland Steering Committee, hosting international workshops on wetlands and declaring six Ramsar wetland sites (Bundala, Anawilundawa, Madu ganga, Venkali Santuary, Kumana Wetland Cluster and Wilpattu Wetland) showed the country's willingness to protect these valuable water bodies.</p><p>Currently, the Sri Lankan Government, non-governmental organisations, research organisations and academia as well as the corporate sector are involved in wetland conservation and management related activities in the country.</p><p>\"The National Wetland Policy published in 2006 highlighted the need for an effective institutional mechanism to coordinate wetland conservation activities in the country. As a result, a wetland management unit has been established at the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) for overall coordination of wetland activities in the country. Accordingly, we have identified Environmental Protection Areas (EPAs), as per provisions of the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1980, which also includes six wetlands sites. The CEA shall exercise, perform and discharge any powers, duties, functions related to planning and development, within such protection areas,\" said Mrs. Priyangani Gunathilaka, Acting Directress, Natural Resources and Catchment Programme, CEA.</p><p>SUGGESTION TO WETLAND MANAGEMENT</p><p>We all have a role to play in sustainable wetlands management - to ensure the wetland dependent communities continue to obtain the benefits that wetlands provide for reducing poverty and to ensure balanced ecosystems. The book on 'Wetlands and People' suggests a 'people-centred approach' to wetland management - a balanced approach that seeks to optimise the benefits for poor people, including through appropriate wetland agriculture, while simultaneously protecting vital ecosystem services - is essential if wetlands are to be conserved for future generations. This people-centred approach complements the 'wise use' principle put forward by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1987.</p><p>Wetland policies need to better reflect the realities of wetland agriculture - the dilemma remains as to how to maximise the benefits of agriculture whilst simultaneously minimising the adverse impacts on other valuable ecosystem services. Research is required to better understand trade-offs and determine best management practices.</p><p>\"Moving from wetland protection alone to integrating conservation and development is a significant step - because managing wetlands together with the fast growing economy, urbanisation and infrastructure development while supporting people's livelihoods will not always be totally corresponding with managing them for conservation objectives. There will often be conflicts and trade-offs between people's desires and conservation; these require skillful and innovative forms of management,\" said Mr. Pay Drechsel, Senior Resercher at IWMI who also represents Thalangama Wetland Watch.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Yala and Wilpattu are the best places in the world to see leopards; Minneriya, Kaudulla and Uda Walawe to view large herds of Asian Elephants; Mirissa, Kalpitiya and Trinco for blue and sperm whales.</p><p>Sri Lanka is the only place in the world where one can see the largest sea mammal (the whale) in the morning and see the largest land mammal (the elephant) in the same afternoon.</p><p>Development and bio diversity conservation go hand in hand to ensure sustainable economic development. Although the government's commitment to promote conservation tourism is commendable it has not taken the right path.</p><p>The focus of Sri Lanka Tourism is on the number of visitors and not on the quality of the experience. The government will promote construction of hotels in buffer zones of PAs and additional bungalows within the National Parks.</p><p>These policies are contrary to sustainable conservation tourism. These are not what the conservation tourists want. A survey conducted by interviewing international visitors to PAs (Yala, Uda Walawe, Minneriya, Bundala and Sinharaja) confirm that high satisfaction with the wildlife experience and dissatisfaction with the poor quality of guides, over crowding of parks and traffic congestion in the parks.</p><p>Conservation tourists are willing to pay 60 percent more as entrance fees if the quality of the experience improves. We should aim for high value added, low impact tourism.</p><p>Surveys show that currently \"non-package\" tourists visiting National Parks spend more than double compared with the regular \"package tourists\".</p><p>Accommodation facilities should be low impact and tented safari camping and eco-friendly resorts in forests should be outside the buffer zones. The number of tourists entering these sensitive ecosystems should always remain below capacity.</p><p>Landscapes surrounding PAs are a part of an ecologically sensitive ecosystem. Therefore, development projects in such areas should be sensitive to the ecosystem and be within its carrying capacity. Extra investment in \"greening\" infrastructure in sensitive ecosystems is needed (such as smart green infrastructure in tiger conservation landscapes). Identification of land for development should take the land's ecosystem service value into consideration. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

The BOI has launched a forestry cultivation program in Export Processing Zones (EPZ) to control the adverse impact of industrialisation and promote sustainable development.</p><p>Today, there are innovative and exciting projects organised around the idea of planting large numbers of trees. These are understood as efforts to improve the quality of life, produce more wildlife habitat and increase ecological resilience and construct green infrastructure, and are undertaken by various stakeholders.</p><p>BOI sources said EPZs have a daily influx of thousands of workers and added that a planned landscape will provide a relaxing effect on the workers. Director Media and Publicity, BOI, Dilip Samarasinghe said the BOI is committed to create environment-friendly zones throughout the country. A massive and comprehensive tree planting exercise is to take place and will be the first step in that direction.</p><p>\"Our organisation's longstanding goal is to develop the country but not at the expense of the environment. We are also aware that today's consumers want to know the conditions under which the goods they purchase are produced overseas. A clean environment will be an important selling point in tomorrow's globalised economy,\" he said.</p><p>Urban forestry will be introduced in the EPZs as multiple use landscapes to enhance the visual character, create recreational areas, provide shade, reduce the energy budget of urban buildings such as cost of air-conditioning, reduction of dust, air pollution and noise level.</p><p>The land used to set up EPZs were mostly scrub-land, secondary forest, plantations with vegetation which shows a considerable extent of vegetation cover has been removed for EPZs.</p><p>Rapid industrialisation has increased emission of greenhouse gases through transportation, land clearing, and manufacturing resulting in expansion of the carbon footprint in the country, sources said.</p><p>Today there are a number of innovative and exciting projects organised around the idea of planting trees to improve quality of life, produce more wildlife habitat and increase ecological resilience, and construct green infrastructure and are undertaken by stakeholders of business establishments.</p><p>\"Many common areas of the EPZ apart from those to be leased out to investors will be used for planting. Road reservations, footpaths, reservations around water bodies such as lakes, streams and maturation ponds, parking areas, bus terminals, land around common facilities such as administration buildings, health centres, land areas around water and sewage treatment plants, buffer zones and playgrounds will be used for planting which will provide favourable working and living conditions for factory employees and the environment in the region,\" sources said.</p><p>He said the potential for urban forestry within the zones may vary and as a result constraints have to be taken into account when planning.</p><p>Providing land and facilities for investment in commercial forestry will help minimise damage to forest reserves without affecting the demand for timber and related products. Private sector support will be obtained for planting, harvesting, processing and sale of wood products.</p><p>\"The Board will explore the possibility of launching 'social forestry' to conserve the forest cover in areas adjacent to EPZs in rural areas with the support of the local community and investors. Trees could be planted in the premises of government, semi-government, private and non-governmental organisations, community lands, cremation grounds, banks of river, lakes and ponds, private and degraded farmlands and roadsides, grasslands to improve tree cover and energy plantation,\" he said.</p><p>Planting stock will be obtained from the Forest Department, Govijana Seva Centres and private growers.

A successful agreement should curb, over the long-term, average global surface warming at a maximum of 2 \u00c2\u00b0C, compared to the pre-industrial level. Along this ultimate objective, the financing of greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation to climate change, the so-called green finance, will be part of the discussions. df</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At first sight, a green finance could be interpreted as contradictory, as for many finance goes hand in hand with excessive greed, economies in dire straits and little interest in environmental considerations. Yet this growing brand of finance basically encompasses all financial instruments fostering the transition towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we will see, every finance stakeholder, from governments to private investors, has actually a high potential of transformative impact to take-up the challenge of fighting global climate change.</p><p>A world economy starving for green infrastructure</p><p>Putting aside the recent slowdown of economic growth in China and the expected US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike, the world economy stands at a critical juncture.</p><p>First, the world is starving for investments in infrastructure. Obsolete infrastructure in developed countries and lack of suitable ones in developing countries, enabling them to accommodate structural changes, are reckoned to be costly in terms of growth. Those investments play indeed a key role in increasing the potential economic growth by spurring productivity gains among other things. They include energy production and distribution, water-supply, transport, airports and every tangible assets easing the access to markets for consumers and producers.</p><p>Meanwhile, as pointed out by the Fifth Assessment Report1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history with widespread impacts on human and natural systems. Importantly, the IPCC warns that a rise of average global surface temperature superior to 2\u00c2\u00b0C will be detrimental to any hopes of a fairer global economic development due to the harsher effects of climate change on developing countries.</p><p>According to IPCC, reaching carbon neutrality by 2100 is a sine qua non condition to stabilise the global warming at the 2\u00c2\u00b0C trigger. We must emphasise that this neutrality does not imply zero carbon emissions rather making the natural absorption of all the carbon released because of human activities possible. Before the industrial revolution, natural carbon sinks, such as oceans, forests, soils and vegetation, have actually contributed to a next to carbon neutral world. As a consequence, every member of the international community should now factor in carbon-neutrality, adaptation and resilience in its decisions of new investment into infrastructure.</p><p>Public finance has definitely to pave the road</p><p>As evidenced by many surveys conducted by IMF or top consultancies, the world needs to mobilise billions of dollars every single year to fund the urgently needed green infrastructure. Unquestionably, part of these funds have to come from the public sector as it has to chart the way ahead. This is why, along the negotiations on the legally binding agreement, the countries' official delegates are expected to find a way to jointly commit $ 100 billion dollars a year by 2020 to combat climate change.</p><p>The Green Climate Fund (GCF), established in 2009 in Copenhagen along the COP15, is to be the main channel for a public green finance. This fund has been designed to promote a paradigm shift in the global economic development by financially supporting countries in their efforts to mitigate greenhouse emissions and their need for adaptation to climate change.</p><p>The contributions consist of grants, capital and loans sourced from developed and developing countries. Provided with these funds, the GCF will target game-changer investments that have a huge impact on greenhouse emissions reduction and are likely to catalyse further investments by reducing entry costs and creating new investment opportunities.</p><p>In this regard, the GCF will provide mainly developing countries with financing in the form of grants and subsidised lending. The access to funds will be available for international and national entities accredited by the GCF's Board.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, the Sri-Lankan Carbon Fund is likely to be the recipient of these funds. Besides the investment dimension, the fund will financially accompany willing countries in the design of their national policies and sectorial strategies intended to cope with the climate issue.</p><p>BUP_DFT_DFT-15-7</p><p>Public money could be too short</p><p>So far, both developed and developing countries had only pledged funds amounting to $ 10 b. This is obviously nowhere near to the ambitious target of $ 100 b a year. In fact, too many governments across the world are cash-strapped because of large fiscal deficit and huge piles of debt to be paid off. The latter reaches on average 100 % of GDP in the OECD, a group of mostly rich countries.</p><p>Public finances in tatters could impair the ability of states to easily honour such a promise. Though, a gradual end to the inefficient and socially costly fossil energy subventions in too many countries would clearly give leeway to switch money into green infrastructures.</p><p>In a recent compelling study2, IMF researchers found out that these subventions cost $ 5, 300 b worldwide and a significant sum of $ 2.6 b in Sri Lanka, almost half of the current public investment in the country. But even if public money has a leading role to finance the transition towards a carbon neutral economy it cannot be the only answer.</p><p>No more banking as usual6</p><p>In a world of still prominent banking intermediation, banks should adapt their business model to the climate change by reorienting their funding towards low-carbon projects or stopping the financing of polluting projects.</p><p>Lately, Credit-Agricole, a global French bank, committed to curb financing new coal thermal powers in the high income countries. Some other big US and UK global banks are already under scrutiny by environmentally minded shareholders who want to see them disclosing more about their lending to firms that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, at least four of these leading banks have seen their shareholders filing nonbinding resolution to commit them to such disclosures.</p><p>Moreover, they are also pushing the banks to take measures aiming at addressing climate change. Though, banks could have reduced margin of actions to finance the economic transition as they have to maintain high regulatory capital ratio under Basel III regulationwork for carbon emissions trading should definitely be contingent on any legally binding agreement signed in Paris to make the world a better place to live in.</p><p>(The writer is the Deputy Economic Counsellor at the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

Authorities in Colombo should monitor and track progress in conserving and sustainable use of the green infrastructure and will have to justify retention of the accreditation for the next six years - the Independent Advisory Committee will review the status of the accredited Wetland City in every six years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Asian Wetland Directory describes that the country has 41 wetland sites of international importance covering an area of 274,000 ha of which the Colombo Wetland Complex covers 1,900 ha - which is almost eight percent of the city's total area.</p><p>Wetlands are the habitats with permanent or temporary accumulation of water with associated floral and faunal communities. The Ramsar convention explains the term as \"areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres.\"</p><p>Wetlands of Sri Lanka can be divided into three broad categories as inland natural fresh water wetlands (rivers, stream, marshes, swamp forests and villus), marine and salt-water wetlands (lagoons, estuaries, mangroves, sea grass beds and coral reefs) and man-made wetlands (tanks, reservoirs, rice fields and salterns).</p><p>Rich bio-diversity</p><p>Wetlands comprise a combination of water, soils, flora and fauna. The interaction of the elements helps the green infrastructure to perform several functions that are beneficial to humankind and the environment. The combination of these functions, together with the rich bio-diversity and cultural heritage of wetlands makes these ecosystems invaluable to people all over the world.</p><p>The services, that a wetland provides, can be classified into four groups: provisioning services, regulating services, cultural services and supporting services.</p><p>Wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that change over time as a consequence of natural phenomena, such as soil erosion, sedimentation and flooding. However, human activities, both within the wetland or in the catchment area can influence these natural processes and accelerate the rate of change, threatening the wetland's sustainability.</p><p>Professor of Ornithology S.W. Kotagama summarised the threats to wetlands in Sri Lanka under four major categories; habitat deterioration and degradation, direct loss and exploitation of species, spread of invasive alien species and natural phenomena.</p><p>Farming in river basins and upstream combined with heavy usage of agrochemicals are major threats to fresh water and man-made wetlands. Seeped and percolated chemicals are often responsible for the degradation of water quality in the downstream and deterioration of wetland habitats.</p><p>Soil erosion due to unprotected upstream agricultural practices aggravates sedimentation which is seen as a potential threat that will increase with the intensi?cation of agriculture.</p><p>Coastal erosion on the other hand is another problem, which is brought about by altered currents and sediment loads, and can also be caused by coastal land uses, such as unauthorised constructions. Reclamation for urban development, solid waste and garbage disposal and sand mining contribute to alter the structure of the wetland.</p><p>Wetland habitat can deteriorate due to clearing vegetation, especially, in the coastal belt and unauthorised and untreated sewage dumping in urban wetlands. Unplanned irrigation structures, regulation of water flow through large water infrastructure i.e. dams and mini-hydro power projects result in degradation of the quality of wetlands.</p><p>Wetland dependent communities rely on them for their income generation and living. Overexploitation of associated fauna and ?ora by these communities result in risking the extinction of endangered species. The most visible example is ?sheries, and water birds that are being poached for consumption, while less visible, but important changes may also take place in the micro faunal communities that support the ecology of the system and the food chain. Tourism and freshwater recreation and trade of ornamental plants and species pollute the ecosystem, which leads to the loss of native species in the wetlands.</p><p>Introduced exotic aquatic animal and plant species can eventually escape into wild habitats, and can create serious threats to native aquatic biodiversity. The ornamental fish trade mostly established around water bodies has become the sole contributor to introducing invasive alien aquatic species in Sri Lanka. The most prominent examples that can be seen in local wetlands are these four species of fauna (Tilapia - Oreochromis mossambicus, Walking catfish - Clarias batrachus, Rainbow Trout - Oncorhynchus mykiss and Mosquito fish - Gambusia affinis) and two species of flora (Water Hyacinth - Eichhornia crassipes and Giant Mimosa - Mimosa pigra) that are also included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive alien species.</p><p>The spreading of alien invasive species can lead to the exploitation of native species as it creates a competition for limited resources. Agricultural pests and weeds can also be threatened by this while deteriorating the quality of the wetlands.</p><p>Colombo University Zoology and Environment Sciences Department Head Prof. Deepthi Wickramasinghe said, \"Despite all the services, wetlands worldwide are threatened by human activities, and Sri Lanka is no exception. Reclamation and clearing for urban expansion, unsustainable solid waste disposal from domestic and industrial sources and the release of industrial, domestic and commercial waste have deteriorated the health of the wetland ecosystem. Increase in floods and declining aquatic biodiversity are, in part, the results of wetlands degradation and destruction. The conservation of our natural heritage is the duty of any responsible citizen.\"</p><p>Wetlands are also threatened by natural phenomena common in Sri Lanka. For instance, the prolonged dry conditions in the dry zone results drying off of tanks, streams, salt marshes and lagoons, causing death to species of flora and fauna. The rise of sea water temperature due to climate change bleaches the coral reefs, especially, in the southwestern part of Sri Lanka.</p><p>Prohibitory order</p><p>The vigilance for wetland conservation reached high in Sri Lanka with high intensity and frequent flash floods in the past few years. The Cabinet on August 21, 2018 on a proposal by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister, decided to; to impose a prohibitory order preventing all types of land reclamation and constructions in the Colombo Metropolitan Region for any other purpose other than the constructions necessary to be done which are of national importance and the constructions identified under the Transit Railway Line Network, and to direct the Director General of Wildlife to declare the wetlands, other than the areas recognised adjacent to Kimbulaela and Diyawanna oya in which the development activities have been initiated, as protected areas.</p><p>Sri Lanka rati?ed the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1990 and established a National Wetland Steering Committee (NWSC) while the Committee was reconstituted in 2003 to integrate plans for wetland areas and to coordinate development and conservation activities.</p><p>This resulted in the formal adoption of a National Wetland Policy under the auspices of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources in 2004.</p><p>Giant step</p><p>Since 1897 with the broadcasting of \"protect the coastal belt systems\", Sri Lanka has taken steps towards conserving its wetlands. The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance of 1937 can be considered as another giant step. Using this legislation, wetlands of importance to birds have been declared as sanctuaries and other protected areas by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. The setting up of a Wetland Steering Committee, hosting international workshops on wetlands and declaring six Ramsar wetland sites (Bundala, Anaiwilundawa, Maduganga, Venkali Santuary, Kumana Wetland Cluster and Wilpattu Wetland showed the country's willingness to protect these valuable water bodies.</p><p>The Government, non-government organisations, research organisations, academia and the cooperate sector are involved in wetland conservation and management related activities in the country.</p><p>Wetland management</p><p>Every one has a role to play in sustainable wetlands management - to ensure the wetland dependent communities continue to obtain the benefits that wetlands provide for reducing poverty and to ensure balanced ecosystems.</p><p>Wetland policies need to better reflect the realities of wetland agriculture - the dilemma remains how to maximise the benefits of agriculture while simultaneously minimising the adverse impacts on other valuable ecosystem services. Research is required to better understand trade-offs and determine best management practices.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Found on every continent, rivers supply food, water and are home to wildlife.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rivers are also the foundation of civilisations. Major cities such as Kuala Lumpur, New York City, London, Calcutta and Shanghai were founded around rivers, which provided routes for transportation, trade and exploration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unfortunately, rivers have also borne the brunt of development. Growing populations, pressures of land management and poor waste management have reduced them to waste dumping grounds. Having lost their usefulness, polluted rivers end up being covered up or hidden away from society.</p><p>Rediscovering the Bandar</p><p>Sunway canal</p><p>Not many are aware that Bandar Sunway has its very own canal, which is often mistaken for a monsoon drain. Canals are artificial waterways or artificially improved rivers.</p><p>Originally a river flowing from Kelana Lake, the 6km-long canal measures 5m wide, and runs through Subang Jaya and Bandar Sunway before discharging into the Klang River.</p><p>'The original river cuts across three municipalities, with some sections owned by Bandar Sunway and some owned by its neighbour municipalities. You can see the natural riverbank with vegetation upstream. Moving downstream from Federal Highway past Sunway-Monash Residence, the 5 metre-wide canal then reverts to the original river past the residence,' said Professor Khu Soon-Thiam, Head of Civil Engineering at Monash UniversityMalaysia's School of Engineering.</p><p>Interestingly, the river has changed its course over the past few decades. 'Based on old maps, we found that the river follows a different path today. Back then, there was no golf course. Rivers can move either in their natural environment or due to human intervention such as the construction of the Federal Highway,' he explained.</p><p>In January 2018, Khu and his team at MonashMalaysia started the Bandar Sunway 'River of Sustainability' project to rehabilitate the Bandar Sunway canal. They hope to improve citizens' quality of life and increase the economic value of the properties surrounding it.</p><p>'People appreciate the natural environment. Whenever they have free time, they will hike or go for nature walks. It's sad that we have a water body here that people are unaware of, and also unable to make full use of due to its current state,' said Khu, who describes the river as polluted and unsafe for recreational use.</p><p>Innovative ways to</p><p>rehabilitate the river</p><p>Unique to the 'River of Sustainability' project is its multi-disciplinary approach, combining the expertise of Monash University's different disciplines - civil and chemical engineering, biochemistry, biology,business and social science - to achieve the project's objectives.</p><p>'Unlike the 'River of Life' project in Kuala Lumpur, the 'River of Sustainability' project goes beyond beautification and economic objectives. We are also looking at it from a sustainability perspective, communicating with stakeholders from the beginning and throughout the project, and quantifying the health impact of the river on people,' he said.</p><p>Using innovative molecular bioscience-based tools such as the 'DNA recovery technique', the research team was able to track bacterial and viral contamination found in the water and pinpoint the source of pollution.</p><p>The team will then employ nature-based solutions such as a stepped cascade and bio-filtration system to enhance the water quality of the canal and prevent pollution. Nature-based solutions are green infrastructure that can substitute or work together with man-made infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>'Currently, we're approaching Sunway Group to ascertain the costs of the structural measures, after which we will talk to the Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ) for further discussion. We are also looking at non-structural measures such as developing policies and educational materials,' he said.</p><p>Hope for future restoration efforts</p><p>It is Khu's hope that restoring the Bandar Sunway canal will inspire others to care for their local rivers.</p><p>'We want to demonstrate that it is possible to turn a canal or river that has degraded and rehabilitate it. We hope that as more people are made aware of our efforts, they will begin to ask about the rivers in their backyards and replicate the restoration efforts,' he said.</p><p>Currently, Khu is also involved in the Sunway South Quay Lake Water Quality Improvement project, with a RM100,000 grant from Sunway Properties and Facilities Management. He has also been awarded a pound 103,000 (RM482,371) grant from the European Union Horizon 2020, which is the EU's Research and Innovation Programme.</p><p>'We are looking at the same idea [rehabilitating rivers] but to be implemented in Iskandar Johor. We are working together with Monash University's Clayton campus in Australia to see what we can learn from Europe, Australia and Malaysia, and integrating that knowledge for implementation,' he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1808201900645</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVH-RFW1-F00C-6125-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 18, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjY5QTJBMDg0MzE0NDFGMUI2MUMyMjU1NjlBMUQ1QzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRBRTk5NEIyQzA2NEI4MTk0NDI2RTFEMjdCMTg0RTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N541330GM</classCode><className>CIVIL ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000123</classCode><className>POPULATION GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001816</classCode><className>WATER POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

With the introduction of Smart FD, customers are able to open, withdraw or cancel Fixed Deposits more conveniently without having to visit the branch. Customers who are above the age of 18 can open Smart FDs individually or jointly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once the customer fills in the details and select the tenor as mentioned in the application, he/she can submit the application to any branch he/she wishes. Since Smart FD does not compromise of a physical certificate, customers will receive the e-mail confirmation to the provided email address and SMS to the given telephone number.Further, the depositors do not need to worry about protecting the certificate or producing the certificate to bank at maturity. Opening and closing of Smart FDs can be done simply by giving instructions to any BOC branch.</p><p>In line with the BOC's process of automation and digitalisation of business processes, in order to provide more convenience to its customers, recently the bank has added Personal Loans and Home Loans apply online facility to its website. The bank expects to add Accounts Opening and complaints handling also to its website soon.</p><p>Further the bank has expanded the digital presence by opening 178 SmartZones, 763 ATMs and 161 CDMs.The bank expects to introduce a new Internet Banking platform and a mobile banking solution within the year. Recently the bank launched its e-passbook 'Smart Passbook,' which is available on Google Play store for free download. Also the Bank is in the process of expanding its mobile branch network 'Branch on Wheels' to all provinces, providing digital banking experience to entire country.</p><p>As part of Green Banking initiatives, the bank is also carrying out a raffle draw to encourage all customers to enroll for e-statement. This draw is opened to all NRFC and Current account holders till 28 February. It will be conducted to select eligible winners in the month of March to select winners for a 48' curved Smart LED TV as the first prize, an iPad (pro 12.9 128G8) as the second prize, an Apple iPhone 7 as the third prize and 50 smart phones as consolation prizes. The prime objective of these initiatives is to encourage customers to save the environment by saving trees and reducing carbon footprint, the Bank of Ceylon has embarked on comprehensive green banking initiatives led by digital infused transformation process.</p><p>'The bank's approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind BOC brand's 78-year-long success. Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylon's motive was the same as promoting social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services,' stated Chairman President's Counsel Ronald C. Perera.</p><p>Bank of Ceylon General Manager D.M.

Its core idea is to engage in any form of banking which the community gets environmentally benefitted through its practices. The importance of the banking industry being involved in green initiatives comes through its importance in playing the role in economic development through financial intermediation.</p><p>The banking sector acts as a major partner in financial inclusion therefore vested on its economic power it can promote environmentally sustainable and socially responsible investments and projects.</p><p>\"For the Bank of Ceylon Success is always to gain sustainable growth together with the wellbeing of the community, therefore the idea is embedded as an integral part in the Bank's core mission. Understanding the economic, social and environmental needs the Bank evolved its approach overtime towards this mission without compromising the environment at any cost. The Digital Transformation was one big advancement we made towards this goal to make a better environment through digitization.\"the Bank's Chairman Ronald C. Perera said.</p><p>\"Through this transformation process BOC has been able to alter its systems, processors, communication channels and manage all its resources not only to yield best economic advantages for the Bank and its customers but also to engage in environment related best practices comprehensively.\" Perera said.</p><p>With the best practices that came along with the digital transformation the Bank was able to move into a green process where day-to-day bank operations specially paper work was replaced by technology and made to be seamless and thus minimized waste including and carbon emission. Smart Products such as \"SmartGen\" were introduced replace conventional savings accounts that use passbooks where there were a lot of paper usage. SmartZones were introduced for paperless transactions 24 x 7. These products and services have changed the Bank's customer interface completely providing utmost convenience. Internally the bank has adapted a comprehensive Document Management System (DMS) and E-learning facility for employee training.</p><p>\"We at Bank of Ceylon had many on-going environmentaly friendly programs that have been there for several years. The Bank has moved into a comprehensive Green Banking approach that is heavily aided by the digital transformation. With that we have introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that includes IT and physical infrastructure,\" General Manager D.M. Gunasekera said.</p><p>Encouraging the business community to adapt environmental best practices is an important initiative that a Banking institution can do. \"The Bank of Ceylon takes a special care in projects and business lending to make sure that those financed projects are environmental friendly. It even encourages customers, especially in the SME and Corporate segments to execute projects that use renewable energy and installation of renewable energy, waste management, recycling/ up-cycling projects and energy saving projects. Partnering to build the NSBM Campuses' new premises is a very recent such project the Bank of Ceylon worked with keen interest which was not only a green project but also addresses one major area of Bank's social sustainability which is education.\" Gunasekara added.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Climate change has become a burning issue and it is now dominantly measured with the formulation and implementation of the SDGs. Moreover, DFIs are called to be in the forefront of advancing climaterelated financing instruments and services in different countries and in developing and undertaking innovative solutions in this regard.</p><p>ADFIAP has continued to play an important role in climate finance as member DFIs have provided both financial and technical assistance to climate changerelated projects such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, clean technologies, green infrastructure and sustainable agriculture among others.</p><p>Speaking on DFCC's own contribution towards mitigating climate change as a member DFI, Arjun Fernando said, DFCC with over 60 years of experience has played a pioneering role in mitigating climate change through green financing. DFCC Bank was the first to finance Sri Lanka's first private sector gridconnected minihydro power project in 1994, the first private sector gridconnected wind power project in 2010 and the first private sector gridconnected solar power project in 2014 amongst others.</p><p>With Sri Lanka also pledging its support towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 and the setting up of a Sustainable Development Secretariat, our resolve is further strengthened.

Today, on world water day we shall remind ourselves of the importance of saving water as exemplified by the recent events in Cape Town.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Water is an essential building block of life. It is more than just essential to quench thirst or protect health; water is vital for creating jobs and supporting economic, social, and human development.</p><p>Today, there are over 663 million people living without a safe water supply close to home, spending countless hours queuing or trekking to distant sources, and coping with the health impacts of using contaminated water.</p><p>Sri Lanka so far has escaped a water shortage but we should take steps from now itself to preserve our freshwater.</p><p>This year's theme on World Water Day 'Nature for Water' explores how we can use nature to overcome the water challenges of the 21st century.</p><p>Environmental damage, together with climate change, is driving the water-related crises we see around the world. Floods, drought and water pollution are all made worse by degraded vegetation, soil, rivers and lakes.</p><p>When we neglect our ecosystems, we make it harder to provide everyone with the water we need to survive and thrive.</p><p>Nature-based solutions have the potential to solve many of our water challenges. We need to do so much more with 'green' infrastructure and harmonize it with 'grey' infrastructure wherever possible. Planting new forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, and restoring wetlands will rebalance the water cycle and improve human health and livelihoods.</p><p>Sustainable Development Goal 6 - ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030 - includes a target to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater and increase water recycling.</p><p>We would be hard-pressed to go without water for just a few hours, let alone one whole day. Depriving ourselves of water even for a short period of time would demonstrate how much we take our water for granted.</p><p>This year the United Nations will launch the new International Decade for Action on Water (2018-2028)</p><p>we would be hard-pressed to go without water for just a few hours, let alone one whole day. Depriving ourselves of water even for a short period of time would demonstrate how much we take our water</p><p>The emphasis Now is on the need for innovation and investment in the water sector, water science, water technology and water infrastructure - the hard services required to meet our water challenges and cope with crises like drought, flooding and pollution.</p><p>These are important investments that will yield a significant return on investment in coming decades. However, what the OECD and UN have been increasingly emphasizing is the need for dialogue and action on water governance - to focus on changing water behaviours and decisions.</p><p>Indeed, even countries with an abundance of freshwater like Brazil and Canada will face significant water challenges in the coming decades. As drought, flooding and pollution across the globe has shown water governance challenges are increasing in contexts of both abundance and scarcity.</p><p>In addition to improving our water policies and adapting our water governance institutions, We need to place more emphasis on having future water thinkers, leaders and practitioners.</p><p>Investments in hard services and water infrastructure are very important. However, to be creative and innovative with these investments we need new approaches. New approaches come from investing in people focused on the social, economic and political challenges we increasingly face in governing our waters.The emphasis at these forum is on the need for innovation and investment in the water sector, water science, water technology and water infrastructure - the hard services required to meet our water challenges and cope with crises like drought, flooding and pollution.</p><p>These are important investments that will yield a significant return on investment in coming decades.</p><p>Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families across the world. Drought afflicts some of the world's poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition.\" We have to address all these issues without delay.</p><p>Water may appear to be an infinite resource but it is not. The ocean may cover 75 percent of the planet but fresh water covers only a fraction of that. Every drop counts in the bid to save water. And we have to start now if we are to avert a major water crisis.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

It has affiliated hubs in other countries, connecting with London and each other to share trade and investment opportunities in the environmental goods and services sector for the benefit of the Commonwealth and of course our planet. Thus far there exists established hubs in Canada, London, Wales, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa (in both Cape Town and Durban), the Seychelles.</p><p>The Sri Lanka hub will also cover the Maldives, and is operated by Motha Capital Investments [MCI], part of the GE Group. The MCI team leading this hub are Roshan Motha head of Motha Capital Investments (Private) Limited, Rohantha Athukoral, Head of National Portfolio Development of the United Nations office for Project Services (UNOPs), and Tanya Goonewardene, Attor ney-at-law. The focus of the hub is to link businesses, investors, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders not only in their national markets but also across Commonwealth member nations, and indeed other countries who wish to engage with the Commonwealth for trade and investment. The Hub exists to identify common interest and encouraging transfer of sustainable technologies within the Commonwealth, helping to address climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially in vulnerable countries, and promoting trade and investment in environmental businesses.</p><p>As an inaugural project, Motha Capital Investments (MCI) is presenting to the Platform, an initiative by the Carbon Consultancy Company (Private) Limited which is a project that has the required expertise to carry out a reforestation project that will establish a biodiversity corridor between the two large remnant rainforest patches in Sri Lanka following principles of analog forestry concepts.</p><p>Yet another reputed company which has been selected to be introduced on to the Platform is the renowned EnergySolve International (Private) Limited, which promotes the principles of sustainable development in areas including, but not limited to Green infrastructure development and LEED certification, energy saving and efficiency improvements, water saving and efficiency improvements, saving, monitoring and verification, renewable energy development, building energy simulations, artificial and daylighting simulations and energy auditing.</p><p>Investors looking to derive return on investment through green initiatives can become members by registering with MCI, which will then make them privy to proposals of green initiatives across the platform. Similarly, enterprises that are looking for funding for a green initiative can meet with us and have their initiatives screened and upon initial assessment submit a proposal setting out the credentials of the transaction which will then be shared among the rest of the Commonwealth Hubs.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The analogy is instructive because, like Modi, Gotabaya packages development as a nationalist project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Modi, for example, recently revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy. He claims that he wants to develop the region. Legal dispossession, however, has justified an ongoing crackdown. Similarly, during Mahinda Rajapaksa's tenure as President, developing the north was his response to those critical of militarisation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike 2009, however, in 2019 the liberal international order is under attack. Now more than ever, we can't look for saviours from outside. What is the context of the rise of right-wing populism around the region and the world?</p><p>Systemic breakdown</p><p>The shift is most visible in US President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Trump has an intuitive sense that hegemons do not rule forever in the capitalist system. The US's transition from a multilateral system in which it exercised its power through control of global institutions, to a go-it-alone attitude that involves negotiating bilateral agreements, is an expression of systemic breakdown.</p><p>The US binged on debt and bought its wares from China, powering the workshop of the world. When it ran into trouble during the Great Recession, as historian Adam Tooze points out, the global economy depended on Chinese stimulus. The relationship between the power blocs, however, is under pressure.</p><p>Deglobalisation reconfigures supply chains. New trends in automation and technology make reshoring a possibility. The world races to find alternative energy sources in the face of climate crisis. In the meantime, new conflicts engendered by climate change compound the centuries-long process of underdevelopment that imperialism has imposed on poor countries. This results in many people migrating to rich countries, seeking a better life.</p><p>Social bases of proto-fascist ideology</p><p>The xenophobic response in Western countries, rooted in settler colonial ideology, is reinforced by the post-9/11 framing of terrorism as a 'Muslim problem'. Strengthening Fortress Europe and the chant to 'build the wall' are ways in which right-wing demagogues capitalise on people's frustration with a system that has not benefited the many. Wages have stagnated over decades while the rich got richer.</p><p>Moreover, the establishment is viewed as a bulwark of liberal multiculturalism. The new right-wing populists attack the public sector in favour of a vindictive capitalism that protects the investments of the few who have made it. They try to convince working class whites especially that they must exclude others to defend what they are in the process of losing. The social base of white supremacy, however, is staunchly (upper) middle class.</p><p>Gotabaya doesn't have a solution to the structural problem of Sri Lanka's dependency. Instead, he proposes regime stability for investors. He and his supporters attack the current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for signing the country away. They are as desperate, however, to attract foreign capital. The 'urban professional classes, retired military actors, and nationalist bureaucratic elements,' as Ahilan Kadirgamar put it in his column in the Daily Mirror, identify with the mercantilist, competitive ideology of the proto-fascist base in the Western countries. That means advertising Sri Lanka as a paradise secured by a strongman</p><p>In contrast, Gotabaya appeals to an aspiring class that has not yet achieved all that it believes it can. Drawing the bridges up won't work for Sri Lanka. Still, he proposes a similar, muscular nationalism to compete on the global stage. This aggressive masculine bravado ignores Sri Lanka's dependence in a system that has kicked away the ladder for poor countries, to use economist Ha-Joon Chang's phrase. Powerful global institutions condemn state intervention, including industrial policy, as unfair competitive practice. Free trade agreements impose punishing rules to access markets. Such trade agreements are the outer ditches of industrial fortresses.</p><p>Gotabaya doesn't have a solution to the structural problem of Sri Lanka's dependency. Instead, he proposes regime stability for investors. He and his supporters attack the current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for signing the country away. They are as desperate, however, to attract foreign capital.

That means advertising Sri Lanka as a paradise secured by a strongman.</p><p>Confronting reaction</p><p>What is the alternative? It's clear from the Labour Party's responses in the UK and Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign in the US that there are other ways of framing the masses' problems: from austerity linked to deep cuts to social welfare, to runaway inequality embodied by the super-rich. These political groups and campaigns have drawn attention to new proposals such as the Green Industrial Revolution and the Green New Deal, which would fund massive investment in public infrastructure. In addition, they propose taxing the richest one percent to fund universal services, such as health care and education.</p><p>The problem in Sri Lanka is that progressives often lack the same vision. Liberal civil society appeals to an international order that is quickly disappearing; one built in fact on brutal imperialist intervention masquerading as humanitarianism. For the parliamentary left, the aftermath of revolutionary defeat around the world has meant focusing on 'corruption,' attempting to win over politically ambivalent middle-class constituencies, and, in general, downplaying concerns about redistribution. Gotabaya, however, won't be defeated with paeans to civility or social initiatives that don't challenge market pressures on ordinary people's households.</p><p>Instead, he can be defeated only by a progressive movement that recognises the immediate dangers of a world undergoing profound transformation. This movement must speak to a wide constituency of people who have been dispossessed, exploited, ignored, and marginalised. Only then can we inspire voters to turn up at the polls. The current crop of right-wing demagogues realise that winning is as much about mobilising their own narrow section of the population as it is suppressing voters from other groups. To defeat the proto-fascism that feeds on disenchantment with nominally participatory institutions-and, consequently, to begin the long process of revitalising democratic engagement-we must think big. That means offering people a stake in a renewed left movement. We need massive public investment in green infrastructure and the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor by expanding universal services. Imagining this horizon of possibilities is critical. It keeps the immediate priority to vote for whichever mainstream candidate is most capable of defeating Gotabaya in perspective.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2208201900056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW5-MWW1-JCH9-G35F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1191\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 22, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQKS</classCode><className>FASCISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQQA</classCode><className>POLITICAL &amp;

Twenty-five percent of the country's population resides along the coastal belt and is dependent on the tourism industry, seaports, fisheries and agricultural sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tourism industry, which is the third largest contributor to per capita income, is centred chiefly in the coastal areas with 70% of its infrastructure based in the region. The threats posed by climate change thus puts the livelihood of the coastal communities, both urban and rural, at risk, inadvertently posing a threat to the country's economy. These industries located centrally in the coastal region account for nearly 43% of the country's GDP, making it a cogwheel that drives the national economy.</p><p>Sri Lanka experienced a deceleration in its real GDP growth in 2017, as the country's agricultural economy was struck by the then prevailing weather conditions. The Economist, in an article published in the same year, linked the country's economic downtrend partially to climate change, attributing it to floods, landslides and droughts the island struggled against. Sri Lanka's real GDP, which maintained an average 4.7% from 2014-2016, fell steeply to 3.9% during the first half of 2017 and closed at 3.1% towards the latter part of the year.</p><p>Although Sri Lanka accounts for less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, owing to its geo-climatological position, it is highly susceptible to climatic fluctuations. Thirty percent of Sri Lanka's population employed in the agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to the effects of the changing food prices and increasing food insecurity. A Ricardian evaluation of the Sri Lankan agricultural scenario by Yale University professors determined that the impact of temperature change and rainfall could vary between Rs. 11 billion and Rs. 39 billion, depending on the outcome of the weather.</p><p>The opportunity for climate investment</p><p>As the economy's most powerful and largest source of spending power, businesses have an opportunity to take the lead and invest in a climate-smart future, be it through the generation of renewable energy, green infrastructure or scaling up carbon capture and storage.</p><p>According to an article published by the We Mean Business Coalition, leading businesses that are taking climate action have benefitted from an average 27% internal rate of return on their low carbon investments.</p><p>The National Adaptation Plan recognises that collaborative efforts by key stakeholders, which include the government sector, corporate sector, academics, researchers, small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), civil society organisations along with local community-based approaches, can deliver the ultimate objective of enhancing the adaptive capacity of sections of society that are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.</p><p>'The private sector counts for approximately about 68% of investments made in the South Asian region. Up to 80% of the population in the region depend on the income generated by the private sector. It contributes substantially to climate finance flows both at the global and regional levels. Yet the contributions made to adaptation specific activities is a fraction and mostly confined to the insurance industry. There is an urgent need to enhance the role of private sector involvement through appropriate policy measures and targeted interventions,' says Dr. Nambi Appadurai, India Adaptation Strategy Head for the Climate Resilience Practice, World Resources Institute, India.</p><p>Private sector forum on climate adaptation</p><p>Recognising the critical need for private sector involvement in climate adaptation, Dilmah Conservation, in collaboration with Global Compact Network Sri Lanka and Biodiversity Sri Lanka, will initiate a national dialogue on the threats, responses and opportunities presented by the changing climate on 31 July at the BMICH. The forum will be the first in a series of events that will look towards options of adaptation of and opportunities for climate innovation for Sri Lanka which can be achieved through the active participation of corporate sectors, academia and other stakeholders.</p><p>Dr. Appadurai, who is currently exploring ways to integrate adaptation practices into development processes at the national and community levels, will deliver the keynote address. He will speak from his experience of working in climate risk management and adaptation in Asia and Africa on the options available for Sri Lanka. Taxonomist and former Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board, Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, and Climate Resilience expert Wasantha Dissanayake will share their insight on the implications of climate change and strategies on climate adaptation for Sri Lanka.</p><p>UNGC Chair Dilhan C. Fernando, explaining the purpose of the event, said: 'This initiative is intended to build a nationwide dialogue on what we should expect and prepare us for that reality, whilst also understanding that there is opportunity in this adversity, through the adoption of climate-smart agriculture and designing and promoting climate innovation. As businesses, we have a responsibility to understand this phenomenon and the responses and adaptation we can adopt to help mitigate the cataclysmic consequences of ignoring the reality.'</p><p>The inaugural climate reality event is organised with the involvement of the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Biodiversity Sri Lanka, CITRA Lab and the MJF Charitable Foundation. Following the keynote address, Biodiversity Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka's first social innovation lab CITRA Lab, which is jointly funded by the UNDP and the Ministry of Science and Technology, will facilitate a dialogue among corporate sector entities, both established and upcoming, to define the next steps and recommendations for business, individuals and government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2707201800027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWT-2011-F00C-6175-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 27, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

At this meeting, the well known Environmentalist, Dr. Sarath Kotagama pointed out that our wetlands were rapidly shrinking due to human activities. Prior to that observation, it was my perception that the main cause for shrinking of wetlands had been due to deliberate filling and reclamation activities carried out by people and institutions. However, Dr. Kotagama's observation at the meeting, convinced me to accept the fact that soil erosion contributes much towards the natural shrinking of our wetlands. Every time I visited cities and suburbs, I could see many wetlands - both natural wetlands and abandoned paddy fields, being used as waste dumping yards by individuals, institutions and some local authorities as well. Those who are with vested interests, deliberately dump garbage into wetlands and carryout earth filling on top.</p><p>They subsequently block out these filled land and put it up for sale. Some valuable buildings like Hilton Hotel, Nawam Mawatha Buildings, Maligawatta Housing Complex in Colombo have been built on (filled-up) wetlands. Even the Blomendhal garbage mountain once had been an abandoned paddy field and a marshy wetland. The dumping of Colombo Municipal Council garbage at Blomendhal commenced in 1991, and the motive behind that exercise would have been to make that wetland saleable at a latter date. So, filling wetlands with garbage and its subsequent selling have been a lucrative business in Colombo and suburbs.</p><p>Sometime back, when I made a field visit to Bellanwila - Attidiya sanctuary to ascertain the new eco system development on a waste dump, the land owners of the sanctuary made representations and requested that they be allowed to fill their respective blocks to make them saleable. This area recorded in epics, written during the Kotte period, was a vast paddy field prior to and in the 1970s. However, due to various reasons these fields were abandoned and as a result, invasive plants like 'Wel Aththa' had found their way in to them and it started spreading like a cancer. Unfortunately, these valuable water retention areas and the bird sanctuaries are now gradually vanishing.</p><p>The wetlands are kidneys of eco systems. Environmental services provided by the wetlands are very important for the eco systems to survive. When it rains, wetlands act as water retention and filtration areas, raising the water table facilitating the people to tap fresh water. Variety of flora and fauna thrive in wetlands and therefore, they play a very important role in preserving biodiversity.</p><p>They also maintain food chains and these vast areas with vegetation, naturally purify the air by absorbing carbon and releasing oxygen. On the other hand they act as essential eco corridors for unsustainable cities that are coming up rapidly. So it is very important to have wetlands as open spaces and eco corridors as sustainable for eco cities, which need to be built in the future. Unfortunately, as the services rendered by wetlands to maintain the equilibrium of the eco system has not been properly identified, their market values are comparatively low. In order to get its market value enhanced, its owners opt to fill it for monitory gains. It is profitable for various institutions including local authorities to purchase low priced wetlands, reclaim and construct buildings or other infrastructure facilities on them. Having set up the Low Lying Areas Reclamation Board - a new arm of the then government, the former President Premadasa pioneered the process of filling and selling lowlands.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was so vociferous and took much pride in announcing that he was converting abandoned marshy land to mini cities like Maligawatta Flats and Nawam Mawatha Buildings, without realizing the fact that his exercise would lead to adverse imminent environmental problems. However, within a short period of time, the repercussions of that ill-advised exercise was experienced by its proponents and many others when several areas of Colombo and suburbs got inundated by floods.</p><p>It is important to note that present day cities are totally unsustainable.</p><p>Without fossil fuels we are unable to maintain sky scrapers, flyovers and fuel guzzling transportation etc., It is reported that the first commercial oil well was found by one DRAKE in 1859 and it is predicted that the last drop of oil in the last well will be exhausted by 2059. We are presently experiencing the much awaited oil peak, and if we look far ahead for the sake of our grand children, we have to look for ways and means of introducing new energies to sustain built environments. On the other hand burning of some fossil fuels cause heat pollution. Green House Gases with carbon cause solar radiation accumulation and it results in the rising of global mean temperature. Global warming and climate change would seriously threaten the mere existence of humanity. So, the depletion of oil resources and its destructive pollution effects would force us to choose a new paradigm or trajectory for sustainable development.</p><p>In order to achieve sustainable development, a new concept called Green Economy has been introduced. Green Economy is based on renewable energies and the built environment should essentially be Eco friendly and self sustainable. Generally Sri Lanka's priority for development is to enhance its infrastructure facilities like road network, electricity and transportation etc. The IMF, the World Bank and the other lending and partners of development aid should focus on this as their top priority.</p><p>But as per green economic policies, a new concept called Green Infrastructure has emerged. Multi faceted global crisis promoted this green new big deal and development of green infrastructure. One of its main themes is conservation and the restoration of low lands and wetlands.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the market based value system has failed to add the desired values to the ecosystem services rendered by wetlands or other similar systems. Therefore, the government or the public sector should intervene and introduce new schemes to protect and enhance value of the eco system services. Generally there are four accepted strategies for protection and enhancement of eco services.</p><p>(i) Direct intervention by the government by way of direct funding on restoration projects.</p><p>(ii) Introducing a fee or a tax on people or institutions which cause damage to ecosystem services. This restoration levy will compensate the damage done.</p><p>(iii) By subsidizing the private parties for the steps they take to conserve and enhance the ecosystem services. For example the government can pay the land owners to improve their private property which act as water retention or watershed areas.</p><p>(iv) Creating new markets by way of introducing trading systems. This is a widely accepted mechanism which provide a price on Ecosystem services.</p><p>Governments do this by allocating trading permits or property rights in ecosystem services and then allow other parties to purchase these permits or rights.</p><p>To get the best out of this trading system which could be applied to enhance the value of wetlands, we have to study its practical implementation. In 1995 the city of Eugine in Oregon, USA, established the wetland trading permit system to protect cities of wetlands. They knew very well that their wetlands provided valuable ecosystem services such as water filteration, flood control and species habitat.</p><p>A new law was introduced so that any private developer who wanted to build on existing wetland, had to agree to mitigate the impact by creating or protecting other wetlands. That means a developer who wanted to build on a wetland had to meet that requirement either by creating new wetlands or purchasing a wetland trading permit process by someone else.</p><p>The city of Eugine also established a Wetland Mitigation Bank. This Bank had a dual purpose where those who owned wetlands could store or deposit their certified wetland credit in that Bank and those who wanted to mitigate the damage caused by their building on wetlands could purchase those credits. That could produce new value to the wetland owners. On the other hand new green businesses enhancing green infrastructure by way of creating new wetlands could promote entrepreneurs and also it would discourage developers to build on wetlands in order to keep their mitigation cost low.</p><p>These four strategies should be introduced to protect wetlands in Sri Lanka as well. It is fortunate that The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation &amp; Development Corporation (LRDC) has now launched new projects with these objectives in mind. Presently our Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources is in collaboration with The LRDC to explore the feasibility of implementing these strategies in Kelaniya, Mudunella wetlands, while preserving the flood control and water filteration capability of new developed land for the waste management systems of the area.</p><p>The market values of Muthurajawela, Aththidiya and various other lowlands could also be enhanced if we apply these new strategies. The public should be made aware of these strategies before unnecessary politically motivated petty protest campaigns are staged jeopardizing these valuable projects and proposals even before they are put into operation.</p><p>The writer is the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Published by HT Syndication with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe graced the occasion as the Chief Guest for this very first launch of this event pioneered by Interbrand, the world's largest and most influential global brand consulting agency, in partnership with the Daily FT newspaper. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Currently Interbrand is a New York based global brand consulting agency with twenty one offices in 17 countries. It is highly recognised for its globally influential 'Breakthrough Brands' and 'Best Global Brands' reports and Webby Award-winning 'brand channel'. Sri Lanka being in the Interbrand catalogue of countries is important as a chance for local companies to be on the global stage. The Prime Minister stated that it is impressive to see state banks performing well among Sri Lankan brands. </p><p>Interbrand's Global Director Brand Valuation Mike Rocha, Strategy Director - Nation Branding Guido Van Garderen, Managing Director Interbrand India Ashish Mishra, Sri Lankan partner for Interbrand Michel Nugawela and several other officials from Interbrand were also present at this occasion. The Chairman, President's Counsel Ronald C. Perera and D.M. Gunasekera, General Manager of Bank of Ceylon received the award on behalf of the bank.</p><p>Interbrand has calculated the Bank of Ceylon's brand value as Rs. 31.12 billion based on well-stipulated criteria for brand valuation. The financial performance of the brand, its role in influencing the customer's choice and the strength of the brand to secure the company's financial position and many other key elements are taken into account when calculating the brand value. Many indigenous well established brands operating in the country have been taken into account. </p><p>The Bank of Ceylon's 'BOC' has been 'The No.1 Brand' in the country for the last nine years as determined by Brand Finance Lanka too. With the pledge to commit as 'Banker's to the Nation' since its inception the Bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require. The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn PBT of Rs. 25.3 billion for 2015 and PBT 31.2 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking. Two very significant achievements of BOC in the recent past were achieving over Rs. one trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. one trillion in loans and advances in 2016. The bank's asset value now exceeds over Rs. 1.8 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country. Having a very strong balance sheet and the trust and confidence that had been built among public for the last 78 years paved the way to achieve this award. Receiving an award in the year in which the award is inaugurated is in itself quite an achievement. </p><p>'The bank's approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind BOC brand's 78 year long success. Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylon's motive was the same as promoting social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services,' stated the Chairman, President's Counsel Ronald C. Perera.</p><p>BOC has earned the trust of Sri Lankans and proudly caters to over 12 million customers today.

In order to cater to this geographically diverse customer base, the bank has 630 branch network that is spread covering every nook and corner and owns the largest ATM/CDM network in Sri Lanka with over 900 machines serving customers 24 hours 365 days. BOC was the first Sri Lankan bank to have marked its presence overseas with the opening of 'BOC London' in 1949 at the epicentre of international banking at that time. Later BOC spread its foreign branch network to Chennai, Male and Seychelles. Apart from its own foreign branch network BOC maintains foreign correspondent banking network with over 860 foreign banks and exchange houses.</p><p>D.M. Gunasekera, the General Manager Bank of Ceylon stated that, 'BOC's digital transformation completely changed the bank's internal processes along with its customer interface and infused synergy to the whole Sri Lankan banking system. Along with the benefits of digital transformation BOC was able to embark on a sustainable growth together with the community.

With the pledge to commit as 'Bankers to the Nation' since its inception the bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require.</p><p>The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn PBT of Rs.25.3 billion for 2015 and PBT 31.2billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking. Two very significant achievements of BOC in recent history were the surpassing Rs. 1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016. The bank's asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.</p><p>'Maintaining our position as the No.1 brand in the country is an achievement like no other. Anyone would agree with me that being the No.1 brand in the country for the ninth consecutive year is an unmatchable achievement. We have done exceptionally well during past years and now we are the only bank that has three trillions in the balance sheet. Our next goal is to enhance the bank's asset base up to Rs. 2 trillion by 2019 - thiswill surely be another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry,' the bank's ChairmanPresident's Counsel Ronald C. Perera stated.</p><p>In its steadfast journey brand 'BOC' has been able to overcome significant macro and micro environmental changes in the banking and financial industry to establish itself as a superior brand in the country. With the time tested vision as 'Bankers to the Nation,' Brand BOC has delivered the best result for its true stakeholders, citizens and the Government of Sri Lanka.</p><p>BOC has earned the trust of Sri Lankans and proudly caters to over 12 million customers today. With its massive financial capacity and adaptable approach that comes with inherent commitment towards country's social and economic development BOC has enabled banking services successfully to a very diverse base customer base from individuals to businesses and organisations of different geographic and economic strata.</p><p>BOC offers the flexibility and convenience of a whole gamut of banking services under one roof for everyone from newborn to senior citizen and micro entrepreneur to corporate business.

Gunasekera.</p><p>'We have many on-going environmentally friendly programs that have been there for several years. However with the digital infused transformation the bank introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that include IT and physical infrastructure. In the bank's success story, the staff commitment, dedication and their achievements played a vital role and that has been recognised when Asia's Best Employer Brand - awardsorganised by Employer Brand Institute endorsed the BOC as one of those classed as a Best Employer Brand for the year 2016.

The number of people who may lack sufficient water, at least for one month per year, will soar from 3.6 billion today to more than 5 billion by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rising seas and greater storm surges could force hundreds of millions of people in coastal cities from their homes, with a total cost to coastal urban areas of more than US$ 1 trillion each year by 2050. Climate change could push more than 100 million people in developing countries below the poverty line by 2030.</p><p>But there is still time to protect and work with nature to build resilience and reduce climate risks at all scales, the report says encouragingly. It also strongly argues that investment in climate adaptation and resilience is cost effective and worthwhile in every possible way.</p><p>High Returns</p><p>As per the report, the overall rate of return on investments in improved resilience is high, with benefit-cost ratios ranging from 2:1 to 10:1, and in some cases even higher.</p><p>Specifically, the analysis finds that investing US$ 1.8 trillion globally in five areas from 2020 to 2030 could generate US$ 7.1 trillion in total net benefits.</p><p>The five areas the report considers needing investment are: early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dry land agriculture, mangrove protection, and investments in making water resources more resilient.</p><p>'Climate adaptation can also deliver a triple dividend. It avoids future losses, generates positive economic gains through innovation, and delivers additional social and environmental benefits,' the report says.</p><p>Social Stratification</p><p>The report says that the underlying inequalities in society must be taken note of and addressed in climate change adaptation programs. People most vulnerable to climate impacts must be involved in decision making, it urges.</p><p>Improved dry land crop production, mangrove protection, and water resources management have economic, social and environmental benefits. These benefits will be on-going and not static in time.</p><p>Accurate Assessment of Risk</p><p>The report says that risk assessment must be accurate so as to better spend resources and get the maximum benefit. There is a need to make risk visible, requiring more precise characterization of who and what is at risk-and why. As part of making risk visible, the public and private sectors can work together to more explicitly put a 'price' to risk in both economic and financial decision-making.</p><p>Equally important is to understand what works and what options to prioritize by supporting experiential learning, stimulating innovations in science and technology, sharing solutions, and piloting new business models and financial services.</p><p>Importantly, there should be no talking down to local people. ' It is important to consider all forms of knowledge, recognizing that valuable local knowledge rests with communities and indigenous populations,' the report said in a plea to be democratic and grassroots-oriented for attaining optimum results.</p><p>Paucity of Funds</p><p>Even though the imperative for action is clear, money is not flowing at the pace or scale needed, the report regrets. The government or the public sector is an essential provider of finance to protect people and livelihoods across communities and sectors. It is also an enabler of increased private sector finance through disclosure requirements and incentives, like buying down the risk of providing financial services to small-holder producers.</p><p>On its part, the private sector should increase investments on its own account, but it should also increasingly complement the public sector in sharing the costs and benefits of adaptation investments, such as for infrastructure, contingency finance, and insurance, the report suggests. Finally, there is a critical need for higher levels of international financial support for adaptation in developing countries.</p><p>Task Ahead</p><p>The tasks ahead are long and onerous given the dangers foreseen. The global demand for food will increase by 50% even as yields decline by up to 30% by 2050 in the absence of ambitious climate action. A more resilient food future will rely on sharp increases in agricultural R and D, which has demonstrated benefit-cost ratios between 2:1 and 17:1. There is a need for better alignment of government finance and incentives for farmers with long-term, sustainable, climate-smart production.</p><p>There needs to be a radical change in access to information, innovative technologies, and finance to enhance the resilience of 500 million small-scale farming households whose livelihoods are most critically impacted by climate change.</p><p>Nature-Based Solution</p><p>Nature-based solutions regulate water flows, protect shorelines, cool cities, and complement built infrastructure. Nature is rapidly being degraded. Large-scale protection and restoration of nature will require accelerating efforts to meet existing political commitments. These commitments are: implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity; appropriately valuing natural assets in land use and investment decisions; and increasing the scale of public and private resources to safeguard nature.</p><p>Many nature-based adaptation solutions are also beneficial for mitigation and can provide one-third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C.</p><p>Water</p><p>Climate change is integrally connected to water systems and resources. Successful adaptation will require scaled-up investments in healthy watersheds and water infrastructure, dramatic improvements in efficiency of water use. Without efficient water allocation and use, the GDPs of India, China and Central Asia would be lower by 7 to 12% by 2050.</p><p>Cities</p><p>Urban areas are home to more than half the global population and are centers of opportunity and innovation. Adaptation efforts, if designed well, can take advantage of this 'transformative energy' and generate high economic returns, the report suggests.</p><p>In coastal cities, for instance, the cost of good adaptation is one-tenth the cost of no action. To plan and deliver more resilient urban services, cities everywhere need to invest in better climate risk information and technical capacity, drawing on credible topographic and community-level data.</p><p>Cities should also invest in nature-based solutions to tackle water and heat risks, and in upgrading the living conditions of the 880 million people living in informal settlements that are highly vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>Ports, roads, power, sanitation, sewer, and communications systems are infrastructure assets at risk from climate change. 'Climate-proofing' existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure that is more climate resilient, make sound economic sense as on an average, the benefits outweigh costs by 4:1.</p><p>Investments in infrastructure need to directly build resilience, whether for storm-water drainage in cities or protecting coastal communities against sea-level rise. This will require developing blended public-private approaches that share the costs and benefits of investing in resilient infrastructure, the report says.</p><p>Need For Community Sense And Prior Warnings</p><p>Finally, the report urges people to go beyond protecting individual assets to ensuring that whole systems are more resilient by making the right choices about where and what to build, which existing assets to upgrade, prioritizing green infrastructure wherever possible, and ensuring that infrastructure continues to function even as damages occur.</p><p>'We need to proactively yet voluntarily move people and assets out of harm's way through better planning and investment decisions. At the same time, we need to scale up efforts to warn and prepare people ahead of disasters, actions that can dramatically reduce the loss of life, and exhibit very high returns on investment.'</p><p>Finally, social safety nets and improvements in forecast-based planning can help hasten recovery from disasters when they do strike, the report says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSIN-NEWSINASIA2409201900012</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X46-P281-F00C-63PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465533</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewsIn.Asia All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NewsIn.Asia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Sanitation &amp;

Perera said, \"Maintaining our position as the No.1 Brand in the country is an achievement like no other. Anyone would agree with me that being the No.1 Brand in the country for the ninth consecutive year is an unmatchable achievement. We have done exceptionally well during past years and now we are the only bank that has Rs. 3 trillion on the balance sheet. Our next goal is to enhance the bank's asset base up to Rs. 2 trillion by 2019 which will surely be another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry.\"</p><p>Empowering Sri Lankans to realize their life goals through affordable yet best-in-class banking solutions in its steadfast journey of over 77 years, BOC has always gone that extra mile to add value to the Sri Lankan banking industry. With the pledge to commit as 'Banker's to the Nation', since its inception the bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require.</p><p>The first and only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn a profit before tax of Rs. 25.3 billion for 2015 and profit before tax of Rs. 31.2 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking. Two very significant achievements of BOC in recent history were the surpassing of Rs. 1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016. The bank's asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.</p><p>Brand 'BOC' has been able to overcome significant macro and micro environmental changes in the banking and financial industry to establish itself as a superior brand in the country. With the time tested vision as 'Bankers to the Nation', Brand BOC has delivered the best result for its true stakeholder, citizens and the Government of Sri Lanka.</p><p>BOC has earned the trust of Sri Lankans and proudly caters to over 12 million customers today. With its massive financial capacity and adaptable approach that comes with inherent commitment towards the country's social and economic development, BOC has enabled banking services successfully to a very diverse customer base from individuals to businesses and organizations of different geographic and economic strata.</p><p>BOC offers the flexibility and convenience of a whole gamut of banking services under one roof for everyone from newborn to senior citizen and micro entrepreneur to corporate business. In order to cater to this geographically diverse customer base, the bank has 625 branches spread over every nook and corner and owns the largest ATM/ CDM network in Sri Lanka with over 825 machines serving customers 24 hours, 365 days.</p><p>BOC was the first Sri Lankan bank to have marked its presence overseas with the opening of \"BOC London\" in 1949 at the epicenter of international banking at that time. Later BOC spread its foreign branch network to Chennai, Male and Seychelles. Apart from its own foreign branch network BOC maintains foreign correspondent banking network with over 860 foreign banks and exchange houses. \"The Bank's approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind the BOC brand's 77 year long success.</p><p>Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylon's motive was the same - to promote the social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services. A very recent example was the BOC's digital transformation that completely changed the bank's internal processes along with its customer interface and infused synergy to the whole Sri Lankan banking system.</p><p>\"Along with the benefits of digital transformation BOC was able to embark on green banking comprehensively for a sustainable growth together with the community,\" said BOC General Manager D.M. Gunasekera. \"We have many on-going environmentally friendly programmes that have been there for several years. However with the digital infused transformation the bank introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that include IT and physical infrastructure.\"</p><p>In the bank's success story, the staff commitment, dedication and their achievements played a vital role and that has been recognized when Asia's Best Employer Brand awards organized by Employer Brand Institute endorsed the BOC as one of those classed as a Best Employer Brand for the year 2016. The strength of all these factors contribute to make the \"BOC\" brand No.1 for the ninth consecutive year,\" he added.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

CEIP an alliance between the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Forbury Investment Network associated with the UK law firm Clarkslegal and is managed in London by Forbury. It has affiliated hubs in other countries, connecting with London and each other to share trade and investment opportunities in the environmental goods and services sector for the benefit of the Commonwealth and of course our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thus far there exists established hubs in Canada, London, Wales, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa (in both Cape Town and Durban), the Seychelles.</p><p>The Sri Lanka hub will also cover the Maldives, and is operated by Motha Capital Investments [MCI], part of the GE Group. The MCI team leading this hub are Roshan Motha head of Motha Capital Investments (Private) Limited, Rohantha Athukoral, Head of National Portfolio Development of the United Nations office for Project Services (UNOP's) and Tanya Goonewardene, Attorney-at-law.</p><p>The focus of the hub is to link businesses, investors, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders not only in their national markets but also across Commonwealth member nations, and indeed other countries who wish to engage with the Commonwealth for trade and investment. The Hub exists to identify common interest and encouraging transfer of sustainable technologies within the Commonwealth, helping to address climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially in vulnerable countries, and promoting trade and investment in environmental businesses.</p><p>As an inaugural project, Motha Capital Investments (MCI) is presenting to the platform, an initiative by the Carbon Consultancy Company (Private) limited which is a project that has the required expertise to carry out a reforestation project that will establish a biodiversity corridor between the two large remnant rainforest patches in Sri Lanka following principles of analog forestry concepts. Through initiatives such as this they are able to advocate Carbon offsets which are credits for reductions in Green House Gas emissions made at another location.</p><p>Yet another reputed company which has been selected to be introduced on to the Platform is the renowned EnergySolve International (Private) Limited, which promotes the principles of sustainable development in areas including, but not limited to Green infrastructure development and LEED certification, energy saving and efficiency improvements, water saving and efficiency improvements, saving, monitoring and verification, renewable energy development, building energy simulations, artificial and day lighting simulations and energy auditing. To their credit are several World Bank initiatives relating to Energy Efficiency Improvements. It also includes the Brandix India Apparel City and Ken Park Group, jeans manufacturers.</p><p>Investors looking to derive return on investment through green initiatives can become members by registering with MCI, which will then make them privy to proposals of green initiatives across the platform. Similarly, enterprises that are looking for funding for a green initiative can meet with us and have their initiatives screened and upon initial assessment submit a proposal setting out the credentials of the transaction which will then be shared among the rest of the Commonwealth Hubs. We will represent the organization and according to its merits the potential investors will carry out their own due diligence of it.</p><p>The role as the Hub Operator is assisting the enterprise to make its case for funding through its business plan and introducing them to investors across the Commonwealth via the Platform.</p><p>The terms and conditions will be a matter of negotiation between the enterprise and the investor and funding depends entirely on interest of investors. The third group of members to which the Hub extends its invitation is professionals such as lawyers, accountants, lending institutions, auditors who have the required skill set and competence to facilitate these commercial transactions.</p><p>Alluding to the possible cost implications of membership it was decided by MCI has made a policy decision to admit investors, enterprises and professionals free of charge for the first 6 months since launch. In the future however, she added that there will be a possible cost implication of membership.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

They think it won't affect them personally. One young graduate, employed as a senior marketing executive in a large organisation, told this writer, \"It's just one of the many thousands of issues that are out there. If I have to worry about getting myself settled down in this job, I'm less concerned about melting sea ice in the Arctic.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The writer wasn't surprised. Two years ago, even President Trump called climate change a hoax. He said that he didn't believe the findings of potentially devastating impacts. Trump has since backed away from his assertion that climate change is a hoax, but apparently feels that the threat is overstated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Yale University research paper last year based on a Gallup World Poll survey of residents of 119 countries found that 40 per cent of adults worldwide reported having not understood what was climate change. That figure rises to more than 65 per cent in some Asian countries and Middle East countries.</p><p>Reality</p><p>But climate change is already affecting us. It is the reality. The temperatures are going up everywhere, not just in the Arctic, but cities everywhere - whether in USA, China or Sri Lanka. The heat waves are becoming more frequent.</p><p>These facts are proven. They are demonstrated by multiple lines of evidence. First, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has now reached such levels that have never been seen in the history of human civilization. Second, carbon dioxide is known to be a greenhouse gas. Third, the average surface temperature of the earth and the world's sea levels are rising. And as the temperature increases, glaciers melt. Both factors add to the sea level, which has already risen by four to eight inches. Eventually, this results in loss of coastline, and low-level islands.</p><p>Sri Lanka</p><p>According to the global statistics, Sri Lanka has not fared well in handling the climate change. In a new global index, Sri Lanka has been ranked second among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 20 years since 1998. The 2019 Long-Term Climate Risk Index, published by German-watch, has listed Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka, and Dominica as the top three affected countries.</p><p>The index is part of a report - Global Climate Risk Index 2019 - which was released at the annual climate summit in Poland recently.</p><p>The Index analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events such as storms, floods, heat waves, etc., from data available for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017.</p><p>In a report published in the Guardian in 2013, it was stated that \"in the next 55 years the greatest threat to Sri Lanka will be not from war, but from climate change. Sri Lanka is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and weather-related disasters have the potential to set back any gains made in agriculture, fisheries and even services such as tourism\".</p><p>Therefore, climate change definitely is an issue of concern for Sri Lanka.</p><p>Education</p><p>Sri Lanka is a country whose economy is highly reliant on climate-sensitive sectors. For example, agriculture, forestry and energy production. The Government has adapted some measures in these fields to promote better environmental management. Programmes have been established for the agricultural sector to manage soil erosion, support better water management and encourage the diversification of agricultural production.</p><p>In the energy sector, policies have been developed to support increased energy efficiency and to reduce associated environmental pollution. The Government also has realised that to effectively respond to anticipated climatic changes the existing adaptation measures need to be extended and action needs to be taken in other areas.</p><p>So, how can we slow the process of global climate change? First and most important of all, it needs more education and more public awareness.</p><p>Education has two obvious effects on the fight against climate change. Firstly, it impacts citizens' general awareness of the issue, and secondly, it determines how enabled they are to develop the necessary solutions and innovations to overcome the problem.</p><p>In fact, so important is education in the fight against climate change that Article 6 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is wholly dedicated to education, training, public awareness and access to information related to climate change.</p><p>Effects</p><p>However, general awareness alone would not necessarily equate to public concern, especially in countries like Sri Lanka where climate change is not regarded by citizenry as an urgent issue. In such countries the climate change should become part of the political debate. This solidifies the importance of ensuring that the information shared about climate change is as accurate as possible and that the public is educated enough to understand the scientific concepts at its core.</p><p>A basic scientific literacy in the population can help increase a community's ability to solve and adapt to climate change by enabling the citizens to make informed decisions about climate and the factors that impact it, such as pollution.</p><p>The second benefit of education on the fight against climate change is the development ofthe citizens' ability to solve and mitigate its impacts.</p><p>This requires the development of a modern educational infrastructure, from primary through to higher education, that has a strong focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). A STEM-focused education will provide students with both the understanding of the cause and effects of climate change, and also, the tools and know-how to solve them.</p><p>Since the government is responsible only for a proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, they must persuade other stakeholders to adjust their behaviour in ways that limit emissions and promote adaptation. In this respect, as the economy's most powerful and largest source of spending power, businesses have an opportunity to take the lead and invest in a climate-smart future, be it through the generation of renewable energy, green infrastructure or scaling up carbon capture and storage.</p><p>The National Adaptation Plan also recognises that collaborative efforts by all stakeholders, which include the government sector, corporate sector, academics, researchers, small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), civil society organisations along with local community-based approaches, can deliver the ultimate objective of enhancing the adaptive capacity of sections of society that are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.</p><p>Tools</p><p>The government itself has a number of tools at its disposal for motivating people to make these changes. Policies and legislation can be used to raise the cost of activities that emit greenhouse gases or create vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. They can also be designed to reduce the costs of activities that lower emissions and promote adaptation.</p><p>Regulations and standards can mandate changes in products and practices. Taxes and subsidies can also be adjusted to influence behaviour.</p><p>Such policies and measures, however, can encounter inertia, passive resistance or active opposition, particularly from those concerned about the imposition of a new cost. Providing information and explanations is therefore vital for generating public and stakeholder support for government policies and regulations.</p><p>At the same time, public outreach can also encourage voluntary changes in habits, address the arguments of those who oppose specific actions and help to prepare the younger generation for living in the climate-changing world that they will soon inherit.</p><p>The Government and many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are already working actively to raise awareness. The scale of the change is required, however, and the vast number of people and interests that must be influenced, calls for outreach activities of a much greater magnitude. The government must encourage local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), educators, the media, the entertainment industry and individuals to play a role.</p><p>They may also consider building partnerships with many of these diverse actors.</p><p>Education and awareness-raising enable informed decision-making, play an essential role in increasing adaptation and mitigation capacities of communities, and empower women and men to adopt sustainable lifestyles.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

They think it won't affect them personally. One young graduate, employed as a senior marketing executive in a large organisation, told this writer, \"It's just one of the many thousands of issues that are out there. If I have to worry about getting myself settled down in this job, I'm less concerned about melting sea ice in the Arctic.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The writer wasn't surprised. Two years ago, even President Trump called climate change a hoax. He said that he didn't believe the findings of potentially devastating impacts. Trump has since backed away from his assertion that climate change is a hoax, but apparently feels that the threat is overstated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Yale University research paper last year based on a Gallup World Poll survey of residents of 119 countries found that 40 per cent of adults worldwide reported having not understood what was climate change. That figure rises to more than 65 per cent in some Asian countries and Middle East countries.</p><p>Reality:</p><p>But climate change is already affecting us. It is the reality. The temperatures are going up everywhere, not just in the Arctic, but cities everywhere - whether in USA, China or Sri Lanka. The heat waves are becoming more frequent.</p><p>These facts are proven. They are demonstrated by multiple lines of evidence. First, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has now reached such levels that have never been seen in the history of human civilization. Second, carbon dioxide is known to be a greenhouse gas. Third, the average surface temperature of the earth and the world's sea levels are rising. And as the temperature increases, glaciers melt. Both factors add to the sea level, which has already risen by four to eight inches. Eventually, this results in loss of coastline, and low-level islands.</p><p>Sri Lanka:</p><p>According to the global statistics, Sri Lanka has not fared well in handling the climate change. In a new global index, Sri Lanka has been ranked second among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 20 years since 1998. The 2019 Long-Term Climate Risk Index, published by German-watch, has listed Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka, and Dominica as the top three affected countries.</p><p>The index is part of a report - Global Climate Risk Index 2019 - which was released at the annual climate summit in Poland recently.</p><p>The Index analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events such as storms, floods, heat waves, etc., from data available for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017.</p><p>In a report published in the Guardian in 2013, it was stated that \"in the next 55 years the greatest threat to Sri Lanka will be not from war, but from climate change. Sri Lanka is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels and weather-related disasters have the potential to set back any gains made in agriculture, fisheries and even services such as tourism\".</p><p>Therefore, climate change definitely is an issue of concern for Sri Lanka.</p><p>Education:</p><p>Sri Lanka is a country whose economy is highly reliant on climate-sensitive sectors. For example, agriculture, forestry and energy production. The Government has adapted some measures in these fields to promote better environmental management. Programmes have been established for the agricultural sector to manage soil erosion, support better water management and encourage the diversification of agricultural production.</p><p>In the energy sector, policies have been developed to support increased energy efficiency and to reduce associated environmental pollution. The Government also has realised that to effectively respond to anticipated climatic changes the existing adaptation measures need to be extended and action needs to be taken in other areas.</p><p>So, how can we slow the process of global climate change? First and most important of all, it needs more education and more public awareness.</p><p>Education has two obvious effects on the fight against climate change. Firstly, it impacts citizens' general awareness of the issue, and secondly, it determines how enabled they are to develop the necessary solutions and innovations to overcome the problem.</p><p>In fact, so important is education in the fight against climate change that Article 6 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is wholly dedicated to education, training, public awareness and access to information related to climate change.</p><p>Effects:</p><p>However, general awareness alone would not necessarily equate to public concern, especially in countries like Sri Lanka where climate change is not regarded by citizenry as an urgent issue. In such countries the climate change should become part of the political debate. This solidifies the importance of ensuring that the information shared about climate change is as accurate as possible and that the public is educated enough to understand the scientific concepts at its core.</p><p>A basic scientific literacy in the population can help increase a community's ability to solve and adapt to climate change by enabling the citizens to make informed decisions about climate and the factors that impact it, such as pollution.</p><p>The second benefit of education on the fight against climate change is the development ofthe citizens' ability to solve and mitigate its impacts.</p><p>This requires the development of a modern educational infrastructure, from primary through to higher education, that has a strong focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). A STEM-focused education will provide students with both the understanding of the cause and effects of climate change, and also, the tools and know-how to solve them.</p><p>Since the government is responsible only for a proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, they must persuade other stakeholders to adjust their behaviour in ways that limit emissions and promote adaptation. In this respect, as the economy's most powerful and largest source of spending power, businesses have an opportunity to take the lead and invest in a climate-smart future, be it through the generation of renewable energy, green infrastructure or scaling up carbon capture and storage.</p><p>The National Adaptation Plan also recognises that collaborative efforts by all stakeholders, which include the government sector, corporate sector, academics, researchers, small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), civil society organisations along with local community-based approaches, can deliver the ultimate objective of enhancing the adaptive capacity of sections of society that are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.</p><p>Tools:</p><p>The government itself has a number of tools at its disposal for motivating people to make these changes. Policies and legislation can be used to raise the cost of activities that emit greenhouse gases or create vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. They can also be designed to reduce the costs of activities that lower emissions and promote adaptation.</p><p>Regulations and standards can mandate changes in products and practices. Taxes and subsidies can also be adjusted to influence behaviour.</p><p>Such policies and measures, however, can encounter inertia, passive resistance or active opposition, particularly from those concerned about the imposition of a new cost. Providing information and explanations is therefore vital for generating public and stakeholder support for government policies and regulations.</p><p>At the same time, public outreach can also encourage voluntary changes in habits, address the arguments of those who oppose specific actions and help to prepare the younger generation for living in the climate-changing world that they will soon inherit.</p><p>The Government and many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are already working actively to raise awareness. The scale of the change is required, however, and the vast number of people and interests that must be influenced, calls for outreach activities of a much greater magnitude. The government must encourage local authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), educators, the media, the entertainment industry and individuals to play a role.</p><p>They may also consider building partnerships with many of these diverse actors.</p><p>Education and awareness-raising enable informed decision-making, play an essential role in increasing adaptation and mitigation capacities of communities, and empower women and men to adopt sustainable lifestyles.

In addition to contributing to analysis, we must describe concretely the vision of society that we are fighting for, regardless of who wins. Having this perspective will shape our approach to future challenges under the rule of either of the two main contenders, Gotabaya Rajapaksa or Sajith Premadasa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the event of a Gotabaya victory, the immediate response will be to try and defend liberal democratic norms. Even if Sajith wins and the left buys itself more time to organise, however, the same crisis that created space for chauvinist forces will exist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, as we can see in Western countries, the neoliberal centrist establishment is hollowed out and incapable of effectively pushing back against authoritarian politics. This politics offers hospitable terrain for extremist actors such as the far right and even fascist forces.</p><p>Left populists in other countries have argued that reversing the authoritarian turn requires an expansive vision that breaks with the neoliberal order. Their argument makes visible the linkage between political and economic reform any successful movement must make, regardless of its ideology. If we look back in the case of Sri Lanka, for example, the UNP used the neoliberal Open Economy policy of 1977 to justify the establishment of the Executive Presidency to effectively implement its plan.</p><p>During the Presidential Election of 2015, the Rajapaksa clan became a concentrated target for popular anger toward the abuse of power. But the political agenda of diverse actors in opposition was vaguely defined. Many embraced anticorruption discourse and a narrow, legalistic definition of constitutional reform. A democratic agenda for constitutional reform can only be achieved, however, by understanding the broad social purpose for which it is designed. We must explain why a more democratic system of governance would be required, for example, to devolve decisions regarding public investment.</p><p>To offer people something more-a way of framing the upcoming election not just in terms of dangers but also possibilities-the left must take the risk, even in a moment fraught with peril, to sketch what a future society could look like if organised according to new principles. What the rest of this article offers is a sketch of a transition in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Narrow electoral calculations force us to recognise the hard authoritarian threat. Writing, however, is also an exercise in political imagination. In addition to identifying the electoral stakes, it helps us concretely envision what we could potentially achieve if we build a collective movement for egalitarian change.</p><p>Social priorities for investment</p><p>If we look at what most people spend money on, we see that basic needs that should be covered by public services remain significant costs for households earning less than Rs. 100,000 a month. Analysing data from the 2016 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, we see that the bottom 90% of Sri Lankan households on average spend nearly 15% on healthcare and education alone.</p><p>Although healthcare and education are technically offered as free services, quality has gone way down. In the health sector, private sector hospitals and insurance schemes predominate because of the need to cover more advanced and complex operations. More importantly perhaps, State hospitals are underfunded. Medical care, however, will require greater investment, especially as the population grows older.</p><p>In terms of education, Sri Lanka used to maintain world-class standards. Now, however, graduates aspire to enrol in extension courses of foreign universities. The lucky few migrate abroad. The crisis is severe even before students enter university. Parents are forced to shoulder the costs of tuition classes because Government schools are inadequate.</p><p>Moreover, after graduation, there are no job guarantees. What's the purpose, then, of schooling? Simply put, education must be decoupled from skills-in a narrow, vocational sense-and reconsidered as a process that enables the citizenry to engage in decision-making at advanced levels. That means debating the social priorities of investment.</p><p>Spending more on health and education would decommodify these needs, take them out of the market, and ease people's stress and anxiety. To do so would require drastically increasing (and enforcing) direct taxes on the rich, which would also level inequality. The State's revenue would ultimately be limited, however, by Sri Lanka's overall economic development. We must redefine what kind of investment is required to achieve development, especially in green infrastructure.</p><p>What if we invested, for example, in more public transport? This approach would create a market for goods and services procured by the state, including the possibility of worker-owned cooperatives. It would enable the state to set labour and environmental standards for contractors, while incentivising private investment. In addition, we could turn Wages Boards into sectoral bargaining institutions, along with making it easier to unionise in the workplace.</p><p>We could imagine a nationalised ride sharing platform, a light rail network in Colombo, and the upgrading of public transport across the entire country. Passenger transport could be combined with cargo. Public facilities for the warehousing and retailing of agro products, including for export abroad, could be built. We could bring farmers, estate workers, and other rural constituencies into the political debate by demanding an efficient network of transportation that cuts out the middlemen while providing unionised green jobs for logistics workers.</p><p>The energy to power this system could come from micro grids expanded with even more public investment. Establishing decentralised renewable energy could enable District Councils to take on more tasks. This would strengthen their capacity under the direction of Provincial Councils that address the development needs of their respective provinces.</p><p>The latest UN Committee on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report on a global Green New Deal, for example, describes an alternative path for countries in the global South. The report mentions that those countries which have not yet sunk capital into developing inefficient energy infrastructure could potentially convert to alternatives faster.</p><p>The above processes would require confronting perhaps the most powerful force currently driving the Sri Lankan economy: real estate speculation. If government planners are serious about implementing the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, for example, it's time to ban construction of new luxury apartments, or at least require that a significant proportion of housing stock be allocated for lower income families.</p><p>We could also demand subsidies for climate-proof housing across the island. Finally, a financial transaction tax, capital gains tax, and other wealth taxes could limit speculative activity, in addition to helping cover public expenditures.</p><p>A vision that can win</p><p>What the above reforms would entail is a mix of public and private investment. More importantly, they represent a public framework for private investment. Investors on their own do not set the right priorities for our society, or for our economy for that matter. They look for the most profitable activity that requires the least amount of risk. That's why policy slogans such as attracting more foreign investment can't solve the crisis that manifests politically in the choice between a weak democratic candidate and a hard authoritarian candidate, or Sajith versus Gotabaya. The calculus only changes when capitalists are forced to operate under different circumstances. That means increasing the leverage of actors, such as workers, who can prevent the rich from pushing economic burdens onto the poor. For too long, unfortunately, most Sri Lankans have not enjoyed this advantage. They have experienced their lack of effective bargaining power in the stagnation of their living standards, while other parts of the country, especially the affluent sections of Colombo, obtain high-profile investment.</p><p>Nevertheless, on another level, the business community also operates according to a different rationality, within a set of social parameters. Business people recognise that they will face consequences if the economy, state and society enter a full-blown crisis. As many can see, in Sri Lanka and beyond, the current system is not sustainable. It's producing increasingly authoritarian political responses.</p><p>While some elites may claim that they want a leader who can impose 'discipline,' they may not equally appreciate the proto-fascist forces such a figure could-and likely would-unleash. In the meantime, neoliberal policy makers and think tanks will offer the same solutions. But the deadening of our imagination and the retreat into clich\u00e9s shows that even their rhetoric hardly convinces the decision-makers, much less the voters who will decide the next president.</p><p>In addition to exposing the potential dangers of proto-fascism then, we must sketch an alternative for the candidate that is most capable of defeating reaction this election. While Sajith's success or failure hinges on structural factors-especially the diversity and enthusiasm of his party's social bases-ideological work still has a role to play. Moreover, the way in which we can prevent hard authoritarianism from rearing its head again in the long-term, even if it is defeated in the immediate short-term, is based on the extent to which we adopt a new platform.</p><p>Finally, rethinking the boundaries of what's politically possible can remind us why the changes so many other progressives would like to see can only be achieved as part of a strong left-led coalition. Leading from the left means approaching the democratisation of the relationship between state and society from the perspective of democratising the economy. That includes dispensing with the cheap technocratic rhetoric that has so far defined the presidential candidates' campaigns. Instead, leadership demands that we take the risk of imagining and fighting for a different order.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT1010201900033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-6MY1-JCH9-G0JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000563</classCode><className>ELECTION LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp; ISSUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSEP</classCode><className>ANTI-CORRUPTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQHE</classCode><className>FAR RIGHT POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQKS</classCode><className>FASCISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CYCH</classCode><className>LIBERALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQV2</classCode><className>POPULISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DQK4</classCode><className>CENTRISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001309</classCode><className>PERSONAL &amp; FAMILY INCOME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000D5SG</classCode><className>CORRUPTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DRD8</classCode><className>GOTABAYA RAJAPAKSA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC381</classCode><className>SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The bank has incorporated Green Banking as a strategic business initiative to its business process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Green Banking is still an evolving concept that has emerged in recent years. Its core idea is to engage in any form of banking which the community gets environmentally benefitted through its practices. The importance of the banking industry being involved in green initiatives comes through its importance in playing the role in economic development through financial intermediation. The banking sector acts as a major partner in financial inclusion therefore vested on its economic power it can promote environmentally sustainable and socially responsible investments and projects.</p><p>'For the Bank of Ceylon, success is always to gain sustainable growth together with the wellbeing of the community, therefore the idea is embedded as an integral part in the bank's core mission. Understanding the economic, social and environmental needs the bank evolved its approach overtime towards this mission without compromising the environment at any cost. The digital transformation was one big advancement we made towards this goal to make a better environment through digitisation,' stated the bank's Chairman President's Counsel Ronald C. Perera.</p><p>'Through this transformation process BOC has been able to alter its systems, processors, communication channels and manage all its resources not only to yield best economic advantages for the bank and its customers but also to engage in environment related best practices comprehensively,' Perera further stated.</p><p>With the best practices that came along with the digital transformation the Bank was able to move into a green process where day-to-day bank operations specially paper work was replaced by technology and made to be seamless and thus minimised waste including and carbon emission. Smart products such as 'SmartGen' were introduced replace conventional savings accounts that use passbooks where there were a lot of paper usage. SmartZones were introduced for paperless transactions 24x7. These products and services have changed the bank's customer interface completely providing utmost convenience. Internally the bank has adapted a comprehensive Document Management System (DMS) and E-learning facility for employee training.</p><p>'We at Bank of Ceylon had many on-going environmentally friendly programs that have been there for several years. The bank has moved into a comprehensive Green Banking approach that is heavily aided by the digital transformation. With that we have introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that includes IT and physical infrastructure,' stated General Manager D.M. Gunasekara.</p><p>Encouraging the business community to adapt environmental best practices is an important initiative that a banking institution can do. 'The Bank of Ceylon takes a special care in projects and business lending to make sure that those financed projects are environmental friendly. It even encourages customers, especially in the SME and corporate segments to execute projects that use renewable energy and installation of renewable energy, waste management, recycling/up-cycling projects and energy saving projects. Partnering to build the NSBM Campuses' new premises is a very recent such project the Bank of Ceylon worked with keen interest which was not only a green project but also addresses one major area of bank's social sustainability which is education,' Gunasekara added.</p><p>Apart from best practices adapted through digitalisation, the Bank of Ceylon has been engaged in green initiatives such as paper recycling, E-waste management, installing eco-friendly equipment, installing energy efficient lighting systems in branches and head office, maintaining green gardens at selected branches with rain water harvesting systems. The solar powered system in selected branches is also a recent addition to the Bank's Green Banking process.</p><p>Commenting on special achievements that is noteworthy; during the past three years only BOC was able to recycle 389,440 kg of paper that was calculated to save 6621 fully grown trees which otherwise would have been cut-down for this purpose and planted 100,000 trees in line with the bank's 75th anniversary in 2014 gathering school children and public from all over the country. The bank's Kilinochchi branch was endorsed as a green branch recently as it was designed to have a solar energy system and utilises space and architectural design to obtain more natural light and air, vertical green garden to keep the interior cool, rain water harvesting system and a SmartZone for digital banking.</p><p>Leading the Sri Lankan banking industry with over 77 years' experience, the Bank of Ceylon has become the most stable and the trusted bank in the country that serves Sri Lankans from all walks of life helping them to build their lives and make themselves financially stable whilst uplifting the country's economy. The bank earned global recognition as one of the top 1000 banks in the world, (Country rank No. 1) as listed by 'The Banker Magazine' (UK) respectively in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The Bank of Ceylon won the overall Gold Award at the NBEA Awards Ceremony 2015 with five other 'Winner' awards. The bank claimed its award as the only Sri Lankan brand recognised as one of Asia's Best Brands in 2013 by the Chief Marketing Officer's Council (CMO Council) based in Mumbai, India. Brand Finance Lanka has ranked Bank of Ceylon as the country's No. 1 brand for the last eight consecutive years.</p><p>The bank has passed exceptional milestones in recent years such as becoming the first to gain over Rs. 1.5 trillion assets and over Rs. 1 trillion deposits. Focusing on the bank's achievement, Fitch Rating Lanka ranked the Bank of Ceylon at AA+(lka) which is the highest rating awarded to a local commercial bank and ICRA (lk) awarded AAA rating which is the highest credit quality rating issued by ICRA Lanka. The Bank of Ceylon maintains international presence with three overseas branches and a subsidiary in London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT071120160000205</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M4D-WB91-F00C-6048-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 7, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0004B11</classCode><className>BANK OF CEYLON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6022 STATE COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Authority of State Agencies</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc4MzRFMzEwMEEwNDZEMTgzMjZFMjg1N0M2Q0FENTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFDOEJBNTMwMzE5NERBQjk4MUM3QjI0QjdCRTYyRTI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Bank Creations &amp;

As water spills into houses and shops, business grinds to a halt and children pick their way through dangerously flooded streets to get to school.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the past 10 years, the floods have gotten worse, with maximum sea levels rising 8-10 inches. The water stays up for about four hours each time, says Cao Van Buon, a business owner.</p><p>As seasonal and extreme weather events become more severe, cities like Can Tho face an enormous challenge. Many of the world's largest cities are located on coasts, deltas, or riverbanks; globally, 60% of the world's cities are at risk from rising sea levels and storm surges. With this in mind, more than 400 mayors from around the world met at the UN's Paris climate conference determined to take action.</p><p>There was a clear signal from Paris that municipal leaders are not only deeply committed to making sure their cities adapt to the impacts of climate change,  but are also leading the way to lower emissions through low-carbon development, said World Bank Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice Senior Director Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez. With COP21 behind us, it's time to get on with the real work of the post-COP agenda.</p><p>Last year, the World Bank provided over $ 3 billion in urban climate finance and technical assistance to help developing countries build climate-smart cities; this figure is expected to grow proportionately as the Bank moves to increase its climate finance by a third over the next five years.</p><p>As urban populations grow faster than ever - with 90% of that growth happening in developing countries - the World Bank and its partners, are providing advice, tools and funding to address the urban climate challenge. Here's a look at what the bank is doing:</p><p>Adaptation</p><p>Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change, because that's where people and assets are concentrated. The World Bank has helped cities understand and build resilience for more than a decade, promoting early warning systems, stronger infrastructure, flood management, and disaster preparedness programs. In Sri Lanka, World Bank loans are improving Colombo's resilience and ability to prevent floods. In Bogota, Colombia, schools have been upgraded to meet resilient building codes and people living in high-risk areas susceptible to landslides and flash floods have resettled in safer territory.</p><p>Adaptation is about managing risk, said Niels B. Holm-Nielsen, Global Lead for Resilience and Disaster Risk Management at the World Bank. There is a lot for cities to consider - improving water circulation to avoid flooding, territorial planning to guide more resilient urban growth and, most importantly, how to keep things going in the face of major storm or natural disaster.</p><p>Among many tools offered by the World Bank is a new program called 'City Strength', which evaluates resilience on a holistic basis - looking at different sectors like transport, energy, health, waste management, and information and communications technology - bringing the findings together to identify critical gaps or areas of weakness.</p><p>Mitigation</p><p>By the end of the Paris climate talks, more than 450 cities with a combined population of nearly one billion people had pledged to reduce emissions by more than 50% over 15 years. A recent analysis by the World Bank found that only 20% of the world's largest cities have the basic analytics necessary for low-carbon urban planning.</p><p>This expanded engagement on the part of the mayors, coupled with unprecedented urban population growth, presents a unique opportunity to set cities on a low-carbon development path, said Paul Kriss, World Bank Global Lead for Sustainable City Infrastructure and Services.</p><p>Working with more than 20 international organisations, the bank is developing a Climate Certification Program to help city officials gain the expertise necessary to conduct local GHG emissions inventories, the foundation for climate action plans.</p><p>The newly-established Global Platform for Sustainable Cities (GPCS) supports municipal efforts to integrate low carbon and resilience into planning and decision-making processes, while the Climate Action for Urban Sustainability (CURB) tool can be used by cities prioritise different low-carbon initiatives bases on cost, feasibility, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The Bank is also pioneering the use of TRACE (Tool for Rapid Assessment of City Energy), a land use, transport and energy model that lets users project different scenarios.  When TRACE was deployed in Romania, city officials found that more compact urban development in the Bucharest region could decrease local greenhouse gas emission by 39%.</p><p>Financing</p><p>Building low-carbon, resilient infrastructure often exceeds the existing financial capacity of cities in the developing world.</p><p>Cities can't do it alone, said Roland White, the World Bank's Global Lead for City Management, Finance and Governance. National governments will have to help with major investments, particularly in climate and green infrastructure. And the international community has an important technical and financial role to play.</p><p>Most cities in the developing world don't have access to sufficient, long-term financing and credit. Only 4% of the 500 largest cities are credit worthy in the international markets and only 20 % have a domestic credit rating. National governments need to create the policy and legal environments that help cities more easily access private financing to invest in climate infrastructure, and cities need to strengthen their financial performance to attract investors.</p><p>The World Bank is working with a number of countries to strengthen their regulatory frameworks for municipal borrowing, while its City Creditworthiness Academy (CCA) works to strengthen municipal performance and prepare them to tap domestic and regional capital markets. The CCA has trained over 500 municipal officials from 185 cities in 20 countries.</p><p>Looking to the Post-COP future</p><p>The future of sustainable development lies in creating a mix of financial and technical solutions that can match the complexity of building low carbon, resilient cities, said Ijjasz-Vasquez. These engagements offer combinations of physical risk reduction, financial risk transfer and management, support systems to improve decision making for risk management, and early infrastructure and regulatory improvements that will shape a city's future over 10 to 15-year horizons. Together with our development partners, the World Bank will continue to finance public investment in low-carbon, resilient cities, but we are also helping municipal governments develop a wider array of financial tools to reduce their vulnerability to natural disasters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2812201500015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HPY-8MB1-F0FB-T1RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 28, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Business &amp;

As you may be aware, today, we are running at an ecological deficit, and the current global rate of extraction of natural resources is 25 per cent more than the replenishment rate. The global average ecological footprint is 2.2 global hectares per person as against the bio-capacity of 1.8. The ecological footprint measures humanity's demand on nature. </p><p>\"High income countries\" accounts for an ecological footprint of 6.4 global ha/person as against the bio-capacity of 3.3, whereas the \"Middle Income Countries\" and 'Low Income Countries\" account for ecological footprints of 1.9 and 0.9 as against bio-capacities of 2.1 and 0.7 respectively. Ecological footprint Sri Lanka has an ecological footprint of one global ha/person whereas our bio-capacity is 0.4. Therefore we Sri Lankans too are running at an ecological deficit of 150 per cent! Our country's situation is worse than the global situation. The present multiple crises provide us ample evidences of the ill effects of the unsustainable economic development strategies followed by the industrialized countries in the 20th century for the sake of human development. The result of the present crises is becoming in fact the worst global economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s which led to the World War II. IMF has already warned that all the economies of developed countries may contract in 2009 leading to social and political explosion. It is clear that we have to adjust our economic activities within a two limiting factors in order to attain a sustainable economic growth. One limiting factor is the \"Scarcity of resources\" and the other is \"Pollution\" arising out of the unlimited waste generation including emissions. All of us especially, the policy-makers, Architects and Engineers should understand the gravity of this problem, the root causes and the possible environmental devastations that would occur in future ruining the natural balance of the ecosystem which in turn would lead ruining the human existence in this planet. It is clear that the root cause of the problem is unsustainable consumption and production of the humankind. Most economists are now concerned whether the current financial credit crunch could lead to an ecological crunch or an environmental crisis in the absence of long term solutions linking to sustainability. Financial crisis and economic recession could be reversed over time. However the ecological crises are irreversible in nature and if there are environmental catastrophes, each civilization in the world would be severely affected. It may be considered as the end of the human civilization on this planet. In the early stages of human civilization, it was possible to change the civilization region or zone to a nearby region or a zone whenever environmental problems arose. Globalization However, in the present context, the process of globalization has tightly integrated all civilizations through trade and financial flows and the decisions taken in one country on their economic development have remarkable impacts on the entire world economy and thereby on the entire world community. At the same time, it is a known fact that ecosystems of the world are inextricably interlinked and economic recessions would lead to ecological recessions if timely action is not taken to reverse the trends of unsustainable development by the entire world community. We have to understand that short term rescue plans and temporary measures ignoring the ecological sustainability will not solve the present crises. Even the short term solutions should lead to long term sustainable solutions based on Green Economic principles leading to a \"Green Economy\". Green Economy is about sustainable consumption as well as production. Human health, wellbeing and livelihood are inextricably interlinked with the biological and physical properties and processes and functional ecosystems. The construction industry and its allied professionals-the Architects and Engineers have an important role to play with the policymakers to create a \"Low carbon-Green Built Environment\" functioning in harmony with the natural ecosystem. Without a healthy environment, there can be no social and economic development. We need to form green cities with green infrastructure minimizing the carbon footprints moving away from the carbon dependency economy. Present trends It is important to note that the carbon budget for the century identified by the United Nations to avoid catastrophic environmental disaster to humans is in the range of 50:50 probability which will expire in 2030 if the present trends continue. Therefore we must use a wider framework - a combination of architectural styles of different schools of thought to suit our climatic conditions and cultural practices within a green development paradigm, self sustained with a green culture. In this context my memories go back to the principles followed by our world famous leading architect, Geoffrey Bawa with his remarkable designs based on the Monsoon Architecture. Also, we can learn lessons from our ancient architecture in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa and use these with suitable modifications if necessary to suit the present condition. Maintenance A significant portion of investments for economic development should be set apart in the design of green architecture which would eventually avoid the massive costs of expenditure that the country would otherwise have to bear for the maintenance of energy and material intensive systems. In this context, it is necessary to develop new models of green architecture: green buildings, green villages, green cities with guidelines, building codes and other related codes of practices that would evolve the ancient architecture with appropriate modifications to resolve the present crisis. This Green Architecture should lead to sustainable production and consumption practices of the entire community of the country. The recent initiative taken by the Government of Sri Lanka to establish a National Sustainable Development Council with the leadership of the President under the Haritha Lanka Program clearly goes hand-in-hand with the governance structure necessary to integrate green economy needs into the existing development processes at national level.Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.</p><p>For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:htsyndication@hindustantimes.com\">htsyndication@hindustantimes.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DNSL-n-041549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DNSL2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VBX-XDY1-2SFM-K4FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338355</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1161\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd.

According to Dr. Punyawardena, the Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of the atmosphere is increasing at an alarming level which affects the climate change negatively.</p><p>'We know that global warming is occurring due to the greenhouse effect. These greenhouse effects, ultimately lead to the climate change. After 1750, the greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere has been sky rocketing. About 45 years ago, the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere was 0.03%. Now the new generation has to learn that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere as 0.04%. Within our lifetime it has risen 0.01%. A huge amount of heat is entrapped due to the greenhouse effect. This effectively leads to a negative impact on climate change,' he said.</p><p>Dr. Punyawardena also mentioned that there is a very clear cut and significant increase in the ambient temperature in the country. According to various studies conducted, the ambient temperature is increasing at a rate of 0.01% to 0.03% annually, with frequent droughts and floods.</p><p>Speaking on the effects of climate change on the annual rainfall, Dr. Punyawardena said that there is no decrease or increase in the amount of rainfall received annually as there was insufficient evidence to prove that there was a trend in the rainfall received.</p><p>'There is a misconception saying that with climate change, the annual rainfall is decreasing. I will say with all the responsibility, our annual rainfall is neither decreasing nor increasing. There is no trend in the rainfall. We get more rain when it is not needed, and we don't get rains when it is needed. In summary, if you take rainfall recording stations, there are about more than 400 stations governed by the Government and the private sector. Around 10% of these stations will show an increasing trend, another 15% will show a decreasing trend, while the remaining 75-80% will not show any trend in the rainfall. The only aspect that has been effected is the timing of the rainfall. The timing has become highly erratic. This results in more droughts and more floods.</p><p>He also mentioned that the intensity of rains have increased as a result of climate change while the number of rainy days have decreased.</p><p>'The intensity of the rains we receive have increased, which also results in an increase in flash floods. After 2005, our rainfall intensity has increased, both in the Central Highlands, and also in the dry zone. Even though the rain intensity is increasing, the number of rainy days are decreasing. This will have a significant impact on the agricultural productivity of the country,' Dr. Punyawardena elaborated.</p><p>He also noted that there will be a noticeable increase in the temperature in the future. He says that the studies conducted by various institutions show that there will be an increase of the temperature by two to three degrees at the turn of the century than that of today. According to Dr. Punyawardena, the increase in temperature will be significant in the Central Highlands, and the Northern Province.</p><p>'All these studies show that the dry zone will become even drier, while the wet zone will become even wetter in the years to come. The dry zone will experience a more intense drought than that of today, whereas the wet zone will experience more excessive rainfall conditions than today,' he added.</p><p>In his final remarks, Dr. Punyawardena said that the threat posed by climate change is a reality.</p><p>'It is true that the threat of climate change is there. All the studies we conduct arrive at the same conclusion, that it is real threat. It will affect all the sectors of the economy, especially agriculture, tourism, health, and transport. There are no sectors with immunity to this complication. All of the sectors are vulnerable to climate change. If you want to sustain, you have to adapt to this situation. That means the need for smarter strategies. We also need to have an attitudinal change. Without changing our attitude we will not be able to face this dilemma successfully,' he concluded.</p><p>Impact and assessment of climate change on biodiversity and alternative energy generation</p><p>IUCN Species Revival Commission Former Deputy Chairperson Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda who spoke at the forum said that the impact of climate change on biodiversity is catastrophic. He also noted that the worst impact will be suffered by the oceans.</p><p>'If we talk about the impact of climate change on biodiversity, it is catastrophic. The worst impact is going to happen to the oceans. The oceans today are acidifying at a rate that exceeds anything we have seen during vertebrate evolution. The last time the oceans saw this kind of acidification trend was 252 million years ago when the Earth saw the Permian Triassic extinction. The acidification of the oceans means that all the animals that depend on Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) for their exoskeletons cannot survive. The very bottom of the food web is taken out. When the Great Dying took place 252 million years ago, 90% of oceanic species became extinct. That is what we are looking at unless we reverse climate change by reducing CO2 emissions,' he said.</p><p>He also mentioned that different species in order to adapt to climate change engage in various actions.</p><p>'As the climate warms, species need to adapt or move to colder climates. As we go upcountry the climate cools substantially. Trees and animals that are now at sea levels in forests have to migrate upwards. Two problems arise here. One is that we have fragmented our landscape so radically that the migration of species becomes very difficult unless we build substantial habitat corridors that enable this to happen. The other problem is that the species who live on the highest peaks have nowhere higher to go. We are looking at major species extinctions in this area,' he added.</p><p>Dr. Pethiyagoda noted that the only way to dampen the impacts of climate change was to decrease the CO2 emissions released.</p><p>'In the whole climate change scenario, there is only one number that matters. That is the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Everything else comes out of that one simple fact. Over the past 1000 years we had an atmospheric concentration of CO2 less than 300ppm (parts per million), we are now well over 400ppm and aiming for the sky. 400ppm is something that we have not seen before in evolutionary history. As in the past 400,000 years, CO2 concentrations have varied. Global sea levels have varied by as much as 400 feet. The last time atmospheric CO2 exceeded 400ppm was 17 million years ago. Long before many of the species that walk the Earth today had evolved. During that time we only saw a sea level rise of 100 feet. The reason this is important is, we are only tweaking one number here. Only the greenhouse gases. The other consequences of that tweak will follow. That is what we need to be ready for,' he elaborated.</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Pethiyagoda said that although Sri Lanka had come a long way in the use of renewable energy, we need to do more. He mentioned that as Sri Lanka was a developing country, the energy requirement will only increase.</p><p>'Our electric energy consumption at the moment is low. To become a fully developed country, we are going to increase the energy consumption by 10 times. As we industrialise, the energy component supplied by the renewable resources we use now will not be sufficient. We have to think big into the future. The only technology available at the moment that we can even think about that will provide CO2 free energy is nuclear energy. Thirty-three countries in the world have nuclear electricity, including countries that are significantly poorer than us. There is no reason that we cannot think big into the future. We have no choice but to think big,' he concluded.</p><p>National strategy to address climate change threats</p><p>Speaking on the national strategy to address climate change threats by creating green infrastructure, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment Climate Change Director Dr. Sunimal Jayatunga said that overcoming the threats from prolonged drought and flood conditions was a national priority for the Government.</p><p>'We have identified three main interventions to address the arising threat of climate change. We hope to enrich catchments and watersheds in the central highlands and river basins. We hope to rehabilitate ancient cascade tank systems in the dry zone, and finally we also hope to divert excess water in the wet zone to control flash floods and to address prolonged droughts in the dry zone. These are the three major interventions that we hope to achieve at present,' he said.</p><p>The Climate Change Director noted that the Moragahakanda Reservoir project is one of the major projects conducted by the Government to address the climate change threat posed on the country.</p><p>'One of the interventions that the Government is currently engaged is building dams, especially the Moragahakanda reservoir project. It is a multipurpose irrigation project. Our aim is to improve the agriculture, power generation, industrial water supply, and the inland fishery sector through this project. This is the biggest multifunctional irrigation project in Sri Lanka and it contains a water quantity that is six times bigger than that of the Parakrama Samudraya. We plan on providing water for both of the major harvest seasons. We also hope to add an annual power generation of about 110 gigawatts to the national grid. It will also provide safe drinking water to a large population that is affected drought conditions in the dry zone. This project addresses and mitigates most of the effects of climate change,' he added.</p><p>Summarising some of the economic benefits of the Moragahakanda Reservoir project, Dr. Jayatunga noted that it is slated to provide irrigation water to about 87,000 farmers in districts such as Matale, Anuradhapura, and Polonnaruwa, during both of the major harvesting seasons, and to increase the annual inland fishing by 4,500 metric tonnes.</p><p>Dr. Jayatunga sharing insights on the most vulnerable sectors to climate change said, 'Agriculture, fishery, livestock, water, health, biodiversity, tourism, marine, urban, city planning, and human settlement are the sectors that are going to be effected the worst by climate change.'</p><p>The Climate Change Director noted: 'In Sri Lanka, we have a cascade tank system. More than 42,000 tanks including small tanks, and the 103 rivers we have in the country are included in this cascade tank system. We have a lot of water bodies in the country, we have to utilise them in a better way. This is what the Ministry is planning on doing. When we divert the excess water in the wet zone to the dry zone, we are going to be using the Mahaweli system. The Mahaweli system is a unique system. It is necessary to apply the ecosystem based adaptation system again. We have to think back to that era and hope to make the country more sustainable. It is one of the best ways to address the climate change in the dry zone. We are also hoping to restore upper watershed catchment areas to ensure climate change resilience. This is an opportunity for us to rehabilitate what we destroyed.'</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Jayatunga said, 'We have other major climate adaptation projects in the works. The Uma Oya multipurpose development project, Upper Elahara Canal project, North-West Canal project, Minipe Left Bank Canal Rehabilitation project, the Climate Smart irrigated Agriculture project, the Climate Resilient Improvement Water Management project, and the Yan Oya reservoir project are some of these.'</p><p>Pix by Ruwan Walpola</p><p>Looking ahead and planning for the aftereffects of climate change</p><p>The forum concluded with a panel discussion on looking ahead and planning for the aftereffects of climate change, which included Dr. Nambi Appadurai, Dr. Ranjith Punyawardene, Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, Dr. Sunimal Jayatunga, Forest Department Conservator General Anura Sathurusinghe and Dilhan Fernando</p><p>Q: Under UN Red, the UN programme for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, there are many adaptation strategies discussed in the global context. How can they be applied to Sri Lanka?</p><p>Anura Sathurusinghe: If we take the Red Plus strategy, we developed and presented to the Government about a year ago, when we talk about forestry, we usually talk about the mitigation. But in this case, in Sri Lanka, what was really important was ecosystem services. We thought of identifying different strategies and policies while looking at the mitigation aspects of forestry and also to look at the adaptation requirement also. For that we had identified 13 policies and measures within three main policy frameworks as forest, wildlife, and the watersheds. We looked at watersheds as one whole landscape while looking at the social aspects. There is a mix of both adaptation and mitigation aspects.</p><p>Q: What is the UN Global Concept (UNGC) Future Scope for the climate change adaptation?</p><p>Dilhan Fernando: In the alignment of the environment, there are multiple different interventions, but we must remember that the UNGC is a convening platform and therefore it is reliant on the initiatives of the members. It offers an opportunity for members to work within those seven directions that is mandated by the UN which are very general, to build certain specific interventions. In our case, we work with the UN platform, speaking as Dilmah Conservation, in order to be able to understand best practice globally from the UNGC platform. We use that to be able to optimise what we do, so that we don't reinvent the wheel, build partnerships and that we are able to share our best practice using UNGC, because ultimately there is no point in us doing something fantastic only on one or two of our estates. We need to be able to leverage it to be able to deliver something that we can look back at. I think UNGC has two functions there, one is to be able to act as a platform to share best practice that will help us to scale up any initiative that the members wish and secondly it also has the possibility to allow the members to share their efforts with others in order to deliver at a national scale rather than making it something that might be isolated.</p><p>Q: With respect to adaptation and mitigation responses that we should undertake to reduce the vulnerability of Asia to climate change, are there any significant barriers or challenges that would delay or make them ineffective?</p><p>Nambi Appadurai: One of the key constraints is the interface between science and policy, and how do you convert scientists into policy makers? To me that is a bog challenge. Apart form that the capacities are at different levels, because it is happening at a rapid pace, therefore people coping with different things. But then what happens is that the people cannot accommodate the change in which it happens today. The information flow has to be maintained. Technology is helping us with that. The interactions between science and policy is very critical to me, because a lot of politicians do not understand the complexity of the climate change subject whereas scientist do not understand the intricacies of policy making. Demystifying science is important here.</p><p>Q: Undamming rivers is the trend today. We have decided in Sri Lanka, in consultation with the president, that we cannot tap our rivers any more for power generation without harming the environment. I do not see how climate change impacts can be reduced by damming rivers.</p><p>Rohan Pethiyagoda: There is no question that damming rivers, whether for irrigation, flood management or hydropower, carries environmental costs. It is true that in the US many old and/or poorly-constructed dams are being removed. However, the driving reason for this is not environmental but safety and maintenance cost. In Sri Lanka, the institutions whose job it is to provide our farmers with water, and provide all of us with electricity, considered these challenges and came up with solutions. These solutions include the dams which are today generating electricity at a cost of less than Rs. 10 per kWh4, a fraction of the Rs. 25-60 it costs per unit of thermal power. Almost a third of our power now comes from these dams.</p><p>Climate risk management and climate change adaptation</p><p>Speaking on the reality and threats posed by climate change, and how we can respond to these, World Resource Institute and Climate Resilience Practice India Adaptation Strategy Director Dr. Nambi Appadurai said that it was important to look at adaptation and mitigation as response options to climate change at the same time rather than working on them individually.</p><p>'We have only two major response options to climate change. Mitigation and adaptation are the only major response options. We have spent decades on mitigation, because it is a very politically charged issue. Even though the disparities between the debating sides have died down a bit, we still have a long way to go. Adaptation on the other hand is mostly untouched. Due to the fact that it is a development issue, adaptation is very complex and there is no single solution to it. It is a work in progress and we still have a long way to go. It is a moving target. A good starting point for successful adaptation is acquiring good and relevant information and the possible range of impacts on different sectors. That information also is not easy to come by. We need to have practical approaches to vulnerability assessments. Whatever sector we look at and do vulnerability assessments, we need to look at the direct impacts as well as the indirect impacts,'</p><p>Dr. Appadurai also noted that climate change is a complex subject that needs a thorough understanding to fully comprehend.</p><p>'Climate change is a subject that needs reiteration and repetition. It is also a complex subject, so it takes time to fully comprehend the threat that it poses to the future of the world. We have to accept the fact that climate change is happening right now and it is here to stay for a long time to come. Wherever you go you hear about climate change, no matter the country or continent. It is a word that resonates with everybody today though they find it a bit complex,' he said.</p><p>Speaking on the threat that climate change poses to the modern world, Dr. Appadurai said, 'There are different global challenges. Population growth, poverty, urbanisation, and things like that. All of these are major challenges. Climate change is also on this list but it is a bit further down. Even though it is low on the list as of now, it will only get more prominent, and we have to be ready for that. Climate change affects the very building blocks of survival.'</p><p>He also mentioned the impacts of climate change on the private sector and how adaptation is the most relevant response option to these effects.</p><p>'If we look at the impacts of climate change on the private sector, much of the global discussion on adaptation finance has focused on integrating aspects of climate resilience into public sector budgeting and the allocation of international climate finance. It is however, through the integration of climate resilience aspects into the day-to-day decisions of private enterprises around the world, that the most significant adaptation potential in economic development can be achieved. Understanding how these decisions are made and are ultimately financed is critical for establishing the policy frameworks capable to scale-up private sector investment to transformational scale required. Understanding how private sector adaptation investment occurs, what drives it and how it is financed, also is essential. It is a low-cost entrance for Governments and policy makers seeking to increase levels of adaptation,' he elaborated.</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Appadurai mentioned that evidence based research and sound monitoring as the most important aspects that we should focus on as responses to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>'Looking ahead, I believe that evidence based research is very important. Transformative approaches to the problems that we face today are critical when dealing with the threat of climate change. We need to learn from all the different studies that have been conducted and we need to look at how to put them to good use. Sound monitoring and evaluation is important for this. It is also important to invest in the best tools when dealing with this issue. Given the fact that 70% of the urban infrastructure is yet to be built in India and other developing countries. This provides a big window opportunity to all the countries to build climate resilient infrastructure,' he concluded.</p><p>Overview of the climate change conversation</p><p>Providing an overview of the climate change conversation to the forum, Dilmah Conservation CEO Dilhan Fernando elaborated on some key insights from the 2006 Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change.</p><p>'In 2006, Lord Nichiolas Stern, who was the Treasury Secretary, now the Vice Chair at the Grantham Institute made three key points in the Review of the Economics of Climate Change. Every country and every individual in our world will be affected by climate change but the poorest will suffer the earliest and the most. Two is that climate change is the greatest market failure in of all time. The third is that the benefits of early action far outweigh the costs. He estimated that at that time, inaction could cost the world at least 5% of global GDP each year whilst the cost of early action, reducing emissions could be limited to around 1% of global GDP,' he said.</p><p>He also noted on some of the global catastrophes that have incurred due to the ill-effects of climate change.</p><p>'Just 12 years later from the Stern Review, wildfires are burning in the arctic circle. The fires across Siberia, in the past few weeks have covered 38,000 square miles, the smoke from those fires is evident even over Canada. Last year in Sweden, they had three forest fires. This year they have 40 times that,' he added.</p><p>Fernando also mentioned that the reasons for the lack of definitive action taken to mitigate climate change was due to economic discrepancies.</p><p>'A decade ago, there were environmentalists who fought for acknowledgement and action on this climate reality and on the other side, there were state and business lobbies that sometimes responded but mostly did not. The reasons for the lack of response were mostly economic. Adapting is often thought not to be good for business. In spite of all this, the world still has the same perception, because it is burning more fossil fuels today and apart from other consequences, also killing millions from air pollution,' he elaborated.</p><p>The Dilmah Conservation CEO speaking from the point of view of a climate change denier said, 'There is no real business case for a climate denier, however much one might try to ignore the reality. The US is not alone in this belief, and continues to invest about $20 billion in 2016 in subsidies for the production of fossil fuels, $15 billion more, but the fact is that there are many others except the US example.'</p><p>In his remarks, Dilhan Fernando noted that, 'Human existence is very clearly, intricately, and irrevocably linked to our natural environment. Ultimately, I think that when you look at the past, environmentalists, there was Government, and there were businesses, but today by necessity we are all environmentalists. Failure to address climate change is only going to exacerbate inequalities, and as we all know inequality is a corrosive, debilitating that leads ultimately to instability and far worse consequences.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT1308201800032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T1D-HTM1-JCH9-G08B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 13, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;
