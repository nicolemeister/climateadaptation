The overflow delegation, consisting of private sector organisations and one of Sri Lanka's biggest-ever contingents of 20 youth delegates, forms the largest part of the representation at the climate summit.</p><p>Sri Lanka will host its first-ever pavilion at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties in Dubai next week, where multiple climate-related policies and lobbies are set to be spearheaded by Sri Lanka.</p><p>While the Sunday Times does not have information on the nature of funding for the political and technical delegations, it has confirmed that the overflow delegates are self-funded or sponsored by other organisations.</p><p>'We are focusing on three main initiatives: the tropical belt initiative, the climate justice forum, and the international climate change university,' Presidential Climate Change Advisor Ruwan Wijewardene told the Sunday Times.</p><p>Sri Lanka would launch the 'Climate Justice Forum' and the 'Tropical Belt Initiative' with a focus on the triple planetary crisis and continue to work on the Climate Change University at COP28 this year, he said. The International Climate University would also focus on more research on protecting the tropical belt and other climate initiatives.</p><p>Mr. Wijewardene noted that the Climate Prosperity Plan, which was launched at COP27 with the Maldives, would also come into play as it would list out green initiatives and projects for the global north to invest in tropical belt countries.</p><p>Explaining their interlinkage, Mr. Wijewardene noted that the Tropical Belt Initiative would be used to press developed countries to invest in more green initiatives like renewable energy and green technology for countries in the tropical belt. 'The tropical belt has the countries that are most vulnerable but are also struggling with poverty and are debt-ridden,' Mr. Wijewardene noted.</p><p>He added that this was where the Climate Justice Forum would help by seeking to reduce the debt burdens by appealing to the creditors of these countries to offset and cut part of the debt.</p><p>'We have taken leaps this time in terms of our representation at COP28,' Environment Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe told the Sunday Times yesterday as he delved into the inner workings that pushed for these focus initiatives in particular.</p><p>The question of responsibility in terms of mitigation, the reduction of greenhouse gases, and combating climate change has shifted from developed countries since the 1992 Earth Summit, which established the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, to all party countries thanks to the Paris Agreement.</p><p>'But different countries have responsibilities in different proportions, which still means developed countries have to take the lead in mitigation,' said Dr. Jasinghe, who held that the responsibility that developed countries accepted in 1992 was somewhat diluted in 2015.</p><p>Acknowledging that the battle for climate justice has been going on for decades in various forms, the Ministry Secretary noted that Sri Lanka was championing global solutions as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts.</p><p>The Paris Agreement clauses for the 'means of implementation' form the crux of climate action, according to Dr. Jasinghe. He noted that it essentially calls on developed countries to support developing countries in three areas: finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.</p><p>'This is also precisely what isn't being addressed adequately, and developing countries have been battling for it,' he said, noting that an agreement for a loss and damage fund, which was agreed on last year, took decades.</p><p>Sri Lanka's move for climate justice, however, will not take a confrontational approach. It is where the concept of the tropical belt comes in. The Ministry Secretary noted that the tropical belt, northwards and southwards from the equator, was rich in biodiversity and renewable energy, with biomass potential that was much higher in comparison to polar and subtropical regions. Some 134 out of the 198 UN countries were either fully or partially located in the tropical belt, and 40% of the landmass and the global population were concentrated in this belt too. 'This is also the area that has suffered the most historically in terms of pollution, climate events, and biodiversity loss. That is why they are considered vulnerable countries-90% of vulnerable countries are located in the tropical belt.'</p><p>Echoing Senior Advisor Wijewardene on the call for investments into green transitions in the tropical belt, Dr. Jasinghe noted that if developed countries start investing in these areas regardless of political affiliations and geopolitics, the whole world would benefit. 'The tropical belt is the natural shield for the globe.'</p><p>The Sri Lankan pavilion is set to host 25 side events at COP28, which will be attended by thousands of stakeholders, from state leaders to NGOs and the private sector.</p><p>With climate catastrophes exacerbating across the world and even here in Sri Lanka, each COP becomes more decisive than the next. The reverberating calls for fossil fuel phase-outs and just transitions from activists and scientists will be voiced out for the 28th year in a row; implementation and impact rest with those in the high-level negotiations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM2611202300105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69R5-NDC1-F00C-63G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 26, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Initiative &amp;

He told the 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dubai, UAE that such contentious issues should be tackled urgently, given the present climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlighting the challenges faced by developing countries, President Wickremesinghe said they faced a disproportionate vulnerability and impact due to lower adaptive capacities in Finance, Technology, and Climate investments. He cited the Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance, which has indicated the need for at least a US$ 1 trillion per annum to combat Climate Change.</p><p>The President said: \"The Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance highlighted that at least a trillion USD per annum is required to combat Climate Change. The Transitional Committee on the Operationalisation of Funding Arrangements in its Report on November 4, 2023 only calls for voluntary contributions to the \"Loss and Damage fund\". The Report makes no mention of the funds needed or who the contributors are. It is silent on the issue of global debt relief. These are interconnected.</p><p>\"Four days later, the Technical Dialogue of the First Global Stocktake highlighted the requirements of a minimum of US$ trillion per annum. To arrive at a consensus we need to take up this contentious issue. Who are we fooling?\".</p><p>President Wickremesinghe said Climate Justice must be accessible to all nations and proposed a resolution for a Climate Justice Forum. This forum, agreed upon at the 5th Forum of the Ministers of Environmental Authorities of Asia Pacific, aims to provide a platform for constructive and proactive engagements, with the proposal scheduled for the UN Environment Assembly on February 6, 2024. \"The Climate Justice Forum will provide us a platform for constructive and proactive engagements. The Secretary General of the UN said, \"The era of global boiling has arrived\". The enemy is at the gates. We are still procrastinating. We are still forming our battalions to take the fight to the enemy. Therefore, this fortnight is critical. It will determine whether we are capable of providing a leadership. Let us prove we can do so by action and delivery.\" The President called for immediate action to find effective solutions, thinking outside the box and investing in the Tropical Belt to tackle the Triple Planetary Crisis. The Tropical Belt, covering 134 countries and 44 percent of the Earth's surface, holds rich biodiversity and potential for renewable energy. President Wickremesinghe unveiled plans for a panel to report on the Tropical Belt Initiative, emphasizing its global impact. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), President Wickremesinghe said the health of the Indian Ocean was important in the context of Climate Change. He said a sustainable Blue Economy is essential to counter the adverse effects of rising sea levels, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and extreme weather patterns.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe outlined plans to set up the International Climate Change University (ICCU) for capacity building and advancing research, operationalising it next year. The ICCU aims to contribute significantly to global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The President said that Sri Lanka is committed to the 1.5 degree Celsius limit.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

As the technology progresses, there are emerging use cases for AI to enhance climate finance in terms of speed, efficiency, transparency, and equity. However, the potential role of AI for finance and risk management is complex and not without challenges, which need to be carefully considered before any large-scale implementation or the introduction of innovative applications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Data management and analytics</p><p>AI-driven solutions present significant opportunities to enhance processes and instruments related to climate finance, risk finance, and insurance. For example, AI can significantly improve the accuracy of climate change projections and climate risk assessments by analysing vast datasets on weather patterns, recorded impacts, and other relevant factors. By improving the precision of risk modelling, AI can inform financial instruments, ensure that they reflect ground realities, facilitate informed investment, and enhance the evidence-based design of relevant triggers and clauses in insurance or loan agreements.</p><p>However, it is important to note that an effective application of AI for data management and analytics is heavily dependent on the quality and availability of data and methodologies. In many cases, especially in developing countries, there is a lack of reliable, comprehensive, and/or centrally available data on climate risks, financial flows, and disaggregated household characteristics. Gaps in this regard might hinder the ability of AI to generate accurate predictions and assessments, potentially limiting its utility in these contexts.</p><p>Innovative financial tools and products</p><p>Beyond analysing and managing complex data patterns, AI can also directly aid in the development of innovative financial tools and products. For example, this could be customised insurance solutions that are tailored to the specific needs of individual households or small businesses with minimal transaction costs, bundled with advisory or risk management functions that not only provide a financial safety net but also help to minimise existing risks. Another potential solution could revolve around pricing and structuring green bonds or climate resilience bonds, which fund projects that have positive environmental outcomes or enhance climate resilience.</p><p>Personalised banking services; financial advisory; automated claims processing; dynamic pricing models; precision agriculture financing platforms; AI-guided ecosystem restoration funds; enhanced customer support; more accurate underwriting processes; smart microfinance products; or regulatory compliance monitoring are further examples of tools and products that can benefit from the ability of AI to customise user experiences, utilise a wider range of data points and formats, and process data quickly and efficiently with full-time availability.</p><p>Local-level access to finance</p><p>With the upcoming operationalisation of the Loss and Damage Fund under the UNFCCC and other global funds-such as the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environmental Facility, or the Adaptation Fund-, it is important to look at local-level access to finance and how global funds can directly connect to vulnerable communities on the ground. In this context, AI has the potential to enhance local-level access to financial resources for climate action by automating and streamlining the process of identifying, assessing, and funding projects. AI could reduce the barriers to entry for smaller projects and communities that traditionally lack access to finance, including those led by indigenous communities or small-scale farmers, and match them with appropriate funding sources based on their specific needs and impacts. To achieve this, it is essential to incorporate principles of equity and climate justice into AI-driven climate finance mechanisms. This involves designing AI systems that explicitly aim to address the disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalised communities and ensure that these communities have equitable access to finance. AI can aid in identifying the most vulnerable populations and the most effective interventions to support them, but this requires the integration of social and environmental justice considerations into AI models, as well as equitable access modalities that are usable by local-level stakeholders and available in local languages. Moreover, design and governance of AI for climate finance should be inclusive and based on multi-stakeholder engagement to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly and do not exacerbate existing inequalities.</p><p>Moving towards the future</p><p>Fully or partially AI-based solutions offer opportunities as well as challenges for the areas of climate finance, risk management, and insurance. It is important to facilitate an open conversation on aspects such as data availability, accessibility, interpretability, bias, transparency, equity, inclusivity, and climate justice as the field continues to evolve. Navigating the practical and ethical complexities of AI for climate finance will likely be a vital part of policymaking, planning, and research and development processes in the near future to ensure that the technology is used to its full potential and contributes towards achieving a sustainable, equitable, and climate-resilient future.</p><p>(The writer works as Director: Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn in as the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka. The people of Sri Lanka have vested in him the mandate to realize the people's aspirations for the future and to build a sustainable foundation for future generations.</p><p>H.E. President Dissanayake has outlined to the nation his determination to put in place a united Sri Lanka and a transformed ethical political culture. Echoing the wishes of the people, his future trajectory combines nation-building based on public trust in governance and in the political system through accountability, integrity and the elimination of waste and corruption.</p><p>In the words of His Excellency President Anura Kumara Dissanayake:</p><p>'We are launching ... a unified Sri Lankan nation that respects diversity, fully ending an era of division based on race, religion, caste and class ...'</p><p>In order to achieve these objectives, the Government has recognized that it is crucial to reinforce stability and confidence in the economy and stimulate growth. The Government will work within commitments to reach macro-economic stability through the framework of international financial institutions and in negotiations with sovereign and private external stakeholders.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the hardships that have been faced by the people in the process of economic transition. Measures will be put in place to generate greater resources for enhanced public expenditure and welfare to raise the living standards of the people, with equity and justice.</p><p>The recent vote for change by the people of Sri Lanka presents us with a renewed opportunity, and we are determined to succeed including with the support of our friends in the international community.</p><p>Moment of profound global crises</p><p>Despite our consensus on the Pact of the Future, this year's UNGA takes place at a moment of profound global crises on multiple fronts. In the Middle East, we are closer to wider regional conflagration than when we convened last week and the humanitarian suffering in Gaza gets worse by the day. The achievement of the SDGs now appears beyond our reach, and we are off target on the Paris Climate Goal to limit the temperature increase to 1.50C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Big power rivalries and geopolitical tensions have reignited and widened, and new rifts are appearing on North-South lines. Racism, intolerance, discrimination, and xenophobia against migrants are on the rise. Theatres of conflict and tension have opened up on land and in the oceans. The developments in the digital realm provides fertile ground for proliferation of disinformation and hate speech, with the potential for violence. The lingering impact of the pandemic have reverberated throughout the global economy, creating profound economic insecurities, threatening free trade and leading to protectionist barriers. We are spending more on weapons than ever before in the past and regrettably use of nuclear weapons is in mainstream discourse. New domains are being weaponised including outer-space and cyberspace, while the use of AI is challenging International Humanitarian Law in the battlefield.</p><p>Debt crisis of unprecedented proportions</p><p>Today, a large number of developing countries, including my own, face a debt crisis of unprecedented proportions. This debt distress severely impedes our ability to invest in sustainable development, as we are unable to meet these financial obligations while simultaneously investing in the future and well-being of our citizens. It is a fact that financing challenges remain at the heart of the Sustainable Development crisis. As per the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2024, the SDG financing gap is between USD 2.5-4.0 trillion.</p><p>Comprehensive reform of the global financial architecture</p><p>Given these immense challenges, the need for comprehensive reform of the global financial architecture has never been more pressing. The current international debt resolution framework has failed to respond adequately and efficiently to contemporary challenges. The global landscape has changed dramatically, with global debt, particularly in the developing world, increasingly controlled by international bond markets and non-Paris Club lenders. It is time that we review the architecture's traditional moorings; we must urgently reform this system to reflect the new economic landscape. It is necessary to find a more efficient, comprehensive, and equitable way to address debt. Other institutions of global governance that reflect the world of the past century need to be reformed to meet the challenges of the present and the future. The composition of the Security Council must be expanded to be representative of current global diversity and decision-making. In parallel, the role of the UN General Assembly, the most representative primary organ of the United Nations where all countries have an equal voice, must be strengthened and revitalised.</p><p>Global peace and security</p><p>Sri Lanka's commitment to maintaining global peace and security has been unwavering. We recognise that peacekeeping is one of the most effective tools available to the UN to help member states to manage the difficult phase of transitioning from conflict to peace. Sri Lanka has been contributing to UN Peacekeeping operations in some of its most hostile and demanding deployments. Over 23000 men and women from the Sri Lanka armed forces and Police have contributed to ensuring international peace and security under the UN banner over the past 6 decades and been commended for high calibre service.</p><p>Climate crisis</p><p>Beyond economic recovery, we face an even greater existential threat: the ongoing climate crisis, and the accompanying need for a just energy transition. Although our development trajectory has not contributed to climate degradation, Sri Lanka has taken concrete steps to address these challenges. We will increase our nation's forest coverage and increase renewable energy in our energy mix. It is time for developed countries to fulfill their obligations and assume their fair share of responsibilities under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. We need their support in mitigation and adaptation efforts, as well as compensation for loss and damage. Without a concerted international effort to bridge the climate financing gap, the burden of climate impacts will continue to fall most heavily on those least responsible for the crisis. Sri Lanka is committed to phase out coal by 2040 and reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. As a climate vulnerable country, Sri Lanka has been advocating for operationalisation of the Loss and Damage Fund and called for climate justice. There is an urgent need for increased climate financing, especially for vulnerable, developing nations like Sri Lanka.</p><p>Two other critical issues which are also relevant to Sri Lanka as an island nation were a part of the discourse during this year's High-Level Week. Sea level rise is an imminent reality affecting millions. While Sri Lanka has taken mitigation measures nationally, as included in the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change, it is through concerted international action that solutions can be implemented to halt the global warming that is the cause of sea level rise. Sri Lanka initiated the UNGA resolution on declaring 1 March as the World Sea Grass Day, to bring international attention and awareness on a small but significant aspect of universal importance of combating climate change. Sri Lanka has further been recognized for its contribution to mangrove regeneration programme as a 2024 World Restoration Flagship by the UN, under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.</p><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a critical public health issue the world over with bacterial resistance linked to around 5 million deaths worldwide annually. AMR, if not contained, has the potential to spiral into a development issue as well with life expectancies declining worldwide. We welcome the target of mobilizing $100 million through the Antimicrobial Resistance Multi-Partner Trust Fund to ensure that 60% of countries have funded action plans by 2030. However, international cooperation and sustainable financing must increase to meet this goal.</p><p>As we seek solutions to global challenges, we must harness the power of technology and innovation. Digital technologies and artificial intelligence offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate sustainable development. Sri Lanka aims for sustained growth by innovation and envisages an equitable digital transformation through the establishment of accessible digital public infrastructure. At the same time, we call for increased capacity building and technical assistance to bridge the global digital divide and empower all countries to leverage these tools for the betterment of their people.</p><p>This General Assembly's theme calls on us to leave no one behind and to act together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, 38% of our total population is youth, which is the most capable and dynamic resource that can contribute to our future development. Sri Lanka advocates for increased youth participation in decision-making processes. After all, the Declaration on Future Generations is theirs. Simultaneously, the new Sri Lanka will realise the aspirations of a just society with greater empowerment for women, who make up to 52% of our population.</p><p>Recognition of legitimate and inalienable right of Palestine people</p><p>As we look towards the future, we must also address one of the gravest injustices that this Assembly has inherited from the past. Sri Lanka has repeatedly voiced its concern over the dire humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We reiterate our support for the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestine people to statehood and join the call for a two-state solution, based on the 1967 borders, in line with all UN resolutions.</p><p>As a country that has suffered separatist terrorism for decades, we condemn the terrorist attacks in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. Sri Lanka calls for complete and unconditional lifting of all Unilateral Coercive Measures imposed against any country, as they hinder free trade, right to development and have unintended humanitarian consequences.</p><p>As an island country, we are concerned about the present environmental and geopolitical aspects relating to the oceans. We want our oceans to be free of rivalry, conflicts, and pollution, and to be able to sustainably manage our marine resources. The UNCLOS, with its cohesive and universal nature, provides us with a say in shaping the global maritime system. Sri Lanka remains committed to the balance and collaboration embedded within the Treaty, enabling freedom of navigation and sustainable use of the oceans, respecting the sovereignty of the coastal states.</p><p>We must recognise that global challenges demand global solutions. In our interconnected world, no country can solve these complex problems in isolation. We must strengthen our international institutions, enhance knowledge sharing, and foster stronger relationships. We must work together equitably, ensuring all voices are heard in shaping our shared future. It is encouraging that several developing countries are on the cusp of becoming the leading economies tomorrow. We must bolster South-South Cooperation, to foster economic growth, social progress, and sustainable development among us. However, South-South Cooperation is not a substitute for the responsibilities of the global North as set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement.</p><p>In conclusion, as Sri Lanka embarks on a path of national unity, ethical governance and economic recovery and growth with justice and equity under new leadership, we reiterate our commitment to multilateral cooperation in pursuit of peace, prosperity, and sustainability. We must harness the power of international solidarity to confront the interconnected challenges before us as well as to explore durable solutions for the generations to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT04102024000010001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D3Y-CSS1-JCH9-G0VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2143\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 4, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

He referenced the alarming findings of the UNEP Report of 2023, titled \"Broken Promises,\" which warns of a 3-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by the end of the century.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlighting the challenges faced by developing countries, President Wickremesinghe stressed the disproportionate vulnerability and impact due to lower adaptive capacities in Finance, Technology, and Climate investments. He cited the Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance, which underscored the need for at least a US$ Trillion per annum to combat climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The President commended the Government of the United Arab Emirates for hosting the crucial event and expressed gratitude for their warm hospitality</p><p>Expressing concern about the lack of concrete measures in the Transitional Committee's report on funding arrangements, the President called for a more transparent approach, particularly addressing issues of global debt relief. He questioned the wisdom of avoiding contentious issues, emphasizing the urgency of the climate crisis.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe advocated for climate justice accessible to all nations and proposed a resolution for a Climate Justice Forum. This forum, agreed upon at the 5th Forum of the Ministers of Environmental Authorities of Asia Pacific, aims to provide a platform for constructive and proactive engagements, with the proposal scheduled for the UN Environment Assembly on 6th February 2024.</p><p>Underlining the critical nature of the current period, the President urged immediate action to find effective solutions, thinking outside the box and investing in the Tropical Belt to tackle the Triple Planetary Crisis. The Tropical Belt, covering 134 countries and 44% of the Earth's surface, holds rich biodiversity and potential for renewable energy. President Wickremesinghe announced plans for a panel to report on the Tropical Belt Initiative, emphasizing its global impact.</p><p>As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), President Wickremesinghe linked the health of the Indian Ocean to climate change. He stressed the need for a sustainable Blue Economy to counter the adverse effects of rising sea levels, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and extreme weather patterns.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe also revealed plans to establish the International Climate Change University (ICCU) for capacity building and advancing research, operationalizing it next year. The ICCU aims to contribute significantly to global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>In conclusion, President Wickremesinghe's address at COP28 outlined a comprehensive approach, blending regional initiatives like the Tropical Belt and the Indian Ocean with global measures, reflecting Sri Lanka's commitment to climate action and leadership on the international stage.</p><p>&amp;#8205;</p><p>The speech made by the President at the World Leaders Summit of the COP28 is follows;</p><p>\"Chairperson, Excellencies, Esteemed Delegates, At the outset let me congratulate his highness and the Government of the United Arab Emirates for hosting COP28 and extend to you my gratitude for your warm hospitality.</p><p>The UNEP Report of 2023 \"Broken Promises\" warned that we are facing a 3 degree Celcius increase in global temperatures by the end of the century. It is we; the developing countries are both disproportionately vulnerable and disproportionately impacted due to their lower adaptive capacity when it comes to investments in Finance, Technology and Climate.</p><p>The Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance highlighted that at least a Trillion USD per annum is required to combat climate change. The Transitional Committee on the Operationalization of Funding Arrangements in its Report of 4th November 2023 only calls for voluntary contributions to the \"Loss and Damage fund\". The Report makes no mention of the funds needed or who the contributors are. It is silent on the issue of global debt relief. These are interconnected'</p><p>Nevertheless, four days later, the Technical Dialogue of the First Global Stocktake highlighted the requirements of a minimum of US$ trillion per annum. To arrive at a consensus not to take up a contentious issue is not a solution. Who are we fooling?</p><p>Climate justice must be available to all the people and all the countries. In this background, Sri Lanka will propose a resolution for a Climate Justice Forum which was agreed upon at the 5th Forum of the Ministers of Environmental Authorities of Asia Pacific to be moved at the UN Environment Assembly of 6th February 2024.</p><p>The Climate Justice Forum will provide us a platform for constructive and proactive engagements. The Secretary General of the UN highlighted, \"The era of global boiling has arrived\". The enemy is at the gates. We are still procrastinating. We are still forming our battalions to take the fight to the enemy. Therefore, this fortnight is critical.</p><p>It will determine whether we are capable of providing a leadership. Let us prove we can do so by action and delivery.</p><p>Sri Lanka is committed to the 1.5 degree Celcius limit. We are facing a drastic situation to await the disaster. We must think outside of the box. We must Invest in the Tropical Belt to tackle the Triple Planetary Crisis.</p><p>The Tropical Belt constitutes 134 countries covering 44% of earth's surface, and will by 2030s be home to roughly 50% of world's population. Most of the world's remaining primary forests are tropical, along with its coral reef systems. The rich biodiversity of the Tropical Belt enhances biological carbon sequestration and can shield the world from instabilities in weather.</p><p>Furthermore, the energy generation potential from solar, wind and biomass are significantly higher in the tropics than that of other areas on the earth. Yet, anthropogenic activities in the Tropical Belt can easily lead to an imbalance in the equilibrium of this region.</p><p>So much so that some scientists predict that the Tropical Rain Belt could shift away from the Equator by the 22nd Century. Large scale investments in Renewable Energy, Pollution Control and Nature-based Solutions will lead to significant transformative changes in the entire world by enhancing carbon sequestration.</p><p>Therefore, Sri Lanka and other concerned countries will convene a panel to report on the Tropical Belt Initiative. A multi sector plan distributed not only among the whole tropical region but the whole world. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change.</p><p>A healthy ocean generates oxygen and absorbs the carbon and heat produced from global warming. Mangroves and sea grasses sink more carbon than land forests. However, the rapid climate change is altering the marine environment with rising sea levels and temperatures, Ocean acidification, coral bleaching, habitat destruction and extreme weather patterns. These phenomenon have a direct impact on human lives by disrupting ocean biodiversity, the Ocean dependent food patterns, and coastal livelihoods. Member states and partners of IORA will work towards ensuring a sustainable, Indian Ocean for future generations.</p><p>The Tropical Belt initiative and the Indian Ocean IORA program combined will form the largest global sink for carbon sequestration. Addressing the climate change need, up to date scientific knowledge, and the effective use of these findings</p><p>Therefore, at COP27, I proposed to establish an International Climate Change University (ICCU) for capacity building and advancing research, necessary to contribute to the crucial efforts to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We will be operationalizing the International Climate Change University (ICCU) next year.</p><p>Ministers Mr. Ali Sabry, Mr. Keheliya Rambukwella, Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, and Member of Parliament Mr. Madhura Withana represented the government, while Members of Parliament Mr. Champika Ranawaka and Mr. Ajith Mannapperuma represented the Opposition.

The President envisions three key focal points: the launch of the Climate Justice Forum, the Tropical Belt Initiative and the establishment of a Climate Change University.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a visionary move initiated by President Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka is set to launch the Climate Justice Forum during the upcoming COP 28 Conference in Dubai, scheduled from 30 November to 12 December.</p><p>The President, accompanied by three ministers and two opposition MPs, along with 20 young participants passionate about environmental concerns, will engage in this pivotal conference in Dubai. The primary objective is to harness support and collaboration from countries in the Tropical Belt to influence policy-making decisions on a global scale.</p><p>Addressing the special press briefing on COP 28 participation yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry said that President Wickremesinghe's concept behind the Climate Justice Forum aims to address the pressing issue of climate change and exert influence, particularly on the Global North. Sri Lanka, recognising the critical role it plays in the fight against climate change, seeks to actively engage with the international community to garner support for its ground-breaking initiatives.</p><p>Among the key agendas to be presented and discussed during the COP 28 Conference are Sri Lanka's recently introduced roadmaps on Green Hydrogen and Sustainable Energy. The country is also seeking endorsement for the establishment of a Climate Change University, signalling its commitment to fostering education and research in sustainable practices.</p><p>Climate change has emerged as one of the most crucial challenges in the world, and Sri Lanka, like many other nations, is making determined efforts to contribute to global mitigation strategies. Minister Ali Sabry emphasised the tangible impact of climate change and underscored the imperative for global cooperation. He highlighted the critical role of the United NationsClimate Change Conference, held annually since the pre-industrial revolution era, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees \u00b0C.</p><p>A noteworthy aspect of Sri Lanka's approach is recognising the plight of the approximately 136 countries within the tropical belt, which bear the brunt of the adverse impacts of climate change. By championing initiatives like the Climate Justice Forum, Sri Lanka seeks to unite nations facing similar challenges and collectively address the urgent need for climate action.</p><p>Drawing attention to the vulnerability of tropical countries, which are housing 40% of the global population, faces disproportionate environmental consequences. The Minister stressed the importance of concerted efforts in addressing climate challenges. The minister articulated Sri Lanka's proactive stance at the conference, advocating for principled decisions to combat environmental pollution and promote transformative initiatives.</p><p>Additionally, in line with the President's guidance, Sri Lanka proposes the establishment of an international university dedicated to climate change, emphasising the need for rigorous scientific study in this domain, as well as securing international investments to mitigate climate change. Several tropical belt nations have expressed their willingness to support this initiative.</p><p>Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella highlighted the evolving landscape of environmental discussions in the contemporary world, where economic and security concerns often take precedence. He emphasised the growing importance of environmental issues, signalling a shift in global priorities.</p><p>In today's discourse, the Minister underscored that environmental considerations have gained prominence, recognising the critical role they play in shaping the world. The Minister acknowledged that the primary cause of environmental damage lies in the historical neglect of ecological concerns. The Minister expressed concern about the immeasurable environmental harm caused by human activities, particularly during the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Reflecting on the international commitments made in 2015, Minister Rambukwella noted the gap between these agreements and their practical implementation on the ground. He highlighted the significant pressure faced by tropical countries, attributing it to the actions of developed nations. Notably, this year's conference assumes heightened significance within the United Nations framework, given the urgency to establish a robust foundation for addressing environmental challenges and preventing further damage.</p><p>Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, emphasised the pivotal role of this year's conference in advancing Sri Lanka's renewable energy agenda. He highlighted the significance of the opportunity to generate electricity through sustainable resources, emphasising that plans for this initiative were presented last year.</p><p>He noted the findings of survey reports by global institutions, such as the World Bank and development agencies, indicating the substantial potential for electricity generation to meet both national and regional needs. Drawing attention to the recently unveiled green hydrogen roadmap of Sri Lanka, he outlined the strategy to leverage offshore renewable potential in the Northern Province.</p><p>Expressing the challenges in securing financial support for energy projects in Sri Lanka, the Minister stressed the importance of obtaining technical and financial assistance, especially from international organisations. He underscored the uniqueness of this year's conference, providing a dedicated platform for Sri Lanka to engage with local and foreign organisations and make crucial decisions.</p><p>Minister Wijesekera outlined the country's commitment to obtaining 70% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, with a focus on excluding fossil fuels. He called for the support of state leaders in achieving this ambitious target, highlighting the need for financial backing.

ALI SABRY</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, Nov. 30 -- The Government of Sri Lanka:News issued the following news release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">20 youth representatives, private sector corporates in the energy and environmental sectors, with a media team, will participate at no cost to the government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the world gears up for COP 28, President Ranil Wickremesinghe is spearheading Sri Lanka's delegation, to the Conference, which is set to tackle pressing climate change issues and to address critical decisions. The Conference will convene world leaders, public-private representatives, environmentalists, and scholars. The President envisions three key focal points: the launch of the Climate Justice Forum, the Tropical Belt Initiative and the establishment of a Climate Change University.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a visionary move initiated by President Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka is set to launch the Climate Justice Forum during the upcoming COP 28 Conference in Dubai, scheduled from November 30 to December 12. The President, accompanied by 03 ministers and 02 opposition MPs, along with twenty young participants passionate about environmental concerns, will engage in this pivotal conference in Dubai. The primary objective is to harness support and collaboration from countries in the Tropical Belt to influence policy-making decisions on a global scale.</p><p>Addressing the special press briefing on COP 28 participation yesterday morning (29) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Ali Sabry said that President Wickremesinghe's concept behind the Climate Justice Forum aims to address the pressing issue of climate change and exert influence, particularly on the Global North. Sri Lanka, recognizing the critical role it plays in the fight against climate change, seeks to actively engage with the international community to garner support for its ground-breaking initiatives.</p><p>Among the key agendas to be presented and discussed during the COP 28 Conference are Sri Lanka's recently introduced roadmaps on Green Hydrogen and Sustainable Energy. The country is also seeking endorsement for the establishment of a Climate Change University, signalling its commitment to fostering education and research in sustainable practices.</p><p>Climate change has emerged as one of the most crucial challenges in the world, and Sri Lanka, like many other nations, is making determined efforts to contribute to global mitigation strategies. Minister Ali Sabry, emphasized the tangible impact of climate change and underscored the imperative for global cooperation. He highlighted the critical role of the United NationsClimate Change Conference, held annually since the pre-industrial revolution era, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees degC.</p><p>A noteworthy aspect of Sri Lanka's approach is recognizing the plight of the approximately 136 countries within the tropical belt, which bear the brunt of the adverse impacts of climate change. By championing initiatives like the Climate Justice Forum, Sri Lanka seeks to unite nations facing similar challenges and collectively address the urgent need for climate action.</p><p>Drawing attention to the vulnerability of tropical countries, which are housing 40% of the global population, faces disproportionate environmental consequences. The Minister stressed the importance of concerted efforts in addressing climate challenges. The minister articulated Sri Lanka's proactive stance at the conference, advocating for principled decisions to combat environmental pollution and promote transformative initiatives.</p><p>Additionally, in line with the President's guidance, Sri Lanka proposes the establishment of an international university dedicated to climate change, emphasizing the need for rigorous scientific study in this domain, as well as securing international investments to mitigate climate change. Several tropical belt nations have expressed their willingness to support this initiative.</p><p>Meanwhile speaking at the Press Briefing, Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella highlighted the evolving landscape of environmental discussions in the contemporary world, where economic and security concerns often take precedence. He emphasized the growing importance of environmental issues, signalling a shift in global priorities.</p><p>In today's discourse, the Minister underscored that environmental considerations have gained prominence, recognizing the critical role they play in shaping the world. The Minister acknowledged that the primary cause of environmental damage lies in the historical neglect of ecological concerns. The Minister expressed concern about the immeasurable environmental harm caused by human activities, particularly during the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Reflecting on the international commitments made in 2015, Minister Rambukwella noted the gap between these agreements and their practical implementation on the ground. He highlighted the significant pressure faced by tropical countries, attributing it to the actions of developed nations. Notably, this year's conference assumes heightened significance within the United Nations framework, given the urgency to establish a robust foundation for addressing environmental challenges and preventing further damage.</p><p>Minister of Power and Energy, Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, emphasized the pivotal role of this year's conference in advancing Sri Lanka's renewable energy agenda. He highlighted the significance of the opportunity to generate electricity through sustainable resources, emphasizing that plans for this initiative were presented last year.</p><p>Minister Wijesekera noted the findings of survey reports by global institutions, such as the World Bank and development agencies, indicating the substantial potential for electricity generation to meet both national and regional needs. Drawing attention to the recently unveiled green hydrogen roadmap of Sri Lanka, he outlined the strategy to leverage offshore renewable potential in the Northern Province.</p><p>Expressing the challenges in securing financial support for energy projects in Sri Lanka, the Minister stressed the importance of obtaining technical and financial assistance, especially from international organizations. He underscored the uniqueness of this year's conference, providing a dedicated platform for Sri Lanka to engage with local and foreign organizations and make crucial decisions.</p><p>Minister Wijesekera outlined the country's commitment to obtaining 70% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, with a focus on excluding fossil fuels. He called for the support of state leaders in achieving this ambitious target, highlighting the need for financial backing. The Minister estimated a requirement of at least US $12 billion by 2030 for the successful implementation of renewable energy projects and expressed confidence that the conference would serve as a crucial platform for addressing these financial considerations.</p><p>Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene, Senior Presidential Adviser on Climate Change, underscored the global significance of the upcoming conference, labelling it as one of the most crucial gatherings in the world. He highlighted the participation of government leaders from influential nations, major corporations, and religious leaders, making it an ideal platform to address the impacts of climate change and seek necessary solutions.</p><p>Drawing attention to the economic consequences of climate change for Sri Lanka, Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene noted the substantial annual financial losses incurred by the country. Referring to insights from World Bank experts, he emphasized that, by the year 2050, Sri Lanka is projected to face a loss of 1.2% of its gross domestic income due to climate-related issues. In this context, he advocated for leveraging the conference as an opportunity to devise strategies to minimize these losses and address the challenges posed by climate change.</p><p>Mr. Pasindu Gunaratne, Chairman of the National Youth Service Council, emphasized the need to scrutinize the environmental degradation caused by human activities. He highlighted a significant milestone for Sri Lanka, with a delegation of young representatives, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, participating in the conference. Acknowledging their active role in contributing to climate change initiatives in the country, Gunaratne mentioned that, under the guidance of the National Youth Service Council, numerous programs have been initiated to educate the youth about climate change, in collaboration with organizations such as UNICEF and the British Council.</p><p>Mr. Gunaratne emphasized that the young representatives have not utilized any government funds for their participation in the conference. He described them as a dedicated group committed to finding solutions to Sri Lanka's climate change challenges. Sri Lanka currently ranks 30th globally for climate change, and Mr. Gunaratne stressed the collective responsibility to prevent future generations from becoming \"climate orphans\" unaware of the impending dangers.</p><p>Sri Lanka takes pride in submitting a substantial number of proposals to this year's conference, underlining the commitment to translate proposals into actionable initiatives on the ground and, for the first time, will showcase its own platform, signalling the nation's commitment to global climate action.</p><p>PMD For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htlive.com\">contentservices@htlive.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SRLKGV-NSLPR4623589</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SRLKGV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69S2-CX51-F12F-F00X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377133</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1570\"/><timeReceived>11:31 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 HT Media Limited.

The Conference will convene world leaders, public-private representatives, environmentalists, and scholars. The President envisions three key focal points: the launch of the Climate Justice Forum, the Tropical Belt Initiative and the establishment of a Climate Change University.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a visionary move initiated by President Wickremesinghe, Sri Lanka is set to launch the Climate Justice Forum during the upcoming COP 28 Conference in Dubai, scheduled from November 30 to December 12. The President, accompanied by 03 ministers and 02 opposition MPs, along with twenty young participants passionate about environmental concerns, will engage in this pivotal conference in Dubai. The primary objective is to harness support and collaboration from countries in the Tropical Belt to influence policy-making decisions on a global scale.</p><p>Addressing the special press briefing on COP 28 participation this morning (29) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Ali Sabry said that President Wickremesinghe's concept behind the Climate Justice Forum aims to address the pressing issue of climate change and exert influence, particularly on the Global North. Sri Lanka, recognizing the critical role it plays in the fight against climate change, seeks to actively engage with the international community to garner support for its ground-breaking initiatives.</p><p>Among the key agendas to be presented and discussed during the COP 28 Conference are Sri Lanka's recently introduced roadmaps on Green Hydrogen and Sustainable Energy. The country is also seeking endorsement for the establishment of a Climate Change University, signalling its commitment to fostering education and research in sustainable practices.</p><p>Climate change has emerged as one of the most crucial challenges in the world, and Sri Lanka, like many other nations, is making determined efforts to contribute to global mitigation strategies. Minister Ali Sabry, emphasized the tangible impact of climate change and underscored the imperative for global cooperation. He highlighted the critical role of the United NationsClimate Change Conference, held annually since the pre-industrial revolution era, with a focus on reducing carbon emissions to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees degC.</p><p>A noteworthy aspect of Sri Lanka's approach is recognizing the plight of the approximately 136 countries within the tropical belt, which bear the brunt of the adverse impacts of climate change. By championing initiatives like the Climate Justice Forum, Sri Lanka seeks to unite nations facing similar challenges and collectively address the urgent need for climate action.</p><p>Drawing attention to the vulnerability of tropical countries, which are housing 40% of the global population, faces disproportionate environmental consequences. The Minister stressed the importance of concerted efforts in addressing climate challenges. The minister articulated Sri Lanka's proactive stance at the conference, advocating for principled decisions to combat environmental pollution and promote transformative initiatives.</p><p>Additionally, in line with the President's guidance, Sri Lanka proposes the establishment of an international university dedicated to climate change, emphasizing the need for rigorous scientific study in this domain, as well as securing international investments to mitigate climate change. Several tropical belt nations have expressed their willingness to support this initiative.</p><p>Meanwhile speaking at the Press Briefing, Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella highlighted the evolving landscape of environmental discussions in the contemporary world, where economic and security concerns often take precedence. He emphasized the growing importance of environmental issues, signalling a shift in global priorities.</p><p>In today's discourse, the Minister underscored that environmental considerations have gained prominence, recognizing the critical role they play in shaping the world. The Minister acknowledged that the primary cause of environmental damage lies in the historical neglect of ecological concerns. The Minister expressed concern about the immeasurable environmental harm caused by human activities, particularly during the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Reflecting on the international commitments made in 2015, Minister Rambukwella noted the gap between these agreements and their practical implementation on the ground. He highlighted the significant pressure faced by tropical countries, attributing it to the actions of developed nations. Notably, this year's conference assumes heightened significance within the United Nations framework, given the urgency to establish a robust foundation for addressing environmental challenges and preventing further damage.</p><p>Minister of Power and Energy, Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, emphasized the pivotal role of this year's conference in advancing Sri Lanka's renewable energy agenda. He highlighted the significance of the opportunity to generate electricity through sustainable resources, emphasizing that plans for this initiative were presented last year.</p><p>Minister Wijesekera noted the findings of survey reports by global institutions, such as the World Bank and development agencies, indicating the substantial potential for electricity generation to meet both national and regional needs. Drawing attention to the recently unveiled green hydrogen roadmap of Sri Lanka, he outlined the strategy to leverage offshore renewable potential in the Northern Province.</p><p>Expressing the challenges in securing financial support for energy projects in Sri Lanka, the Minister stressed the importance of obtaining technical and financial assistance, especially from international organizations. He underscored the uniqueness of this year's conference, providing a dedicated platform for Sri Lanka to engage with local and foreign organizations and make crucial decisions.</p><p>Minister Wijesekera outlined the country's commitment to obtaining 70% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, with a focus on excluding fossil fuels. He called for the support of state leaders in achieving this ambitious target, highlighting the need for financial backing. The Minister estimated a requirement of at least US $12 billion by 2030 for the successful implementation of renewable energy projects and expressed confidence that the conference would serve as a crucial platform for addressing these financial considerations.</p><p>Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene, Senior Presidential Adviser on Climate Change, underscored the global significance of the upcoming conference, labelling it as one of the most crucial gatherings in the world. He highlighted the participation of government leaders from influential nations, major corporations, and religious leaders, making it an ideal platform to address the impacts of climate change and seek necessary solutions.</p><p>Drawing attention to the economic consequences of climate change for Sri Lanka, Mr. Ruwan Wijewardene noted the substantial annual financial losses incurred by the country. Referring to insights from World Bank experts, he emphasized that, by the year 2050, Sri Lanka is projected to face a loss of 1.2% of its gross domestic income due to climate-related issues. In this context, he advocated for leveraging the conference as an opportunity to devise strategies to minimize these losses and address the challenges posed by climate change.</p><p>Mr. Pasindu Gunaratne, Chairman of the National Youth Service Council, emphasized the need to scrutinize the environmental degradation caused by human activities. He highlighted a significant milestone for Sri Lanka, with a delegation of young representatives, led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, participating in the conference. Acknowledging their active role in contributing to climate change initiatives in the country, Gunaratne mentioned that, under the guidance of the National Youth Service Council, numerous programs have been initiated to educate the youth about climate change, in collaboration with organizations such as UNICEF and the British Council.</p><p>Mr. Gunaratne emphasized that the young representatives have not utilized any government funds for their participation in the conference. He described them as a dedicated group committed to finding solutions to Sri Lanka's climate change challenges. Sri Lanka currently ranks 30th globally for climate change, and Mr. Gunaratne stressed the collective responsibility to prevent future generations from becoming \"climate orphans\" unaware of the impending dangers.</p><p>Sri Lanka takes pride in submitting a substantial number of proposals to this year's conference, underlining the commitment to translate proposals into actionable initiatives on the ground and, for the first time, will showcase its own platform, signalling the nation's commitment to global climate action.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hiru News.

There is an urgent need to scale up finance for addressing climate impacts and supporting those who are on the frontlines, especially in climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this context, the loss and damage fund established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in late 2022 could play a pivotal role. The fund is meant to provide finance to nations grappling with the adverse impacts of climate change and address the existing financial gaps for building long-term climate resilience. After the 27th meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP27), the fund is currently being operationalised through the work of a Transitional Committee, which has met four times throughout 2023 to lay the groundwork for a decision at COP28 in November/December this year.</p><p>Financing loss and damage</p><p>The term 'loss and damage' (L and D) covers those climate impacts that go beyond the limits of adaptation and cannot be (or have not been) averted through emission reduction or adaptation efforts. Addressing such impacts requires a multi-faceted approach that combines finance as well as other means of implementation, such as technology and institutional capacity-building. Finance is the linchpin that enables the implementation of concrete measures to address L and D, including early warning systems, climate insurance, risk pooling, resilient infrastructure, relief, rehabilitation, and recovery.</p><p>Establishing a dedicated global fund for L and D presents an important milestone in supporting vulnerable countries and providing them with the necessary funding to engage in these actions. However, the fund needs to navigate the complex terrain of climate-induced challenges, ranging from infrastructural damage to livelihood disruptions, as well as challenges related to its operationalisation and finding agreement between developed and developing countries.</p><p>The basic building blocks of a loss and damage fund consist of its sources of funding; its organisational structure and secretariat; the scope and modalities of funding, including potential funding windows or categories; eligibility to receive funding; approaches to addressing different kinds of L and D; international cooperation; and reporting and oversight mechanisms to ensure the transparent, equitable, and accountable operation of the fund.</p><p>While adequate capitalisation and sustained funding are essential to ensure that the fund can provide meaningful support, there are also other important considerations as well. These include, for example, climate justice and inclusive processes; the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, which is embedded in the UNFCCC to acknowledge the different capabilities and responsibilities of individual countries for climate action; and ensuring that cross-cutting vulnerabilities and aspects are acknowledged and addressed, such as gender, youth, Indigenous peoples, and particularly vulnerable countries.</p><p>The meetings of the Transitional Committee have provided a space for countries to discuss these questions and find alignment that could lead towards a decision at COP28. As mandated during COP27, the Transitional Committee has been established to provide recommendations on the fund's building blocks and operationalisation, including its place within the wider global financial architecture and the mobilisation of new and innovative sources of funding.</p><p>COP28 as a milestone for loss and damage finance</p><p>From 30 November till 12 December 2023, the parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement will meet in Dubai for the annual global climate change conference and climate negotiations. As in COP27 last year, L and D will be high on the agenda, with multiple workstreams that are relevant to this thematic area: the L and D fund, the Santiago Network, the Warsaw International Mechanism, and the Global Stocktake, among others.</p><p>For the L and D fund, the recommendations of the transitional committee will be considered for adoption when parties formulate a decision on L and D finance and funding arrangements. COP28 presents an opportunity to reflect, refine, and ratify the operational modalities of the fund, as well as to ensure that it adheres to key principles of climate justice and inclusiveness. Moreover, the conference also provides a platform for vulnerable countries to articulate their needs and for the global community to reaffirm its commitment to provide tangible support.</p><p>The discussion around L and D consists of a multitude of different aspects and focus areas, including climate justice, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and global cooperation. Without adequate financial resources, climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka may struggle to effectively address climate-induced L and D. Financial support from the international community, including through a loss and damage fund under the UNFCCC, is crucial to enable comprehensive action, build long-term resilience, and support sustainable development in the face of climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2810202300001003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69H6-BPT1-F00C-635V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 28, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000632</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But how should marine resources be properly managed? The blue economy is the umbrella term that looks at the planet's oceans from an economic perspective and refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of ocean ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On one side of the coin are the exploitative activities and economic sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, maritime transport, tourism, offshore renewable energy like wind and tidal power, and biotechnology. On the other side are marine conservation efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global platforms like the United Nations, the World Bank, the European Commission, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Center for the Blue Economy have called for oceanic sustainability efforts.</p><p>In March 2024, the United Nations Environmental Assembly adopted a resolution on 'strengthening ocean efforts to tackle climate change, marine biodiversity loss and pollution.' A press release issued by the European Commission after the session stated, 'By submitting and negotiating the resolution, the European Union and its Member States reiterated their determination to play a leading role in protecting, conserving, restoring, and sustainably utilizing the world's oceans.'</p><p>The concept of the blue economy is rooted in the recognition that the oceans are vital to human well-being and the global economy. Still, they are also threatened by overexploitation, pollution, and climate change. Therefore, the blue economy seeks to balance economic development with the need to protect and restore the ocean environment, ensuring that future generations can enjoy marine resources.</p><p>Fundamental principles of the blue economy include:</p><p>Sustainability: Ensuring ocean-related activities do not deplete resources or harm the environment.</p><p>Inclusive Growth: Promoting economic activities that benefit local communities and alleviate poverty.</p><p>Innovation: Encouraging the development of new technologies and practices that enhance productivity and sustainability in using ocean resources.</p><p>Governance: Implementing effective policies, regulations, and international cooperation to manage ocean resources responsibly.</p><p>The blue economy is increasingly seen as a crucial component of global efforts to achieve sustainable development and address climate change, particularly in coastal and island nations heavily dependent on marine resources.</p><p>Challenges in Defining the Blue Economy</p><p>There is no consensus on the definition of 'blue economy.' The term generally refers to the purportedly 'sustainable' economic activities associated with oceans, seas, and coastal waters. Yet, that's where consensus on the concept breaks down. The blue economy requires a clear, widely agreed-upon definition before it can be applied appropriately.</p><p>The World Bank defines the blue economy as the 'sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health.' The European Commission defines it as '[a]ll economic activities related to oceans, seas, and coasts. [It] covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors.'</p><p>According to the United Nations, the blue economy 'comprises a range of economic sectors and related policies that together determine whether the use of ocean resources is sustainable' while emphasizing the need to protect life below the water. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that the blue economy applies to industries with 'a direct or indirect link to the ocean, such as marine energy, ports, shipping, coastal protection, and seafood production.' The World Wildlife Fund acknowledges that there is no widely accepted definition.</p><p>Defining the blue economy is much more than semantics. Some people mistakenly believe that it has been intended to benefit capitalism. This is a widespread phenomenon and is not just limited to corporations. In some ways, it is similar to the misconceptions that arose from using the term green economy.</p><p>People who live far from the ocean may not fully grasp how much humans rely on the ocean for survival, including regulating climate, providing food sources, and generating oxygen, even if they don't directly access it for daily needs. This can lead to a view of the blue economy as simply supporting coastal transportation, recreational activities, or ecotourism. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states, 'Approximately half a billion people globally depend on coral reef ecosystems for food, coastal protection, and income from tourism and fisheries.' And yet, coral reefs are dying at an alarming rate due to ocean acidification fueled by the climate crisis. They are also being destroyed by harmful coastal development-development that could be part of the blue economy.</p><p>Development or Destruction?</p><p>The United Nations affirmed that the blue economy would assist in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals-especially Goal 14, 'Life Below Water.' This triggered a rapid expansion across all facets of the blue economy, with projections suggesting this trend would persist.</p><p>Marine economic activities include fisheries, aquaculture, maritime transport, coastal renewable energy, seabed mining, bioprospecting, marine biotechnology, and waterborne tourism. These activities harm marine health to some degree and contribute to many problems, including biodiversity erosion, ocean acidification, climate change, water and air pollution, and even noise pollution that threatens marine life, including whales and dolphins.</p><p>The corporate extractive sector, in particular, has been looking for new territories to extract minerals such as manganese, cobalt, copper, nickel, and rare earth elements. This has become increasingly problematic due to the risks involved in resource extraction. Though the ocean may seem like an unlimited expanse that profiteers exploit purely for financial gain, it has natural limits.</p><p>'[A]lthough scientists and campaigners have been warning of the consequences of our rampant exploitation for decades, time is now running out to protect our oceans,' Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana in the UK, and Callum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation at the Center for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter, wrote in EuroNews in November 2023. 'We like to think of our ocean as infinite, but the truth is, it cannot stand this industrial-scale exploitation.'</p><p>The Earth's marine ecosystems are extremely valuable to the global economy. They deliver essential ecosystem services to life on the planet and provide sustenance for billions of people. More than 3 billion individuals depend on the ocean for their livelihoods. Most live in developing nations; humans and countless other species rely on healthy, thriving oceans.</p><p>Bluewashing: Covering Up Bad Behavior</p><p>Terminologies such as 'green economy' and 'blue economy' might seem promising but are often noted as cover-ups for harmful activities. '[T]he blue economy is not a benign concept offering a win-win for the economy and the environment,' said John Childs, a senior lecturer at the Lancaster Environment Center at Lancaster University, United Kingdom, and the co-editor of a special section in the Journal of Political Ecology that presented several papers on the blue economy.</p><p>Childs said the papers he reviewed suggest that the blue economy is 'another capitalist fix in which global capital is seeking to reproduce itself, to keep making money and create a surplus. This is happening as we get to the point where much of the planet's landmass [has] been appropriated.'</p><p>'If 'greenwashing' is the practice of making unsubstantiated or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of an action, then perhaps we need a new term-'bluewashing'-to cover coastal and marine development initiatives which fail to deliver on their environmental and social promises,' wrote Nicole Leotaud, the executive director of the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute, in 2017. 'Personally, I'm tired of labels that confuse and mask the development principles we are seeking,' she added.</p><p>Threats to the Marine Ecosystem</p><p>Some protections benefit the oceans, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), established in 1982 to provide an international legal framework for using and protecting the marine environment. However, not all nations agree to these protections. Additionally, ocean-bordering countries have their own laws, creating a patchwork of often poorly enforced rules. Contested waters regularly result in tumultuous situations.</p><p>Many maritime crimes negatively impact oceanic health, such as illegal fishing or harvesting, ocean dumping, and polluting. In addition to overfishing, where necessary species are removed from the food chain, and accelerating biodiversity loss, unsustainable industrial development along coastlines has also contributed to ocean pollution. 'All of these threats erode the capacity of the ocean to provide nutritious food, jobs, medicines, and pharmaceuticals as well as regulate the climate,' stated a 2020 article in the journal Nature. 'Women, poor people, Indigenous communities, and young people are most affected.'</p><p>Climate change is another serious threat to our oceans. '[I]ncreasing sea levels and making the ocean warmer, more acidic, and depleted in oxygen,' the Nature article pointed out. The ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of excess gas trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, but that is only a portion of the damage. 'Unsustainable development along coastlines destroys coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests,' which provide vital biodiversity reservoirs, sequester carbon, and buffer coasts against storm surges,' the article added. Because of human intervention, plastics, and nutrient runoff pollute the water and kill sea life.</p><p>We must not ignore the hazards of shipping. Sea vessels use heavy fuel oils that release soot, sulfur, and carbon dioxide, amounting to substantial emissions of some air pollutants and 3 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>There are many parts of the ocean where life has died. These sections have layers of crude oil and have been contaminated to outlandishly unsafe levels.</p><p>A Bayelsa State Oil and Environment Commission report reveals that the 'concentration of noxious chemicals, such as Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, exceed safe levels by a factor of 1 million according to some of the samples taken,' pointing to the impact of oil extraction in Bayelsa in the Nigerian Delta.</p><p>Even though significant oil spills receive much media attention, the ongoing oil flow into the sea represents the bulk of the problem. 'Hundreds of millions of gallons' of oil enter our oceans yearly, but most evade media attention. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, only a fraction of that-5 percent-comes from what the U.S. Department of Commerce labels as 'significant' oil spills.</p><p>Some of the most prominent damage to ocean ecosystems appears to come from deep-sea mining on a massive level, which destroys the seabed. It harms marine and aquatic ecosystems while impoverishing coastal communities that depend on fisheries and other resources. The kind of damage that it could cause is almost impossible to calculate, especially since deep-sea mining is a relatively new endeavor.</p><p>In a press statement in August 2024, Dr. Enric Sala, the National Geographic Explorer in Residence and Pristine Seas founder, said:</p><p>'Giving the greenlight to deep sea mining would open a Pandora's box of unknown impacts. Mining the seabed will inevitably affect fragile sea life that we barely know. And a [July 2024] study ... showed that deep-sea polymetallic nodules produce oxygen in total darkness, which may be key to ocean health. The more we look in the deep sea, the more we discover. Rushing to mine the seabed will surely go down in history as an environmental disaster we should have stopped before it started. It is short-sighted to destroy, in minutes, ecosystems that have taken millennia to develop. Countries worldwide have so much more to gain by protecting vital parts of the ocean than signing them away for short-term profit.'</p><p>The Blue Economy in African Coastal Waters</p><p>Just as vast tracts of global land have been acquired to extract fossil fuels (in the United States alone, Earthjustice, a nonprofit public interest environmental law organization, reports that '[t]he oil and gas industry has over 26 million acres of land under lease.' The same phenomenon is being duplicated in the sea. The well-being of more than 200 million Africans who depend on fisheries for food and nutritional security is at risk, CEO of WWF Kenya Mohammed Awer said in July 2023. Once corporate interests claim bodies of water as their own, they will likely become inaccessible to those who make their living from the sea and nearby coastal communities.</p><p>Industrial installations, such as crude oil platforms, establish control over the surrounding waters, ostensibly as security buffers. Fishermen who have tried to find more sea life in the high seas have reported that large parts of the continental shelf and beyond are off-limits because extractive industries have claimed and cordoned them off with controlled installations.</p><p>Unregulated industrial fishing in West African coastal waters, often carried out by foreign fleets, threatens fishermen's livelihoods. According to 'Fishy Networks: Uncovering the companies and individuals behind illegal fishing globally,' a 2022 report by the Financial Transparency Coalition, more than 40 percent of cases involving illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by industrial vessels from January 2010 to May 2022 occurred in West Africa. More than one-third of global fisheries were overfished in 2019, mainly due to illegal fishing.</p><p>Access to healthy water bodies is becoming increasingly difficult by the day due to industrial installations and related pollution. Massive oil spills have been the result of different security forces at work, including blowouts at wellheads at Santa Barbara River, a fire at the Ororo-1 well (which erupted in 2020 in Nigeria and was still raging nearly a year later), explosions of floating production storage and offloading (FSPO) units; the blowing up of oil-laden vessels; and burning of bush refineries.</p><p>Paying to Pollute</p><p>In the current blue economy paradigm, privatization prioritizes profit above ecosystem health. Water is not viewed as a commodity in this construct, and the buying and selling of oceanic water and aquatic resources would be prioritized over other considerations.</p><p>The blue economy could allow polluters to pay to pollute by allowing bodies of water to be used as dumps for mine tailings and other pollutants. It could also open the space for speculators on water futures, thus raising the stakes against access to clean and safe water for the 4 billion people worldwide facing extreme water scarcity for at least one month every year.</p><p>Promise and Peril for Ocean Economy</p><p>An OECD report indicated a significant increase in ocean-related economic activities by 2030, saying that '[t]he new 'ocean economy' is driven by a combination of population growth, rising incomes, dwindling natural resources, responses to climate change and pioneering technologies.' The projections show that the global value added by ocean-based industries could grow from $1.5 trillion in 2010 to more than $3 trillion by 2030.</p><p>While the growth of the ocean economy does offer potential advantages for coastal communities, it's essential to monitor the adverse outcomes that ocean-based economic development can also yield. These challenges can include the growth of existing economic disparities, the displacement of local communities and their means of livelihood, pollution, harm to environmental sustainability and biodiversity, and an infringement on human rights.</p><p>With all of these stressors connected to the exploitation of the oceanic ecosystem, safeguards must be implemented.</p><p>Physical capital and technology have been given such priority in the world economy that other critical factors like human resources and natural resources are ignored or reduced in significance, and there is no longer any real balance in sustainability.</p><p>The drive for profit above the health of the planet and its people leads to the transformation and, often, the destruction of environmental resources without regard to planetary or social limits.</p><p>For coastal communities, the ocean is not just an arena for economic activities but a space for culture, spirituality, and interactions with nature. Connections to the ocean are a way of life. The prevailing capitalist bent may dismiss this reality as an inefficient use of aquatic ecosystems. Yet, it highlights the origins of the polycrisis in our world today.</p><p>When governments and corporations decide what should be done, they often ignore the people closest to the water and the fact that they know more about what is necessary to protect it. It gets more troubling when the uninhabited deep sea is discussed. For example, in Nigeria, Shell Oil is selling off its onshore oil fields and moving operations to the deep sea, where there is limited oversight on the damage being done. Even if the harm being done in the deep sea stays out of sight, its results still affect everyone onshore. This is a major reason for the concern anywhere in the world that is near the water.</p><p>While some countries believe that opening their maritime territories to investment will improve their economies, they invite the destruction of irreplaceable resources.</p><p>Norway Explores Deep Mining in the Seas</p><p>In January 2024, Norway's Parliament voted to allow mining companies to search a large area of the country's waters, approximately the size of Italy, for the minerals needed to build electric cars, mobile phones, and solar panels. 'If you find the resources, and if you have the technology that shows that you can develop this with acceptable [environmental] impact, then you will have your green light,' said Walter Sognnes, CEO of the startup mining company Loke Marine Minerals, according to a January 2024 Wired article.</p><p>Other companies are also looking to exploit the Norwegian waters, with the startup Green Minerals expected to 'extract copper from what's known as seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits, according to its CEO, St\u00e5le Monstad,' added the article. Test mining is supposed to begin in 2028, but several technical challenges must be resolved. Deep-sea mining companies must transport mineral deposits 3 kilometers (approximately 1.9 miles) from the seabed to the surface. How the maritime ecosystem-corals, sponge grounds, and other sea life-will respond to the mining is unknown. Yet, on a positive note, mining companies are required to study the environmental impact before they are permitted to begin exploration.</p><p>Norway has changed its position on this issue in recent years. As co-chair of the Ocean Panel, it pledged to sustainably manage the world's coastline by decarbonizing the shipping industry and regulating seafood production. The Ocean Panel, formed in 2018, comprised 14 governments responsible for 40 percent of the world's coastlines.</p><p>Norway's shift in allowing deep-sea mining occurred because a new government was elected in 2021. Outraged researchers have said that not enough is known about the deep-sea ecosystem to risk mining for minerals such as manganese and cobalt, used in batteries and other electronics. 'In marine biology, our knowledge about the existence, function, and distribution of many species is either too poor or non-existent,' warned a group of scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and NTNU University Museum, both located in Trondheim, Norway.</p><p>When a relatively forward-thinking country like Norway promotes deep-sea mining, it raises concerns due to the region's history of resistance to expanded offshore oil extraction. The damage to local economies, fisheries, and Indigenous peoples of the region has been demonstrated before, so it is worrisome that support for deep-sea mining seems to be increasing once again.</p><p>Deep Mining in U.S. Seas</p><p>According to the Nature article, 'Five Priorities for a Sustainable Ocean Economy,' '[b]lue carbon' ecosystems of mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes store carbon at up to 10 times the rate of terrestrial ecosystems.' For example, the article's authors cite the successful restoration of 3,000 hectares (approximately 1,500 acres) of seagrass beds in Virginia lagoons along the U.S. eastern seaboard, sequestering about 3,000 tons of carbon annually.</p><p>However, there are proposals to rely on seaweed to capture carbon or iron filings, which could lead to enormous damage. Yet, most people are unaware of these initiatives or the potential disasters they can cause. The concept appears benign, but the unsustainable aspects aren't adequately addressed in the public sphere. Moreover, the pursuit of blue carbon through mangrove protection or restoration portends the danger of sea grabbing, displacement of communities, or disruption of their livelihoods.</p><p>Assessing the Value of the Marine Ecosystem</p><p>Some argue that putting a price on the oceans' value distorts the meaning of the blue economy as the right path forward. According to a 2023 report by the World Resources Institute, the blue economy is responsible for more than $1.5 trillion of the annual global economy.</p><p>Although a blue economy is often conceptualized as the 'sustainable' management of aquatic and marine resources and ecosystems, actions other than economic profit or power are usually seen as unreasonable or not viable.</p><p>A 2015 report published by Nature estimated that the assets found in the global marine ecosystem-including fisheries, shipping routes, and tourism-have a total value of $24 trillion and generate an annual output worth $2.5 trillion. In 2022, employment in the marine economy grew by 5 percent in the United States, outpacing the overall economy (3.9 percent) in job growth.</p><p>Yet, the fundamental issue is that the concept of an 'economy' has become so pervasive that people often assume that aquatic ecosystems are intended solely for capital accumulation through exploitation.</p><p>Protecting Marine Ecosystems</p><p>Local coastal communities must be mobilized. Forming alliances with fishermen, activists involved with natural rights, nonprofit organizations, and legal and political influencers will have to play an essential role in protecting the oceans. We must use all legal mechanisms to prevent threats to water bodies from corporations, governments, and other parties.</p><p>The world functions quickly, while political leadership in many regions tends to make strides on the path of least resistance, taking the most expedient way forward. It is a global responsibility to prevent profits from becoming the first priority for industry and political leaders, thereby maintaining the importance of natural resources and life below water.</p><p>The wars happening in the world today demonstrate that oceans and other waterways require protection. The massive destruction shows that appealing to the consciences of political leaders or the boards of global corporations is counterproductive. Grassroots activists and mass public awareness and mobilization, including litigation, can help to hold corporations, governments, and criminals accountable when official routes fail to protect the seas. The media can help expose ongoing marine destruction and unsustainable practices and motivate lawmakers to protect oceanic ecosystems. Destroying marine ecosystems can be viewed as an international crime. As harmful activities in the oceans threaten species, it may be considered a kind of genocide-ecocide, or the killing of Mother Nature.</p><p>Marine Protected Areas: More Action Needed</p><p>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) include oceanic space for long-term conservation. Other areas could be estuaries, seas, and lakes. Such protected areas also cover rivers, creeks, swamps, and continental shelves.</p><p>As governments, corporations, and illegal actors exploit the open seas in a highly unregulated ecosystem, community-led MPAs represent a potential strategy for protecting the health of the Earth's oceans. Simply marking an area as an MPA may not be a neutral exercise.</p><p>MPAs can have many names: marine parks, conservation zones, reserves, sanctuaries, and no-take zones. As of 2023, there were more than 5,000 MPAs worldwide, covering more than 8 percent of the ocean. MPAs have been established in various maritime sites, including the open ocean.</p><p>Most MPAs aim to protect marine habitats and the sea life they support. One of the best-known examples is the Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve, which is about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off the west coast of South America and includes a variety of marine habitats like coral reefs and mangrove swamps, where trees grow directly in seawater. The waters around the Gal\u00e1pagos are home to about 3,000 plant and animal species. Some MPAs, on the other hand, focus on particular historical sites, like shipwrecks.</p><p>According to the Marine Conservation Institute, approximately 8 percent of the world's waters are protected by some form of marine protection, with the island nation of Palau far out in front. Only nine countries have protected 10 to 30 percent of their waters, though only 2 percent have protected as much as 30 percent.</p><p>The UN's World Database on Protected Areas documents MPAs submitted by nations. It reports that more than 15,000 MPAs safeguard an expanse of ocean covering more than 27 million square kilometers, equivalent to nearly 10.6 million square miles. In the U.S., marine protected areas cover 25 percent of the country's waters.</p><p>Most African MPAs are in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a few in West and North Africa. Experts recommend that MPAs should be people-driven rather than financially driven. If the laws regulating MPAs come solely from the government, further details must be made clear to those involved in keeping these laws intact.</p><p>One example of these rules is the Chumbe Reef Sanctuary in Tanzania, established in 1992. This project continues to involve local communities in managing and monitoring marine resources. It has led to a significant recovery of degraded coral reefs and increased fish stock. This success is due to the involvement of local communities in the management of MPAs and the assurance of equitable stakeholding in the benefits derived from such conservation.</p><p>Another success story is the Bazaruto Archipelago National Park in Mozambique, established in 1971. It covers an area of 1,430 square kilometers (approximately 550 square miles) and contains a diverse range of marine habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves. This MPA has provided economic benefits to the local communities by supporting sustainable artisanal fishing and protecting the region's biodiversity, including endangered species such as dugongs, turtles, and sharks.</p><p>Unless MPAs are instituted with the full consent and support of dependent coastal communities, they may be a means of shutting groups of people off from nature. Governments can protect forests without the consent of relevant parties in what is often called 'fortress conservation.' This concept refers to the ability of some groups to map out and prevent others from going near designated parts of the ocean. In such instances, the blue economy could be considered a cause of many conflicts. This situation could arise if communities or commercial entities contend to control resources found in particular areas. Conflicts could also occur when MPAs are cordoned off with a military shield as 'conquered' territories.</p><p>Colonizing Nature</p><p>The concept of colonialism goes beyond the political control and exploitation of one nation by another; it also extends to our relationship with nature. The 'colonization of nature' entails exploiting and transforming natural resources for economic gain without considering its socio-ecological impacts. This approach has contributed to many problems, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and armed conflict over resources.</p><p>Launched in 2018 and based in Nigeria, the School of Ecology (SoE) explores environmental and climate justice, agriculture, resource democracy, and overall socio-ecological transformation. The organization operates under the aegis of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, an ecological think tank where I serve as the director. One SoE gathering was based on the MPA concept and the challenges of the idea of the blue economy. A people-driven MPA would place the fate of their aquatic ecosystems in people's hands. Such a level of stewardship would ensure ecosystem protection and restoration where damage may occur.</p><p>The organization promotes the security and resilience of ecosystems as wielders of power and capital. Although many people see the promotion of the blue economy as a means of securing life underwater, as highlighted in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this is often not the case.</p><p>Environmentalism From Below</p><p>The Gulf of Guinea has seen high pollution levels and environmental crimes. A high level of sea-based pollution, including plastic waste, in the Gulf of Guinea is traceable to the Niger Delta, and it is time for regional governments such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to declare an environmental emergency.</p><p>A commitment to such a declaration will go far in ensuring that the population of West Africa can rely on a safe environment to carry out their economic, socio-cultural, recreational, and spiritual activities. Environmentalism from below requires the reassessment of the false idea that environmental concerns are for those who have had their basic needs met and have the benefit of thinking about luxuries. Environmentalism from below requires those who depend on healthy ecosystems for their basic needs to stand up against attempts to appropriate their territories for exploitation by powerful and connected individuals, governments, and corporations. Humanity is outpacing nature and plundering ocean resources to the degree that we are preventing those resources from recovering naturally.</p><p>Establishing community-managed MPAs is a powerful strategy for safeguarding the health of our oceans and halting further decline, particularly when incorporated into a comprehensive management framework. These MPAs offer a compelling solution that will help to guarantee that the aquatic commons remain free of corporate and industrial exploitation and monopolies.</p><p>Optimally, if local, community-based managed MPAs were established in coastal waters worldwide, they would restore degraded areas, rebuild biodiversity, revive cultural practices, restore dignity, and reinvigorate local economies. While capitalism often sets rules globally, there are definite ways in which humanity can work together to liberate nature from the bottom up. The world's oceans-and all species they support, including ours-depend on it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLGUAR-SRILAGUARD12102024000010001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLGUAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D5V-4KR1-F00C-633Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Sri Lanka Guardian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sri Lanka Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18517\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 12, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Energy &amp;

'[The COP28 decision text] is a balanced plan that tackles emissions, bridges the gap on adaptation, reimagines global finance, and delivers on loss and damage,' he further stated. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell underscored the importance of finance and the strong interconnection between climate action and economic transition: 'At every stage, climate action must strive forward side by side with human development, dignity, and opportunity. [...] The political and economic logic is increasingly insurmountable.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The decision on the first Global Stocktake, which takes the place of this year's COP cover decision, highlights both the urgency of addressing climate change and the significant resources required to do so. Within its preamble and first ten paragraphs, it notes that finance, capacity-building, and technology transfer are critical enablers of climate action, and that climate justice is an important principle underlying such action. Furthermore, it also notes that finance for adaptation as well as mitigation needs to increase manyfold to close the growing gaps between the needs of developing countries and the support currently provided to them.</p><p>Connecting climate change and climate finance</p><p>The COP28 decision mentions finance sixty-six times and references a range of funds and funding arrangements, including the newly established Loss and Damage Fund, the Green Climate Fund, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, and the Special Climate Change Fund. It outlines that an estimated $ 5.8-5.9 trillion are required for developing countries to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) up to 2030, and that there is an estimated annual need of $ 215-387 billion in adaptation funding up to 2030.</p><p>The decision text also links to the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, which will be negotiated next year towards COP29 in Azerbaijan, and the loss and damage fund and funding arrangements, which were operationalised on the first day of COP28 and received pledges of close to $ 800 million so far. However, it acknowledges 'the significant gaps, including finance,' that remain in responding to loss and damage, as well as in other areas of climate change.</p><p>As highlighted in the decision, there is an urgent need to scale up new and additional finance which is grant-based and does not create further debt for developing countries. The decision also recognises the positive connection between having sufficient fiscal space and being able to engage in ambitious climate action, which could potentially connect, among other things, to the need for addressing the rising debt burdens of many climate-vulnerable developing countries.</p><p>Climate change and the global financial architecture</p><p>There are wider implications and interconnections around the nexus of climate change, climate-induced loss and damage, and the global financial system. The COP28 decision underscores 'the importance of reforming the multilateral financial architecture,' including multilateral development banks, and emphasises the roles of different financial actors towards ensuring or enhancing access to climate finance, such as governments, central banks, commercial banks, and institutional investors. It calls for significantly scaling up 'the provision of climate finance in particular through grants and concessional instruments,' accelerating 'the ongoing establishment of new and innovative sources of finance, including taxation,' scaling down harmful incentives, and 'building on existing institutions and mechanisms such as the Common Framework.'</p><p>The need to acknowledge climate risks as both as a reason for and a barrier to accessing finance is crucial for countries of the Global South such as Sri Lanka, who are facing the increasing impacts of climate change in the context of macroeconomic challenges and existing debt. Climate impacts are increasing in scale and frequency, which results in economic and non-economic loss and damage, reduced fiscal space, and constraints towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>The way forward</p><p>COP28 has brought attention to the significant and increasing need for climate finance related to economic transition, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage, which is especially important for vulnerable developing countries that are operating in challenging economic circumstances and with severely restricted fiscal space.</p><p>Going forward, it will be important to explore the interlinkages and potential synergies between the global financial architecture, climate finance, and sovereign debt both within and beyond the UNFCCC process. Initiatives, platforms, partnerships, and funds, such as the Bridgetown initiative, the Ubuntu initiative, Sri Lanka's Climate Justice Forum, the New Global Financing Pact Summit, the World Bank Evolutionary Roadmap, or the IMF's Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, provide options and potential pathways for reform. Furthermore, further research could help to identify opportunities within the nexus that allow countries to better manage compound risks and enhance their long-term economic resilience and prosperity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT231220230001022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69Y3-PSC1-F00C-60BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"886\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 23, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Commercial Banks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIyQTAxOUNERDI4NDdFNjkyMEFDOTFFM0MwMTQzNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp; Corporate Compliance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUFEMUQ2QTA1OUZCNEE5RjkzNTA2RERFMUNEOTk1RTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Commercial Banks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIyQTAxOUNERDI4NDdFNjkyMEFDOTFFM0MwMTQzNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC569</classCode><className>AZERBAIJAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Research has firmly established the need to mobilise significant resources for addressing these impacts, as well as the current gaps and shortfalls in this endeavour. According to the first Global Stocktake, which was finalised at the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (COP28) in December 2023, the adaptation finance needs of developing countries 'are estimated at USD 215-387 billion annually up until 2030,' and their needs to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 'at USD 5.8-5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Besides mobilising these funds-which will be a key topic for climate negotiations in 2024 and at COP29-, there is also a challenge in connecting the global to the national and local level. Ultimately, climate finance and other means of implementation-such as technology, technical support, and capacity-building-need to reach vulnerable communities and other local stakeholders at the frontlines of climate change, who depend on this support to reduce their vulnerabilities, adapt to climate impacts, and address climate-induced loss and damage.</p><p>Barriers and constraints for local-level access</p><p>The needs of communities, households, and vulnerable groups and individuals as outlined above are well established and documented. Global funds-such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), and now the Loss and Damage Fund (L and DF)-have been created to address this urgent need for resources to scale up climate action and build resilience. However, local-level stakeholders are often unable to directly access these funds and have to rely on a chain of intermediary entities, which can lead to delays, transaction costs, and misalignment.</p><p>Key barriers and obstacles for local organisations, communities, and grassroots actors to access climate funding can include stringent eligibility criteria; complex application procedures and proposal templates; limited direct access modalities; lack of small grant windows; high fiduciary standards and reporting requirements; and the need for comprehensive scientific evidence and needs assessments.</p><p>In addition, another challenge for communities includes potential waiting periods and timelines for funding allocation, which can often span years and do not match the immediacy and urgency of ground-level needs in the face of climate action. Many local-level stakeholders are also not aware of available climate finance opportunities or lack a detailed understanding of how to access, manage, or report on such funds. Without this knowledge and empowerment, local stakeholders are left without the means to initiate and sustain relevant projects that address their specific needs and circumstances.</p><p>Local-level priorities and success metrics</p><p>Access to and the effective utilisation of funds also depends on clearly identified and communicable needs, priorities, and success metrics. How can resources at the local level be used to efficiently address climate impacts and risks in a targeted manner? How can the impact of such interventions be measured-especially when it comes to averted or addressed economic and non-economic damages and losses-without adding additional burdens on already vulnerable and resources-constrained communities? And how can it be ensured that the needs and voices of all groups are incorporated, including women, youth, the elderly, migrants, displaced persons, informal workers, or those with disabilities?</p><p>Setting up systems that can answer these questions is a key challenge that involves a range of different stakeholders on the local level-such as communities, grassroots organisations and associations, research institutions, civil society actors, and local authorities-as well as on the national and global level. In the context of the multilateral climate negotiations, workstreams such as those on the Global Goal on Adaptation and the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience, the Loss and Damage Fund, the technology work programme, or National Adaptation Plans and NDCs can connect to these ground realities and acknowledge them in the development of targets, indicators, modalities, guidelines, recommendations, reporting mechanisms, and guidance to global funds.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>The challenge of local-level access to global funds is strongly connected to issues of climate justice and equity, but also to the need of ensuring the transparent and accountable disbursement and utilisation of funds, including robust monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and impact assessment mechanisms.</p><p>If local actors are to directly access funding, it is vital to build up and strengthen their relevant skills, competencies, and systems as well as their awareness of priorities, success metrics, and funding opportunities. Furthermore, other measures towards more equitable access to climate finance could include simplifying and streamlining application processes; enhancing direct access modalities and offering small grant windows; adapting flexible or scalable eligibility and disbursement criteria; involving local stakeholders directly in decision-making processes around funding allocation and enhance their participation, representation, and ownership of the process.</p><p>Addressing these challenges is important to ensure that climate finance is effective and equitable and contributes towards the adaptation and long-term resilience-building efforts of local actors in appropriate, inclusive, and context-specific ways. The path forward involves not just adjustments in the mechanisms of funding but a deeper recognition of local realities and needs in the global climate finance architecture and the wider financial system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2704202400010027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BWY-WCF1-F00C-649H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 27, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEZ</classCode><className>FINANCIAL INCLUSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

India's proposed Mumbai-Iran-Russia and Mumbai-Middle East-Europe corridors, along with projects in the Bay of Bengal and the Chongqing-Kyaukphyu corridor, aim to address this demand. Additionally, plans for the Kra land bridge by Thailand and the feasibility studies for land connectivity between India and Sri Lanka underscore efforts to establish Sri Lanka as a regional logistics hub, facilitating trade with South India.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe recalled the historical significance of Perth in Sri Lanka-Australia relations, particularly during World War II when Royal Canadian Air Force Catalina Flying Boats established a crucial air link between Perth and Koggala Air Base in Ceylon, facilitating vital communication for the Allies.</p><p>He emphasised the importance of the Indian Ocean, especially in light of historical events such as the Japanese attacks on Ceylon in 1942, which Winston Churchill described as a critical moment in the war. He discussed the multipolarity of the Indian Ocean region, shaped by events like the Bandung Conference in 1955, and the subsequent Non-Aligned Movement, which opposed big power rivalry.</p><p>Wickremesinghe's speech outlined various diplomatic frameworks and groupings that have emerged in the Indian Ocean region, including IORA, Indo-Pacific, BRI, QUAD, and BRICS, along with the increased militarisation by several countries, leading to a complex geopolitical landscape. Wickremesinghe also highlighted the growing strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean, particularly in light of geopolitical shifts and the influence of major powers like Russia, China, and Iran.</p><p>He addressed challenges such as attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi rebels, piracy, and threats to freedom of navigation, emphasising the need for collective action to address these issues. Wickremesinghe also discussed the importance of connectivity initiatives for future economic growth, particularly in light of projected increases in GDP for countries like India and Indonesia by 2050.</p><p>Furthermore, Wickremesinghe emphasised the urgency of addressing the climate crisis, noting the Indian Ocean's vulnerability to warming and rising sea levels. He proposed initiatives such as the Tropical Belt Initiative and the International Climate Change University to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure climate justice for vulnerable countries.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe called for unity among Indian Ocean Rim countries to address shared challenges and create a safer, more sustainable ocean environment. He advocated for the development of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean, emphasising the responsibility of IORA leaders in achieving this goal.</p><p>The event, themed 'Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean,' aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. This conference was organised by the India Foundation in collaboration with India's Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and Perth-US Asia Centre.</p><p>Singapore's Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan and India's External Affairs Minister Dr. Subramanian Jaishankar also attended the event.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT1002202400010024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B9K-DWF1-JCH9-G3JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 10, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Initiative &amp;

They also noted the horrendous list of errors in the draft.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva said the Bill's Sinhala version also included English words. He pointed out this would create issues since it is the Sinhala version of an Act that would prevail under the law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We need an important discussion on this Bill, which is why we are asking the Government to regazette it,' said Dr de Silva.</p><p>'You can not have Singlish in the draft,' said National People's Power (NPP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. He said the errors also showed that the Government was in an undue haste to push the Bill through Parliament.</p><p>Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara said some of the words in the draft 'are not even used in any of the languages in Sri Lanka,' and he asked the Government what its intention was in publishing gazettes without any scrutiny beforehand.</p><p>SLPP dissident Parliamentarian Prof. Charitha Herath, who now represents the Freedom People's Congress, pointed out several glaring translation errors in the Sinhala draft.</p><p>'Some of these words have been translated using Google Translate,' he added. He said it was the responsibility of the government to present such Bills properly in all three languages.</p><p>On Saturday, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekara acknowledged there were errors in the draft, saying they had identified 42 such errors which they had pointed out to the Legal Draftsman's Department. Nevertheless, he said these should not distract from the essential nature of the proposed law and the Bill would be presented to Parliament with amendments.</p><p>Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena delivering this year's Lalith Athulathmudali Commemorative Freedom Speech at the BMICH</p><p>Left-wing PM pays tribute to 'Aluth Mudalali'</p><p>Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena delivered this year's Lalith Athulathmudali Commemorative Freedom Speech at the BMICH on the 87th birth anniversary of the former minister. It was a rare occasion where a commemorative speech was delivered by someone who was politically on the opposite side.</p><p>The PM said from the time he first entered Parliament as an Opposition MP in 1983, he was intrigued and impressed with the intellectual abilities, prowess and implacable conduct on the floor of the House by Mr Athulathmudali, who was then a government minister. The Communist Party newspaper 'Aththa' once reffered to Mr Athulathmudali as 'Aluth Mudalali.'</p><p>The Premier also used the occasion to draw attention to steps being taken to hand over lands to farmers who had lost ownership of their traditional lands during the British colonial era. After reinvesting in these lands, he said the new 'Ape Gamen Lowata (Gateway of Exports) scheme the Government was launching would connect more than 14,000 Grama Niladhari Divisions, with each division being made up of three to four villages, coming to more than 40,000 villages across the country.</p><p>All of them would be engaged in contributing towards ensuring food security through the cultivation of these lands and exporting the surplus to earn valuable foreign exchange.</p><p>Museum visitors amazed by wall guns and canons taken from Lanka during Dutch period</p><p>The Colombo National Museum was crowded through the week with local visitors and foreign tourists coming to view 'A lost heritage reclaimed' exhibition that showcased artifacts that were returned to Sri Lanka after being taken by Dutch forces some three centuries ago.</p><p>Most of the items were either looted after the Kandy palace was invaded by the Dutch in 1765, and they were taken as war trophies. Others were sent as gifts to the foreign rulers later.</p><p>Many visitors were amazed by the canons and wall guns that were showcased for their technical features and handicraft work that were made by Sri Lankan goldsmiths. The wall guns, which weigh around 27-28 kilogrammes, were used as infantry guns and were often carried by two persons on their shoulders. The special feature of these guns was their 'detachable pans' and the capability to increase fire power.</p><p>As a retired colonel who visited the exhibition with his family wrote in the visitor's book, it was a proud moment to learn the history of the land and 'witness the first handmade cannon Sri Lankans produced.'</p><p>Another government official who was busy taking photographs after admiring the minute decorative work on the swords used by late Kandyan kings and the guns, was heard telling his colleague about the craftsmanship of the Kandyan goldsmiths. He wondered how long it would take to finish the artistic work on these weapons.</p><p>His colleague who was stunned by the artistic beauty of these artifacts, asked his friend what happened to a demand back in the 1980s when the government prepared a list of similar stolen artifacts in foreign museums including the statue of the deity Tara that is now kept at the London Museum.</p><p>Closer ties between Lanka and Guinea-Bissau which commends Ranil's Climate Justice Forum</p><p>Kana Kananathan, Sri Lanka's first Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau, recently met President Umaro Sissoco Embalo at the Presidential Palace in Bissau. During the high-level discussions, the President of Guinea-Bissau lauded the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, for successfully steering and swiftly restoring stability to the nation.</p><p>Ambassador Kananathan with Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo</p><p>Expressing admiration for these accomplishments, the Guinea Bissau President also acknowledged and commended President Wickremesinghe's recent launch of the Climate Justice Forum during COP28 in Dubai, in which the Guinea Bissau President also participated. He welcomed the Climate Justice Forum, asserting that it will serve as a potent force unifying nations for this endeavour and the initiative underscores Sri Lanka's dedication to addressing pressing environmental issues on the international stage. Mr Kananathan thanked President Sissoco for the support Guinea-Bissau extended for Sri Lanka's candidature at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).</p><p>Bug at the Sri Lanka high commission in London</p><p>Foreign Ministry corridors are buzzing over reports from London that a listening device, commonly known as a 'bug', had been found at the Sri Lankan High Commission.</p><p>Exactly who placed the device and for what purpose remains a mystery, though MI5, the British spy service, was ruled out as a suspect.</p><p>Foreign Ministry seniors have expressed amusement more than anything else and ordered a security clean of the premises with professional help. It is better to be safe than sorry seems to be the reason.</p><p>Top official must pay for his visit to Dubai for COP28</p><p>The President's office has directed that action be taken to recover nearly Rs. 900,000 that a top official from an institution under the Environment Ministry, had spent on his trip to Dubai to attend the COP28 summit.</p><p>The official had gone to Dubai using funds from the institution, but had not obtained approval from its Board of Directors to use the institution's funds for the visit.</p><p>Instead, he had gotten the funds released without any covering approval, claiming that his invitation to attend the summit had been received at short notice. After attending the conference held from December 1 to 7, he had returned and is now planning to submit a paper to the next Board of Directors meeting due to be held on December 16, asking the Board to approve the release of the funds retrospectively.</p><p>The matter had been referred to the Presidential Secretariat, which has made it clear the money should be returned to the government and all costs for the trip should be recovered from the officer responsible.</p><p>Sri Lanka-Palestine Committee calls for ending diplomatic ties with Israel</p><p>The Sri Lanka-Palestine Parliamentary Friendship Committee met on Friday after a long hibernation, with members showing renewed enthusiasm to turn it into a dynamic and result-oriented body, given the unprecedented suffering Palestinian civilians, including children, are going through in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</p><p>Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) dissident Parliamentarian Dilan Perera was unanimously elected secretary. This post had been vacant ever since Mujibur Rahman resigned to contest the Colombo Municipal Council election.</p><p>Mr. Perera, who, together with several pro-Palestinian MPs, came to Parliament last week wearing the Palestinian keffiyeh, or scarf, and proposed the committee urge the government to stop sending Sri Lankans to work in Israeli farms until a solution to the Palestinian crisis was found.</p><p>Bringing an amendment to his own draft resolution, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Imtiaz Bakeer Markar said the committee should instead call on the government to sever relations with Israel until Israel agrees to abide by all United Nations resolutions on the Palestinian dispute. This was adopted unanimously.</p><p>The committee also passed a resolution proposed by SLPP Parliamentarian Yadamini Gunawardena with an amendment. It urged the government to call for an unconditional and immediate ceasefire in the Gaza war. Soon after the meeting ended, Mr. Perera announced the resolutions passed by the committee.</p><p>Dozens of people rescued from floods in Kegalle town</p><p>The President's office has been thanked for the quick action taken to rescue dozens of people trapped by rising flood waters during adverse weather in the Kegalle town.</p><p>After receiving a message that dozens of people, including those in several buses, were stuck as flood waters rose around them, the President's office had immediately alerted the security forces and other agencies to the emergency and ensured that steps were taken to safely rescue those who were trapped.</p><p>Former Southern province Governor Kumari Balasuriya, who hails from Kegalle, had written to President's Secretary Saman Ekanayake thanking him and the Presidential Secretariat for their timely actions after she had alerted them to what was happening during recent torrential rains.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1012202300170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69V5-80F1-JCH9-G4SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 10, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

They thought it was impossible. But I accepted the challenge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know this story so well. You also know this very sad story; people suffered in queues all day, waiting for fuel, gas, medicine and essential items. But today, that country has started breathing. Finally, things are getting better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, there are still difficulties, little hitches, little concerns. But, we can overcome them. To do that, we must make the economy stronger and more stable. We have come so far on this precarious rope bridge, now we cannot turn back!</p><p>Some say that things feel better now because we do not have to pay back the loans. It's not true. We did pay back the loans, approximately Rs. 2.5 Billion in 2022, and Rs. 2.6 Billion in 2023. The journey we have undertaken through hardships and obstacles has so far been a tremendous path of success. And I intend to complete this journey - with you!</p><p>I was just a UNP MP in the Parliament. Just one man. Eventually, they set fire to my house as well. The entire country was in flames. Nobody believed it was possible to build a peaceful and prosperous country again, a country where people could be free and happy. A by-gone dream. But I rose from ashes. I took the challenge because I have always loved my motherland, I always believed that this country could do better. It was my time to prove it.</p><p>So today, when I see people in my country smiling again, somehow having three meals a day, when I see vehicles back on the roads, and Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Thai Pongal, Ramazan, and Christmas being celebrated, dansalas being initiated everywhere once again during Vesak, I feel a sincere pride. I have achieved the impossible!</p><p>The politicians who fled and hid during the crisis have now come out of their dens and are criticising me. I found Rs. 10 Billion to hold the Presidential Elections in this country again. It is with much compassion I gaze at them.</p><p>Of course, I took over a bankrupt country. But we are gradually gaining speed. We have restructured our debt and we are recovering rhythmically. In 2019, when I left the post of Prime Minister our Gross National Product (GNP) was US$ 89 Billion. But in 2022, when I took over the country as President, it was USD 76.9 Billion. Our GNP has dropped by US$ 12.1 Billion! However, by the end of 2023, we could increase it to US$ 84.4 Billion even amidst a crisis! That is what I call possibility. If we continue to tread this path, we can reach US$ 89 Billion by the end of2025.</p><p>I did all this with just one seat in the Parliament. But I garnered the support of many parties to pass relevant Acts in the Parliament and made plans which are critical for development. All of you, despite your political preferences, extended me your full support. That is why I am contesting this Presidential Election as an independent candidate.</p><p>I do not represent a party or a group of people. I stand for all of you who have varied political views. My service is not only for you who are from the previous and the new generation, but also for those children who are yet to be born, the future generation.</p><p>- Ranil Wickremesinghe</p><p>The manifesto of President Ranil Wickremesinghe; running as an independent candidate at the upcoming Presidential Election; titled \"Five Triumphant Years for Sri Lanka with Ranil\" was unveiled on Thursday (August 29).</p><p>In his policy statement, President Wickremesinghe outlined the priorities of the five-year plan: easing the cost of living, creating jobs, providing tax relief, promoting economic growth and implementing programs to ensure that every citizen has the right to land and a home.</p><p>The manifesto \"Five Triumphant Years for Sri Lanka with Ranil\" comprising five core principles: \"The Theravada Trade Economy, Operation-Beyond 2025, Towards a Prosperous Nation, A Win for the Motherland, and A United Sri Lanka,\" was first presented to religious leaders, led by the Maha Sangha and then to the country's youth by President Wickremesinghe. The President also launched the website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ranil2024.lk\">www.ranil2024.lk</url>, which features his manifesto \"Five Triumphant Years for Sri Lanka with Ranil\" as an independent candidate for the upcoming Presidential Election.</p><p>The Theravada Trade Economy will ensure an adequate standard of living for all the citizens. We will be able to create a highly competitive, export-oriented digital green economy through this journey, and we will be able to achieve all our economic goals by 2048. We have already passed and implemented the primary laws aiming for necessary transformation towards such a development stage.</p><p>A separate authority will be established to ensure systematic and expeditious delivery of rights to citizens. This will ensure land ownership to 2 million people through the Urumaya program and the transfer of low-income housing owned by the Government in Colombo city to the residents within 4 years. Loans will be granted at concessional rates to middle-class families for the construction of houses. Low-income families shall be given the opportunity to own their houses in condominiums. New villages will be established for the plantation workers and those living in line rooms will be granted the right to own a plot of land.</p><p>Significant Trade Union representation will be allowed in the Board membership of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees Trust Fund (ETF). Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce will also be included to ensure better financial administration.</p><p>The National Wealth Fund will be formed by combining the budget surplus and the profits of Government institutions. This fund will be invested in local and international stock markets.</p><p>We have been given a foremost place in the World Climate Change Program due to our commitment to addressing climate change. We have launched a number of initiatives in this regard such as the Climate Justice Forum, the Climate Prosperity Plan and the International Climate Change University.</p><p>We are a principal stakeholder of the Global Financing Pact entered into by the countries of the Global North and the Global South under the patronage of France, in order to address the global climate changes. We have also joined the Global Blended Financial Alliance initiated by Indonesia focusing on the countries in the Global South. We have launched a Tropical Region Collaboration program at present with the aim of ensuring environmental safety in the tropical region.</p><p>Farmers will be provided with seeds, fertiliser and modern machinery required for modern agricultural methods. A supply chain where agro-products will be directly purchased from the farmers will be created. Establishment of a chain of storages across the island in order to uplift the rural agriculture industry is also in the works. Home garden cultivations and subsistence crop cultivations in urban apartments will be highly encouraged.</p><p>Three hundred thousand acres of land will be allocated out of the underutilised State Land for commercial crop cultivation. Proper instructions and assistance will be provided to Urumaya freehold deed recipient farmers to expand and improve their cultivations. We will encourage them to use those lands for productive crop cultivation and other agro-enterprises. An amount of Rs. 25,000 will be directly credited to the accounts of farmers for the purchase of fertiliser and other requirements needed for paddy cultivation. A fixed-rate will be declared for the selling price of paddy from season to season.</p><p>Although our island home is surrounded by the ocean, even less than 40 percent of the boats we own at present are utilised for fishing. It is planned to implement a plan to reap maximum benefits from the ocean with the patronage of the local and foreign experts. This is expected to double the income of US$ 300 million we currently earn via fisheries products exportation. The freshwater fishery industry, prawn cultivation, aquatic plants, and ornamental fish industry are expected to be promoted and expanded.</p><p>Economic centres</p><p>The fishery harbours across the island will be developed and upgraded to Fishery Economic Centres. Fishing societies, fishermen, investors and experts will be linked to these centres in order to yield the best out of the economic centres.</p><p>A program to raise the dairy harvest by connecting the National Livestock Development Board with Indian authorities related to the dairy industry is already in progress. This would positively impact the local dairy industry in the aspects of technology and investment.</p><p>The infrastructure required to provide a better experience for the tourists will be upgraded and the tourist arrivals which are 2.5 million will be increased to 5 million within the forthcoming five years. The gross income received to the country from one tourist is currently US$ 150, and it will be increased up to US$ 500 by the year 2035. The cities Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Trincomalee will be developed as the main tourist hubs.</p><p>We will also provide facilities to convert the Eastern coast and Jaffna to high-end tourist destinations. Steps will be taken to further increase the demand for the Southern coastal area. The tourist industry will be expanded to the hill country with better activities and attractions for tourists.</p><p>A new Economic Commission will be established for investment promotion and an Office for Internal Trade will be set up to oversee all aspects related to international trade. Trincomalee is expected to be the Primary Economic Hub which will be equipped with a harbour, efficient transport, industrial facilities, energy generation possibilities and also naval and aviation strength. The Government of India has pledged to assist us in this matter.</p><p>Investments in renewable energy production including green hydrogen will be highly encouraged. It is targeted to obtain 70 percent of the power supply network from renewable energy sources which amounts to 2000 Megawatts by 2030. Sri Lanka will thus be transferred to a Green Energy Hub and it will enable us to export energy to India and other neighbouring countries.</p><p>The latest and the most advanced trends shaping the world in future are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation based on digital technology. AI will be the base of all disciplines in future, health to education to financial and economic sectors.</p><p>A Technology Promotion Act will be passed in the year 2025 with the aim of bringing about a digital transformation. A Digital Transformation Agency and a Technology and Innovation Council will thereon be established. Amendments have already been made to the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act in an attempt to create the background for this purpose.</p><p>A new entity named Vocational Skills Sri Lanka (VSSL) will be established in the year 2025 amalgamating the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka. All the vocational training schools and centres will be brought under its purview.</p><p>Provincial Vocational Education Boards will be established in all nine provinces before the end of 2026, and all the vocational training centres located in the provinces will be upgraded to vocational schools and brought under the established Provincial Vocational Education Boards. Technical and Vocational and Management University Colleges will be opened in all the provinces. Steps will be taken to award the related degrees upon the completion of an academic period of two years, similar to developed countries.</p><p>Steps will be taken to modernise the school infrastructure system to face the era of technology which will be dawned in 2040. Funding will be provided by the Government. A program to equip teachers with new knowledge and training will be implemented in the year 2025. School education will be revised with a focus on soft skills, life skills and moral values. The system of examinations and evaluations will be revisited enabling the students to start university education at the age of 17 years. \"English for All\" program which provides English education to all the school children will be implemented within the next decade. It has been planned to recruit 2500 English teachers as a short-term remedy to fill the vacancies for English teachers throughout the country; 1000 retired teachers, 400 from Teaching Colleges and 1100 graduates recruited through a competitive examination will come under the aforementioned 2500 new teachers. The graduates recruited will be given a special training for a period of 3 months before their posting.</p><p>A favourable environment will be built for doctors, nurses, other medical professionals and members of the supporting staff, to carry out their duties in a better manner. A key expectation of improving the condition of healthcare personnel is to reduce the brain drain. Local and foreign training opportunities for the medical staff headed by the doctors will be expanded.</p><p>The area from Kalutara to Negombo will be developed into one extensive megapolis. These city planning activities will be carried out in consultation with Surbana Jurong Pvt Ltd of Singapore. Galle, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Trincomalee will be transformed into megapolises enriched with all modern-day facilities.</p><p>We have made future plans for the sectors of transport and highways with the aim of providing sustainable green transport services. We will use digital technologies from issuing driving licences to driving vehicles. In order to encourage the use of electrical vehicles, we will establish charging centres around the country.</p><p>Even though the northern economy regrettably collapsed due to the decades-long war, we have already launched plans to revive the country's economy through the Northern Province. Our aim is to strengthen the North into being a major economic stronghold which renders a greater contribution to the Western Province as well as to our economy.</p><p>Trincomalee will be transformed into one of the major economic centres equipped with all aspects such as transport, energy, industries, ports, naval, and aviation. The transformation will be supported by the Government of India. We will develop the Verigalara to Panama-Kumana coastline to utilise them optimally in the tourism industry.</p><p>A Gazette Notification is already issued increasing the wages of plantation workers. In addition to this, a number of specific measures to uplift the living standards of the plantation community will be taken in future.</p><p>None of the political leaders who have boasted about catching thieves took action or showed interest in passing the necessary laws to ensure justice. We did not waste time bragging but discussed with the IMF and adopted modern anti-corruption laws, based on global best practices to prevent bribery and corruption. We will be implementing the Anti-Corruption Agenda to make our country the least corrupt State in South Asia.</p><p>A separate commission for women's rights will be established as per the Women Empowerment Act. We will formulate new policies to support the women suffering from poverty. The current process of liberating women from the burden of micro-finance loans and other debts will be further expanded.</p><p>We will formulate the necessary laws to ensure children's human rights, and child rights while protecting them from abuse, delinquency and child sexual exploitation, within the year 2025.</p><p>Working from home</p><p>We have a series of plans in the works to equip the youth with the knowledge and experience required to one day lead the nation. They will be given opportunities and guidance to generate income by working from home. Training programs will be implemented in the fields of Digital Marketing, Freelancing, E-Commerce, and so on.</p><p>Informal practices and external interferences in the past have led to current weaknesses in sports administration. As a result, our athletes are facing various difficulties. New legislation will be introduced for sports to address this situation. According to the recommendations of the committee appointed on cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket will be restructured.</p><p>We will amend the National Policy for Senior Citizens in 2025. Various activities will be carried out by the Divisional Secretariats and Community Organisations to enhance the social and cultural lives of senior citizens.</p><p>We will take steps to adopt the Sign Language Bill and develop a comprehensive national policy for people with special needs. The building access policies will be revised to ensure that they meet the requirements of individuals with disabilities. We will allocate a special employment quota for such communities.</p><p>Across the country, there are small community groups that often go unnoticed and are marginalised by society. Although these groups have faced different forms of suppression and difficulties, no attention has been given to their requirements so far. We are committed to building a society where no citizen is discriminated against or disadvantaged based on religion, language, caste, gender, political opinion, or place of birth.</p><p>We will increase the salaries of public servants from the range of 24 percent to 50 percent. The lowest salary will be brought up to Rs. 30,000. The Cost of Living allowance will be increased to Rs. 25,000. Government employees below the age of 40 will be given one year's leave with scholarships to follow courses to improve service efficiency. University of Public Policy and Administration will be established. A skills or merit-based promotion system will be introduced. Our plan includes digitalising the entire public service to make it more efficient and streamlined. To support this initiative, we are hoping to provide laptops, tablets, and smart phones at subsidised rates.</p><p>As a result of our economic policies, an increasing number of new enterprises will emerge through local and foreign investments, creating numerous employment opportunities in the future. While this may take a year or two to develop, in the meantime, one hundred thousand new employment opportunities will be provided in the year 2025.</p><p>In 2025, we will launch a new program for youth who do not get through Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations. This program, in collaboration with the private sector including tourism and manufacturing industries, will provide vocational training and a monthly allowance of Rs. 35,000 for a period of one year. Private companies could also contribute additional funds to this allowance. They will be provided employment opportunities in those companies after the training.</p><p>We are in the process of amending the Foreign Employment Bureau Act, which will introduce benefits such as housing schemes and daycare centres, to provide them with better facilities and working conditions. We will also be taking steps to enhance foreign employment opportunities. We will establish an Information Centre which will provide continuously updated data on the international job market.</p><p>A large number of people work in the informal labour market, which includes three-wheeler drivers, private bus drivers and conductors, labourers and many others. We will be introducing a contributory pension and social security system for all these workers in 2025. Standardised training will be provided to enhance the professional dignity of these roles. NVQ Level 4 certification courses for female massage therapists have already been introduced.</p><p>Many three-wheeler drivers are currently suffering due to debt. We will be providing the defaulters with an opportunity through State banks to restructure their loans. Discussions will be done to make the arrangements to extend this relief through private banks as well.</p><p>The Security (Special Provisions) Act has now been drafted to enhance the status of our Tri Forces and stabilise the security of the nation. The committee's report on modernising security forces to meet the demands of 2030 has been received, and its recommendations will be implemented. 'One Rank - One Pension' system will be introduced for the Tri Forces. This will eliminate the issues related to pensions of war heroes. Opportunities will be expanded for our military personnel to serve in the UN Peacekeeping Missions.</p><p>The basic foundation of a strong criminal justice system is to create a Police Service consisting of safe, responsible, active, competent, brave and honest officials who ensure the safety of citizens. A Police University will be established to improve the institutional and extracurricular knowledge and skills of police officers. Thereby police officers will be given the opportunity to obtain degrees and post-graduate degrees while in service.</p><p>International standards</p><p>We have planned to build a number of new prisons in accordance with international standards. It is expected to equip these prisons with facilities in the aspects of health, sanitation, food, and welfare services for prisoners and prison officers. This will strengthen the process of rehabilitating prisoners and helping them reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens. The cases of long-term detainees and those serving lengthy sentences will be reviewed.</p><p>In 2025, we will draft a bill to establish a comprehensive Anti-narcotics Command Headquarters covering all functions from drug control to rehabilitation of drug addicts, and ensure that it is passed in 2025 itself.</p><p>The invaluable heritage found at the historical sites of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa should be further studied and utilised for the benefit of the country. We aim to give priority to peace and eliminate disputes that are found in the values of governance in the Eastern world. While promoting non-violence, kindness and compassion, we would also seek to be nourished by the lessons from the Western world.</p><p>We are looking forward to establishing a digital museum dedicated to Buddhist civilisation of the historic city of Kandy. Measures will be taken to utilise AI and new technologies to study the Thripitakaya. Establishing Mahavihara University is another important objective we have.</p><p>Sri Lanka now has world famous writers and it is our responsibility to facilitate and encourage their writing. We will establish an International Fine Arts and Cultural Centre near Ananda Coomarswamy Mawatha by combining the Nelum Pokuna Theatre, John De Silva Theatre, the Science Museum, Mahaweli Centre, and the New Town Hall Premises. This centre shall provide the facilities to improve the skills of the local artists, and produce art of international standard. This centre will be named the Ananda Coomaraswamy Arts and Cultural Centre. A South Asian Cultural Centre and a Museum for Modern and Contemporary Art will be established in the same premises. This task will be commenced in 2025.</p><p>Both multi-community media and modern media are needed to create a sensitive society. We will be drafting a national journalism policy and building a strong foundation to creating a society that values humanity, discipline, loyalty and integrity. We will empower and strengthen journalists and freelance writers. A higher education institute on journalism will be established in 2025. We will work towards solving the issues faced by the regional journalists. An Electronic Media Regulatory Commission will be established to generate a transparent media environment which holds values.</p><p>Two years ago, the economic crisis shattered the people's hopes in all aspects. People lost the hope of moving forward. But now, the time has come for everyone to be united and come together to create a beautiful future for the country. The future which we will be creating will benefit all citizens equally, irrespective of ethnicity. No citizen who speaks in Tamil should be neglected by the Sinhala community, and similarly, no citizen who speaks in Sinhala should be neglected by the Tamil and Muslim communities.</p><p>We will make sure that an atmosphere where people from different ethnicities and religions could live harmoniously like relatives and friends, will be created.</p><p>We will devolve power to the Provincial Councils as per the Constitution. The powers of the Provincial Councils that come under Schedule 1, which are now vested under the Central Government will be devolved back to the Provincial Councils.</p><p>The decision of vesting police powers to Provincial Councils will be decided by the new Parliament. The powers given under Schedule 3 that are approved by the party leaders will be given to the Provincial Councils.</p><p>New Constitution</p><p>Several key reforms need to be made in order to rebuild the country to make the future stronger. I will give the Parliament the responsibility of drafting a new Constitution within a year after the forthcoming Parliamentary Election following the Presidential Election. The new Parliament will need to decide whether or not to abolish the Executive Presidency.</p><p>The new Parliament will introduce a new election procedure based on the recommendations presented by the Commission headed by the retired Chief Justice Priyasath Dep in making the election reforms.</p><p>The political parties in Europe are following systems of high standards in maintaining transparency. We will introduce new rules and regulations regarding election expenditure and other activities of political parties.</p><p>The Parliamentary Standards Act will come into force and it will contain sections enabling the removal of Parliamentary Members who strongly violate the standards given in the Act. It will enact the laws that prevent the elected representatives from doing business with the government.</p><p>One of the main methods where people's sovereignty is exercised, is through voting, which takes place at the Presidential, Parliamentary and Provincial Council election levels. The Peoples' Initiative Act will further enable citizens to submit proposals to the Parliament. In this manner, citizens could be directly involved in the law and policy-making process of the country. This Act will further strengthen democracy practiced in the country.</p><p>The aim of the Jana Sabha is to have the active participation of provincial and rural communities in the decision-making process. Currently, several pilot projects are being implemented in this regard. We will establish Jana Sabhas with representatives from the 50,000 villages in the country dispersed throughout 14,002 Grama Niladhari Divisions.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

One of the key topics addressed during the meeting was an invitation extended by President Wickremesinghe for Brazil to join the Tropical Belt initiative.</p><p>The Tropical Belt initiative is aimed at addressing environmental challenges and promoting sustainable practices within regions affected by tropical climates. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that this initiative holds significance for both Sri Lanka and Brazil, as they share common concerns and impacts related to environmental issues.</p><p>The talks between the two leaders likely involved discussions on collaborative efforts, information sharing, and coordinated strategies to tackle climate change, deforestation, and other environmental threats. The involvement of Brazil, a major player in environmental conservation and biodiversity, could strengthen the collective impact of the Tropical Belt initiative.</p><p>The outcomes of these bilateral talks may have broader implications for global environmental efforts, showcasing the importance of international collaboration in addressing shared challenges.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the Climate Justice Forum at COP28, emphasizing the critical importance of addressing climate issues with a sense of justice and equity.

The GST process allows everyone to identify where they are collectively making progress towards meeting the Paris Climate Change Agreement goals, and where they are not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anil Jasinghe at the SL pavilion</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few days later, however, COP28 President Sultan Al-Jaber reaffirmed his own oil company Adnoc's commitment to invest in oil and gas - fossil fuels at the root of the climate crisis.</p><p>COP28 is yet another United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit without the unabated call for a phase-out of fossil fuels. The decision texts agreed upon read:</p><p>'...transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner ... so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science'.</p><p>With its many adjectives, experts say it is too weak a call at this stage of the climate crisis. 'It's like trying to mop a flooding room without turning off the faucet,' said Sri Lankan climate activist Jeanna de Zoysa.</p><p>While OPEC members and some Global North nations exploit technicalities and grey wordings on international decision texts, countries like Sri Lanka bear the brunt of climate-induced weather events.</p><p>The Sri Lanka Government was determined to make a mark at this year's summit, investing in its first-ever pavilion and hosting a staggering 31 events and many bilaterals. The tab is still being calculated. Nonetheless, Sri Lanka's interventions were absent in many key negotiations over the two weeks of COP28.</p><p>Newly-appointed Environment Minister Keheliya Rambukwella was absent from many of the country statements on various agenda items and events - like the climate-health ministerial and even a Joint Crediting Mechanism event at the Japan pavilion, a crucial instrument on climate finance.</p><p>He missed most of his sessions and sent his secretary to some, Sri Lanka delegation sources said, requesting anonymity. While he avoided our specific questions regarding his absence, his staff sources claimed it was because he was 'overbooked'.</p><p>Mr Rambukwella had bilaterals with the Environment Ministers of the UAE and the Philippines, iRise Global Inc., the Glasgow Finance Alliance for Net Zero, IPCC, Adaptation Fund, and Green Climate Fund as well as various carbon trading projects.</p><p>His discussions with UAE's Environment Minister centred on Sri Lanka's climate priorities, Mr Rambukwella told the Sunday Times. Investments in renewable energy (RE) and collaboration on the Mangrove Alliance for Climate (MAC) programme were explored.</p><p>The Sri Lanka pavilion</p><p>The Philippines Environment Minister expressed support for Sri Lanka's Tropical Belt and Climate Justice Forum. They also spoke of carbon trading projects, Article 6 readiness, and financial backing for net-zero plans. His engagement with iRise Global Inc. included potential collaboration on carbon and biodiversity credit projects including in the agriculture and agro-forestry sectors.</p><p>The Sri Lanka Government will continue to push the Climate Justice Forum, Tropical Belt Initiative, and the Climate Change University as key priorities, Mr Rambukwella said. Commenting on future climate strategy, he highlighted the development of a carbon trading framework, Nationally Determined Contributions implementation and the National Adaptation Plan update along with the upcoming submission of the first Biennial Transparency Report, and efforts to develop Provincial Adaptation Plans tailored to regional needs.</p><p>Mr Rambukwella said he had engaged with the COP28 youth delegation on 'innovative renewable energy technology solutions, capacity building, circular economy practices, and nature-based solutions'.</p><p>However, the Sunday Times can confirm that he did not have direct engagements with any members of the youth delegation. While Sri Lanka was recognised by the UNFCCC for being one of the countries with the most number of youth-led events, the minister didn't attend at any events organised by youth in the Sri Lankan pavilion. We observed that delegates who invited stakeholders to bilaterals on the promise the minister would attend were often left in the uncomfortable position of making excuses for his last-minute cancellations.</p><p>Sri Lanka faced scheduling conflicts across the board. Attendance of ministry officials at agenda item meetings - the core negotiations at COP28 - was varied. Deliberations on loss and damage and agriculture saw regular interventions by Sri Lankan officials, but Article 6 negotiators were frequently absent from their relevant meeting rooms. (Article 6 of the Paris Agreement sets out the rules for global trade in greenhouse gas emissions reductions).</p><p>This was because of commitments at the Sri Lanka pavilion, ministry officials maintained. 'There were a lot of lessons this year that we must make sure we learn from and improve for upcoming climate summits,' noted Environment Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe. He said the country's first-ever pavilion at the international event was a serious undertaking.</p><p>Dr. Jasinghe, by contrast, was seen hard at work, making numerous interventions and representations for Sri Lanka in many spaces. The result of this year's COP was underwhelming from a developing country's point of view, he concurred.</p><p>'The Global Stocktake revealed that progress was insufficient,' he said. 'The target was to cut 43% of emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 globally, which hasn't happened.'</p><p>Consequently, the GST has called on parties to triple RE capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030; and to produce ambitious economy-wide emission reduction targets. But, as usual, commitment gaps were identified on the part of the developed countries, Dr. Jasinghe observed.</p><p>COP28 called for a doubling of adaptation finance and for targets to be set for 2030 in terms of water security, ecosystem restoration, and health under the Global Goal of Adaptation.</p><p>'There were no decisions on carbon markets, which is unfortunate since countries like ours could benefit from it, but voluntary markets will continue amidst discussions on how to supervise them to troubleshoot the credibility issues associated with them,' Dr. Jasinghe said.</p><p>Carbon markets are a specialised type of financial market, through which carbon credits - essentially permits that allow the purchaser to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas - can be bought and sold.</p><p>The terminology on fossil fuels was also significantly 'diluted' this year, Dr. Jasinghe pointed out.

Such a bridge will facilitate trade and people-to-people contact.</p><p>In his IOC speech, the President highlighted the critical need for enhanced connectivity infrastructure to accommodate the projected eight-fold increase in the GDP of countries such as India and Indonesia by 2050.</p><p>The President said that existing channels such as the Suez Canal may not be adequate, necessitating new initiatives. India's proposed Mumbai-Iran-Russia and Mumbai-Middle East-Europe corridors, along with projects in the Bay of Bengal and the Chongqing-Kyaukphyu corridor, aim to address this demand.</p><p>Plans for the Kra land bridge by Thailand and the Indo-Lanka Bridge could also address the infrastructure demands for trade and people's movement.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe recalled the historical significance of Perth in Sri Lanka-Australia relations, particularly during World War II when Royal Canadian Air Force Catalina Flying Boats established a crucial air link between Perth and the Koggala Air Base in Ceylon, facilitating vital communication for the Allies.</p><p>Later, Qantas used Colombo as a transit point for its \"Double Sunrise\" flights from Australia to London, UK. Although Qantas no longer flies to Colombo, it has indicated the possibility of starting Perth-Colombo flights using next-generation long-range aircraft.</p><p>The President discussed the multi-polarity of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), shaped by events such as the Bandung Conference in 1955, and the subsequent Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which opposed Big Power rivalry. Incidentally, NAM's 19th Heads of State Summit took place recently in Kampala, Uganda. The President's speech outlined various diplomatic frameworks and groupings that have emerged in the IOR, including the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) (of which Sri Lanka is the Chair now), Indo-Pacific, Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), QUAD (military alliance comprising Australia, US, Japan and India) and an expanding BRICS, along with increased militarisation by several countries, leading to a complex geopolitical landscape.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe cited the growing strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean, particularly in light of geopolitical shifts and the influence of major powers such as Russia, China, and Iran.</p><p>He addressed challenges such as attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi rebels, piracy, and threats to Freedom of Navigation (FON), emphasising the need for collective action to address these issues.</p><p>He said it was important to address the climate crisis, in the context of the Indian Ocean's vulnerability to Global Warming and rising sea levels. He proposed initiatives such as the Tropical Belt Initiative (TBI) and the International Climate Change University (ICCU) to mitigate the effects of Climate Change and ensure Climate Justice for vulnerable countries.</p><p>He called for unity among IOR countries to address shared challenges and create a safer, more sustainable ocean environment. Sri Lanka held the second edition of the event in 2017.</p><p>The event aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. The conference was organised by the India Foundation in collaboration with India's Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and Perth-US Asia Centre.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Prof. Munasinghe has developed innovative concepts such as the integrative, trans-disciplinary Sustainomics framework, Balanced Inclusive Green Growth (BIGG) and Millennium Consumption Goals (MCG).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a candid interview with the , Prof. Munasinghe shared his thoughts about impacts of climate change, sustainable post-pandemic recovery, and his vision for Sri Lanka.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q How do you feel about receiving the 2021 Blue Planet Prize?</p><p>I felt deeply grateful and honoured when I received the award notification from Japan, and even a little surprised - why me, since there were other colleagues worldwide, who also had outstanding credentials. While meditating that morning (which I have done daily for over 50 years), I realized how the award is not just one person's achievement, and how indebted I am to so many who have contributed generously to my intellectual development and emotional intelligence, including teachers, mentors, colleagues, family and friends. The pressures of COVID-19 further remind us that social ties are invaluable, and should never be taken for granted.</p><p>It was quite encouraging that the award committee has specifically acknowledged several key concepts I developed and their practical application worldwide, during almost 5 decades, including the Sustainomics framework, sustainable development triangle (economy, environment, society), balanced inclusive green growth (BIGG), and Millennium Consumption Goals (MCG).</p><p>On reflection, my research interests have evolved from basic disciplines like engineering, physics and economics,</p><p>to application sectors like energy, water, transport, ICT, and environmental resources, and finally to multidisciplinary topics like poverty, disasters, climate change and sustainable development. This eclectic personal journey helped me develop Sustainomics, as a holistic, trans-disciplinary methodology.Drawing on my past work and the global platform provided by the prestigious Blue Planet Prize, I hope to continue my modest efforts to make our planet more sustainable for all.</p><p>Q You have worked many years in the fields of sustainable development and climate change. Are you satisfied with how humanity has performed in bringing about changes in these two areas?</p><p>The current world status is summed up by the two major international achievements of 2015 -- the United Nations 2030 Agenda and sustainable development goals (SDG), and the COP21 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The progress made so far is disappointing.In fact, we are even further behind compared to the high hopes I had when we launched the historic Agenda 21 and UNFCCC at the 1992 UN earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Q Indeed, the UN SDGs and COP21 Paris Agreement of 2015 are major global accords where your research and applications made significant contributions. What's the impact such events have had in helping us to address sustainable development and climate change issues?</p><p>Both agreements are early steps on a long human journey towards sustainability and climate stability. However, we have failed to achieve significant milestones in recent years. Progress on the SDG are quite limited at best, and country pledges on carbon mitigation are far below the levels needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5Cdeg or even 2Cdeg, which are considered dangerous thresholds. Furthermore, adaptation efforts are also inadequate to protect the poorest and most vulnerable, who will unfairly suffer the harshest climate impacts. Basically, climate justice has been ignored, which requires that the rich (who caused the problem) should bear the main cost burden, while the poorest must be protected from impacts.</p><p>Q You introduced the key concept of 'Sustainomics'. Tell us a little about it...</p><p>Sustainomics is a comprehensive and integrated trans-disciplinary framework, which I first presented at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. It sets out a step-by-step methodology to make development more sustainable, based on balanced consideration of economic, social and environmental concerns, using trans-disciplinary thinking and a range of analytical tools. During the past two decades, the approach has been successfully applied practically, worldwide. The four core principles are:</p><p>1. The sustainable development triangle --integrating and harmonizing the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental). Any critical sustainable development issue like poverty may be analysed in terms of all three dimensions, and their interactions - for example, the poor are economically destitute,socially disempowered, and live in environmentally degraded neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the social and economic interaction results in increased inequalities.</p><p>2. 'Making Development More Sustainable' (MDMS), which is essentially using a step-by-step method that empowers people to take immediate action without waiting for instructions from leaders. You and I could simply identify and eliminate many existing unsustainable activities - by conserving energy and water, planting trees, etc.</p><p>3. Transcending traditional boundaries in our thinking, to bring about sustainable behavioural changes in the longer term. Replacing unsustainable values like greed with sound ethical principles, especially among the young, must go hand in hand with raising awareness across every sector of society.Implementing sustainable development requires cooperation that transcends stakeholder boundaries - across government, business and civil society.Trans-disciplinary analysis is essential, and we must transcend geographic scaleswith global level planning and temporal scales over decades or centuries.</p><p>4. Full life cycle, integrated,long-term analysis to ensure implementation of sustainable development activities, especially consumption and production -- that covers the entire value/supply chain, identifying hot spots where process innovation can improve sustainability, reducing material use, and eliminating waste.</p><p>Q Many are of the view that the COVID-19 pandemic helped restore the environment and give nature a break. Do you think the pandemic is a blessing in disguise or has it posed more challenges in achieving the SDG?</p><p>The term \"anthropause\" has been coined to describe temporary improvements in various environmental indicators (especially carbon dioxide emissions) that followed COVID-19 lockdowns. However, I strongly disagree that a disease that has already killed millions worldwide and greatly increased poverty, inequality, unemployment and hardship, could be called a \"blessing in disguise\". On the contrary, the pandemic should be considered a cautionary lesson about Mother Nature's harsh response to human environmental abuse - I have described 9 lessons learned, in a 2020 journal article: \"COVID-19 and sustainable development\".</p><p>One important lesson is that the anthropause is an unsustainable outcome, because it violates the first core concept of Sustainomics, by severely unbalancing the sustainable development triangle. While the pandemic may have temporarily improved environmental conditions, the economic and social costs are very high, with impacts falling disproportionately on the poorest and most vulnerable. Indeed, the achievement of many key SDG have been set back significantly due to socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.</p><p>Fortunately, there are other and more benign ways to reduce environmental resource use, without drastically reducing living standards, through an approach called the \"balanced inclusive green growth\" (BIGG) path, as described below.</p><p>Q Can a country become fully sustainable in this competitive global environment, particularly in the face of a pandemic?</p><p>The pandemic is just one shorter term problem among many others (like poverty, inequality, environmental degradation and conflicts), on a rocky long term path towards sustainable development. SDG12 on Responsible Consumption and Production is a key sustainability requirement for which the Millennium Consumption Goals (MCG) I introduced at the UN in 2010, was a key building block.The MCG sought to reduce the unsustainable consumption of the rich which was exceeding the sustainable eco-capacity of the planet, while leaving inadequate resources to reduce poverty and inequality. It facilitates balanced inclusive green growth (BIGG -- based on Sustainomics), to help countries become more sustainable. Several countries are trying to pursue BIGG paths.</p><p>Rich nations at point C are already unsustainable and exceeding safe ecological limits. They should take one step towards sustainability by first balancing economy and environment. They can reach sustainable point E by reducing environmental resource use without lowering their quality of life,as envisaged in the MCG--using new resource efficient technologies, lifestyle changes, and other measures, to dematerialize modern economies. Meanwhile, emerging nations at intermediate point B should learn from the past, innovate and avoid exceeding safe limits. They could go through the Green Growth (GG) tunnel to also reach point E, avoiding the unsustainable path of the rich countries.</p><p>However, we need to go beyond Green Growth, to ensure that social goals are met. In the second step,the BIGG path also adds pro-poor and inclusive policies to Green Growth-thereby fully harmonizing the sustainable development triangle: economy, environment and society. Furthermore, the same BIGG path is generally available for other types of resources like energy, food and water.</p><p>Q Like every other country Sri Lanka too is a victim of climate change. Has climate change changed Sri Lanka's weather patterns, food production cycles, and lifestyles?</p><p>It is too early to identify major impacts in Sri Lanka that are unambiguously attributable to climate change, but some preliminary trends in temperature and precipitation are emerging. We experience warming of around 0.8degC during the 20th century, with temperature rise accelerating toward the end. This trend will continue. Meanwhile, annual precipitation has decreased about 7% in the late 20thcentury, compared to the period 1931-1960. However, future rainfall is projected to rise, especially in the hills.</p><p>Extreme events and disaster risks will rise, with future increases in heat waves and permanent (chronic) heat stress. The intensity of extreme rainfall events is likely to rise, with more flooding (both inland and coastal areas) and landslides (especially in the hill country). By the 2030s, floods would affect thousands of people, with annual GDP losses exceeding US$300 million. Paradoxically, droughts will worsen especially in the dry zone, with reduced rainfall, river basin flows and reservoir storage. Finally, cyclone frequency has declined recently, but their intensity has increased, underlining the need for future disaster risk management. More broadly, nine vulnerable sectors were identified in recent consultations -- food security, water, coastal sector, health, human settlements, bio-diversity, tourism and recreation, export development and industry-energy-transportation.</p><p>Q What three things should Sri Lanka keep in mind, as it is becoming a geopolitically important location with developments such as the Port City?</p><p>In order to become a \"sustainable, upper middle income Indian Ocean hub\" following the BIGG path, as envisaged in the Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision report (described below), we should aim to:</p><p>1. Maximize the geo-strategic advantages of our unique location and emulate the success of ports like Dubai to the west and Singapore to the East, by taking the lead in focused areas like digital and financial technology and banking, port and maritime facilities, high-end tourism(nature- and culture-based), etc., while greatly upgrading our infrastructure services in critical areas like energy, water, communications, skilled workforce (especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics - STEM), etc.</p><p>2. Provide improved governance, including policy consistency, fair and investor-friendly regulations, convenience in doing business, tax incentives, etc.</p><p>3. Follow a strictly non-aligned foreign policy - carefully balancing major international forces, supporting a multi-polar world order, and riding the wave of rising Asian dominance in this century (paying attention to China, India, Japan, Russia and other emerging Asian powers), while maintaining cordial relations with our major markets in the west.</p><p>Q You are also the first Sri Lankan to share the Nobel Peace Prize. Is there enough space in Sri Lanka for intellectuals to grow and contribute to the wellbeing of the country? Or has Sri Lanka continued to facilitate a brain drain? Tell us your experiences.</p><p>Sri Lankans have consistently excelled internationally -- having enjoy ededucational advantages much superior to most comparable developing countries. However, this edge is now eroding and we need to seriously revamp our entire educational system to compete in the modern world. Focusing on STEM subjects is critical, but new areas like emotional intelligence, sustainability, and multi-disciplinarity are also important to produce practical, rational, well-rounded citizens who can contribute to sustainable development along the BIGG path (as detailed in the Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision report described below).</p><p>The brain drain is not unique to Sri Lanka. We must strive to make our country attractive to our youth, so that they either stay here and grow intellectually, or return after a stint abroad bringing fresh intellectual and financial capital to their motherland. Above all, building a true Sri Lankan identity from an early age, will help enormously.</p><p>One small practical contribution is through my institute (MIND). Since 2000, our scholarships have funded almost 500 undergraduates. We also hosted many graduate students as \"fellows\", and supported some school-goers (especially 2004 Tsunami-orphans). We maintain contact via digital technology with this MIND family, as \"ambassadors of sustainable development\" who will transform Sri Lanka and the world. To reach young minds, I also continue to deliver sustainable development university courses, public lectures, webinars, etc. To reach millions of young hearts, I helped found Sustainomusica (at the Rio+20 Earth Summit in 2012) -- a musicians network harmonizing the planet by creating \"music for sustainability\".</p><p>Q Where do you see Sri Lanka in another 10-20 years' time? As a country that braces to become a sustainable nation or a country that has moved away from it?</p><p>Sri Lanka could become a world leader in sustainable development, provided we immediately start following the comprehensive recommendations in 2019 Presidential Expert Committee (PEC) report on \"Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision and Strategic Path\".</p><p>This document describes the country status, key issues and opportunities relating to sustainable development, future priorities and targets, and new initiatives and options to achieve ambitious goals by 2030. The report empowers citizens, and provides guidance to government, civil society and business. The key findings are essentially robust and neutral, helping to build the national consensus and a truly Sri Lankan identity -- irrespective of ethnicity, race, religion or political affiliation. The report could continue to provide strategic guidance to all present and future governments, while strengthening sustainability and national unity.</p><p>By 2030 Sri Lanka would become a sustainable, upper middle income Indian Ocean hub that is economically prosperous, competitive and advanced; environmentally green and flourishing; and socially inclusive, harmonious, peaceful and just.</p><p>Q How can one expect to see change from individual, national and global perspectives?</p><p>It is important to start with oneself, before trying to save the planet- by \"harmonizing the personal sustainability triangle\"and becoming a mature, content and well-balanced individual. There are three key elements including: (1) good career and income: (2) robust physical health; and (3) thriving social links including family and friends;to build a wholesome and decent persona, having both emotional and mental intelligence. Balancing these three internal elements will create a global population that can build a sustainable planet more effectively.</p><p>From a planetary perspective, the impacts of global issues like COVID-19 and climate change are \"mother nature's\" feedback loops, reminding us that human activities are environmentally unsustainable. We need to correct the \"unhealthy\" relationship between ecological and socio economic systems. If we do not change, it will not be the end of the world. The earth will certainly continue as it has for billions of years, but perhaps with a diminished human presence or none - a relatively minor blip in the greater scheme of things.</p><p>However, from our narrower, human-centric viewpoint, matters look more serious. Returning to a pre-pandemic, business-as-usual path is unsustainable. Adopting limited reforms (due to inertia of existing power structures) will merely stave off disaster temporarily. Only a transformative path like BIGG offers a safe and sustainable future for all. By adopting rational, science-based approaches and working together, we can make this third (and right) choice, to avoid enormous suffering and millions of unnecessary deaths in the future.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

It is a biodiversity hotspot; however, a significant proportion of our endemic species are diminishing.</p><p>Sri Lanka is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. The country experiences on average US $ 313 million in annual disaster losses,\" said Environment Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe.</p><p>Yet, Sri Lanka has been lauded as a success story for achieving high levels of human development while pursuing low-carbon growth, he added.</p><p>Sri Lanka has submitted the Climate Prosperity Plan to the UNFCCC, under which the country's long-term low GHG emission strategy requires US $ 26 billion.</p><p>The island nation needs US $ 6.5 billion per year, if it is to successfully mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p><p>Sri Lanka is only just getting its bearings following the worst economic crisis the country has ever seen. It is evident that Sri Lanka and many other countries in the tropics with identical cases require concerted support from the global community.</p><p>The tropics are a catalytic accelerator of solutions to the triple planetary crisis-investments in the tropical belt are investments towards global progress on this front.</p><p>Meanwhile, National Experts Committee on Climate Change Adaptation Member Prof. Buddhi Marambe stressed that Sri Lanka needs a paradigm shift, moving beyond geo-political differences and boundaries.</p><p>\"Investing in the tropical belt could be a unique and effective way to combat the triple planetary crisis. Higher investments in renewable energy, nature-based solutions and pollution control in the tropical belt can lead to significant, transformative changes across the world,\" he said.</p><p>In place is a Tropical Belt Climate Ambition Plan and a proposed debt relief for low-income economies within the belt. The two efforts are poised to make a substantial contribution to advancing the Secretary General's Acceleration Agenda.</p><p>As Sri Lanka prepares for COP28, the Tropical Belt Climate Ambition Plan is not just a global call to action but also a demonstration that tangible and ambitious action to credibly cut emissions and deliver climate justice is possible and practical, noted UNDP Sri Lanka Resident Representative Azusa Kubota.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The focus was on Climate Justice, Climate Finance, Climate Adaptation, Loss and Damage, Climate Technology, etc. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, accompanied by three ministers and two opposition MPs, was joined by twenty young participants. This was the largest-ever Lankan delegation at a climate summit. His technical delegation consisted of 15 negotiators and ministry officials. It seemed a bash. A night at the hotel was US$300 and upwards.</p><p>Among the delegates was Elilini Hoole of Jesus College Cambridge who was sponsored by her Department through The Centre for Climate Repair. She made do with Air B&amp;B accommodation, given that 97,000 delegates were registered for in-person presence (not counting the many who presented online).</p><p>James Perkins, Head of Research Excellence, British Council, expressed in November his delight in announcing a new partnership supporting an international early career research programme at the University of Cambridge on community-led climate resilience. Both awards went to women.</p><p>One was to Elilini Hoole who, Perkins said, is looking at the intersectional experiences of women farm operators in Sri Lanka navigating the challenges of aridification and male-centric agricultural marketplaces. Elilini researches development-oriented climate policies in support of vulnerable communities and has advised on and designed developmental strategies for climate responses in vulnerable regions affected by conflict and climate disasters.</p><p>Elilini's wide-ranging experience includes a) Middle East and Eurasia Regional Proposal Development and Grants Coordinator at Save the Children International in Jordan, b) Refugee proposal development at Impact Initiatives in Geneva and C) Associate Director (Grants) at World Vision in Sri Lanka. She has also taught Grant Proposal Development at Baldaeus Theological College in Trincomalee.</p><p>As a programme development service consultant, Elilini's focus is on cultivating high-impact and risk conscious projects to optimise green outcomes in complex settings. Her accurate and analytic insights come from 10+ years' experience overseeing $338.4 million in programme development for 25 organizations in 20 developing countries. She has a high demonstrable success rate in her raising $70 million through institutional donor proposals, reflecting her deep understanding of donor procedures and the ability to bridge multi-partner priorities.</p><p>Elilini made 5 presentations at COP28 and had the daunting task of chairing an Expert Panel that included Princess Esmeralda of Belgium. All speakers stuck to their allotted time and did not need the chair's intervention. The Panel was on Furthering Technology Transfer under the Paris Agreement to Drive Carbon Dioxide Removal and Effective Adaptation at the Climate Law and Governance Initiative.</p><p>Elilini works under Shailaja Fennell, Professor of Economic Security and Resilience at the Department of Land Economy, University of Cambridge. After she handed in her doctoral thesis on Agriculture, and Economic and Social Justice Policy, she is employed there supervising research students.</p><p>She is moved to action by the sad lot of women in Sri Lanka. Her work ethic is driven by that empathy to create opportunities for women. She is an old-girl of Methodist College Colombo and is the daughter of her proud parents, Professor Dushyanthi Hoole and Professor</p><p>Ratnajeevan Hoole.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Our achievements in different sectors like renewable energy, energy efficiency, afforestation, energy conservation, and Mission LiFE are testament to the commitment of our people towards Mother Earth. In keeping with our civilizational ethos, India has always laid emphasis on climate action even as we pursue social and economic development. During our G20 presidency, climate was a high priority. The New Delhi Leaders' Declaration includes numerous concrete steps on climate action and sustainable development. I look forward to the COP-28 taking forward the consensus on these issues.\"</p><p>As per the departure statement, COP28 presents an opportunity to assess the progress under the Paris Agreement and establish a plan for future climate action.

Minister Sabry says the present economic path will have to be followed by several more years to emerge out of the crisis Sri Lanka is facing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following are excerpts from the interview:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q: The President has undertaken several official foreign trips recently. What positive responses have we garnered on the international front?</p><p>A: The most significant positive international response we have received thus far is the agreement to debt restructuring by 14 countries of the Paris Club, along with countries such as India, Japan, and China. The completion of a lengthy process in a remarkably short time is a significant triumph for our country.</p><p>Moreover, we have successfully fostered positive bilateral relations with Western countries like France and Germany, as well as with Middle Eastern nations such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p>This has not only led to the creation of job opportunities but has also initiated discussions on potential investment opportunities.</p><p>The President is adeptly managing these international affairs. His leadership skills, knowledge of international law, and experience in international relations have been instrumental in effectively handling these matters.</p><p>Q: What notable advancements were achieved during the recent visit of the President to Dubai for COP28?</p><p>A: The trip yielded numerous benefits for us. While Climate Change is widely acknowledged as a significant concern, concrete solutions have been elusive. We put forward the idea of establishing a Climate Justice Forum (CJF) to address this issue. The proposed Forum aims to unite countries, allowing them to collectively advocate for Climate Justice. As a nation with a strong voice dating back to before 1983, this trip provided an opportunity for us to reclaim a substantial role in such initiatives.</p><p>During the visit, we garnered positive attention from the global community. Engaging in discussions with several world leaders, including the Presidents of Brazil, Greece and France and regional leaders, further strengthened our diplomatic ties. Additionally, productive dialogues with the investment communities in Dubai allowed us to elaborate on the investment opportunities present in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Q: Has the Government successfully concluded the second phase of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and when is the expected release date for the second loan installment?</p><p>A: I am optimistic that the second loan installment from the IMF will be received this month. This is expected to instill a greater sense of confidence in our country within the international community.</p><p>A comparative analysis with the preceding year will serve as a gauge to assess the effectiveness and correctness of the path we have chosen. We have successfully managed to control inflation, eliminate queues, and reopen opportunities for tourists to visit. When comparing these outcomes, it appears evident that we are moving in the right direction.</p><p>Q: How positively has the Official Creditor Committee responded to the restructuring of Sri Lanka's foreign debt, and to what degree can this be considered a successful outcome influenced by the second installment of the IMF?</p><p>A: From the initial loan installment to the second, our journey has been exceptionally challenging. Nations such as Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Lebanon, which underwent similarly difficult paths, experienced an economic collapse lasting approximately 10-15 years. Considering our successful navigation of this demanding journey through prudent management, we have fared well in comparison.</p><p>Q: What economic benefits and support does our country expect to receive from the second loan tranche provided by the IMF?</p><p>A: Firstly, the receipt of the second IMF tranche sends a message globally that our country is on the right economic path. Subsequently, upon receiving these funds, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are likely to follow suit, providing additional financial support. This, in turn, allows for a portion of the funds to be utilized in supporting the National Treasury's budget. If successful, this approach could mitigate the need to purchase high-interest Bonds, enabling the acquisition of loans at a more favourable rate.</p><p>Subsequently, the expectation is that market loan interest rates will experience a significant decrease. With interest rates potentially reduced to 10-11 percent, businesses could seize the opportunity to secure loans and initiate new ventures through available financial facilities. The second loan installment is seen as a substantial aid in fortifying and revitalising the economy.</p><p>Q: How is the current process of restructuring foreign debt unfolding, and what is the global response to it?</p><p>A: The response has been positive thus far. Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) has been completed. Encouraging responses have also been received regarding the management of bilateral credit, representing two major categories of international credit. The second category involves discussions about loans secured from the private sector in Sri Lanka, facilitated by Lazard, our financial advisor.</p><p>The debt restructuring is expected to be completed by the first quarter of the upcoming year, allowing the country to resume foreign debt repayments and potentially emerge from financial distress. Information received thus far indicates a strong willingness from Japan and some other countries to make significant investments in our country.</p><p>Q: Can the Government announce a specific timeframe regarding the repayment of the loans?</p><p>A: Following debt restructuring, the priority is debt repayment. The aim is to conclude the debt restructuring by the first quarter of next year, initiating bilateral debt repayments in the second quarter.</p><p>The approach involves prioritising low-interest payments and gradually settling the agreed-upon loans. This strategy is anticipated to contribute to the reduction of the overall debt, with the ultimate goal of revitalising the economy for a substantial and long-term recovery.</p><p>Q: The Opposition claims that the Government is imposing various hardships on the people under the guise of IMF conditions. Your comment?</p><p>A: Whether or not the IMF conditions are imposed, our options are rather limited. When income does not align with expenditure, the only recourse generally is currency devaluation.</p><p>This is indeed exemplified by the rise of the US Dollar from Rs. 200 to almost Rs. 400 in just over one year. Inflation surged, and the economy faced collapse, forcing us into taking challenging decisions. Despite Opposition criticism, the question remains: what viable alternatives do they propose?</p><p>Q: Is the Government on track to achieve its goal of boosting State revenue through an increase in income tax?</p><p>A: That is our aspiration, albeit a challenging one. However, it is crucial to reach the desired tax targets. Failing to establish the necessary foundation for a sustainable economy could lead to the collapse of our economy. To safeguard our country, certain sacrifices may be inevitable.</p><p>Q: Do you share the perspective that, irrespective of the Government in office until 2027, a certain economic direction is unavoidable, as asserted by economic experts who contend that there might be no feasible alternative?</p><p>A: Expert economists emphasise that deviating from the current path could lead to an economic collapse, potentially worse than anticipated. The consequence might involve public dissatisfaction, manifesting in street protests similar to those witnessed last year. Making challenging decisions is deemed necessary to guide the country in the right direction.</p><p>Q: What recent decisions have been made regarding future Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)?</p><p>A: Following any investment, the anticipation is for a return in profits. Recognising this situation, the President has taken steps to prepare the required groundwork. Amendments are being made to facilitate this process, with an expectation that the essential groundwork will be established through the second installment of the IMF.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

We're still stuck where we are. So we've proposed to think out of the box, because you are having a crisis, if you are not getting results on the present path, then we have to look at something new\", the Head of State said.</p><p>Speaking on the proposals presented, President Wickremesinghe revealed that Sri Lanka is currently spearheading numerous initiatives in this regard, including the Climate Justice Forum, which is expected to be presented before the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) conference in 2024, and the International Climate Change University (ICCU), which Sri Lanka plans on hosting with support from stakeholders.</p><p>\"There has to be capacity building, there has to be also a focal point where research goes on. This is more a university for postgraduate research as well as training of officials\", President Wickremesinghe said, adding that it is likely to draw several similarities to the East-West Center in Hawaii.</p><p>Moreover, the President also spoke of the Tropical Belt Initiative, which focuses on harnessing commercial investments in vital natural resources within the tropical belt, such as forests, swamps, and mangroves.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, we need trillions of dollars\", President Wickremesinghe said, explaining that in light of the fact that no government would be willing to, nor capable of, sourcing such funds annually, it is crucial that such an investment be commercially viable.</p><p>\"At any case, governments can't raise the trillions that are needed. We have to get it from the private market, we have to find a way of unlocking it\", he emphasised.</p><p>President Wickremesinghe also shed light on the collaboration with the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to promote the blue economy and create a sustainable Indian Ocean, highlighting that the combination of the Tropical Belt Initiative and the efforts in the Indian Ocean is envisioned to become the world's largest global sink for carbon.</p><p>When asked as to the response received from other nations, if any, with regard to the proposals, President Wickremesinghe stated that discussions with world leaders, including the Presidents of Maldives, Kenya, Brazil and Ghana showcased widespread interest in the initiatives.</p><p>\"I think there will be sufficient support\", he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking on Sri Lanka's ongoing recovery from its infamous economic crisis in 2022, President Wickremesinghe assured that the country is expecting positive economic growth next year.</p><p>Speaking on its debt restructuring programme, the Head of State further said, \"We've finished the negotiations with our official creditors, with the Paris Club, with India and with China, and we anticipate that the official creditors committee will come up with a positive statement at the end of the year\", adding that Sri Lanka is only left with having to negotiate with the private creditors.</p><p>Below is the full interview:</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Ada Derana.

The threat of debt distress or debt default is further exacerbated by the climate crisis, which causes additional risks and requires significant investment to fulfil national obligations and build long-term resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For climate-vulnerable developing countries facing serious debt-related challenges-including Sri Lanka-it is therefore crucial to understand the climate-debt nexus and identify ways to reconcile the need for green economic growth, debt sustainability, and climate action.</p><p>Connecting debt and climate change</p><p>'Sovereign debt' describes funds borrowed by a country from a creditor, which could be, for example, another country, a multilateral institution, or the private sector. The resulting debt must be repaid with interest over a specified period in line with contractual terms and conditions. If a country faces difficulties in servicing its debt on time or in full, it experiences debt distress, which can lead to debt default and a range of associated financial, political, and/or reputational costs and consequences.</p><p>Climate change can interlink with debt in several ways. On the one hand, climate impacts and climate-induced loss and damage can exacerbate countries' debt problems by forcing them to borrow funds for relief, recovery, and reconstruction efforts that exceed their available budget allocations. On the other hand, high and/or unsustainable debt constrains the fiscal space of governments and hinders them from funding adaptation and resilience-building measures, rendering them more vulnerable in the mid and long term. Furthermore, climate vulnerability and lack of resilience can also increase debt ratings and the costs of borrowing, especially from private creditors.</p><p>Existing debt also reduces the ability of countries to invest in climate action and fulfil their commitments under the Paris Agreement, such as those submitted via the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In some cases, high debt can incentivise governments to look at unsustainable options with higher short-term returns, such as fossil fuels or the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. Additionally, a sizeable proportion of global climate finance is currently provided in the form of loans, thereby creating additional debt for the countries receiving it.</p><p>Other considerations related to climate change and debt could include the supply side and existing subsidies for sectors such as energy and agriculture; the role of climate technology transfer and deployment in creating debt; legal frameworks and governance gaps; the integration of climate-related indicators into debt sustainability and financial health assessments; and relevant climate negotiation agenda items, such as the loss and damage fund, adaptation finance, or the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, which will be a centrepiece of this year's World Climate Conference (COP29).</p><p>Responding to unsustainable debt</p><p>Creditors and debtors have a range of instruments and mechanisms that can address debt distress and enhance debt sustainability. This includes, for example, debt suspension and climate-resilient debt clauses; debt restructuring, rescheduling, or refinancing; debt cancellation; debt swaps (including debt-for-climate and debt-for-nature swaps); insurance mechanisms (such as parametric insurance or sovereign risk pools); bonds (including catastrophe bonds, resilience bonds, or green and blue bonds); and tax reform.</p><p>However, many debt-related challenges remain and are exacerbated by the worsening climate crisis. There is a need to strengthen the way in which the interlinkages between debt and climate change are addressed at the global as well as national level.</p><p>A research study conducted by non-profit think tank SLYCAN Trust found that out of 194 countries which have submitted their NDCS-core climate commitments under the Paris Agreement-only around 12% directly refer to debt or financial reform. Most of the countries that include references to these aspects are in Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia-Pacific, and Africa, highlighting the urgency of this issue particularly for countries of the Global South.</p><p>Revamping the global financial architecture</p><p>In the last few years, several proposals for reforming or improving the global financial architecture have been brought forward. This includes the Bridgetown Initiative, the Paris Pact for People and Planet, the Ubuntu Initiative, or the V20 Accra-Marrakech Agenda, as well as existing efforts such as the Common Framework for Debt Treatment, the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative, the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable, or special funds and initiatives under the IMF.</p><p>These proposals address aspects such as an overhauled multilateral legal framework; improved access to emergency liquidity for climate-affected developing countries; debt forgiveness or suspension; incorporation of climate risks and investments into credit ratings and lending criteria; climate-contingent debt instruments and clauses; or a reform of financial institutions and arrangements.</p><p>The last meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (COP28), which ended in December 2023 in Dubai, saw the launch of initiatives such as the Leader's Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework, the Joint Taskforce on International Taxation, the Global Expert Review on Debt, Nature, and Climate, or the Climate Justice Forum announced by Sri Lanka.</p><p>The COP28 cover decision (the 'UAE Consensus') includes a reference to developing countries affected by 'increasing impacts of climate change compounded by difficult macroeconomic circumstances,' and the growing gap between their financial needs and the means provided to them. However, it doesn't explicitly mention debt and doesn't yet directly address debt sustainability through key workstreams on adaptation, loss and damage, climate finance, or the Global Stocktake.</p><p>Key considerations and the path ahead</p><p>Debt, lending, and economic investment and development operate in an ecosystem of bi- and multilateral legal frameworks, institutions, and agreements. The climate crisis and the need for ambitious climate action has significant implications for debt sustainability, financial health, and the balance sheets of vulnerable developing countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT1902202400010038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCG-1GM1-JCH9-G4R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 19, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Initiative &amp;

Over the past few years, the country has consistently ranked amongst the top 10 nations at risk of extreme weather events in the Global Climate Risk Index. In the last month alone, Sri Lanka has been hit by heavy rainfall and strong winds which caused floods and landslides that affected livelihoods.</p><p>Marc-Andr\u00e9 Franche</p><p>With the risk of other extreme weather events and climate-related disasters continuing to increase, the Government of Sri Lanka is scaling up its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change under the Paris Agreement. Central to this approach is the recognition that adaptation and mitigation strategies represent opportunities rather than obstacles to sustainable development and green economic growth.</p><p>On the global stage, Sri Lanka has demonstrated this determination to drive positive change for the planet and explore new avenues for international collaboration. During COP28, which concluded last month in Dubai, Sri Lanka's President Ranil Wickremesinghe launched proposals for three new initiatives-a climate justice forum, a tropical belt initiative, and an international climate change university. The UN stands ready to support Sri Lanka to step up towards a more sustainable, greener future.</p><p>Joining forces on the ground</p><p>With COP28 behind us, and the landmark declaration to transition away from fossil fuels adopted, attention now turns to climate action at the country level. In Sri Lanka, our UN team has been supporting the Government to do just that; working with national partners to translate its ambitious global commitments into bolder impact on the ground.</p><p>Natural resource management, climate resilience and environmental sustainability sit at the heart of these joint efforts, as set out in the new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2023-2027. Under this framework, we support the delivery of climate programmes and initiatives that have already reached thousands of people across the country. For instance, a water management project that upgrades irrigation and drinking water systems, or a pilot project for solar-powered water pumping that uses natural and renewable resources, thereby boosting rural communities' water security.</p><p>Other initiatives target policy changes, including the development of a green national tourism policy, or support in developing the National Disaster Management Plan for 2023-2030. In addition, our UN team closely collaborates with the Government to update and implement its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in an effort to raise national ambition to align with global climate goals.</p><p>Tackling interconnected crises</p><p>Our support to the country is rooted in the understanding that our climate challenges are closely interconnected, and that we can't tackle one part of the 'triple planetary crisis' without advancing action on the other.</p><p>Implementing resilient farming techniques, such as efficient water management and soil conservation practices, is essential for farmers</p><p>For example, with Sri Lanka being a global biodiversity hotspot-we have supported the Government to establish a national policy to safeguard its rich biodiversity in environmentally sensitive areas outside the official Protected Areas. Other pioneering initiatives bring together commercial banks and other experts to fund biodiversity conservation in Sri Lanka through a sustainable financing structure.</p><p>Building synergies between food security and sustainable agricultural practices is another important priority-and was emphasized as a key concern in Sri Lanka's humanitarian response plan last year. Implementing resilient farming techniques, such as efficient water management and soil conservation practices, is essential for Sri Lankan farmers to withstand extreme climate events, including severe monsoons and droughts, which impact crop yields.</p><p>Financing the path to reach climate goals</p><p>To make Sri Lanka's ambitious climate goals a reality, the question of sustainable financing is key. This is why we've been working to expand Sri Lanka's access to innovative climate financing instruments including green bonds and debt swaps, which provide investors and creditors with incentives to finance and participate in environmentally-beneficial projects. This is especially important given the limited public resources and concessional financing available in the current economic climate. Our UN team has also supported Sri Lanka's access to global climate funds, such as the Green Climate Fund and Global Environmental Facility, to finance its low-carbon and climate-resilient development.</p><p>To mobilise rapid support, the UN in Sri Lanka is leveraging its country-level SDG Fund to undertake joint programming, which has already helped enhance the climate resilience, disaster risk management, food security and well-being of the most vulnerable communities.</p><p>With the impact of climate change more obvious than ever, there's no time for complacency. As Sri Lanka looks towards its own sustainable future, our UN team stands ready to advance this vision at the global, national and local levels, and to present a strong, coordinated response at the upcoming Summit of the Future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1401202400160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B3M-7NG1-F00C-62FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 14, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Initiative &amp;

I thank the Australian Government, for the hospitality afforded to all of us. I also thank the India Foundation for once again bringing us together. The theme of this Conference - \"Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean\"- could not be timelier and more appropriate.</p><p>The Australasian continent is unique in that it has borders with both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Oceans. Perth played a crucial role in the history of Sri Lanka - Australia relations. During World War II, Royal Canadian Air Force, Catalina Flying Boats, traversed the expanse of the Indian Ocean, connecting Perth with Koggala Air Base in Ceylon. The only air link between the Indian sub-continent and Australia. Known as flights of the double sunrise, they operated a non-stop route upto 32 hours in radio silence, to ensure the success of a critical air route during World War II for the Allies.</p><p>The Japanese attacks in April 1942 on the Indian Ocean specially Ceylon was described by Churchill as the most dangerous moment of the war highlighting the importance of the Indian Ocean to the British Empire. I was just talking with Dr. Balakrishnan and he said there were no carrier battles in the Indian Ocean for the simple reason that the Japanese sank the only British carrier.</p><p>Let me highlight a few important developments which I hope will make a contribution to your deliberations.</p><p>Firstly, historically speaking, the Indian Ocean is multipolar and has resisted domination by a single power. This multipolarity is a reflection of the essence of the Indian Ocean region and its people. As Asia emerged from colonialism the newly independent countries of Asia ie. Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Burma and Pakistan convened the Bandung Conference in 1955 to oppose colonialism in all its forms. The conference declaration to oppose big power rivalry in turn led to the Non Aligned Movement. Since then the Indian Ocean region has been influenced by the spirit of Bandung. It has never became a part of the US Hub and Spoke system.</p><p>The past two decades has seen the emergence of diverse framings of the Indian Ocean region and a flurry of diplomatic activity articulating various policy positions, tilts, and frameworks. What is clear is that no single, objective geopolitical construct has emerged, and we are left instead with a contested vision with multiple interpretations.</p><p>The key frameworks that have emerged include in addition to IORA, the Indo-Pacific, the BRI, the QUAD, and the BRICS. There are also regional organizations including ASEAN, ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), ACD (Asia Cooperation Dialogue) BIMSTEC, SAARC, GCC, Arab League, OIC, SADC, EAC and SCO that have been established. Additionally, we have the operational arrangements that deal with specific areas of cooperation including RCEP, IONS, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, IOTC, Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), MASE, four regional Information Fusion Centres (Singapore, India, Seychelles and Madagascar), and the CGPCS (Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia).</p><p>Along with these frameworks and groupings, we also see an increased militarization of the Indian Ocean which is redefining power balances and alliances. In the maritime space we see a building up in naval capabilities in India, and with USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and China all increasing their naval presence significantly. Therefore, balancing between the great power rivalries is becoming an increasingly more complex task. As a result, the space for manoeuvrability for littoral states is shrinking fast as this rivalry in the Indian Ocean region intensifies and spills over into decision making on political, economic and security issues. The proverbial question to choose one over the other is perennially hanging over us.</p><p>Secondly, the geopolitical developments have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean. The Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on Russia has resulted in the resource rich economy finding new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean. For e.g. Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa.</p><p>China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits.</p><p>The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the region. The hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time. The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony thereby further weakening the US. The Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by,</p><p>a. the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and</p><p>b. guarantees for the security of the state of Israel.</p><p>Thirdly, the recent attacks on commercial vessels by the Yemen-based Houthi rebels, is a challenge to the 'Freedom of Navigation'. We have to ensure access and mobility in the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden. In addition, we also face the threat of Somali Pirates, once again. The safety of undersea cables and critical infrastructure are also facing additional threats. The presence of drugs in the Indian Ocean and Human Smuggling has increased. IUU fishing still takes place. These threats present challenges to the Freedom of Navigation. We need to refocus on the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka offers to recommence the discussions on the Freedom of Nation in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Fourth, is expanding connectivity. According to estimates there will be an eight-fold increase in the GDP of India and Indonesia by 2050. Similar increases are expected in some of the other countries in South and West Asia. This requires additional port capacities and new transport routes. The Suez Canal may not be sufficient. In this regard India's two new connectivity initiatives are welcome. Firstly, the India (Mumbai) - Iran - Russia corridor and secondly the India (Mumbai) - Middle East - Europe corridor. Similarly, there are connectivity initiatives taking place in the Bay of Bengal. Work has already commenced on the Chongqing - Kyaukphyu corridor giving access to Western China. Thailand is planning the Kra land bridge connecting the Gulf of Siam with the Bay of Bengal. India and Sri Lanka are commencing feasibility studies on land connectivity between the two countries making Sri Lanka a Regional Logistics Hub with Colombo and Trincomalee ports available to South India.</p><p>The Indian Ocean Conference theme this year \"Towards a more stable and sustainable Indian Ocean\" highlights the two key areas which require our focus. What I have outlined before, dealt primarily with pursuing stability of the region. There is an equally serious, more immediate and existential threat that looms and that is the Climate Crisis.</p><p>Experts have revealed that the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than the other oceans around the world. The levels of warming are estimated to be three times higher than in the Pacific Ocean and coastal areas across the IOR will experience continuous rise in sea levels and face severe coastal erosion. The Indian Ocean is also rising at a level of 3.7 millimetres annually and extreme sea disasters are inevitable. The island states of the IOR are vulnerable and have to be provided with adequate resources to mitigate the effects of climate change. Changes at sea also affect monsoon patterns and in turn impact on agriculture and food security across the Indian Ocean region. They also impact on the biodiversity and in turn on food and livelihood of people of the littoral states.</p><p>The Indian Ocean presents opportunities in terms of ecology. Not only is it our biggest sink for Carbon, but it also provides potential for mitigating the climate crisis, through offshore wind, solar, and wave energy. Through seaweed farming and mangrove cultivation we can increase the sequestration of Carbon. Sustainable exploitation of our Ocean's resources is critical for our survival, as the Ocean provides for our future.</p><p>At COP 28 Sri Lanka proposed three key initiatives, (1) the Tropical Belt Initiative, including the Indian Ocean (2) The International Climate Change University and the Climate Justice Forum. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change. The Climate Justice Forum aims to accelerate financing of losses and damages and includes debt justice as an essential component of the overall solution. Any proposals for mitigation and adaptation interventions must take into account the debt component faced by Climate-vulnerable and developing countries.</p><p>We are living in uncertain times. The stability we had taken for granted since the end of WWII and the Cold War is unravelling. Globalisation is being challenged as is multilateralism. The Climate Crisis is affecting prospects for trade and economic development around the world. It is impacting on food security, livelihoods, supply chains, biodiversity and maritime transportation. Either we can wait for global developments to dictate our fate or unite, so that we may chart our own course.</p><p>Creating a safer ocean environment by building confidence and predictability among users and enhancing ocean situational awareness will be key to maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean. The main platform that can undertake this important task is the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Ensuring a peaceful and secure Indian Ocean would facilitate sustainable use of oceans for the economic and social benefit of coastal and littoral states.</p><p>An overarching architecture for the Indian Ocean that deals with critical issues is required. The basis for such a structure is already in existence including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) and the recently adopted BBNJ agreement in 2023 on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction or the High Seas Treaty.</p><p>A Code of Conduct on freedom of navigation and over flight and unimpeded commerce and similar guiding principles on dealing with the climate crisis and the sustainable use of the Indian Ocean are a necessity. Only the leaders of the IORA countries can ensure that these measures are translated to the creation of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean region.

I thank the Australian Government, for the hospitality afforded to all of us. I also thank the India Foundation for once again bringing us together. The theme of this Conference - \"Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean\"- could not be timelier and more appropriate.</p><p>The Australasian continent is unique in that it has borders with both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Oceans. Perth played a crucial role in the history of Sri Lanka - Australia relations. During World War II, Royal Canadian Air Force, Catalina Flying Boats, traversed the expanse of the Indian Ocean, connecting Perth with Koggala Air Base in Ceylon. The only air link between the Indian subcontinent and Australia. Known as flights of the double sunrise, they operated a non-stop route upto 32 hours in radio silence, to ensure the success of a critical air route during World War II for the Allies.</p><p>The Japanese attacks in April 1942 on the Indian Ocean specially Ceylon was described by Churchill as the most dangerous moment of the war highlighting the importance of the Indian Ocean to the British Empire. I was just talking with Dr. Balakrishnan and he said there were no carrier battles in the Indian Ocean for the simple reason that the Japanese sank the only British carrier.</p><p>Let me highlight a few important developments which I hope will make a contribution to your deliberations.</p><p>Firstly, historically speaking, the Indian Ocean is multipolar and has resisted domination by a single power. This multipolarity is a reflection of the essence of the Indian Ocean region and its people. As Asia emerged from colonialism the newly independent countries of Asia ie. Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Burma and Pakistan convened the Bandung Conference in 1955 to oppose colonialism in all its forms. The conference declaration to oppose big power rivalry in turn led to the Non Aligned Movement. Since then the Indian Ocean region has been influenced by the spirit of Bandung. It has never became a part of the US Hub and Spoke system.</p><p>The past two decades has seen the emergence of diverse framings of the Indian Ocean region and a flurry of diplomatic activity articulating various policy positions, tilts, and frameworks. What is clear is that no single, objective geopolitical construct has emerged, and we are left instead with a contested vision with multiple interpretations.</p><p>The key frameworks that have emerged include in addition to IORA, the Indo-Pacific, the BRI, the QUAD, and the BRICS. There are also regional organizations including ASEAN, ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), ACD (Asia Cooperation Dialogue) BIMSTEC, SAARC, GCC, Arab League, OIC, SADC, EAC and SCO that have been established. Additionally, we have the operational arrangements that deal with specific areas of cooperation including RCEP, IONS, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, IOTC, Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), MASE, four regional Information Fusion Centres (Singapore, India, Seychelles and Madagascar), and the CGPCS (Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia).</p><p>Along with these frameworks and groupings, we also see an increased militarization of the Indian Ocean which is redefining power balances and alliances. In the maritime space we see a building up in naval capabilities in India, and with USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and China all increasing their naval presence significantly. Therefore, balancing between the great power rivalries is becoming an increasingly more complex task. As a result, the space for manoeuvrability for littoral states is shrinking fast as this rivalry in the Indian Ocean region intensifies and spills over into decision-making on political, economic and security issues. The proverbial question to choose one over the other is perennially hanging over us.</p><p>Secondly, the geopolitical developments have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean. The Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on Russia has resulted in the resource-rich economy finding new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean. For example, Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa.</p><p>China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits.</p><p>The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the region. The hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time. The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony thereby further weakening the US. The Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by,</p><p>a. the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and</p><p>b. guarantees for the security of the state of Israel.</p><p>Thirdly, the recent attacks on commercial vessels by the Yemen-based Houthi rebels, is a challenge to the 'Freedom of Navigation'. We have to ensure access and mobility in the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden. In addition, we also face the threat of Somali Pirates, once again. The safety of undersea cables and critical infrastructure are also facing additional threats. The presence of drugs in the Indian Ocean and Human Smuggling has increased. IUU fishing still takes place. These threats present challenges to the Freedom of Navigation. We need to refocus on the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka offers to recommence the discussions on the Freedom of Nation in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Fourth, is expanding connectivity. According to estimates there will be an eight-fold increase in the GDP of India and Indonesia by 2050. Similar increases are expected in some of the other countries in South and West Asia. This requires additional port capacities and new transport routes. The Suez Canal may not be sufficient. In this regard India's two new connectivity initiatives are welcome. Firstly, the India (Mumbai) - Iran - Russia corridor and secondly the India (Mumbai) - Middle East - Europe corridor. Similarly, there are connectivity initiatives taking place in the Bay of Bengal. Work has already commenced on the Chongqing - Kyaukphyu corridor giving access to Western China. Thailand is planning the Kra land bridge connecting the Gulf of Siam with the Bay of Bengal. India and Sri Lanka are commencing feasibility studies on land connectivity between the two countries making Sri Lanka a Regional Logistics Hub with Colombo and Trincomalee ports available to South India.</p><p>The Indian Ocean Conference theme this year \"Towards a more stable and sustainable Indian Ocean\" highlights the two key areas which require our focus. What I have outlined before, dealt primarily with pursuing stability of the region. There is an equally serious, more immediate and existential threat that looms and that is the Climate Crisis.</p><p>Experts have revealed that the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than the other oceans around the world. The levels of warming are estimated to be three times higher than in the Pacific Ocean and coastal areas across the IOR will experience continuous rise in sea levels and face severe coastal erosion. The Indian Ocean is also rising at a level of 3.7 millimetres annually and extreme sea disasters are inevitable. The island states of the IOR are vulnerable and have to be provided with adequate resources to mitigate the effects of climate change. Changes at sea also affect monsoon patterns and in turn impact on agriculture and food security across the Indian Ocean region. They also impact on the biodiversity and in turn on food and livelihood of people of the littoral states.</p><p>The Indian Ocean presents opportunities in terms of ecology. Not only is it our biggest sink for Carbon, but it also provides potential for mitigating the climate crisis, through offshore wind, solar, and wave energy. Through seaweed farming and mangrove cultivation, we can increase the sequestration of Carbon. Sustainable exploitation of our Ocean's resources is critical for our survival, as the Ocean provides for our future.</p><p>At COP 28 Sri Lanka proposed three key initiatives, (1) the Tropical Belt Initiative, including the Indian Ocean (2) The International Climate Change University and the Climate Justice Forum. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change. The Climate Justice Forum aims to accelerate financing of losses and damages and includes debt justice as an essential component of the overall solution. Any proposals for mitigation and adaptation interventions must take into account the debt component faced by Climate-vulnerable and developing countries.</p><p>We are living in uncertain times. The stability we had taken for granted since the end of WWII and the Cold War is unravelling. Globalisation is being challenged as is multilateralism. The Climate Crisis is affecting prospects for trade and economic development around the world. It is impacting on food security, livelihoods, supply chains, biodiversity and maritime transportation. Either we can wait for global developments to dictate our fate or unite, so that we may chart our own course.</p><p>Creating a safer ocean environment by building confidence and predictability among users and enhancing ocean situational awareness will be key to maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean. The main platform that can undertake this important task is the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Ensuring a peaceful and secure Indian Ocean would facilitate sustainable use of oceans for the economic and social benefit of coastal and littoral states.</p><p>An overarching architecture for the Indian Ocean that deals with critical issues is required. The basis for such a structure is already in existence including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) and the recently adopted BBNJ agreement in 2023 on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction or the High Seas Treaty.</p><p>A Code of Conduct on freedom of navigation and over flight and unimpeded commerce and similar guiding principles on dealing with the climate crisis and the sustainable use of the Indian Ocean are a necessity. Only the leaders of the IORA countries can ensure that these measures are translated to the creation of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean region. Therefore the responsibility lies with us.</p><p>I thank you.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Ada Derana.

This forum is jointly organized by the Ministry of Environment and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p>During an awareness press briefing held yesterday (25) at the President's Media Centre (PMC), Environment Minister Nazeer Ahamed, announced that this significant international event will witness the participation of 41 member countries of UNEP Asia Pacific, with 25 countries and 16 ministers already confirming their attendance, so far. Organizers expect more than 300 foreign delegates and 100 professionals to engage in discussions alongside stakeholders from Sri Lanka.</p><p>The primary objective of this ministerial forum is to provide regional inputs for the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), scheduled for February 24 to March 01, 2024, in Nairobi.</p><p>Minister Ahamed also said that the opening of the forum on October 05 will be officiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, with the chairmanship being handed over to Sri Lanka during the event. Throughout its duration, the forum will cover a wide range of topics, including side events and excursions for the delegates. Sri Lanka intends to propose the establishment of a Climate Justice Forum to address the debt burden faced by climate-vulnerable developing countries, a proposal expected to garner attention at COP28 in December 2023.</p><p>Hosting an event of this magnitude will strengthen international relations, facilitate access to foreign grants and allow Sri Lanka to showcase its environmental best practices. The United Nations Environment Programme has generously supported the event, recognizing Sri Lanka's economic challenges, the Minister added.</p><p>Meanwhile speaking at the briefing Dr. Anil Jasinghe, the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment also said that in addition to the main forum, there will be several related events, including the Asia-Pacific Youth Environment Forum, Asia Pacific Major Groups and Stakeholder forum and Asia Pacific Science Policy Business Forum on the Environment.</p><p>This forum comes as part of the on-going efforts to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution with a focus on sustainable multilateral actions. The event will provide a platform for Governments, intergovernmental organizations and stakeholders to discuss and prioritize environmental issues in the Asia-Pacific region, contributing to the global effort to combat these challenges.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Some of us have engaged with the Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanisms (ISTRM), including attending the meetings organised by the Secretariat on 9 and/or 26 February 2024 to discuss the proposed Commission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We draw your attention once again to the four statements issued by civil society organisations in the North and East in 2023 setting out their concerns about the proposed Commission as well as their demands to the Government. These demands consist mainly of measures to build trust and repair the severely damaged social contract between Tamil citizens and the state. To date, the government has not taken action to implement even a single demand set out in these statements, thereby validating our concern about the lack of political will to provide substantive solutions to the Tamil people where truth, justice and reparations are concerned.</p><p>Our scepticism was further affirmed by the failure of the ISTRM to conduct wide ranging consultations with the war affected communities in the North and the East during their consultation process. Only a handful of organisations and activists from the North and East were invited to the meetings held in Colombo on 9 and 26 February despite concerted advocacy for greater inclusion. For instance, the ISTRM did not even attempt to meet the families of the disappeared in the North and East, a critical stakeholder in the transitional justice process. Given that the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Bill states its focus is 'the conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces during the period 1983 to 2009, or its aftermath', the lack of consultations with the very community that is purportedly the focus of the law beggars belief. Even those predisposed to view the proposed Commission as a good faith act to address decades long violations to which the communities in the North and East were subjected, government disregard for, and dismissal of the concerns of the communities regarding the proposed Commission, will surely question the government's intention.</p><p>The concerns we express are evidenced by the government's repeated declarations that it is determined to ensure the UN Human Rights Council Resolution is not renewed nor a new Resolution passed. Hence, we believe the proposed Commission is one of the means through which the government intends to convince the international community there is no need for another Human Rights Council resolution. If the government's intent is to resolve decades long grievances of the Tamil community and address grave violations committed against the community, instead of railroading legislation the community does not want, the government would implement at least a few demands set out in the aforementioned four statements to build trust.</p><p>While civil society, journalists, activists, families of the disappeared and former combatants amongst others in the North and East continue to be subject to surveillance, intimidation and harassment by the security agencies, while their land is being acquired and occupied and while their places of worship are being destroyed, the enactment of a law and the establishment of a Commission will do little to prevent or mitigate these actions which are in contravention of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka's international obligations. They only serve to increase people's mistrust of the state.</p><p>In this regard, we highlight the findings of the public opinion survey conducted by the Sri Lanka Barometre in 2023, which illustrates that 'confidence towards the political leadership decreased as a consequence of the crisis for almost half of Sri Lankans, showing a significant effect of the crisis on political confidence'. The Barometre also states that the 'decrease in confidence indicates a sense of disappointment and disillusionment among many Sri Lankans in the current political leadership'. It should be noted the lack of trust and confidence in the political leadership is not restricted to the Tamil community as the Barometre reveals that 'almost three quarters of people in the Southern Province experienced a drop in confidence'. Hence, in a climate in which the current government does not have public confidence, establishing yet another institution will in no way enable reconciliation in the absence of substantive measures to restore the faith of the people in those that govern them.</p><p>The imperative to listen to the voices from the North and East is reiterated by another finding of the Barometre, which states that the 'fact that the highest proportion of people showing no change in confidence can be located in the Northern Province could indicate disillusionment with any majoritarian government that is perceived to have ignored the needs and grievances of the Tamil community that make up a majority of the residents in the Northern province'.</p><p>In this context, we urge the government to heed the voices of the people of the North and East and implement the demands set out in the four statements issued by civil society groups from the North and East to build trust and show good faith prior to enacting laws or establishing Commissions. The path to positive peace and reconciliation is through building trust and demonstrating good faith through substantive and meaningful actions, not rhetoric, nor establishing Commissions whose recommendations are not implemented.</p><p>The signatories are Adayalam Centre for Policy Research; Affected Women's Forum, Amparai Aham Humanitarian Resource Centre (AHRC), Trincomalee; Amparai District Women's Network; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances in the North and the East (ARED); Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances - Amparai District; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Batticaloa; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Jaffna; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Kilinochchi; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Mannar; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances - Mullaitheevu; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Trincomalee; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances - Vavuniya; Batticaloa District Aruvi Women's Network; Centre for Humanitarian and Integrated Development, Mullaitheevu; Civil Amayam, Batticaloa; Eastern Social Development Foundation, Batticaloa; Environmental and Community Development Organisation, Mullaitheevu; Forum for Affected Families, Mannar; Jaffna Island Women's Network; Law and Human Rights Centre, Jaffna; Law and Society Trust; Mannar Social and Economical Development Organisation (MSEDO); Mannar Women's Development Federation (MWDF); Mullaitivu Press Club; North East Coordinating Committee (NECC); Organisation of People for Justice, Vavuniya; People's Collective for Climate Justice; Tamil Civil Society Forum; Vali North Resource Centre, Jaffna; Viluthu; Voice of the Voiceless; Women's Action Network; Women Life and Rights Association, Kilinochchi; Anushani Alagarajah, Rajaretnam Anuratha, S.

Your leadership is even timelier as Uganda assumes this role at a critical moment of collective awareness among countries of the global South. This is the first NAM Summit following the onset of the pandemic, the debt crisis, climate catastrophe, new global competition, and the ensuing multiple implications for the world, in particular, for the Global South.</p><p>As we meet today, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip and beyond. For over 3 months immense suffering and losses have been endured by the Palestinian civilian population, endangering regional security and stability. Until now, the NAM was largely silent. How can we remain silent when Gaza is destroyed? People were denied humanitarian aid and a vast majority of the dead are innocent civilians. Silence implies consent. It is encouraging that this 19th Summit has given the highest priority to this crisis in Gaza and the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to self-determination and the realisation of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine. We must congratulate South Africa for the bold stand it has taken regarding Gaza. The international community has already called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the release of hostages.</p><p>There cannot be a two-State solution based on one State - Israel. No resolution is possible without a State of Palestine. Therefore, in line with multiple UN Resolutions, and the Declaration of this Summit, the international community must recognise the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as territories coming within the State of Palestine and in addition, there should be no change in the ethnic composition of Gaza. Sri Lanka also proposes that the State of Palestine be established within 5 years and no more.</p><p>We are now witnessing the end of the post-Cold War order and the coming into being of the evolving multipolar world. On the geopolitical front, we are witnessing a resurgence of latent and open conflicts involving former and aspiring major powers. In Europe the transatlantic military alliance has been strengthened, past arms control agreements have collapsed, military expenditure has reached historically unprecedented levels and nuclear weapons are once again the subject of apparently serious policy discussion. Outer space and the oceans have become potential theatres of conflict and geo-strategic competition including in our vicinity in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.</p><p>Free trade and economic integration are being reversed by the policy-driven rise of trade protectionism due to strategic competition among major powers. Furthermore, this is being extended further with the concepts of de-coupling and de-risking. A unilateral declaration of a new trade order and the setting aside of multilateralism by the West of the WTO. The weaponising of the dollar. New challenges of economic and the debt crisis, climate justice, food and energy security. Digital and technological divides and advanced WMD arsenals have aggravated existing inequalities between the developing states of the NAM and the developed world.</p><p>The theme of this Summit 'Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence' reflects the need to address the inequities between our two worlds. Furthermore, experience shows us that, to succeed we need a strong and united NAM that contributes to a better world for all. To do so, we have to reinvent ourselves.</p><p>Our membership today is no longer a grouping of weak States. We must recognise that as a result of the rapid progress and economic advancement of some Asian, African and Latin American states. A majority of the 10 leading economies of 2050 will belong to this movement. We see among us, rising aspirants for leadership status in global affairs. They must be prepared to give leadership. Furthermore, there is a vital role we must play as geostrategic rivalries in political, economic, technological and military terms become more pronounced among former and new contenders for major power status.</p><p>Therefore, the NAM must reinvent itself under your chairmanship. Assume a new role in a multipolar world - to transform itself as the largest bloc representing the Global South. We must also recast our objectives. While upholding the Bandung Principles in the evolving multipolar world we need to, (i) oppose the spread of big power rivalry including the coercion of uncommitted states, (ii) build a multipolar world which incorporates the political, economic, social and climate change mitigation aspirations of the Global South.</p><p>Let us transform ourselves from this loose movement to become a dynamic bloc of the Global South and its friends. Let us establish an effective permanent operational structure which is equipped to address the contemporary challenges facing the Global South. An organisation which is capable of shaping the new order.</p><p>Our future lies in our hands. We can make it or break it. Let us make it work. Let me conclude by thanking you Mr. President and the Government of Uganda for the excellent arrangements for hosting this important 19th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT20012024000010003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B54-27Y1-F00C-6180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 20, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;
