First, I support this collective observation as it is based on science. However, I started to explore further and compare what we see today and what I saw during my journeys sightseeing around the island in the 1960s. I remember observing an almost 6-inch-deep cow dung layer in villages around Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Ampara, Panama, Moneragala, Hambantota and Madu areas. These were collected by Jaffna farmers by the truck load. People in those areas have the habit of digging pits and mixing cow dung with the soil. </p><p>So, the whole landscape was pockmarked with these pits. This may be to break the hard-top layer to enable water to enter the ground so to collect seasonal rain. This prevents unused water from washing away the fertile soil and seeds. Finally, it allows seed germination and plant growth. Historically, large herds of cattle, buffalo, and goats roamed the entire country's landscape, including pasture lands, shrub areas, and abandoned chena lands. These pastoralists have for centuries been in the habit of stocking pasture lands, shrub areas and abandoned chena lands with their herds. They contribute significantly to the conservation of biodiversity in the dry zone landscape.These migratory groups and the rural inhabitants have very good indigenous knowledge, and by following these methods, they not only increase long-term soil fertility and biodiversity, but also control plant diseases without harming the environment.</p><p>This practice ensures the safety and purity of water, and also makes use of available resources to produce food for people and animals. Here, I established that, with the green revolution of the 1960s which I witnessed and participated in, we destroyed our agricultural systems that had been practiced for thousands of years, and that I, too, was a big part of it, as were my colleagues in the scientific community. Today, these large herds of thousands of cattle, buffalo and goats are very rare and also restricted by the law. However, these domestic animal herds in these areas still outnumber the scattered wild animal concentrations within the forests in those areas. We should restock these lands by developing herding and land-use programmes, as well as developing an agroforestry network along the forest's perimetre.This will allow the rural folks to coexist with the forest.</p><p>In the past, the adjoining forests to these marginal lands, too, used to play an important role in the life of the human population in rural Sri Lanka. Then the forest provided food, fuel, fiber and medicine. However, even till recent times the rural peasant has continued to coexist with the forests in harmony. Methodical hunting of old, sick or weak wildlife is vital to minimize the human-wildlife conflict, to prevent infections of domestic farm animals and passing on to the human population as in the case of Covid-19. Domestic cattle, buffalo and goat herds were mostly kept closer to forest boundaries in adjoining pasture lands, shrub areas and abandoned</p><p>chena lands.</p><p>As a result, the significance of these domestic animals as primary seed dispersers has been identified and documented. They consume herbage and seeds while grazing in one place, and excrete them in a different place. These seeds started growing in that place. In addition, this act of plant seed dispersal was reinforced by a secondary seed disperser known as the dung beetle who will then disperse some of the seeds to adjoining forest areas, thus increasing or maintaining biodiversity in forest areas. This was a synergic relationship during this period as it supported biodiversity within the forest areas. Evidence from plant demography research reveals that this form of seed dispersal might have an important role in determining patterns of tree diversity and distribution. Therefore, these farmers' role in maintaining a diverse forest cover has to be identified and documented. However, this is not properly acknowledged.</p><p>After morning milking, almost all farmers send their cattle to free grazing on land designated as pasture land under the Pasturelands (Reservation and Development) Act 4 of 1983 (5441-19168-1-SM.pdf). The practice of allowing cattle to graze freely has been practiced for centuries. However, due to the legal pressures imposed by Circular 5/2001, this indigenous aspect of the free grazing system has been jeopardized. It resulted in a decrease in land availability in the total area for free grazing from 60-80% (1970-2000) to 5-30% (2001-2020) and created a seed dispersal limitation. The first observation following the implementation of Circular 5/2001 was that the ruminant population was deprived of adequate feed and nutrients to produce replacement stock and milk. The component of providing herbage through free grazing to these stocks was not included in the workload of the paddy and crop farming community. The second observation was a rapid decrease in the national ruminant numbers.</p><p>The Circular 5/2001, makes it practically impossible for smallholder farmers to rear farm animals. Hence, most had to discontinue a livelihood that sustained their crop cultivation activities by providing a daily income. Livestock supplemented their income on a daily basis as opposed to crop farming's seasonal income. In addition, livestock has a significant asset value that can be used as collateral and in times of need. Therefore, livestock increases economic stability for rural peasants and smallholder farmers by serving as a cash buffer, a capital reserve, and a deterrent to inflation. Furthermore, it reduces risks associated with crop cultivation. Rearing livestock is not hassle free, but the outcome surpasses all that.</p><p>It is known that 82% rural peasants were part-time farmers (DA 2000) and was confirmed by a study in 2017. Furthermore, 80 % of smallholder farmers are blacklisted by formal lending organizations. According to a 2017 study, 75% of the remaining 20% not blacklisted are Crop-Dairy farmers. However, only 10.8% of farms have crop-dairy integrated operations. These smallholder farmers continued with their home garden crop-dairy integrated farming system. Others discontinued and found extra income generation outside farming. Chart 1 below depicts the monthly income disparities between different land holdings in Anuradhapura and Vavuniya (2017).</p><p>Farmers having below three hectares get almost twice the income from livestock than from crop farming. This group consists of around 90% of the farming community. Farmers above three hectares get twice the income as those below 3 hectares. This implies that the smallholders below 3 hectares should rear more cattle. This is only possible if the free grazing system can be used during the day and fed processed feed such as maize silage during the night time. The synergistic effect of Crop-Dairy integration, which enabled the vast majority of smallholder farmers to earn a decent living, was undone by Circular 5/2001.This has had a significant impact on the food production system, such as the increased use of inorganic inputs for crop cultivation. This is essential to compensate for the minimum time allocated to crop cultivation by these part-time farmers. This also resulted in narrowing the profit margins or turnover from crop product sales. Therefore, the bottom line is to increase the number of farmers doing integrated crop-dairy farming in all agro-ecological zones in Sri Lanka. However, this would give better results if this project mimicked the system that was practiced in ancient times.</p><p>All pasture land and marginal areas should be demarcated as ruminant grazing areas under the supervision of the relevant Veterinary Surgeon, the Agrarian Development Authority and the Forest Department. Only community grazing is allowed to be practiced. Pasture land areas in each village should be divided into sub-areas, enclosed and numbered. These three organizations should draw up a grazing schedule for each village. All cattle in a village should be allowed to graze in the number 1 sub-area, where the number of days depends on the availability of the feed resource base. Then a subsequent sub-area will be opened to graze all the cattle in that village. However, farmers should dig pits in the first sub-area and fill them with soil mixed with cattle manure. This rotation should continue year-round. All sub-areas should have access to water. Planting shade trees species selected by the Forest Department should be provided to the village farmer group. The responsibility of this tree growth is for cattle keepers using this facility. A programme has to be introduced to use culled cows for breeding to provide female calves for new farmers. Male cattle should be fattened before being sold to butchers in these areas.Culled cows should be maintained in these areas until death and the carcasses will be used for compost making. This project requires planning.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The ICCF served as a global congregation of experts, policymakers, scientists, and practitioners, brought together to collectively tackle the critical issues linked to climate change. With a specific focus on climate change adaptation within the context of food security. This event was made possible through the dedicated efforts of Connect To Care, organized for the Presidential Secretariat, and supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first day of the ICCF concentrated on climate adaptation challenges in the country, along with potential local and global solutions. The second day was dedicated to the development of coordination, project development, and financing mechanisms to address these challenges. Furthermore, the research gaps identified during the event will be promoted through the proposed International Climate Change University. The outcomes of this conference will be taken forward at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) scheduled for December 2023 in the UAE.</p><p>The ICCF featured seven thought-provoking sessions developed and conducted by key agencies working in climate adaptation. These sessions converged toward a unified approach. The President addressed the forum in the morning of the first day setting out his vision. This vision ties building a green economy with the economic revival.</p><p>It must be recognized that Sri Lanka has exceptional biodiversity and relatively low emissions. This is an enormous source of strength as we build a thriving green economy.</p><p>The first session was led by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, titled 'Role of the Private Sector in Climate Adaptation'. It discussed the pivotal role of the private sector in climate adaptation and the ramifications of non-adaptation on markets, scrutinizing the vulnerabilities faced by smallholder farmers, and exploring innovative solutions to these pressing issues.</p><p>Another session on 'Partnership for Scaled Climate Smart Response' witnessed the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as a thought partner and highlighted the urgent need for collaborative approaches to meet climate adaptation challenges, particularly within the context of Sri Lanka.</p><p>The 'Technology and locally led adaptation' session was a collaborative effort by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF), and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). The session was dedicated to technologies and locally led adaptation practices while discussing the successes and challenges experienced by the nation.</p><p>The session on 'Policy and Governance Levers' organised by the World Bank (WB) and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) for adopting science-based targets, emphasized areas such as Water Quality, Biodiversity, and Natural Capital Accounting towards climate-smart agriculture. The session provided actionable solutions to enhance Sri Lanka's climate resilience, focusing on policy refinement, institutional reviews, and the development of robust provincial and national adaptation strategies.</p><p>'Climate Smart &amp; Sustainable and Inclusive Agriculture in Sri Lanka', with a multi-stakeholder approach, was planned by FAO as the first workshop on Day 2, followed by 'Partnerships and Synergies to Mainstream Climate Smart Technologies in Agriculture Value Chains', organised by USAID. The final workshop on Day 2 was organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) on 'Climate financing opportunities including carbon markets as a means for convergence.</p><p>The multi-stakeholder approach adopted in the ICCF facilitated agencies who are working to help Sri Lanka in climate adaptation to share their experiences and arrive at a common mechanism for future work, including lessons sharing and resource mobilization, together.</p><p>Three key outcomes from the ICCF: Sri Lanka needs to adopt a data-first framework so that impacts from climate change and interventions can be monitored and understood, all those working on Climate Adaptation in Sri Lanka need to work much more closely to forge synergies, Sri Lanka needs significant financing through multiple channels to realize the vision of a green and thriving economy.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Empowering farmers is therefore a priority for any a government trying to take a nation to greater heights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On this basis , the Indian government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , a visionary, took strategic steps to accelerate the transformation of the agricultural sector with the aim of empowering farmers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Doubling farmers' incomes, safeguarding them and their efforts, making them tech-savvy, promoting agricultural research and education, and building agricultural infrastructure are some of the major objectives set and developed for the growth of the agricultural sector and the welfare of the farmers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The New India envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi operates on his motto of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' (Everybody's company will help in everybody's growth) while the welfare of farmers is no doubt an integral part of it.</p><p>The Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare has taken stringent steps to empower farmers by implementing government schemes pedantically. This work is happening at an accelerated pace because the government led by Prime Minister Modi is aware that India, where about half the workforce is involved in farming, cannot flourish without making agriculture sustainable.</p><p>The Indian Government will promote chemical-free natural farming across the country. As an initial step, the Indian Government will focus on farmlands within 5-km-wide corridors along the river Ganga. In addition, agricultural universities will be encouraged to revise their syllabi to include natural, zero-budget, and organic farming, technology-based modern-day agriculture or precision farming, value addition, and management.</p><p>From technology to crop insurance, from easier credit access to modern irrigation methods, the Government of India is implementing a comprehensive action plan to empower farmers throughout the farming cycle - a facilitating umbrella of Beej Se Bazaar Tak (BSBT) (from seed to market).</p><p>However, as the quality of crops is directly linked to seeds, ensuring quality seeds is vital. For this end, seeds are made available in sufficient quantities to farmers especially during the sowing season which is key to the health of the farming life cycle.</p><p>Through the setting up of agriculture posts, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), the government provides good quality seeds to farmers at their doorstep. After successfully implementing this project in 20 districts, the scheme was extended in 100 districts of 14 states in association with the Agricultural Science Centers.</p><p>The Government intends to launch a scheme in the public-private partnership (PPP) model to deliver digital and hi-tech services to farmers, which will bring together public sector research and extension institutions, private agri-tech players, and stakeholders in the agri-value chain.</p><p>Further, the government had provided 'Kisan Drones' for crop assessments, land record digitization, and spraying insecticides and crop nutrients.</p><p>A fund with blended capital was also raised under the co-investment model, through National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) - an apex regulatory body for overall regulation of regional rural banks and apex cooperative banks in India.. The fund would finance agriculture and rural enterprise start-ups involved in providing support to farmer-producer organizations (FPOs), machinery for farmers on a rental basis, and technology, including IT-based support, among other activities relevant to the farm-produce value chain.</p><p>It is a known fact that healthy soil is vital for agricultural productivity. Disproportionate use of fertilisers has affected soil health. Hence, the Indian Government decided to combat it by educating farmers about the importance of soil health. A soil testing kit was developed for quick analysis of soil samples to optimise the use of fertilisers and provided to 650 Agricultural Science Centers.</p><p>Another milestone in the Indian Government's endeavours was the provision of neem (Kohmba) coated urea.</p><p>In just one year, the Indian Government has made available 100 percent neem coated urea and curbed unauthorised use of urea by chemical factories.</p><p>The efficiency of neem coated urea is 10-15 percent more as compared to normal urea, it is reported.</p><p>Water is another precious natural resource and lack of it leads to non-remunerative farming. Ensuring the availability of water and proper use is crucial to reform the farming sector. PM Modi launched an end-to-end solution to India's irrigation woes, with the objective of \"Water To Every Field\". This programme is working towards developing long-term remedies to mitigate the effect of drought. It is being implemented in mission mode by three ministries.</p><p>As announced in the Indian Government's budget for this year, a dedicated micro irrigation fund with a sum of Rs. 5000 crores was set up for the achievement of \"Per Drop - More Crop\". Micro-irrigation which is vital to ensure optimal use of water - minimum water, maximum yield.</p><p>The Indian Government will also provide a comprehensive package for farmers to adopt suitable fruit and vegetable varieties that can be processed. The package developed with the participation of the states will also include appropriate crop production and harvesting techniques. The Budget allocation for Food Processing Industries was 126% higher than last year's revised estimate (Rs.2,941.99 crores).</p><p>Budget 2022 has proposed policy and legislative changes to promote agroforestry and private forestry. It also specifies financial support to farmers belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who want to take up agroforestry. Tribal communities hold vast knowledge of traditional agroforestry systems and practices that promote productivity, adaptability, and sustainability, and can contribute immensely to the rural economy, employment, and poverty alleviation at a local level.</p><p>Meanwhile, India hosted the second Agriculture Ministerial-level meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in New Delhi on the 10th of November under the chairmanship of the Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar. Addressing the BIMSTEC, India's Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Tomar said that along with digital farming and precision farming, initiatives under the 'One Health' approach are also taking shape in India.</p><p>He emphasised the importance of cooperation in agriculture and allied sectors to ensure food security, nutrition, environmental sustainability and livelihood support, for which it is required to increase technical and economic cooperation to deal with the challenges of climate change, agro-biodiversity, microbial preventive resistance under the 'One Health' approach and other programmes.</p><p>The agriculture minister reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement at the 5th BIMSTEC Summit held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in March, 2022 on enhancing regional cooperation between BIMSTEC nations for food security, peace and prosperity in the region. At the same time, he expressed India's commitment to promote agricultural productivity, food security and nutrition, sustainability, research and development and enhancing cooperation with BIMSTEC in the areas of agribusiness, climate change management, and digital agriculture, among other related areas.</p><p>Under the leadership of India's Prime Minister Modi, the country is positive that farming will become a lucrative profession at all levels. Farmers feel empowered and they will take the agriculture sector to great heights, contributing to the overall GDP in a bigger way.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Beyond its economic impact, it plays a vital role in uplifting the lives of our fellow citizens and conserving our land's beautiful, natural resources.</p><p>'At Hayleys we are proud to account for approximately 4.6% of the country's tea and 4.7% of its rubber production. The ethical and sustainable way we run our plantations have contributed to Hayleys being ranked as Sri Lanka's number one corporate for the third consecutive year, and its prestigious AAA rating by Fitch. Today serves as a unique platform to collaborate and create greater change together and I encourage all participants to focus on recommendations and actions towards a more resilient industry.'</p><p>Addressing the gathering, Hayleys Plantations Managing Director Dr. Roshan Rajadurai said the Summit provided a unique opportunity to share knowledge and collaborate for a sustainable future. 'Ceylon tea has a legacy of 150 years and we are rightfully branded as the tea nation of the world. To combat the challenges and impact of climate change on the industry, it is essential that we optimise climate-smart and innovative agricultural practices and technologies.'</p><p>He added, 'As we gather industry experts and stakeholders at the IPSS, we witness a powerful knowledge-sharing initiative taking root for the first time. Moving forward, our goal is to take these learnings and steer the entire plantations sector towards a more prosperous and equitable future defined by ethical practices, environmental stewardship, and resilient growth.'</p><p>Themed 'Towards Sustainable Plantations - Reimagined | Redesigned | Resilient', the summit emphasised the integration of environmental, social, and governance considerations into every business decision, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>The panellists', experts in a wide array of subjects including agroforestry, climate-resilient farming, smart and precision agriculture, carbon sequestration and biodiversity preservation addressed gaps in ESG and sustainability, integration of knowledge management practices, data-driven sustainability, sustainable financing and the adoption of circular green economy concepts into business philosophy.</p><p>Participants at the Summit</p><p>Delivering the keynote speech on 'Global trends on sustainability approaches towards innovative plantation production systems and opportunities for new business models', World Resources Institute (WRI), India, Director and Strategy Head Dr. A. Nambi Appadurai said, 'Climate change is the mother of all threats with uncertainty being the only certainty. It has affected every crop in the globe and if we are to meet these challenges, we have to understand every aspect of its impact, which includes not only the environmental changes but also its social bearing. Today's solutions may not be useful in the future and it is necessary that we hone our adaptive capabilities to ensure that no one is left behind.'</p><p>Similarly, delivering the guest speech on 'Regenerative Agriculture (RA) - A sustainable approach to boost soil health in plantations', Wageningen University, Netherlands Senior Scientist Dr. Mirjam Pulleman said, 'Integrating regenerative agriculture to perennial crops has the potential to affect a number of systems, strengthening plantations with higher resilience and lowering risks. It is in fact essential for sustainability across the industry.'</p><p>Embracing environmental responsibility and climate action, the Hayleys Plantations sector quantified, verified and offset its carbon footprint for the event by offsetting 15 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon footprint), through the Sri Lanka Climate Fund.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT3107202300040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68V0-0271-F00C-611J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 31, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUVU</classCode><className>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DONF</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRNL</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS - ENVIRONMENTAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

President Ranil Wickremesinghe also announced Sri Lanka's Chairmanship till 2026 which was attended by Dr. Qu Dongyu, Director General of the UN FAO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conference, which commenced on February 19 in Colombo with the participation of diplomats and representatives from 34 countries including the United States, China, and Russia, will conclude today (21). Sri Lanka's presidency of the Asia-Pacific region of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, succeeding Bangladesh's hosting in 2022, will extend from now until 2026.</p><p>Sri Lanka, having previously hosted the second conference in 1955, is now hosting it again after a span of 69 years. Approximately 70% of the Asia-Pacific region's population relies on agriculture. This year's conference, themed \"Transformation of the Agro-Food System,\" will delve into key areas such as promoting nutritious food production, ensuring food security, enhancing food production, safeguarding the environment, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change risks.</p><p>Following the conference's opening session, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in a group photo with foreign ministers and delegates before engaging in discussions with attending agriculture ministers.</p><p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the vital role of the Food and Agriculture Organization in bolstering food security, fostering sustainable agricultural production, and advancing resilient small-scale agricultural systems aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Highlighting agriculture's pivotal role in Sri Lanka's economic transformation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the country's forthcoming initiatives.</p><p>He further said; \"Despite recent economic challenges, including fertilizer shortages and foreign exchange constraints in 2022, Sri Lanka is now moving towards stability. Anticipating the finalization of debt restructuring agreements, Sri Lanka aims to emerge from its economic crisis and transition towards a revitalized economy, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts beyond mere stabilization.When assessing our economy, agriculture emerges as a sector capable of delivering swift results, closely followed by tourism.</p><p>Fortunately, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) facilitated the procurement of fertilizer, thereby bolstering our agricultural capabilities.</p><p>As a result, as we approached the main cultivation season in April 2023, we found ourselves out of jeopardy, enjoying a bountiful season. This instilled confidence in our ability to progress.</p><p>The absence of domestic food production would have precipitated another crisis this year, but fortune favoured us. Anticipating a bountiful harvest this April and a subsequent yield by year-end, agriculture has undeniably played a pivotal role in navigating this economic challenge.</p><p>Recognizing agriculture's potential to drive sustained national development, it is imperative for every country to acknowledge its significance and prioritize its advancement.</p><p>Another critical factor contributing to the crisis we faced is the trade balance deficit. Historically, we've struggled to maintain a favourable trade balance and have accrued a substantial amount of foreign debt that seems insurmountable within current repayment agreements.</p><p>Consequently, our country requires a comprehensive economic transformation guided by three key principles: competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and digitalization.</p><p>With a rich agricultural and export heritage spanning over 2000 years, Sri Lanka initially thrived on rice and grain exports, supported by our advanced irrigation systems.</p><p>Traditionally, wealth wasn't derived directly from land ownership but from control over water reservoirs in our ancient irrigated civilization. Following its decline, we transitioned to the wet zone, where spices became a prominent export until the decline in prices during British rule prompted a shift to tea, coconut, and rubber cultivation. Despite India and Sri Lanka maintaining dominance in these sectors globally, our agricultural development has been neglected.</p><p>In 1972, large estates were dismantled, capping land ownership at 50 acres, while initiatives like the Mahaweli scheme allocated vast acreage for cultivation, supported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. However, progress was impeded by the conflict.</p><p>Efforts to revitalize and expand our agricultural sector are imperative for sustainable economic growth and development.</p><p>Even after neglecting the plantation industry for some time, we must now re-engage with it. It's imperative that we put in the necessary effort. Our goal is to regain our status as a country that exports agricultural products. This objective is being thoroughly studied.</p><p>We can draw inspiration from our friendly country, Thailand, which currently maintains a robust agricultural export economy. Let's take cues from their success. Our first step is to restructure the existing system and involve the private sector.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the adoption of modern agricultural techniques in our country. This is crucial for our agricultural sector's advancement, even though it may take 10 to 15 years to fully implement. However, our aim is to expedite this process and achieve our goals within a decade. We are actively introducing the latest agricultural practices to our nation.</p><p>Yet, we face another challenge: the exodus of young people from rural areas to urban centres, resulting in a decline in traditional agricultural participation. Introducing smart agricultural practices to rural communities can help retain youth in villages. To address this, we have consolidated the Ministry of Agriculture, previously divided into three ministries, under one minister, to prioritize this issue. Moreover, we have initiated restructuring efforts within related institutions. Our primary focus is to ensure that farmers receive quality service.</p><p>Furthermore, we are endeavouring to transform agrarian service centres nationwide into modernization hubs for agriculture. To achieve this goal, we are actively seeking contributions from both the public and private sectors.</p><p>In addition, we recognize the need to address gaps in the purchase of agricultural products, establish new supply chains and develop cold storage facilities. Many of these essential facilities are currently unavailable in Sri Lanka, so we are committed to bringing them to fruition. This transformative initiative will significantly impact the agricultural sector.</p><p>Moreover, we have initiated the largest privatization effort in the country's history. As part of this initiative, we are facilitating access to land for farmers, including previously unused land within the Mahaweli scheme. These lands are being made available to individuals interested in engaging in modern agriculture, marking the beginning of a new era in farming practices.</p><p>Since 1935, we have allocated land to farmers under the Land Development Ordinance, providing them with licences rather than legal ownership. To rectify this, we are granting freehold ownership of these lands to the farmers. This year alone, over a million farmers will receive freehold deeds to their land.</p><p>Additionally, we have initiated efforts to enhance the animal husbandry sector, particularly focusing on milk production. Currently, each animal produces only 2 litres of milk. However, we are determined to increase this yield. To achieve this, we are finalizing an agreement with Amul to collaborate with the government-owned MILCO.</p><p>Our goal is to rear 2 million animals capable of producing 10 litres of milk per day, significantly boosting milk production and revitalizing the animal industry.</p><p>As a result, we anticipate obtaining 20 million litres of milk solely through this initiative, benefiting around two hundred thousand farmers. Moreover, several other companies are stepping forward to contribute to this endeavour.</p><p>Companies such as Nestle, Fonterra and Ambewela Farming, alongside other institutions, have significantly increased milk production to approximately 28 litres per animal. This concerted effort is expected to substantially augment milk production in the country.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the promotion of both freshwater and saltwater fishing industries in Sri Lanka. Through various strategic plans, Sri Lanka aims to make significant contributions to global food security.</p><p>While contemplating the global population projection for 2050, it's important to acknowledge that we may not be present at that time. Nevertheless, it's anticipated that the population will surge by 500 to 600 million individuals from Iran to Indonesia. This growth is expected to coincide with an overall improvement in living standards and income levels for everyone. Conversely, countries in Africa, particularly East and South Africa, will face significant food demand, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to address future food security challenges.</p><p>Furthermore, Sri Lanka is demonstrating a strong commitment to combating climate change. To this end, we have proposed two initiatives, one of which aims to designate the tropical region, including the Indian Ocean, as a carbon-absorbing zone.</p><p>Encouraging private sector investments in grasslands and forests within our respective countries is essential. We must approach this pragmatically, acknowledging that countries like the UK may not fund projects in Mali, nor would Finland necessarily provide funding to Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, we are actively working to attract investment from various sources.</p><p>Furthermore, efforts are underway to establish a climate change university in Sri Lanka, with the necessary land already identified for this purpose. Discussions are on-going with the Republic of South Korea regarding the commencement of building construction and numerous other stakeholders have shown interest in participating in this endeavour. Additionally, there are plans to consolidate all agricultural research centres in Sri Lanka under the umbrella of the Agricultural Technology University.</p><p>Amidst these initiatives, we are hopeful for the support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) for the government's program aimed at facilitating the rapid transformation of agriculture in our country.</p><p>Agriculture and Plantation Industries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said:Our journey in agriculture began with great dedication in 1954, and it fills me with pride to see Sri Lanka chairing this conference for the second time in 69 years. The dynamic atmosphere of this hall reflects our collective determination to tackle the challenges of food security, sustainable agriculture and development. I must express appreciation for the support provided by the Honourable President and the UNFAO during the crisis that significantly impacted Sri Lanka's agriculture in 2022.</p><p>I am confident that the outcomes of our discussions and collaborations during this conference, combined with our mutual dedication to sustainable agriculture and rural development, will pave the way for a prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) Dr.Qu Dongyu: The relationship between Sri Lanka and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) spans several decades, with Sri Lanka becoming a member in the 1950s. In 1979, the first representative office of the FAO was established in Sri Lanka. Recognizing Sri Lanka's significant potential in agriculture, agroforestry and aquaculture, I am privileged to engage in discussions with the President of Sri Lanka regarding the challenges faced in these sectors. The strong guidance provided by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, along with the programme aimed at modernizing agriculture in rural areas, presents innovative ideas that can truly make a difference. We are committed to offering our support in this regard.</p><p>Present at the event were Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, Ali Sabry, PC, Douglas Devananda, State Ministers D.B.Herat, Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva, Lohan Ratwatte, Kader Masthan, Ministry Secretaries, government officials, delegates from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO), as well as local and foreign diplomats.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

He emphasized the pivotal role agriculture played in navigating Sri Lanka through the previous economic crisis and highlighted agriculture and tourism as key sectors for the nation's swift recovery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These remarks were made during the opening session of the 37th United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Asia and Pacific Conference in Colombo today (20), attended by Dr. Qu Dongyu, Director General of the UN FAO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conference, which commenced on the 19thof February in Colombo with the participation of diplomats and representatives from 34 countries including the United States, China, and Russia, will conclude tomorrow (21). Sri Lanka's presidency of the Asia-Pacific region of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, succeeding Bangladesh's hosting in 2022, will extend from now until 2026.</p><p>Sri Lanka, having previously hosted the 2nd conference in 1955, is now hosting it again after a span of 69 years. Approximately 70% of the Asia-Pacific region's population relies on agriculture. This year's conference, themed \"Transformation of the Agro-Food System,\" will delve into key areas such as promoting nutritious food production, ensuring food security, enhancing food production, safeguarding the environment, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change risks.</p><p>Following the conference's opening session, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in a group photo with foreign ministers and delegates before engaging in discussions with attending agriculture ministers.</p><p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the vital role of the Food and Agriculture Organization in bolstering food security, fostering sustainable agricultural production, and advancing resilient small-scale agricultural systems aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Highlighting agriculture's pivotal role in Sri Lanka's economic transformation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the country's forthcoming initiatives.</p><p>He further said;</p><p>\"Despite recent economic challenges, including fertilizer shortages and foreign exchange constraints in 2022, Sri Lanka is now moving towards stability. Anticipating the finalization of debt restructuring agreements, Sri Lanka aims to emerge from its economic crisis and transition towards a revitalized economy, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts beyond mere stabilization.</p><p>When assessing our economy, agriculture emerges as a sector capable of delivering swift results, closely followed by tourism.</p><p>Fortunately, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) facilitated the procurement of fertilizer, thereby bolstering our agricultural capabilities.</p><p>As a result, as we approached the main cultivation season in April 2023, we found ourselves out of jeopardy, enjoying a bountiful season. This instilled confidence in our ability to progress.</p><p>The absence of domestic food production would have precipitated another crisis this year, but fortune favoured us. Anticipating a bountiful harvest this April and a subsequent yield by year-end, agriculture has undeniably played a pivotal role in navigating this economic challenge.</p><p>Recognizing agriculture's potential to drive sustained national development, it is imperative for every country to acknowledge its significance and prioritize its advancement.</p><p>Another critical factor contributing to the crisis we faced is the trade balance deficit. Historically, we've struggled to maintain a favourable trade balance and have accrued a substantial amount of foreign debt that seems insurmountable within current repayment agreements.</p><p>Consequently, our country requires a comprehensive economic transformation guided by three key principles: competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and digitalization.</p><p>With a rich agricultural and export heritage spanning over 2000 years, Sri Lanka initially thrived on rice and grain exports, supported by our advanced irrigation systems.</p><p>Traditionally, wealth wasn't derived directly from land ownership but from control over water reservoirs in our ancient irrigated civilization. Following its decline, we transitioned to the wet zone, where spices became a prominent export until the decline in prices during British rule prompted a shift to tea, coconut, and rubber cultivation. Despite India and Sri Lanka maintaining dominance in these sectors globally, our agricultural development has been neglected.</p><p>In 1972, large estates were dismantled, capping land ownership at 50 acres, while initiatives like the Mahaweli scheme allocated vast acreage for cultivation, supported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. However, progress was impeded by the conflict.</p><p>Efforts to revitalize and expand our agricultural sector are imperative for sustainable economic growth and development.</p><p>Even after neglecting the plantation industry for some time, we must now re-engage with it. It's imperative that we put in the necessary effort. Our goal is to regain our status as a country that exports agricultural products. This objective is being thoroughly studied.</p><p>We can draw inspiration from our friendly country, Thailand, which currently maintains a robust agricultural export economy. Let's take cues from their success. Our first step is to restructure the existing system and involve the private sector.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the adoption of modern agricultural techniques in our country. This is crucial for our agricultural sector's advancement, even though it may take 10 to 15 years to fully implement. However, our aim is to expedite this process and achieve our goals within a decade. We are actively introducing the latest agricultural practices to our nation.</p><p>Yet, we face another challenge: the exodus of young people from rural areas to urban centres, resulting in a decline in traditional agricultural participation. Introducing smart agricultural practices to rural communities can help retain youth in villages. To address this, we have consolidated the Ministry of Agriculture, previously divided into three ministries, under one minister, to prioritize this issue. Moreover, we have initiated restructuring efforts within related institutions. Our primary focus is to ensure that farmers receive quality service.</p><p>Furthermore, we are endeavouring to transform agrarian service centres nationwide into modernization hubs for agriculture. To achieve this goal, we are actively seeking contributions from both the public and private sectors.</p><p>In addition, we recognize the need to address gaps in the purchase of agricultural products, establish new supply chains and develop cold storage facilities. Many of these essential facilities are currently unavailable in Sri Lanka, so we are committed to bringing them to fruition. This transformative initiative will significantly impact the agricultural sector.</p><p>Moreover, we have initiated the largest privatization effort in the country's history. As part of this initiative, we are facilitating access to land for farmers, including previously unused land within the Mahaweli scheme. These lands are being made available to individuals interested in engaging in modern agriculture, marking the beginning of a new era in farming practices.</p><p>Since 1935, we have allocated land to farmers under the Land Development Ordinance, providing them with licenses rather than legal ownership. To rectify this, we are granting freehold ownership of these lands to the farmers. This year alone, over a million farmers will receive freehold deeds to their land.</p><p>Additionally, we have initiated efforts to enhance the animal husbandry sector, particularly focusing on milk production. Currently, each animal produces only 2 litres of milk. However, we are determined to increase this yield. To achieve this, we are finalizing an agreement with Amul to collaborate with the government-owned MILCO.</p><p>Our goal is to rear 2 million animals capable of producing 10 litres of milk per day, significantly boosting milk production and revitalizing the animal industry.</p><p>As a result, we anticipate obtaining 20 million litres of milk solely through this initiative, benefiting around two hundred thousand farmers. Moreover, several other companies are stepping forward to contribute to this endeavour.</p><p>Companies such as Nestle, Fonterra and Ambewela Farming, alongside other institutions, have significantly increased milk production to approximately 28 litres per animal. This concerted effort is expected to substantially augment milk production in the country.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the promotion of both freshwater and saltwater fishing industries in Sri Lanka. Through various strategic plans, Sri Lanka aims to make significant contributions to global food security.</p><p>While contemplating the global population projection for 2050, it's important to acknowledge that we may not be present at that time. Nevertheless, it's anticipated that the population will surge by 500 to 600 million individuals from Iran to Indonesia. This growth is expected to coincide with an overall improvement in living standards and income levels for everyone. Conversely, countries in Africa, particularly East and South Africa, will face significant food demand, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to address future food security challenges.</p><p>Furthermore, Sri Lanka is demonstrating a strong commitment to combating climate change. To this end, we have proposed two initiatives, one of which aims to designate the tropical region, including the Indian Ocean, as a carbon-absorbing zone.</p><p>Encouraging private sector investments in grasslands and forests within our respective countries is essential. We must approach this pragmatically, acknowledging that countries like the UK may not fund projects in Mali, nor would Finland necessarily provide funding to Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, we are actively working to attract investment from various sources.</p><p>Furthermore, efforts are underway to establish a climate change university in Sri Lanka, with the necessary land already identified for this purpose. Discussions are on-going with the Republic of South Korea regarding the commencement of building construction and numerous other stakeholders have shown interest in participating in this endeavour. Additionally, there are plans to consolidate all agricultural research centres in Sri Lanka under the umbrella of the Agricultural Technology University.</p><p>Amidst these initiatives, we are hopeful for the support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) for the government's program aimed at facilitating the rapid transformation of agriculture in our country.</p><p>Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera:</p><p>I am honoured to address you once more as the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka. I extend my sincere gratitude for your active participation and steadfast commitment to our shared goals. Our journey in agriculture began with great dedication in 1954, and it fills me with pride to see Sri Lanka chairing this conference for the second time in 69 years. The dynamic atmosphere of this hall reflects our collective determination to tackle the challenges of food security, sustainable agriculture and development. I must express appreciation for the support provided by the Honourable President and the UNFAO during the crisis that significantly impacted Sri Lanka's agriculture in 2022.</p><p>I am confident that the outcomes of our discussions and collaborations during this conference, combined with our mutual dedication to sustainable agriculture and rural development, will pave the way for a prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) Dr. Qu Dongyu:</p><p>The relationship between Sri Lanka and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) spans several decades, with Sri Lanka becoming a member in the 1950s. In 1979, the first representative office of the FAO was established in Sri Lanka. Recognizing Sri Lanka's significant potential in agriculture, agroforestry and aquaculture, I am privileged to engage in discussions with the President of Sri Lanka regarding the challenges faced in these sectors. The strong guidance provided by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, along with the program aimed at modernizing agriculture in rural areas, presents innovative ideas that can truly make a difference. We are committed to offering our support in this regard</p><p>Present at the event were Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, Ali Sabry, PC, Douglas Devananda, State Ministers D. B. Herat, Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva, Lohan Ratwatte, Kader Masthan, Ministry Secretaries, government officials, delegates from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO), as well as local and foreign diplomats.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hiru News.

He emphasized the pivotal role agriculture played in navigating Sri Lanka through the previous economic crisis and highlighted agriculture and tourism as key sectors for the nation's swift recovery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These remarks were made during the opening session of the 37th United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's Asia and Pacific Conference in Colombo today (20), attended by Dr. Qu Dongyu, Director General of the UN FAO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The conference, which commenced on the 19thof February in Colombo with the participation of diplomats and representatives from 34 countries including the United States, China, and Russia, will conclude tomorrow (21). Sri Lanka's presidency of the Asia-Pacific region of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, succeeding Bangladesh's hosting in 2022, will extend from now until 2026.</p><p>Sri Lanka, having previously hosted the 2nd conference in 1955, is now hosting it again after a span of 69 years. Approximately 70% of the Asia-Pacific region's population relies on agriculture. This year's conference, themed \"Transformation of the Agro-Food System,\" will delve into key areas such as promoting nutritious food production, ensuring food security, enhancing food production, safeguarding the environment, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change risks.</p><p>Following the conference's opening session, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in a group photo with foreign ministers and delegates before engaging in discussions with attending agriculture ministers.</p><p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the vital role of the Food and Agriculture Organization in bolstering food security, fostering sustainable agricultural production, and advancing resilient small-scale agricultural systems aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Highlighting agriculture's pivotal role in Sri Lanka's economic transformation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the country's forthcoming initiatives.</p><p>He further said;</p><p>\"Despite recent economic challenges, including fertilizer shortages and foreign exchange constraints in 2022, Sri Lanka is now moving towards stability. Anticipating the finalization of debt restructuring agreements, Sri Lanka aims to emerge from its economic crisis and transition towards a revitalized economy, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts beyond mere stabilization.</p><p>When assessing our economy, agriculture emerges as a sector capable of delivering swift results, closely followed by tourism.</p><p>Fortunately, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) facilitated the procurement of fertilizer, thereby bolstering our agricultural capabilities.</p><p>As a result, as we approached the main cultivation season in April 2023, we found ourselves out of jeopardy, enjoying a bountiful season. This instilled confidence in our ability to progress.</p><p>The absence of domestic food production would have precipitated another crisis this year, but fortune favoured us. Anticipating a bountiful harvest this April and a subsequent yield by year-end, agriculture has undeniably played a pivotal role in navigating this economic challenge.</p><p>Recognizing agriculture's potential to drive sustained national development, it is imperative for every country to acknowledge its significance and prioritize its advancement.</p><p>Another critical factor contributing to the crisis we faced is the trade balance deficit. Historically, we've struggled to maintain a favourable trade balance and have accrued a substantial amount of foreign debt that seems insurmountable within current repayment agreements.</p><p>Consequently, our country requires a comprehensive economic transformation guided by three key principles: competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and digitalization.</p><p>With a rich agricultural and export heritage spanning over 2000 years, Sri Lanka initially thrived on rice and grain exports, supported by our advanced irrigation systems.</p><p>Traditionally, wealth wasn't derived directly from land ownership but from control over water reservoirs in our ancient irrigated civilization. Following its decline, we transitioned to the wet zone, where spices became a prominent export until the decline in prices during British rule prompted a shift to tea, coconut, and rubber cultivation. Despite India and Sri Lanka maintaining dominance in these sectors globally, our agricultural development has been neglected.</p><p>In 1972, large estates were dismantled, capping land ownership at 50 acres, while initiatives like the Mahaweli scheme allocated vast acreage for cultivation, supported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. However, progress was impeded by the conflict.</p><p>Efforts to revitalize and expand our agricultural sector are imperative for sustainable economic growth and development.</p><p>Even after neglecting the plantation industry for some time, we must now re-engage with it. It's imperative that we put in the necessary effort. Our goal is to regain our status as a country that exports agricultural products. This objective is being thoroughly studied.</p><p>We can draw inspiration from our friendly country, Thailand, which currently maintains a robust agricultural export economy. Let's take cues from their success. Our first step is to restructure the existing system and involve the private sector.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the adoption of modern agricultural techniques in our country. This is crucial for our agricultural sector's advancement, even though it may take 10 to 15 years to fully implement. However, our aim is to expedite this process and achieve our goals within a decade. We are actively introducing the latest agricultural practices to our nation.</p><p>Yet, we face another challenge: the exodus of young people from rural areas to urban centres, resulting in a decline in traditional agricultural participation. Introducing smart agricultural practices to rural communities can help retain youth in villages. To address this, we have consolidated the Ministry of Agriculture, previously divided into three ministries, under one minister, to prioritize this issue. Moreover, we have initiated restructuring efforts within related institutions. Our primary focus is to ensure that farmers receive quality service.</p><p>Furthermore, we are endeavouring to transform agrarian service centres nationwide into modernization hubs for agriculture. To achieve this goal, we are actively seeking contributions from both the public and private sectors.</p><p>In addition, we recognize the need to address gaps in the purchase of agricultural products, establish new supply chains and develop cold storage facilities. Many of these essential facilities are currently unavailable in Sri Lanka, so we are committed to bringing them to fruition. This transformative initiative will significantly impact the agricultural sector.</p><p>Moreover, we have initiated the largest privatization effort in the country's history. As part of this initiative, we are facilitating access to land for farmers, including previously unused land within the Mahaweli scheme. These lands are being made available to individuals interested in engaging in modern agriculture, marking the beginning of a new era in farming practices.</p><p>Since 1935, we have allocated land to farmers under the Land Development Ordinance, providing them with licenses rather than legal ownership. To rectify this, we are granting freehold ownership of these lands to the farmers. This year alone, over a million farmers will receive freehold deeds to their land.</p><p>Additionally, we have initiated efforts to enhance the animal husbandry sector, particularly focusing on milk production. Currently, each animal produces only 2 litres of milk. However, we are determined to increase this yield. To achieve this, we are finalizing an agreement with Amul to collaborate with the government-owned MILCO.</p><p>Our goal is to rear 2 million animals capable of producing 10 litres of milk per day, significantly boosting milk production and revitalizing the animal industry.</p><p>As a result, we anticipate obtaining 20 million litres of milk solely through this initiative, benefiting around two hundred thousand farmers. Moreover, several other companies are stepping forward to contribute to this endeavour.</p><p>Companies such as Nestle, Fonterra and Ambewela Farming, alongside other institutions, have significantly increased milk production to approximately 28 litres per animal. This concerted effort is expected to substantially augment milk production in the country.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the promotion of both freshwater and saltwater fishing industries in Sri Lanka. Through various strategic plans, Sri Lanka aims to make significant contributions to global food security.</p><p>While contemplating the global population projection for 2050, it's important to acknowledge that we may not be present at that time. Nevertheless, it's anticipated that the population will surge by 500 to 600 million individuals from Iran to Indonesia. This growth is expected to coincide with an overall improvement in living standards and income levels for everyone. Conversely, countries in Africa, particularly East and South Africa, will face significant food demand, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to address future food security challenges.</p><p>Furthermore, Sri Lanka is demonstrating a strong commitment to combating climate change. To this end, we have proposed two initiatives, one of which aims to designate the tropical region, including the Indian Ocean, as a carbon-absorbing zone.</p><p>Encouraging private sector investments in grasslands and forests within our respective countries is essential. We must approach this pragmatically, acknowledging that countries like the UK may not fund projects in Mali, nor would Finland necessarily provide funding to Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, we are actively working to attract investment from various sources.</p><p>Furthermore, efforts are underway to establish a climate change university in Sri Lanka, with the necessary land already identified for this purpose. Discussions are on-going with the Republic of South Korea regarding the commencement of building construction and numerous other stakeholders have shown interest in participating in this endeavour. Additionally, there are plans to consolidate all agricultural research centres in Sri Lanka under the umbrella of the Agricultural Technology University.</p><p>Amidst these initiatives, we are hopeful for the support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) for the government's program aimed at facilitating the rapid transformation of agriculture in our country.</p><p>Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera:</p><p>I am honoured to address you once more as the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka. I extend my sincere gratitude for your active participation and steadfast commitment to our shared goals. Our journey in agriculture began with great dedication in 1954, and it fills me with pride to see Sri Lanka chairing this conference for the second time in 69 years. The dynamic atmosphere of this hall reflects our collective determination to tackle the challenges of food security, sustainable agriculture and development. I must express appreciation for the support provided by the Honourable President and the UNFAO during the crisis that significantly impacted Sri Lanka's agriculture in 2022.</p><p>I am confident that the outcomes of our discussions and collaborations during this conference, combined with our mutual dedication to sustainable agriculture and rural development, will pave the way for a prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) Dr. Qu Dongyu:</p><p>The relationship between Sri Lanka and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) spans several decades, with Sri Lanka becoming a member in the 1950s. In 1979, the first representative office of the FAO was established in Sri Lanka. Recognizing Sri Lanka's significant potential in agriculture, agroforestry and aquaculture, I am privileged to engage in discussions with the President of Sri Lanka regarding the challenges faced in these sectors. The strong guidance provided by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, along with the program aimed at modernizing agriculture in rural areas, presents innovative ideas that can truly make a difference. We are committed to offering our support in this regard</p><p>Present at the event were Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva, Ali Sabry, PC, Douglas Devananda, State Ministers D. B. Herat, Mohan Priyadarshana de Silva, Lohan Ratwatte, Kader Masthan, Ministry Secretaries, government officials, delegates from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO), as well as local and foreign diplomats.

But what exactly is a nature-based solution, and under which circumstances can it unfold its full potential? How can countries such as Sri Lanka employ nature-based solutions as cost-effective interventions, and what are some of their potential use cases?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The resumed 5th United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA 5.2) in February-March 2022 provided a global definition for NBS: 'Actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use, and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine ecosystems which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services, resilience, and biodiversity benefits.'</p><p>Similarly, the European Commission defines NBS as 'solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social, and economic benefits, and help build resilience,' while the earlier IUCN definition focused on 'leveraging nature and the power of healthy ecosystems to protect people, optimise infrastructure, and safeguard a stable and biodiverse future.'</p><p>Across all definitions, NBS are focused on addressing challenges-mostly environmental, social, economic, or climate-related-by harnessing the benefits of natural ecosystems and processes through protection, conservation, restoration, rehabilitation, assisted growth, and/or sustainable use, which often turns out to be more cost-efficient and effective than 'traditional' engineering solutions, grey infrastructure, or nature-blind business practices and models.</p><p>A global reemergence of nature-based solutions</p><p>While NBS as a term emerged in the late 2000s, it has recently garnered renewed attention, especially in the wake of the 27th meeting of the Conference to the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) and the establishment of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) under the Convention on Biological Diversity in late 2022.</p><p>For example, the COP27 cover decision (the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan) encourages Parties 'to consider, as appropriate, nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based approaches [...] for their mitigation and adaptation action' while underlining the importance 'of protecting, conserving, restoring, and sustainably using nature and ecosystems for effective and sustainable climate action.' COP27 also saw the launch of the ENACT initiative, which aims to enhance nature-based solutions for an accelerated climate transformation and strengthen collaboration between existing efforts from both state and non-state actors.</p><p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity, the GBF directly refers to nature-based solutions in its targets 8, 10, and 12, and includes relevant elements and indicators in a variety of other targets as well. As part of the 23 targets under the GBF's four overarching goals, NBS therefore become part of the framework's overall mission to take urgent action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and substantially increasing the area of natural ecosystems by 2050.</p><p>Nature-based solutions for Sri Lanka</p><p>Many NBS function along the line of amplifying or utilising existing ecosystem services and benefits for various purposes. Some examples include climate change mitigation (carbon sequestration and storage through forests), regulation of heat and air quality (e.g., green roofs and walls), flood control and water treatment (e.g., urban wetlands and waterways), disaster risk reduction (e.g., mangrove belts to protect coastal settlements and infrastructure), livelihood generation (e.g., through ecotourism, climate-smart agriculture, and sustainable (agro)forestry), or public health (e.g., bats controlling dengue mosquito populations).</p><p>As a climate-vulnerable island nation, Sri Lanka faces both challenges and opportunities when it comes to the utilisation of NBS. On the one hand, the country needs to find cost-effective and affordable solutions to address climate impacts and strengthen economic development and growth. On the other hand, it has the potential to harness NBS for both a green and a blue economy, scaling up nature-based businesses to benefit from the island's existing wealth of biodiversity and variety of productive natural ecosystems.</p><p>This entails fully nature-based solutions, such as restoring urban wetlands (Colombo's wetlands, for example, have lost 40% of their water holding capacity over the last decade, but could play a critical role for disaster risk reduction and improvement of water and air quality) or afforestation to increase the national forest cover (in line with national commitments and goals), but also the integration of nature-based elements into business models and supply chains. For example, nature-based ingredients and methods could be used in sectors such as the fashion and garment industry; mangrove belts and other ecosystems could be integrated into the design of coastal hotels or resorts; seagrass and other aqua- and mariculture could enhance the blue economy; and investment could be channelled into agroforestry and sustainable, nature-positive agricultural practices, building on existing local and traditional knowledge.</p><p>NBS hold the potential to provide benefits for people, planet, and the economy, but they need to be supported by appropriate frameworks that facilitate investment, prevent greenwashing, and enable entrepreneurs, SMEs, and corporates to access relevant data, resources, accreditation, certification, and risk management techniques. Mainstreaming conservation and sustainable utilisation of natural resources could unlock key synergies and co-benefits across all relevant sectors of Sri Lanka.</p><p>(The writer works as Director: Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

Unexpected extreme weather events in 2022 included severely impacted wildfires in Europe, storms and prolonged droughts in Africa, heatwaves, cold waves, hurricanes, cyclones and so on. This is climate change happening on a daily basis right before our eyes, something that we're starting to see and get to grips with.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, 2023 was held in January in Davos, Switzerland convening the leaders from governments, business, academia, media and civil society to address the state of the world and discuss priorities for the year ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Annual Meeting provides a platform for leaders to exchange ideas, share insights, and engage in meaningful dialogue about key global challenges, such as climate change, economic inequality, geopolitical tensions, and technological disruptions. In the forum, 'Global Economic Outlook: Is this the End of an Era?' IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva shared this famous story about two men in a forest chased by a bear. One of them started running and the second one pulled a pair of sneakers from his backpack. The first one asked, 'Do you think that with sneakers you would run faster than the bear? Then the other one said, 'I don't want to run faster than the bear, I want to run faster than you.'</p><p>The climate crisis demands sneakers for everyone to accelerate the much needed green transition on planet Earth, not just the developed nations. The world today is at a critical inflection point. The sheer number of ongoing crises calls for bold collective action, 'Cooperation in a Fragmented World.'</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The world is facing a climate crisis, with global temperatures continuing to rise due to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Developed countries have a significant role to play in addressing this crisis, given their historical and current emissions and their position of power and resources. The problem of climate change is global in nature and</p><p>requires action from all nations. Developing nations have an important role to play in transitioning to more sustainable practices and technologies, and there is a growing recognition that support and investment from developed nations is crucial in achieving this transition. Cooperation is essential in addressing the climate crisis, as it requires a collective effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. This cooperation must extend beyond national borders and involve a range of stakeholders, including businesses, civil society, and international organisations.</p><p>The developing world, however, faces unique challenges in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including limited resources, competing development priorities, and a lack of technological expertise. This piece articulates how the developed world must use its power and resources to accelerate the green transition in the developing nations, explaining the different ways in their transition to a low-carbon economy, including financial and technical support, knowledge sharing, and leading by example.</p><p>Financial and technical support</p><p>Developed countries have made significant progress in developing and implementing clean energy technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower. The same status in developing and emerging countries varies depending on the specific country and region. However, there has been substantial improvement in recent years in increasing the</p><p>deployment of these clean energy technologies in some of the developing and emerging countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Morocco and Kenya.</p><p>China has become a major player in global efforts to tackle climate change. It is currently the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, but it has also taken significant steps to reduce its carbon footprint and promote sustainable development.</p><p>In recent years, China has invested heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. It has also introduced policies to promote energy efficiency and reduce pollution. In addition, China has played a leading role in international climate negotiations and has pledged to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.</p><p>This financial support to developing nations in their transition to a low-carbon economy can come in many forms, including grants, loans, and technical assistance. For example, developed countries can provide financial assistance to support the development of renewable energy infrastructure in developing nations. This can include funding for</p><p>solar and wind farms, as well as support for energy storage systems. They can also provide technical assistance to help developing countries to build capacity in renewable energy technology. This can include training programs, technical workshops, and other forms of capacity building.</p><p>These technologies can provide a sustainable source of energy for developing countries, but they require technical expertise and resources to implement. Developed countries can share their knowledge and expertise in these areas to support the development and implementation of clean energy technologies in developing countries.</p><p>Another important area is agriculture which is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in many developing countries, particularly in countries where traditional farming practices are still in use. Developed countries can provide financial assistance to support the development of sustainable farming practices including support for agroforestry systems, the adoption to conservation agriculture, and the promotion of sustainable land use.</p><p>However, as 'The Economist' refers, we need to consider the fact that rice, which feeds closer to 60% of the world's population, fuels climate change, due to the high emission of methane from paddy fields. Rice's nutritional quality is another growing concern particularly in terms of its high glycemic index and low levels of iron and zinc which can trigger diabetes.</p><p>Knowledge sharing</p><p>Developed countries have already made significant progress in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and they can share their experiences and lessons learned with developing countries. This can include sharing information on renewable energy technologies, sustainable land management practices, and green building design.</p><p>Another area where developed countries can share their knowledge is in the area of sustainable land management practices demonstrating the benefits including improved soil health, increased crop yields, and reduced greenhouse gases.</p><p>Many developing countries face significant challenges in managing their land resources sustainably. Developed countries have implemented a range of sustainable land management practices, such as agroforestry systems and conservation agriculture practices, which can be adapted to suit the needs of developing countries.</p><p>Leading by example</p><p>Finally, developed countries can lead by example in their transition to a low-carbon economy. By setting ambitious emissions reduction targets and implementing policies that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency, developed countries can demonstrate the viability and benefits of a low-carbon economy. This can inspire developing countries to follow suit and adopt similar policies and practices.</p><p>One important area where developed countries can lead by example is in the development and implementation of renewable energy technologies. Developed countries can set ambitious targets for the deployment of renewable energy technologies and implement policies to support the development and deployment of these technologies.</p><p>This can include policies such as feed-in tariffs, renewable energy standards, and incentives for energy efficiency measures.</p><p>Developed countries can demonstrate the benefits of implementation of sustainable land management practices, such as improved soil health, increased crop yields, and reduced greenhouse gases.</p><p>Climate change is a global problem that affects all nations, and it is essential that all countries work together to address it. Developing nations have a critical role to play in transitioning to more sustainable practices and technologies because many of them are currently reliant on fossil fuels and have rapidly growing populations that</p><p>are increasing their demand for energy. However, transitioning to a low-carbon economy can be challenging for developing nations, particularly if they lack the financial resources or technological expertise to do so. This is why support and investment from developed nations are essential in achieving a successful transition. It is also important to note that this support should be provided in a manner that respects the sovereignty of developing countries and their right to determine their own development paths. Developed countries should work in partnership with developing countries to ensure that the transition is just, equitable, and beneficial for all.</p><p>Developed nations can provide financial assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building to help developing nations adopt sustainable practices and technologies. By working together, all nations can contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change and creating a more sustainable future for everyone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT0805202300035</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6862-DKH1-F00C-60S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 8, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>Business &amp;

In an era, where vast opportunities are growing for low-cost GHG reduction projects, SLCCS enables it to bring multiple benefits to the environment, society and economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Definition</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A carbon offset is a way of compensating for emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. It is a reduction or removal of emissions to compensate for other emissions elsewhere. A carbon credit or offset credit is a transferrable instrument that governments or independent certification bodies have certified. It represents an emission reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or CO2. It can also represent an equivalent amount of other Green House Gases (GHGs). Carbon offsets and credits are a form of carbon pricing, along with carbon taxes and subsidies. The concepts of offsets and credits are linked.</p><p>Both offsets and credits can move among the various markets they are traded. <url normalizedValue=\"https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbonpricing#:~:text=Carbon%20pricing%20is%20an%20instrument,to%20their%20\">https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbonpricing#:~:text=Carbon%20pricing%20is%20an%20instrument,to%20their%20</url> sources%20through%20a</p><p>Carbon markets</p><p>Carbon markets are the trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One tradable carbon credit equals one ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered or avoided. When a credit is used to reduce, sequester, or avoid emissions, it becomes an offset and is no longer 2 tradable. A carbon credit is the representation of a ton of carbon that is no longer emitted into the atmosphere, contributing to the reduction of the greenhouse effect.</p><p>There are several ways to generate carbon credits, including the substitution of fuels in factories, where they stop using non-renewable biomass, such as firewood from deforestation, and start using renewable biomass, which in addition to emitting less greenhouse gases, contribute to the reduction of deforestation.</p><p>Carbon credit is the currency used in the carbon market. In this market, companies that have a very high level of emissions and few options for reduction can buy carbon credits to offset their emissions.</p><p>Thus, it indirectly helps to maintain the reduction project and, in addition to balancing the level of the emissions into the atmosphere, contribute to the sustainable development of poor communities. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sustainablecarbon.com/en/como-sao-gerados\">https://www.sustainablecarbon.com/en/como-sao-gerados</url></p><p>Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement</p><p>On December 11, 1997, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was linked to what is known as the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan. It is an international agreement that sets specific targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing Green House Gas emissions, approximately by about 5 percent.</p><p>Owing to a complex ratification process, it entered into force on 16 February 2005. Currently, there are 192 parties to the Kyoto Protocol (191 States and 1 regional economic integration organization) the European Union, Cook Islands, Niue, and all UN member states except Andorra, Canada, South Sudan, and the United States as of 2022.</p><p>Surprisingly, this excludes the United States, the most noted polluter in the modern world. 3 Percentages in this depiction may not add up to 100% due to independent rounding and the way the inventory quantifies the U.S. as a separate sector. Further, it's based on gross total emissions excluding emissions and removals from the land use, land use change and forestry sector.</p><p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. <url normalizedValue=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/\">https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/</url> The Kyoto Protocol treaty has established three mechanisms that enable countries or operators in developed countries to acquire offset credits. The economics behind these programs were that the marginal cost of reducing emissions would differ among countries.</p><p>Research suggests that the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall cost of meeting the targets. As discussed, the Kyoto Protocol is based on the principles and provisions of the Convention and follows its annex-based structure.</p><p>It only binds developed countries and places a heavier burden on them under the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities\", because it recognizes that they are largely responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Sri Lanka submitted its instrument of acceptance of the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 2 December 2015.</p><p>Sri Lanka Accepts KP Amendment 4 December 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/news/sri-lanka-accepts-kp-amendment\">https://unfccc.int/news/sri-lanka-accepts-kp-amendment</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol\">https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol</url> 4.</p><p>A variety of greenhouse gas reduction projects could be used to create offsets and credits. Forestry projects are the fastest-growing category. Renewable energy is another common type and includes wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, or hydroelectric dams. Other types include energy efficiency projects, such as efficient cookstoves, and the destruction of landfill methane. Further include methods that use negative emission technologies, such as biochar, carbonated building elements, and geologically stored carbon. The primary ingredient for making biochar is a copious quantity of agricultural waste. Covered with tea, rubber and cinnamon plantations, Sri Lanka has no shortage of residual biomass.</p><p>Traditionally, these vegetative remnants and offcuts would be sold for firewood or simply thrown into a heap and burned. <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits#:~:text=A%20variet\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits#:~:text=A%20variet</url> y%20of%20projects%20have,and%20carbon%2Dnegative%20fuels).</p><p>Other International Programs</p><p>Protecting the forests is crucial for the climate. Forests absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and can be a source of greenhouse gas emissions when destroyed or damaged. Countries established the 'REDD+' framework to protect forests as part of the Paris Agreement. 'REDD' stands for 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries.</p><p>The '+' stands for additional forest-related activities that protect the climate, namely sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Under the framework of these REDD+ activities, developing countries can receive results-based payments for emission reductions when they reduce deforestation. This serves as a major incentive for their efforts. Carbon Credits and Sri Lanka Carbon credits could help Sri Lanka in several ways by providing economic and environmental benefits.</p><p>Some of the potential ways in which carbon credits can be beneficial to Sri Lanka are; Mitigation of Climate Change: Sri Lanka can participate in carbon credit programs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>This could involve implementing projects that promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, afforestation, and sustainable agricultural practices. By earning carbon credits through these initiatives, Sri Lanka can contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change. Revenue Generation: Carbon credits can be bought and sold on international markets. By earning carbon credits through sustainable projects, Sri Lanka can sell these credits to countries or companies that exceed their emission targets. This creates a new revenue stream for the country, which can be reinvested in further sustainable development projects.</p><p>Renewable Energy Projects:</p><p>We can develop and invest in renewable energy projects such as wind, solar, hydropower or a hybrid solution that could have a 5 combination of all of them.</p><p>These projects can generate carbon credits by displacing the need for fossil fuel-based energy sources.</p><p>Additionally, they contribute to the country's energy security and reduce dependence on imported fuels. Rural Development: Carbon credit projects often involve activities in rural areas, such as reforestation and sustainable agriculture. These projects can lead to employment creation and improved livelihoods for local communities on agroforestry projects that impound carbon and can provide additional income for the farmers. International Collaboration: Participation in carbon credit programs fosters international collaboration and partnerships.</p><p>Sri Lanka could work with other countries, non-governmental organizations, and private entities to implement and finance projects that reduce emissions and enhance sustainability. Environmental Conservation: Carbon credit projects often involve initiatives that contribute to environmental conservation, such as protecting biodiversity and preserving natural habitats.</p><p>These activities can have a positive effect on the country's ecosystems and biodiversity. Compliance with International Agreements: Sri Lanka's involvement in carbon credit programs can help the country meet its commitments under international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, by actively participating in global efforts to address climate change. In addition, Sri Lanka can enhance its reputation and relationships on the international stage.</p><p>Climate Fund</p><p>The Sri Lanka Climate Fund is a government-owned company established under the Companies Act No.7 of 2007 of Sri Lanka. This fund's effort is to build a new low-carbon business economy and low-carbon life patterns.</p><p>While optimizing carbon emission performance in existing facilities, the company is looking to explore the potential for new effective low-carbon solutions through innovative strategies and collaboration with local and International markets.</p><p>Further, it's essential to take cognizance that the success of carbon credit initiatives depends on effective project implementation, monitoring, and verification. Additionally, the regulatory framework and market conditions for carbon credits can influence their overall impact. Importantly a national instrument and collaboration between all stakeholders would pave the way for the successful implementation of the initiatives. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatefund.lk/slcf_index\">https://www.climatefund.lk/slcf_index</url> Inference \"The small island countries.are on the frontline of being swallowed into an abyss, created initially by human activity and increasingly by inaction. Our vulnerabilities as states on the frontline are profound,\" Hubert Minnis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas.</p><p>World leaders spoke bluntly about the climate crisis, echoing an emotional displeasure during the UN's Climate Action Summit on Sept. 2023. 6 Climate change scares our survival in many ways as it has physical and psychological effects. Sri Lanka has an inordinate need for change.</p><p>It needs to adopt practices that will not only ensure reductions in GHG emission levels but, more importantly, adapt measures to ensure a safe future. It can be easily assimilated that climate change is directly affecting Sri Lanka, whereby we need to look specifically at the impact on Sri Lanka's environment, agriculture, tourism, health, and society at large. We being a developing nation need to increase domestic and foreign investments to further our infrastructure and industry to join the rapidly developing nations.</p><p>Climate change can hinder this process dramatically if efforts are not taken to reduce and arrest the present-day trends.</p><p>Leading stakeholders in this issue the United States, European Union, and China, along with most other developed nations need to consider the negative impact of their industries and curb these industries in a way which will reduce the bearing on climate change. It is the developing nations like us that will suffer first and most.</p><p>We seem to be playing its role well in terms of environmental indicators but, it still has a long way ahead. The policies and measures that governments and other international organizations are implementing to help reduce the negative impacts of climate change are commendable.</p><p>Sri Lanka's Climate Fund and the Carbon Crediting Scheme (SLCCS) are two very respectable national initiatives. It is of the view that both these initiatives need an aggressive awareness campaign amongst the public at large. These instruments need a further intensive and proactive approach to capture the target audience. It is the view that Sri Lanka should accelerate measures to adapt to climate change before it is too late. Even though Sri Lanka has a relatively minor role in mitigating this global threat, Sri Lanka and the whole world will nevertheless have to face this challenge as one. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/baba_accessible\">https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/baba_accessible</url>.</p><p>The writer is formerly Commander Sri Lanka Air Force and Ambassador to Afghanistan President of the Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Also, there have been issues of concern about the management of spatial development programmes and projects that have been started. Consequently, many socioeconomic problems have been created. Some are irreparable; some can be rectified at an excessive cost. Unfortunately, policy formulators have yet to realise the gravity of the issue, and they keep blind eyes, allowing further mismanagement of the limited land resources without remedial actions. To understand the seriousness of the problem and the urgent need for solutions, some of the issues and related programs and activities that led to significant misuse/mismanagement of space and their effects are discussed below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">4.1 Land Alienation Policy, Unplanned Village Expansion Schemes and Encroachments</p><p>The traditional villages could no longer accommodate the increasing population, preventing them from becoming landless, homeless, and unemployed. The Land Development Ordinance-1935 allowed the legal alienation of state lands to landless people. The government has implemented many Village Expansion schemes, especially in densely populated wet zones, to distribute lands to spillovers from traditional villages for agriculture and dwelling purposes. Very often, marginal lands next to the traditional villages, buffer zones of sanctuaries and national parks, and forest reserves around villages were selected for this purpose. Those were hilly or rocky trains with poor-quality soil, without drinking and irrigation water. Under a scientific and rational land use system, most of those should have been used for nature reserves, agroforestry, etc. These lands do not generate a decent income to sustain settler families. Hence, it amounts to misuse of land and other resources.</p><p>Though the legal framework was provided under the Land Development Ordinance, there was no consistent policy or regular system to distribute land. So, people suffering from land hunger were prompted to encroach on state lands for housing, cultivation, and business purposes. Later, the government adopted a policy for regularising the encroached lands, and encroaching became the accepted practice to receive a block of state land. This policy stimulated people (not only the landless) to encroach on any vacant state lands, including roads, rivers, reservoirs, forest and wildlife reservations, and environmentally sensitive places such as hilltops, flood plains, water sources, etc. Due to social and political pressure, the government was compelled to provide infrastructure facilities and other amenities to these unviable settlements at a massive cost. A proper analysis of the socioeconomic cost of these settlements would reveal that settling them in better locations would be much more economical and enable them to find jobs and easy access to services. In that case, the unit infrastructure cost per household will be much lower. The concept behind land allocation in village expansion and colonization schemes seems to be that farmers must cultivate the same land, which shelters them. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of infrastructure, service delivery system, and convenience of settlers have not received due attention.</p><p>Moreover, there have been instances where lands suitable for productive purposes (commercial activities, industries, or tourism) have been alienated in small blocks for low-income housing schemes. Similarly, some East Coast lands ideal for tourism-related projects are used for military camps and related activities. A sizable block of land in Borella with very high commercial value is used for the prison. High-value lands in Colombo Fort have been used as military and defense headquarters until they were relocated recently. All those are a few examples of government-sponsored uneconomical use and mismanagement of the space.</p><p>4.2 Uncontrolled Urban Sprawl and its Effects</p><p>Western province, which includes the Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts, has the highest population density in the country: 3621,1802 and 815 people per sq. km. respectively. The urban sprawl of Combo extends more than 40 Km. from the city centre, which encompasses catchment areas of 3 District capitals, forming a single sizeable urban agglomerate. Settlements are expanding rapidly without proper regional and sub-regional plans to guide them. In the absence of proper spatial plans, land is being sold for property development in every nook and corner of the province, disregarding the need for transport, associated infrastructure, and urban services. If the present phase of land sub-division and urban sprawl continues for a few more years, the entire province will be covered with roofs and septic tanks, leaving little space for other human settlement needs.</p><p>Another significant issue is the urbanisation along the main roads on a linear pattern (ribbon-type development), erecting barricades denying proper access to the much larger land area behind the built strip. Hence, those lands would remain rural or shanties with no commercial value. For instance, either side along the Galle Road from Colombo to Tangalle (205 Km) is blocked with linear structures, leaving little room for access to scattered housing and settlements (large areas) behind. It looks like the entire road passes through an extended urban area, making no difference between the village and the town along the road. The same situation exists along the Kandy Road up to Ambepussa, Negambo Road to Chilaw and Ratnapura Road to Hanwella.The ribbon-type development along the main roads prevents the trickle-down effects of costly road programmes. Urban sprawl is a significant issue for cities like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, which are getting overpopulated beyond their carrying capacity. To accommodate the growing population, physical developments occur in environmentally sensitive surroundings of most hill country cities.</p><p>4.3 Conflict Between Settlement Pattern and Transport Solutions.</p><p>4.3.1 Colombo Metropolitan Region</p><p>According to an IMF analysis, Sri Lanka is among the countries with the slowest road speed. As per the Road Quality Index 2019, Sri Lanka's score is 3.9, which is below the global average of 4.07. The traffic congestion and transport problem in the greater Colombo area has been a topic for several decades for many studies by transport planners and international funding agencies. Professor Amsal Kumarage states in his article titled URBAN TRAFFIC CONGESTION: THE PROBLEM and SOLUTION, published in the Economic Review, Sri Lanka, 'According to the TransPlan Model (UoM,1999), average traffic speeds within the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) have dropped to around 20km/hr today. The typical corridor (major artery) speed is around 10-15 kms/hr within Colombo City'. His research report titled GRATER COLOMBO TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, submitted to the Minister of Transport, states 'around 70% of the length of the national roads within the 10-km radius from the city centre is congested throughout the day. The average speed on these roads falls below 15 kms per hour. At such speeds, fuel consumption doubles, consequently increasing air pollution as well'. The article titled Transport Delemma: What is the Way out? Published in Daily FT on 7 February 2019, it states, 'Commuting to and from Colombo city is a daily struggle. The average speed in Colombo's major corridors during the peak hours has reduced to about 12km per hour'. 'The loss of productive time increases costs and productivity losses and waste of foreign exchange on fuel and mental agony of those commuters and drivers are the outcomes of the present transport economy of the country'. 'The average speed in Colombo major corridors during the peak hours has reduced to about 12km per hour'.</p><p>The above excerpts emphasise the gravity of transport problems in Colombo City, Greater Colombo, and the Western Province. This problem also exists in other cities to varying degrees. Sri Lankan professionals and international funding agencies have put forward various solutions and project proposals to resolve the transport problem, especially in the Greater Colombo and the western province. Among them, the main proposals are Integrated Transport System, Multi-Modal Transport Hubs, Mass Transit Systems, Park and Drive facilities, and improvement of the railway system. The essence of these proposals is the need for an integrated transport system (Public Transport) combining different modes of transport (road, rail, marine, aviation, and public and other types of operations such as private, public, individual, etc.). Some activities of those plans/ proposals have been implemented; others are yet to be considered or implemented. Though many proposals exist, there is no officially accepted master plan to resolve the transport problem in the Western region or the country except for some piecemeal projects. Despite all those proposals and efforts, the transport problem worsens daily.</p><p>4.3.2 Settlement Pattern Discourage the Public Transport</p><p>With the expansion of secondary and tertiary sector activities, urban areas, especially the Colombo urban agglomerate, have become a hive of economic activities demanding more human resources of different levels to operate them. In addition to professionals and skilled workforce, it requires many unskilled labour and low-income groups to discharge municipal services, maintenance works, etc. However, those people can't afford to live within the city or near workplaces, as the rent and land prices are beyond their affordability. This is a dilemma: the people who should attend the daily functions in the urban areas can't afford to live there. So, the low-income groups are settling in slums of the city periphery or near transport hubs.</p><p>Professionals and middle-income groups travel daily to the city for employment, and children's schooling, develop their habitats on low-priced lands, far away from public transport infrastructure and other urban facilities. They must use a private mode of transport from home to the bus stop or railway station to use public transport, and from the destination, to reach the workplace, school, etc. This discourages the use of public transportation, encourages the use of private vehicles, and increases the demand for more and more roads and personal vehicles. This settlement pattern generates morning traffic toward the city and outward in the evening, creating heavy traffic congestion in one direction. Yet, suburbs or satellite cities do not provide urban facilities such as workplaces, schools, hospitals, shopping malls, etc. UDA planning guidelines and regulations are site-specific, limited to the declared urban area and do not consider the big picture. Sometimes, approvals are granted for large housing schemes, away from the essential services, compelling the use of the existing narrow village access roads and other infrastructure. Also, land blocking-out plans do not consider basic aspects such as sewerage, stormwater drainage, and the natural and built environment of the area. That creates many social and economic problems and increases pressure on the government to resolve them.</p><p>Based on the plethora of studies and proposals, it may be possible to introduce a proper transport policy and implement a comprehensive transport plan.But most of these proposals are to resolve the issue within the transport sector itself without looking at the macro picture, especially the settlement pattern (spatial distribution of physical development). Without addressing the core issue of space misuse/ mismanagement, even a well-formulated transport system may not resolve the transport problem in the Western region because it will not reduce the need for personalised modes of transport. A drastic change in settlement patterns is essential to reduce costs and improve efficiency, comfort, and reliability through a public transport system. Unplanned and unmanaged land use and settlement patterns increase the demand for transportation, private vehicles, more roads, and related infrastructures.</p><p>4.4 Adverse Impact of Settlement Pattern on the Cost of Infrastructure</p><p>Irrational use of the space increases capital and operational infrastructure costs (roads, electricity, water, etc.) while causing an added burden on the service delivery system and inconveniencing the service recipient. In many countries, higher population density reduces the unit costs of infrastructure and operational expenses. As discussed below, while the population is increasing, the unit cost of infrastructure is also increasing in Sri Lanka due to space mismanagement. Instead of following a rational spatial policy, the government brings all infrastructure facilities to where people live at any cost. In some instances, paved roads, electricity, water, and telephone lines extend several kilometers to provide the facility for a few houses. This often happens under the Decentralized Budgets and Provincial Council allocations.</p><p>The road network in Sri Lanka has a total length of 114,039 km for a population of 22.2 million and a land area of 65,000 sq. Km.Sri Lanka has the highest road density in South Asia, with 173.9 Km of roads per 100 sq. Km of land area as of 2016. Road density-wise, Sri Lanka is in the 47th place in the global ranking. This is on par with advanced nations. For instance, the average road density in the UK is 175 Km/ 100 Sq. Km. Though Sri Lanka is a developing country, its road density is almost equal to the UK's. Perhaps, in a few more years, it will surpass the UK.</p><p>Out of the total network of 114,039 Km.,85,239 Km. are local authority roads that provide access to scattered villages, houses, and other properties. If minor access roads maintained by communities and individuals are added, the actual road density would be much higher than the official figure. The high density of rural roads demands a high maintenance cost, while its economic contribution is low. The road density could have been reduced if the human settlement development had been developed according to a rational spatial/land use/physical plan. In that case, most local authority roads could have become unwanted. For instance, Malaysia's per capita income is US$ 13,382; the total population is 33 million, and the land area is 328,550 sq. Km. But the intercity connectivity and city travel are more convenient, with a road density of only km.47 per 100 sq. Km. Though the road density is high, intercity connectivity in Sri Lanka was inferior (lengthy travel time) until recently, and city travelling is still cumbersome. This shows no correlation between road density economic growth and the quality of transport. The high-density rural road network could only contribute a little to boost the national and rural economy while increasing demand for the maintenance budget. In many cases, the internal rate of return could have been negative. It shows that significant capital expenditures incurred for several decades, especially on access roads, achieved social justice but have been economically unproductive. Also, these roads' land area isn't justified as an efficient use of limited land resources. But, if we had kept the highway network in good condition and had appropriate standards, the contribution to economic growth could have been much higher through improved intercity and inter-regional connectivity. However, inter-city connectivity has been improved significantly due to the high priority placed on improving the national road network during the last two decades.</p><p>Sri Lanka's Road network is not a systematically planned one. It is only a gradual development over a long period, from footpaths, cart tracks, gravel roads, metal and tarred black surfaces, and to the present condition of asphalt-paved two-lane roads, responding to the needs of different eras. Most roads do not have the shortest connectivity or access, appropriate width of the Right of Way, or horizontal/vertical alignments. Also, urbanisation has evolved on a linear pattern (ribbon-type development) along the roads, limiting road widening space. Thus, improving the road network to meet the present-day requirements involves high costs for land acquisition and profile corrections.</p><p>In addition to roads and transport, electricity, pipe-borne water, and telephone(landlines) have become very expensive under the present settlement pattern. According to the Findings of the Committee Appointed to Investigate Power System Failures on November 29, 2021, and December 03, 2021, 'The CEB distribution network consists of about 33,300 km of 33 kV lines, 2,400 km of 11 kV lines, and about 150,000 km of 400 V or 230 V lines3. The distribution network of LECO consists of about 1,000 km of 11 kV lines and 3,800 km of 400 V or 230 V lines4.'. Accordingly, the total length of the distribution lines comes to 190,500 Km. The total domestic electricity connection is 6,709,574. This averages 35 connections per Kilometer or 2.9 connections per sq. km., reflecting a high capital cost per connection. For instance, under the Matara District Integrated Rural Development project, the electricity line was extended by about 13 km from Morawaka to the Kalubovitiyana tea factory in 1980. After two years of completion, I could find only about 30 domestic connections for the entire length as most houses were scattered and far from the electricity line. Today, the situation may be different due to the ribbon development along the road. Though the data is not readily available, like electricity, the capital and maintenance cost per connection for water and telecommunication would also be high.</p><p>4.5 Aligning Spatial Planning with Environmental Concerns and Initiatives.</p><p>Construction and cultivation on environmentally sensitive locations such as hilly areas, steep slopes, catchments and reservations of rivers and reservoirs have caused silting of water bodies, frequent floods, earth slips, etc., causing loss of assets, environment stability and human lives and costing considerable sums to provide relief, relocate and reconstruct. Devastating floods and earth slips are frequent occurrences, with every monsoon rain destroying many lives and assets, while the intensity of such disasters is increasing. This has become a common feature in the hill country. In addition to the risk, the people living in such locations are trapped in poverty. Unplanned land use and physical development in hilly areas demand more roads and other physical structures, disturbing soil stability. Further, it exerts pressure on environmentally sensitive areas for agriculture. In addition to local issues, it creates some national problems, such as the siltation of reservoirs, water pollution, floods, and climate change.</p><p>Except for some areas in the Western province, human-wild animal conflict (wild elephants, monkeys, peacocks, hedgehogs, wild bows, etc.) is a critical problem in other provinces. The gravity of the issue differs from province to province and location to location. The damage to the economy, human settlement and life are high, and its social implications are immense. Expansion of human settlements to animal habitats, the location of development projects across elephant corridors, the declaration of small land areas as wildlife reserves between or within human settlements, and isolated and scattered small national parks are the leading causes. Small patches of forest/wildlife reserves within human territories provide daytime shelter for elephants to roam villages and farmlands for food at night. There are 28 national parks scattered throughout this small island. Except for the Yala and Wilpattu, all others are sieged by human settlements, restricting the roaming space for elephants and other animals. Sometimes, small human settlements are sieged by national parks, restricting people's free movement. According to the present land use pattern, scrublands are the buffer zone between human and animal habitats. Usually, food for most animals is found in open areas and scrublands rather than in the thick forest. Elephants coming to buffer zones to scrublands for food are naturally enthused to invade human settlements where food is abundant. Consequently, farmers/villagers are abandoning farming and making despicable attempts to co-exist with wild animals on the same land area as a survival strategy. The government strategy also seems to protect wild animals in a co-existing environment with human beings. In other words, it is a competition between animals and humans to use the same land simultaneously for food and shelter, increasing the conflict.</p><p>Both local and foreign environmentalists are concerned about the damage caused to wild animals, especially elephants. They and the wildlife department see only one side of the problem, which prevents a sustainable solution. According to a preliminary estimate compiled by HARTI, the crop damage caused by wild animals in the first half of 2022 is Rs. 30,215 million (US$ 87.5 million). It is unclear whether the figure includes the loss of human and animal lives, the opportunity costs of abandoning farming, and the cost incurred by the government and farmers for protection. Today, wild animals have been dispersed in many areas of the country and infiltrate both new and old settlements, making it a national issue. The national budget for 2023 has allocated Rs 525 million for electric fencing and human-elephant conflict mitigation. Similar or more amounts would be allocated annually, but isolated piecemeal works may not derive a long-lasting solution. Total socioeconomic losses and expenditures incurred by the Department of Wildlife annually call for a permanent solution.</p><p>In addition to the conflict with wild animals, most farmers in the dry zone face the problem of stray cattle. According to the traditional way of herd management, cows are released to find food from anywhere after milking. Bulls and heifers are released into the forest to grow wild. This was not an issue when there were common grazing lands. The land use pattern has been drastically changed, and there is no space for common grazing grounds. Consequently, stray cattle have become a nuisance for farmers and national parks. Farmers are abandoning their farming in some areas as they can't fight with influential cattle owners. This land use pattern is no longer viable in Sri Lanka. However, government authorities are still trying to maintain the system using political power instead of encouraging cattle owners to consider alternatives. The settlement and land use patterns need considerable changes to overcome the conflict between humans, wild animals, and stray cattle.</p><p>4.6 Overall Impact of Space Mismanagement</p><p>Since independence, Sri Lanka has spent a colossal amount of borrowed/grants and own funds and sacrificed resources for development, especially for physical infrastructure. While some have contributed to the growth and well-being of the citizens, the rest have created irreparable damage to the environment and economic advancement and further obstructed the space for future development. The inappropriate interaction of humans (location of activities) with nature and land resources to satisfy socio-economic needs is a significant factor affecting the cost of production and competitiveness of our products in the local and global market. The logistics arrangement is a substantial cost component in agriculture and industry. Gathering local products, particularly agriculture products, to the market from spatially unorganized scattered smallholdings is a significant challenge, leading to high cost, time, inconvenience, and quality deterioration. The farm gate prices of locally grown foods are very low in Sri Lanka, but the retail price for the consumer is exceptionally high. Sometimes, farmers spend more time and resources to sell than they spend to produce. For instance, in December 2023, a farmer told me his vehicle hire for transporting 100 kg of tomatoes to the Dambulla economic centre was Rs.1500 and sold it at Rs 150.00 per kg and spent the whole day, which could have spent to earn Rs 2000 from working elsewhere. So, his selling cost for a kg is Rs 35.00. Accordingly, his actual farmgate price is only Rs.115.00. However, I observed that the retail price in Colombo was above Rs. 500.00 during the same period. A significant portion of this price difference must be attributed to the system's inefficiency, including logistics difficulties, arising from the scattered smallholding system. In contrast, if imported, it could be much cheaper. So, Sri Lanka's sluggish economic growth is a structural issue for which spatial mismanagement is also accountable to a significant extent. Without correcting those problems, Sri Lanka will not be globally competitive in the ever-expanding market economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLGUAR-SRILAGUARD1001202400002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLGUAR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B2S-1S31-F00C-60TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4145\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Sri Lanka Guardian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sri Lanka Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18517\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

It has been a traditional way of family farming near the domicile since ancient times. During the evolution of this farming system, useful trees, herbaceous shrubs, vines, and animals were identified, protected, and managed while undesirable tree species were eliminated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eventually, superior foreign plant species were obtained and incorporated into the gardens. This process of forest garden diversification and development has continued, not only through deliberate additions to the existing biological mix, but also in the establishment of new gardens supporting new generations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A forest garden can be defined as a family farming system initiated, developed, and sustained in the vicinity of the domicile. This garden supplies most of the family's basic resource needs from a small parcel of land comprising a mix of highly diverse tree, herbaceous shrub, and vine species. Kandyan forest gardens have attained a higher level of development and botanic complexity than anywhere else in the country.</p><p>Kandyan forest gardens occur at elevations ranging from about 200 to 800 metres above mean sea level in high rainfall areas of mid-altitude hills of Western and Northern escarpments of the central mountain massif in Sri Lanka. They provide provisioning, supporting, regulating and cultural services to the farming communities.</p><p>For example, some provisioning services include fruits, spices and condiments, vegetable, edible root and tubers, palm nuts and associated products such as treacle and toddy, beverages, animal products, medicine, flowers, firewood, and timber. The high density of trees creates a favorable microclimate for living under tropical conditions and builds a very high resilience to economic and environmental shocks.</p><p>Rapid population expansion and thereby fragmentation of forest gardens in this farming community has adversely affected these services at the household level. This social fragmentation of gardens emphasises the need to direct national attention towards sustaining and regenerating this heritable agroecosystem.</p><p>Most previous review studies have focused mainly on the botanic complexity of the garden system. Factors such as social fragmentation of communities, accelerated land degradation by soil erosion, loss of soil productivity, crop damages from small wild animals and extinction of domestic animals have not been adequately researched, discussed, or addressed. Hence, this article, written in consultation with a Senior Land Use Planner in Canada and a Senior Agronomist from Sri Lanka, is intended to make the public aware of the need for conserving and upgrading this agrarian heritage for the benefit of generations to come. It is also intended to educate the Kandyan forest garden communities on ways of regenerating this agroforestry system to enhance productivity and economic benefits from this nature-friendly farming system.</p><p>Soils of the gardens</p><p>The major soils supporting the Kandyan forest gardens include Red-Yellow Podzolic, Reddish Brown Latosolic, and Immature Brown Loam soils.</p><p>The Red-Yellow Podzolic soils occur in areas such as Awissawella, Ratnapura, Openayake, Galigamuwa, Pallegoda, Weddagala, Giragama and Nawalapitiya. The characteristic strong brown to yellowish-brown makes them easily recognisable. They are best observed in tea plantations in Giragama village near Pilimathalawa.</p><p>The Reddish Brown Latosolic soils are found in areas such as Matale, Kandy, Ukuwela, Gelioya, Rambukkana and Mawanella. These soils have a characteristic reddish-brown to brown and are easily recognised in excavation sites in the Matale municipal area.</p><p>The Immature Brown Loam soils are best expressed in areas such as Akurana, Geli Oya, Pilimathalawa, Kadugannawa, Galagedara and Mawanella. The characteristic dark brown to dark grey-brown makes them easily recognisable. They can be observed along either side of the A-10 road near the Galagedara Police Station in Kandy.</p><p>The productivity of these forest garden soils has declined due to accelerated soil erosion, moisture depletion and loss of soil fertility. Adoption of appropriate soil and water conservation measures, re-introduction of domestic animals, production, and application of compost to the land would enhance garden productivity.</p><p>Plant diversity</p><p>The Kandyan forest garden system consists of tree, herbaceous shrub and vine species. With respect to community use, it includes fruit crops, spice and condiment species, vegetable crops, root and tuber crops, palm trees, beverage crops, medicinal plants, ornamental species, timber species and other useful plants.</p><p>Fruit crops</p><p>Nearly 100 fruit crops occur in the Kandyan forest garden system. The more common crops include avocado, banana, durian, Jak fruit, mango, mangosteen, mandareen, rambutan and papaya. However, maintaining all of these fruit crop species plays a significant role in in-situ conservation of genetic resources for future use.</p><p>Fruit consumption in the country remains far below the actual requirement for a healthy life. Hence, enhancing fruit crop cultivation within the forest garden system and marketing products to appropriate consumer destinations in the country would help increase daily fruit consumption of the nation.</p><p>Spices and condiments</p><p>The major crops used as spices, condiments and other food additives include clove, nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon, goraka, tamarind, ginger, turmeric, pepper, green chilli, hot chilli, curry leaves, rampe, sera and vanilla. These crops are grown mainly for family consumption. Excess produce from crops such as clove, nutmeg, goraka, tamarind, ginger, turmeric, and pepper provide an additional income.</p><p>Most of these spices are also used for indigenous medicines and first aid treatments. Adoption of newly developed land and crop management technologies such as establishment of individual platforms for soil and water conservation in tree crops, frequent manure application, timely pruning and training of plant canopy and use of scientific post-harvest operations would help enhance economic returns from these crops.</p><p>Vegetables</p><p>Nearly 30 vegetable crops are widely grown in market gardens in nearby areas but very few occur in forest gardens. This is due to the adverse shading effects on herbaceous vegetables under the canopy of tree crops in the forest garden system.</p><p>The few vegetables commonly grown include crops such as jak fruit, bread fruit, wing bean, yard long bean, green eggplant, thibbotu and leafy vegetable such as kathurumurunga and spinach. Growing herbaceous vegetables in pots in areas which receive adequate sunlight and adoption of \"vertical-pot-farming\" technology is recommended for enhancing vegetable production for household consumption.</p><p>Root and tuber crops</p><p>Among root and tuber crop species grown in the forest garden system, four crops: cassava, sweet potato, large leaved yam and dioscorea are commonly grown for family consumption. Enhancing the cultivation of these crops, would be an appropriate food production strategy as these crops have a high resilience to adverse climatic changes such as the erratic nature of rains.</p><p>Palm trees</p><p>The Kandyan forest garden system includes a few palm tree species such as coconut, king coconut, areca nut and toddy palm. Some uses of these crops include coconut kernel for household food preparation and oil extraction.</p><p>King coconut is consumed as a fresh drink, arecanut for chewing with betel, toddy palm for preparation of treacle and toddy.</p><p>The toddy consumption has been limited to elderly male family members. However, female members are very actively involved in preparation of treacle as a cottage industry which could use a helping hand to expand this micro enterprise.</p><p>Beverage crops</p><p>The major beverage crops include tea, coffee, and cocoa. Tea is available as some forest gardens have been developed on marginal tea lands. Some uses of these beverage crops include preparation of hot beverage from coffee powder for domestic consumption as well as selling the excess coffee, harvested green leaves of tea and cocoa seed for income.</p><p>Medicinal plants</p><p>More common medicinal plants which grow in forest gardens include akkapana, beli, endaru, hathawariya, komarika, murunga, pavatta, polpala and wadakaha. These plants are widely used in indigenous medicines and first aid treatments.</p><p>Ornamental crops</p><p>Many species of ornamental crops are also grown in the forest garden system. Species such as agloanema, anthuriums, begonia, bougainvillea, caladium, cane palm, cannas, carnation, cordyline, croton, dahlia, dieffenbachia, dracaena, ferns, fittonia, gerbera, hibiscus, jasmine, livistona, maranta, monstera, orchids, peperomia, roses, rhapis and spathiphyllumare widely maintained. Some uses of these crops include maintaining natural beauty of the garden, harvesting cut flowers for indoor decorations, and use in religious activities.</p><p>In some forest gardens, ornamental crops such as anthuriums and jasmine are maintained as a cottage industry for income.</p><p>Timber</p><p>Among the timber plants, species which occur commonly in forest gardens include ginisapu, halmilla, hawarinuga, ketakela, lunimidella, mahogany, pihimbiya and teak. These species are grown, harvested, and used for indoor repairs to the domicile and manufacture of furniture for domestic uses and sold for timber value in case of financial emergencies. The canopy of plants is periodically lopped out and hardwood is used as firewood for domestic cooking.</p><p>Garden canopy structure</p><p>The general botanic structure of Kandyan forest gardens is depicted as a multistory plant canopy system. Each canopy level consists of some combinations of plant species. Plants such as coconut, jakfruit and durian represent the upper canopy level; nutmeg, clove, mango, papaw, avocado, mangosteen, breadfruit, rambutan, citrus and papaya occupy the middle level; banana, cocoa, passion fruit, betel vine and vanilla represent the lower level. Ginger, turmeric, herbaceous vegetables, and yam occupy the ground level.</p><p>Domestic animals</p><p>Since very little sunlight penetrates the Kandyan forest garden canopy, it is usually not possible to grow grass and fodder crops for a large herd of domestic animals. However, a few free-range chickens for eggs, perhaps, a cow for milk, a few pigs, depending on the culture and rarely stall-fed goats, are commonly kept.</p><p>Animal feed consists of tree canopy periodically lopped out, daily kitchen refuses, and grasses and fodder collected from common property land resources such as roadsides and other public lands.</p><p>This domestic animal component plays a significant role in the daily provision of protein rich foods such as milk and egg for garden families.</p><p>In cases of financial emergencies, income can be supplemented by selling an animal. Some forest garden farmers also maintain bee colonies for harvesting honey. Bees also contribute to the pollination of local flowering plants.</p><p>Fragmentation of gardens</p><p>The Kandyan forest gardens have been subject to social fragmentation resulting from expansion of village populations and construction of separate houses for new families. This reduces land availability for growing crops.</p><p>Therefore, it is suggested to shift from large canopy crop varieties to dwarf type varieties for crops such as mango, guava, banana, amberella, durian, nutmeg, coffee, toddy palm and coconut in fragmented gardens.</p><p>Soil and water conservation</p><p>Soils of Kandyan forest gardens which occur in newly fragmented lands with sloping terrain require conservation of the soil resource base to sustain system productivity. Since these gardens receive water mainly from rains and the thick forest reserves on the crests of landscapes receive diminished water due to rapid runoff of rain fall, it is important to conserve water within the garden system.</p><p>Structures such as lock and spill drains, individual platforms, percolation pits, and cut and filled slope protection structures are suitable for conserving soil and arresting water runoff. Hence, gardeners need awareness and development of skills to construct and establish these structures in their forest gardens.</p><p>Protection from wild animals</p><p>The most common wild animals that cause crop losses in forest gardens include boar, monkey, porcupine, palm civet and squirrel.</p><p>There are strategic approaches and potential management strategies, tested and available for effectively controlling the invasion of these animals. Some possible approaches are repelling techniques and translocation. Effective repelling techniques include the use of flashlights, guard dogs, firecrackers, catapults, and air rifles.</p><p>The Kandyan forest gardens collectively represent the oldest agroforestry system in Sri Lanka. More attention is required from researchers, agronomists, land use planners and policymakers as well as local farmers for conservation of this important agrarian heritage for the benefit of generations to come.</p><p>As global concern grows over the destruction of tropical forests, the loss of biodiversity and the need for sustainable agriculture for smallholder farmers, this forest garden system deserves more careful consideration.</p><p>The writer is a Freelance Agriculture Scientist in natural resource management.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

A strong regional structure is now in place and the teams are hard at work on many aspects, with the solid backing of the WNPS and its entire strength.</p><p> PLANT's work has been funded by WNPS and by international agencies such as Rainforest Trust and The Quick Response Fund for Nature from the USA and is engaged with several local partners as well.In 2011 CCC achieved an international landmark with the establishment of the Hiniduma Bio-Link forest corridor, the first of its kind community-based reforestation programme registered in Asia under the global Plan Vivo standard.</p><p> This project is carried out using ecosystemrestoration methods such as Analog forestry through supporting home gardenreforestation and agroforestry using a farmer-based participatory approach.\"PLANT is on a constant search to gather like-minded partners to enhance the quality and impact of our conservation outreach.</p><p> With the rapid strides being made on Emerald Trails, we need insightful expertise on Reforesting, ourimpacts on the Climate, Carbon footprints and community interaction. We are excited with the prospect of working with CCC and leveraging their global exposure and world-class knowledge and networks into our project work\"said Shevon Gooneratne, Director of PLANT.</p><p>Our newly rebranded corporate name clearly defines our commitment to long-term conservation efforts and to the development of a collaborative consortium of like-minded institutions and individuals to act together in concert\" says Director and CEO of CCC, Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne.</p><p> \"Over the past 12 years, CCC has developed a strong background of forestry, carbon and environmental conservation disciplines, and has facilitated the support of global giants such as Patagonia, Ansell and Marks and Spencer as well as local conglomerates such as the Hirdaramani Group, Eswaran Brothers and EFL for its forrest based conservation projects. CCC intends to use its network of corporate clients, and global brands to further the objectives of PLANT and to support their vision of protecting and preserving on biodiversity and forests for the generation to come.</p><p> \" he went on to say.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COLGAZ-COLGAZTT17102022016922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COLGAZ2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66MT-NHB1-JCH9-G1X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">461128</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Colombo Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Colombo Gazette (Pittakotte, Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 17, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUVU</classCode><className>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N115310MM</classCode><className>REFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D5BM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Among the branches of trees, otherworldly-looking primates - the Tarsiers - leap upon unsuspecting insects. Above them hornbills feast on fruit, then fly away to spread the seeds across the island. While Sulawesi's species' richness is enormous, this island is also facing a serious challenge - one of which is unsustainable agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Research has shown that using non-organic fertilizers has contributed to the decreasing quality of soil and water on the island, thus affecting its biodiversity. This is not just a problem for nature. As the UN Food and Agriculture Organization confirms, biodiversity contributes to people's livelihoods and provides multiple ecosystem services such as clean air and water, carbon storage, climate regulation and reduced risk of soil erosion.</p><p>To address this, Burung Indonesia (BirdLife Partner) is supporting local farmers in developing sustainable agriculture practices. With support from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund - Burung Indonesia's partner in Central Sulawesi - along with local NGOs Yayasan Panorama Alam Lestari (YPAL) and Perkumpulan Salanggar, they have developed organic fertilizers using ingredients that can be easily found in every household.</p><p>In Mayakeli dan Wera Village in central Sulawesi, YPAL helped the community to develop organic farming practices which increased the productivity of their rice fields, as well as repelling pests. For the pest repellent, they created an eco-friendly formula using garlic, turmeric, lemongrass, pepper and various leaves, mixed with PH-neutral liquid soap. For fertilizer, they mixed banana stems, Gamal plant, manure, cassava and sugar to produce liquid organic fertilizer to increase the nitrate, phosphate and calcium concentration of the soil. The use of organic pesticide is only recommended if the damage to the plant reaches 80 percent, while the fertilizer can be applied once a week to the rice fields and vegetable farms.</p><p>The use of this organic fertilizer has significantly increased the production of rice and vegetables, with the results typically beginning to show in the third harvesting period. During first two harvests, the farmers still produced 680 kilograms of rice. But by the third, they were harvesting 800 kilograms, and consequently earning more money.</p><p>Elsewhere, Perkumpulan Salanggar helped to develop a different method to control pests on dry fields. People who lived in Balayon and Bojoumete villages on the Banggai islands installed traps made from plastic water bottles. These were painted with bright colours to attract the insects, which then became immobilized by the glue on top. Alongside their crops, the farmers grow plants with strong odours, such as lemongrass and zinnia, to attract predatory insects that eat pest caterpillars and aphids. These methods have successfully increased the productivity of the farm and the quality of the produce, allowing farmers to earn 300,000 to 500,000 Rupiah per yard from growing vegetables. As such, organic agriculture is helping to increase food security and nutrition on top of the financial benefits.</p><p>While these farmers concentrated on organic fertilizers and pesticides, another farmer in Gorontalo - a BirdLife Nature's Heroes awardee - successfully developed agroforestry on his land. As a recent migrant, Sartam set about cultivating sloping land near forest where Heck's Macaque - a primate unique to Sulawesi - lives. He applied terracing on the sloped land, and introduced an intercropping method to optimise the productivity of his cacao plantation: while waiting for cacao to be harvested, he planted palm tree, ginger, and turmeric among the trees.</p><p>As part of his sustainable agroforestry practices, since 2017, Sartam has been using organic fertilizer consisting of manure fermented with straw and corn stalks. The productivity of his farm has increased as a result: three years ago, his two-hectare cacao plantation only produced 680 kilograms. Based on Burung Indonesia's records, in 2020 Sartam harvested 1.5 tons of cacao, increasing his earnings accordingly.</p><p>By developing sustainable agriculture practices, ranging from eco-friendly fertilizers and pesticides to intercropping, the community has seen first-hand that they play a vital role in protecting their environment, while maintaining sustainable livelihoods.

Coconut is uniquely positioned in Sri Lanka as a commercial crop of which 70% is used for local consumption.

The balance 900,000 acres which constitutes 83% of the total land cover are below five acres. These smallholders or home gardens are distributed among one million growers. 'Very often these small-scale holders do not realise that their coconut gardens too need to be developed to commercially viable units, irrespective of the land extent, for which GAP such as soil and water management, fertiliser management, inter-cropping, etc. are required,' says Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairperson Madhavie Herath. The CCB, as its Chairperson explains, is committed to taking GAP know-how to the grassroots level through their field officers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasing production</p><p>The competition in the market for coconut between the industry and consumers and the mismatch between the demand and supply drive the nut price up each day, says Herath. 'This has a cyclic effect as people will find it difficult to spend on coconuts and the industry will find it difficult to buy nuts at a higher rate and sell for a competitive price in the international market.' GAPs, therefore, are the answer to increase productivity in the short-term and to increase the extent long-term, says Herath. 'If not for the hybrid variety, it takes about five years to bear nuts, therefore in the short-term we need to increase the yield from a tree. When the production is increased, a reasonable price will be decided which will benefit both the customer and the industry,' says CCB Chairperson who goes on to note that the Coconut Research Institute helps CCB take the latest research findings on high yielding varieties to the growers. 'We hope to increase annual nut production to at least 3.6 to 3.8 billion by 2025 for which we encourage all coconut growers, irrespective of the acreage, to adhere to best practices that CCB helps disseminate from sapling stage to maturity of a coconut tree,' Herath remarks.</p><p>Finding a niche market</p><p>Coconut is grown in 90 countries in the world and we are the fourth largest coconut producer in the world behind India, Philippines and Indonesia. A collective 'Made in Sri Lanka' branding campaign catering to the demands in the European market is essential if our coconut is to capture a sizable European market, maintains Herath. 'Our production cost is still very high and allocation for research and development is also not sufficient,' says CCB Chair who also cites lack of information and analysis, red tape in bureaucracy and archaic laws and regulation which are not flexible to cater to modern trends as bottlenecks which prevent Sri Lankan coconut from securing its due place. 'Ours is such fertile soil and whatever that grows out of it is always the best in the world, but sadly we are not committed enough as a nation to make the best out of our crops and position them as niche products in the global market,' remarks Herath.</p><p>Research</p><p>A climatic-sensitive tree, coconut requires proper management to sustain its vigour.</p><p>Coconut Research Institute (CRI) is currently conducting research on breeding coconut with the characteristics of drought tolerance, resistance to pest attacks, good kernel quality including high milk yield and high oil yield. 'We have already released six improved cultivars which have different yield potentials and characteristics. To facilitate mass production of seeds/seedlings, we have established four seed gardens, increased the mother palm pool and started setting up another two new seed gardens in collaboration with the private sector. Measures are also underway to establish more seed gardens to meet the demand of the hybrid seeds,' explains CRI Deputy Director (Research) Dr. Sarath Idirisinghe. CRI currently produces about 1.5 million seed nuts annually and issues them to CCB for seedling production. CRI has planned to produce one million hybrid seed nuts by 2024.</p><p>The management of coconut lands as Dr. Idirisinghe points out, has been very poor, particularly those of the smallholders and CRI among their other initiatives to empower growers on GAP is now promoting the use of 50% inorganic + 50% organic manure towards sustainable soil fertility management. New research is also under way to introduce soil conditioning material including carbonised planting materials and compost materials to enrich the fertility level of soil.</p><p>Coconut is grown in 90 countries in the world and we are the fourth largest coconut producer in the world behind India, Philippines and Indonesia. A collective 'Made in Sri Lanka' branding campaign catering to the demands in the European market is essential if our coconut is to capture a sizeable European market</p><p>Pest management</p><p>CRI has also developed integrated pest and disease management (IPM) packages to manage the pests and diseases and these technologies are disseminated to the growers. 'Measures are underway to establish more predatory mite breeding laboratories in the country to produce more predators to release to the growers which is in very high demand for the control of coconut mites. We are also researching to identify new predators to control coconut mite or other control measures,' Dr. Idirisinghe says. New nano-gel based pheromones are also being developed by CRI for Red Weevil (RW) control which is a major threat to the coconut seedlings and young plants.</p><p>Recurrences of extreme climatic changes have severely affected the coconut cultivations in the country and the low rainfall received during the past several years has caused significant damages to the coconut palms. Therefore, studies are underway to identify the drought resistant varieties, pest and disease resistant varieties due to changing climatic conditions. </p><p>The present whitefly attack which was first reported from Kegalle District, has now been spread to several other districts in the island causing notable economic damage to the coconut cultivations. CRI's research, according to Dr. Idirisinghe, has identified the life cycle of the pest and severity of attacks. 'We have recommended chemical insecticides, bio-based insecticides and have started to identify and breed predators to control the pest. In addition, we are also in the process of spraying chemicals to infested palms in collaboration with the CCB in Dankotuwa, Wennappuwa and Nattandiya areas as a pilot project. Based on the outcome of the pilot project, we expect to give better recommendations to manage the white fly attack in the rest of the areas in the country.'</p><p>Less than 5% of growers could afford the current price of coconut fertiliser which is at Rs. 25,000-30,000 per 50 kg bag</p><p>Intercropping and livestock</p><p>The productivity of coconut under monoculture is generally low, however, the land productivity can be increased by intercropping and integration of livestock, says Dr. Idirisinghe. CRI has recommended coconut-based agroforestry systems using fruits such as rambutan, mango, papaya, pineapple and spices such as pepper, coffee, cinnamon and cocoa and livestock such as cattle, goat and sheep. 'These practices will help change the micro climatic condition of the coconut plantations which will improve the yield. Further, agroforestry systems using Gliricidia, Calliandra and wild sunflower have been proven as potential for degraded coconut soil improvement.' Mixed-cropping systems also reduce the risk and uncertainty of incomes. Integration with livestock requires establishment of pastures and fodder varieties. Thus, livestock rearing can simultaneously increase land productivity and farmer-income which is an ideal combination for sustainability of soil fertility and to reduce rural poverty, points out Dr. Idirisinghe.</p><p>Coconut is uniquely positioned in Sri Lanka as a commercial crop of which 70% is used for local consumption</p><p>Climate changes</p><p>Climate change has had a significant impact on the Sri Lankan coconut industry. High temperature affects the pollination resulting in a few nuts per bunch and button nut fall, aggravating the effect of water scarcity. 'Although the technology is in place for minimising the drought effects in coconut plantations and the farmers are trained to implement them, many do not seem to follow recommended practices,' says Dr. Idirisinghe. He further says that CRI has set breeding objectives to develop high yielding hybrid varieties tolerant of climate change. Experiments are also being done by CRI to identify the potential of using carbonised plant materials for soil moisture conservation and for increasing the nutrient use efficiency, changing the micro climate, and carbon sequestration.</p><p>The productivity of coconut under monoculture is generally low, however, the land productivity can be increased by intercropping and integration of livestock</p><p>Unaffordable fertiliser</p><p>Unless the present whitefly pest devastation is arrested soon and a treatment process is implemented as a national program covering small holders as well, 2023's coconut production could be seriously threatened, warns the Coconut Growers Association of Sri Lanka. Its President, Jayantha Samarakoon tells the Daily FT that the diseases could eliminate over 1 million coconut trees and the annual production could drop by 10-20% which is equivalent to 300-600 million coconuts per year. This will increase the price of coconut further.</p><p>'Fertiliser issue is also very serious as most coconut growers have not fertilised their coconut estates for more than two years. Less than 5% of growers could afford the current price of coconut fertiliser which is at Rs. 25,000-30,000 per 50 kg bag. If we do not fertilise coconut trees the yield will drop drastically in the coming year and we may face severe shortage of coconut and a price hike in the domestic market. Therefore, it is very important for the government to make available coconut fertiliser at a reasonable price (Rs. 10,000-15,000 per 50 kg bag) in 2023.' </p><p>Annual fertiliser requirement for the coconut sector is about 80,000 MT. This includes 20,000 MT of Urea, 40,000 MT of MOP and 20,000 MT of ERP which is available locally. 'Urea and MOP are to be imported and made available through fertiliser companies at the above reasonable price,' says Samarakoon.</p><p>Around 1.8 billion coconuts are required for domestic consumption per year while the coconut processing industry needs 1.2 billion coconut per year. Coconut processing industry, as Samarakoon points out, generated an export income of $ 834 million in 2021 and the estimated export income for 2022 would be about $ 900 million, he says. In 2021, coconut product export contributed 6.7% of total export and about 0.7% to GDP.</p><p>Added to the fertiliser and agrochemical shortage, the economic crisis, labour scarcity, high labour wages and unavailability of skilled labour have placed many large-scale coconut plantations in predicament</p><p>Market-oriented interventions</p><p>In a bid to strengthen the state mechanism to assist growers, CDA, CRI and CCB should introduce a market-oriented service delivery mechanism to meet the requirements of coconut growers of various levels, more effectively, maintaining Samarakoon. This could include digitalisation of services and product-delivery methods, on-line applications to disseminate specific knowledge and advice to individual coconut growers which could significantly reduce the cost of operation and production, he says. 'We have also requested successive governments to provide capital investment for coconut growers to modernise irrigation systems and smart and targeted application of fertiliser. In addition, we have requested subsidy schemes for soil fertility improvement and moisture conservation to be continued for small holders.'</p><p>In a bid to strengthen the state mechanism to assist growers, CDA, CRI and CCB should introduce a marketoriented service delivery mechanism to meet the requirements of coconut growers of various levels, more effectively</p><p>Climate-smart agriculture</p><p>Added to the fertiliser and agrochemical shortage, the economic crisis, labour scarcity, high labour wages and unavailability of skilled labour have placed many large-scale coconut plantations in predicament. The whitefly menace has become a double whammy. To counter the disease, Kurunegala Plantations Ltd. (KPL) is practicing yellow sticky traps on coconut trunks and spraying pesticides, neem oil, and soap mixtures to control them, says its CEO Dr. S.M.M. Samarakoon.</p><p>Coconut production of Sri Lanka is mainly rainfed and vulnerable to climate change manifested in unpredictable rainfall patterns and high temperatures. 'Sustaining the yield of coconut has been challenged with low soil fertility with the inadequate chemical fertiliser application. KPL has cultivated more than 15 intercrops across the different agro-ecological zones as means of crop-based climate-smart agriculture. Coconut is highly vulnerable to drought as well. However, inter-crops of KPL, such as cashew, rambutan, mango, durian, and guava have shown very good performance during low rainfall with dry climatic scenarios and have compensated for the yield loss of the coconut due to dry climatic conditions,' says Dr. Samarakoon who reiterates on the importance of combining coconut with intercrops, for the sustainability of income per unit of land.</p><p>In addition, drip irrigation and jet irrigation, building of ponds, husk pits, burying husks, cover cropping, etc. are practiced by KPL to conserve moisture throughout the year, he says.</p><p>Being an island with inherent qualities, Sri Lankan coconut is well-reputed in the global market. However, heavy domestic consumption of coconut is limiting the value addition and export earnings of the crop, says KPL's CEO.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT28122022000529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:676B-J611-JCH9-G4SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2364\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 28, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001405</classCode><className>PRODUCTIVITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NW</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

However, according to Peter Lehner, managing attorney for EarthJustice, a nonprofit environmental law firm, the EPA estimate is \"almost certainly significantly quite low.</p><p>\"Lehner argues that most analyses exclude five unique sources of emissions from the farming sector: soil carbon (carbon released during the disturbance of soil), lost sequestration (carbon that would still be sequestered in the ground had that land not been converted into farmland), input footprints (carbon footprint for products used in agriculture, like the manufacturing of fertilizer), difficult measurements (it is harder to measure the carbon emissions of biological systems like agriculture than it is to measure the emissions of other industries that are not biological, like transportation), and potent gases (like methane and nitrous oxide).Regarding that last source: Focusing on carbon dioxide as the main greenhouse gas often ignores powerful planet-warming gases that are emitted by agriculture and that are even more potent than carbon dioxide.</p><p> Methane, which is emitted by the burps and farts of ruminants like cows and sheep, has up to 86 times more global warming potential over a 20-year period than carbon dioxide (and also impacts public health, particularly in frontline communities). Nitrous oxide, a byproduct of fertilizer runoff, has 300 times more warming potential than carbon dioxide (and also harms plants and animals).</p><p>\"Most other studies, including by the [United Nations (UN)] and others, say that agriculture contributes much closer to 15 or 20 percent or more of world greenhouse gas emissions,\" Lehner points out.Miscalculating Agricultural EmissionsA systems engineering analysis of climate science and animal agriculture published in the Journal of Ecological Society in 2019 by Sailesh Rao, the founder and executive director of Climate Healers, an environmental nonprofit, backs up the claim that the majority of analyses of agricultural emissions are low.</p><p> Rao's paper found that \"animal agriculture is the leading cause of climate change, responsible for at least 87% of greenhouse gas emissions annually.\"According to Rao, there are \"four major miscalculations in the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports, which systematically undercount the climate change impact of animal agriculture.</p><p>\" These miscalculations relate to carbon dioxide, methane, land use, and the timeline of analysis (using data only from the Industrial Era onward, which discounts the long-term contribution of animal agriculture to historical emissions).Rao's abstract states:\"We show that we need to transition to a global plant-based economy first and that blindly eliminating fossil fuel usage first will accelerate the warming of the planet.</p><p> We show that the annual methane emissions from animal agriculture alone cause more incremental global warming than the annual CO2 emissions from all fossil fuel sources combined. We further show that the transition to a global plant-based economy has the potential to sequester over 2000 Gigatons (Gt) of CO2 in regenerating soils and vegetation, returning atmospheric greenhouse gas levels to the \"safe zone\" of under 350 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 equivalent, while restoring the biodiversity of the planet and healing its climate.</p><p> This paper clearly illustrates why the scientific community, government institutions, corporations, and news media, who vastly underestimate the role of animal agriculture and focus primarily on reducing fossil fuel use, need to urgently change their priorities in order to be effective.\"Tackling Food Systems at Global Climate SummitsAgriculture was not a central topic of discussion at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021. \"Despite [the] huge impact to ecological systems and climate,\" writes Suzannah Gerber, a nutrition scientist and fellow of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture--a research agency within the U.</p><p>S. Department of Agriculture--\"specific high-level talks about agriculture comprised less than 5 percent of all official negotiations and less than 10 percent of side events, favoring the less controversial topic of renewable energy.</p><p>\"And while renewable energy supporters cheered the fact that the Glasgow Climate Pact is the first UN climate agreement to explicitly mention \"coal\" and \"fossil fuels\"--something that the fossil fuel industry fought hard against in previous summits, and that China and India managed to water down in the current agreement--the pact makes no mention of the words \"agriculture\" or \"food.\"Deforestation and methane emissions were main topics at COP26 (resulting in pledges to reduce both), but agriculture--which is intimately linked to deforestation and land-use change--was relegated to a sideline topic.</p><p> \"Unlike forest, finance, and transport--that got the feted 'title of a day' at  [COP26]--agriculture was taken up as part of 'Nature Day' on a Saturday,\" reported Richard Mahapatra for Down to Earth. \"Outside the venue, thousands protested against a gamut of things, including step-motherly treatment to food systems that have been a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"Governments did a better job addressing the agriculture and climate connection the following year at COP27, held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in November 2022. At the conference, governments actively engaged in intensifying efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance adaptive measures in the agriculture sector to combat the challenges of climate change.During the discussions, an important milestone was reached with the establishment of a comprehensive four-year plan focusing on agriculture and food security, which included the mobilization increased financial resources to drive the transformative changes needed in the agricultural sector by 2030. A pioneering initiative called Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST) was also launched under the leadership of over 20 agriculture ministers and the Egyptian COP27 presidency.</p><p>\"Practical lessons that can be scaled exist: from sustainable intensification of food systems to regenerative agriculture, to agroecology and related agroforestry,\" said Dr. Agnes Kalibata, president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa.</p><p> \"Such solutions offer us an opportunity to build food, social-economic and ecological resilience to the negative effects of climate change. These practices work towards empowering communities against hunger and poverty, and ensure inclusion of marginalized communities and people.</p><p>\"Meat Is Murder--for Animals and the EnvironmentForests continue to be clear-cut to make room for farms, such as factory farms--which supply humans' appetite for meat--and plantations that produce the world's most used vegetable oil: palm oil. Within agriculture, producing meat is the main climate problem: Plant-based foods account for 29 percent of the global food production greenhouse gas emissions, while animal-based food accounts for almost twice as much--57 percent--with beef being the main contributor.</p><p> \"Every bite of burger boosts harmful greenhouse gases,\" said the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). \"Research shows that if cows were a nation, they would be the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter,\" according to UNEP.</p><p> \"As humans, meat production is one of the most destructive ways in which we leave our footprint on the planet.\"UNEP states, \"Between 1970 and 2011, livestock increased from 7.</p><p>3 billion to 24.2 billion units, worldwide.\" With such a staggering number of animals trapped in our food system, it should be no surprise that industrial farming is, as the animal rights nonprofit Animal Equality states, \"the largest cause of animal abuse in history.</p><p>\" The group points out, \"At no other time in history have so many animals died or suffered so much throughout their lives.\"A More Sustainable Future Is Plant-PoweredAnimal-based agriculture is ultimately a poor way to feed a skyrocketing human population.</p><p> \"Farming animals is notoriously inefficient and wasteful when compared to growing plants to feed humans directly, with the end result that 'livestock' animals take drastically more food from the global food supply than they provide,\" writes Ashley Capps, a researcher specializing in farmed animal welfare for A Well-Fed World, an international food security organization advocating for the transition to plant-based agriculture.\"This is because in order to eat farmed animals, we have to grow the crops necessary to feed them, which amounts to vastly more crops than it would take to feed humans directly,\" writes Capps.</p><p> \"To give one example, it takes 25 pounds of grain to yield just one pound of beef--while crops such as soy and lentils produce, pound for pound, as much protein as beef, and sometimes more.\"Beef is so resource-intensive to produce, that it requires 20 times more land and emits 20 times more greenhouse gases per gram of edible protein than beans, lentils, and peas--all commonly farmed plant proteins, according to the World Resources Institute.</p><p>Switching to plant-based agriculture would help prevent food shortages, hunger, and even famine at a time when climate change is creating food insecurity across the globe. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, had warned during the Saudi Green Initiative Forum in October 2021, that failure to stem the climate crisis \"would mean less food, so probably a crisis in food security.</p><p>\"A Well-Fed World points out that \"[c]limate change is a hunger risk multiplier, with 20 percent more people projected to be at risk of hunger by 2050 due to extreme weather events. Unfortunately, the world's most food insecure populations are also those disproportionately harmed by climate-related events, including increased heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, and flooding.</p><p>\"Climate, Conflict, and COVID-19: A Perfect Storm\"A perfect storm of conflict, climate crises, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and rising costs for reaching people in need is causing a seismic hunger crisis,\" warns the World Food Program, the food assistance branch of the UN. The agency launched a public appeal to the world's billionaires to donate $6.6 billion to save 42 million people across 43 countries from famine.</p><p>\"Concurrently replacing all animal-based items in the U.S.</p><p> diet with plant-based alternatives will add enough food to feed, in full, 350 million additional people, well above the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food waste,\" according to a 2018 study by an international team of researchers published in the journal Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The authors note that the results of their study \"highlight the importance of dietary shifts to improving food availability and security.</p><p>\"The dietary shift from meat to plants is something that UNEP has underscored as a way to combat climate change and increase the efficiency of our food system. In their Emissions Gap Report 2021, the agency noted that--in addition to switching from the combustion of natural gas to renewables--\"behavioral changes such as reduced consumption of cattle-based foods and reduced food waste and loss\" present a significant opportunity to reduce methane emissions.</p><p> \"[F]ast methane action, as opposed to slower or delayed action, can contribute greatly to reducing midterm (2050) temperatures,\" the report states.In many ways, this behavioral change is already underway, as veganism is on the rise.</p><p> \"It can be difficult to get an accurate picture of how many vegans there are in the U.S.</p><p>, but one survey found a 300 percent increase in vegans between 2004 and 2019, amounting to about 3 percent of the total population or nearly 10 million people,\" notes Sentient Media, a nonprofit animal rights journalism organization. Still, even though there has been a steady increase in plant-based diets, meat consumption is hitting record levels, aided by carnivores in low- and middle-income countries where incomes are on the rise, like India and China.</p><p>Looking AheadBy 2050, the human population is expected to reach a staggering 9.9 billion people.</p><p> (The Earth supports more than 8 billion people as of 2023; just 50 years ago, the global population was less than half that number.) To ensure global food security in 2050, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said that food production must increase by 60 percent.</p><p>In a 2022 Economist blog post, Alice Ruhweza, the Africa regional director of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), an environmental nonprofit, urged nations to make food systems a priority. \"From brands to retailers, manufacturers to farmers, it will take every organization and person involved in the food system to deliver on progress for climate and nature--ensuring our children have access to high-quality fresh food in the future which doesn't cost the planet,\" she writes.</p><p> \"Actions that food system organizations can take now include ensuring renewable energy is used on-site, investing in circular initiatives that simultaneously tackle food waste and address soil health, removing deforestation from their supply chain, and communicating to consumers in a way that makes plant-rich diets irresistible. All of this must be underpinned by a just transition for farmers--who are often the first to feel the impacts of climate change--and a firm commitment to food security.</p><p>\"If society can effectively address the runaway emissions of our broken, unsustainable, and inhumane industrialized food system--including moving humanity to plant-based diets--perhaps the existential climate crisis can truly be overcome.

Do tell us a bit about how this legacy started and how it has become so successful.</p><p>A: It all began with a single person, a young man with a very big dream. It was the 1950s and my father, at the age of 20, had observed the passion and the commitment with which tea was harvested. Each cup of tea contained 30 hand-picked leaves. That means somebody spent time and effort hand picking the finest leaves for your cup of tea. There is nothing more artisanal or more luxurious than that. My father saw this and he wanted to get into the tea industry. He then visited Mincing Lane in London, which ironically was the centre of the global tea trade, though they don]t produce much tea, yet, was the centre of a global tea trade, part of the unfortunate colonial economic legacy the British Empire had. And there, contrary to his expectation of a celebration of what is great about tea he found something quite different, because the trade was focused on profit and therefore value reduction. As a tea grower, my father saw at the time as we see today the incredible artisanal commitment, the effort that goes into making tea, the effort of the tea growers combined with the influence of nature. When you translate that into a commodity to be traded, it turns out to be something completely against the social and economic interests of the country. My father saw this in the 1950s when he conceived an idea. It was a very different time. There was no printing in the country. There were power issues and many complications while the trade was dominated by the British. So he had to work his way through and eventually in 1985 he was able to make his first breakthrough getting his Dilmah tea grown, harvested, ethically produced, packed and branded in Sri Lanka, with the profits coming to the country. In September 1985 he got it on shelf in Australia. That's a potted history of how it all happened.</p><p>Q: In how many countries is Dilmah being sold now?</p><p>A: Then onwards we soared and we are now in over 100 countries. However, our objective is not to say that we are the biggest. We want to maintain our quality, as there is nothing great about saying you are the biggest in volume, what matters for Ceylon tea is value.</p><p>Q: Sri Lanka does not really do much of value-added product exports. When it comes to the tea industry, the majority is bulk exports. Dilmah is an exception. What is the reason for Sri Lanka not being geared for value-added exports?</p><p>A: It]s a tragedy. Sri Lanka has the finest tea, the finest cinnamon; we have exceptional cardamom and the finest pepper. We have an abundance of quality products that extend from our people. If you talk to international chefs they would tell you Sri Lankan pastry chefs anywhere in the world are the finest. We fail to take advantage, with the finest chocolate work, ice carvings and the precision of their work. This is the difference that my father saw. Because every skill, whether it is the quality in a cup of tea, every uniqueness, every point of difference, needs to be emphasised and focused on in building value. In Sri Lanka value addition in tea may be in the region of 30 %. But real value addition is when you take a product and you add value through the use of technology, use of art, craft, communication and presenting new experiences to engage the consumer. Value addition isn]t just saying look I]ve sold something at a high price. It]s about delivering an experience where a consumer says this is worth the price we are asked to pay. Although we have all these attributes, it]s probably in the mindset and the marketing failures that we are yet selling our cinnamon as a competitor to the inferior and carcinogenic cassia. We are selling our finest Ceylon tea with all its artisanal attributes as a cheaper alternative to multi-origin blended tea which has no identity, personality, guarantee of craft nor guarantee of soil conservation. So whether it is cinnamon or our incredible cashew, we need to understand that we have an amazing asset and that asset merits charging a fair price. My father]s philosophy of understanding the concept of value and charging a fair price for the value we offer, not cheating the customer but offering an experience for which he or she is willing to pay the price extends to tourism.</p><p>My brother oversees and manages our Resplendent Ceylon. Our room rate is significantly higher than any other in Sri Lanka, because we offer a unique experience and that]s a Sri Lankan experience. Our Ceylon Tea in most countries has its own place, for example, in Poland you would see us sitting on the top shelf in terms of price, because we offer a quality product.</p><p>Tasting 10,000 teas each week and selecting the finest is about honesty. Honesty builds trust. Trust builds value. I think the important thing here is as Sri Lankans we need to first understand the value of what we have. We need to frame our proposition on how we propose to engage with the consumer. Today the consumer is very responsive to a message that talks of wellness, provenance, biodiversity, quality and taste. Tea has everything, so does cinnamon, cashew and Sri Lanka tourism. When you read some of the reviews online they are exceptional but we need to charge a fair price. Because when you discount something as a commodity, you end up devaluing it. The Seychelles is $ 600 to $ 700 a night while in Sri Lanka it's $200 a night, trying to demonstrate that probably the cost corresponds to the quality. Sri Lanka is worth a thousand plus dollars per night because of the experiences we could offer. Wellness experiences, Ayurveda, fine tea, fine gastronomy are a few that Sri Lanka offers. I believe it is as much the mindset, as well as a relic of colonialism that seems to have colonised our minds. We need to have the confidence to say we have a great product, we are going to market it as a premium, and charge the right price. It is only the right price that]s going to allow us to pay our workers a fair salary and to build innovation into our industry.</p><p>Q: Dilmah is an export-oriented business and the current high currency fluctuation can be a serious challenge. How is this impacting the industry and Dilmah?</p><p>A: We emerged from an unprecedented crisis. In 2020 following the Easter bombing we confronted unimaginable challenges. We had to build parallel transport networks, build fuel dumps. We had to maintain health and safety in a way that we never had to in the past. But we never stopped for a minute. Currency fluctuation is part of the recovery of our nation. Ultimately it]s also in the mindset. We have to be positive. Every problem has a solution. We are a Sri Lankan company, with a Sri Lankan product and believe we can do it. So we will overcome the challenge. To meet any challenge valuing our product is important. When the currency fluctuates or when we have inflationary pressures we can go to the market and tell our partners these are the justifications for a price increase. When you don]t have a brand you become a victim of all of those trends. When you sell bulk tea for example, it is you against the low cost producers around the world. So it comes back to the same thing. Value what we have. Today we have a currency crisis but it]s part of our restoration. Tomorrow we may have a climate crisis. We may have another health crisis or perhaps other issues. It is building value, understanding what you have and crafting it through value addition is what is going to help us to build resilience.</p><p>Q: Turkey and Russia are two main buyers of Ceylon tea. In the recent past we have seen that both these countries are experiencing economic challenges. How are these dynamics affecting the demand for Ceylon tea and how do you manage that?</p><p>A: Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Russia are the traditional markets for Sri Lankan tea and I think our future and our resilience is to broad-base Ceylon tea. We have been reliant on the same markets virtually since the 1960s. There is no reason why we should not venture beyond. When we talk to industry insiders you hear the phrase 'oh we lost that market'. Yes we lost it to Kenya but we lost it on price. Ceylon tea is not a price driven product. It's a quality and sustainability driven product. So perhaps today it]s Turkey and Russia suffering from an economic crisis and tomorrow it could be Europe. But we need to broaden our markets. We cannot stay reliant on the same five or six markets. When Iraq, our number one market, has some sort of import issue, embargo or sanctions, Sri Lanka suffers. Hence, it]s an unsustainable and narrow-minded approach to keep going</p><p>Q: Kenya and India emerged as strong suppliers of tea. However, both countries are facing labour issues at present. Does that mean it creates more opportunities for Ceylon tea and is there any way that we can capture that opportunity?</p><p>A: I think it creates more opportunities but probably not in the way you think. When there is a supply disruption it is inevitably temporary. But where it creates an opportunity is, if we go to consumers and say look during the pandemic most countries either mechanised or retrenched twenty, thirty thousand workers causing them misery or they abandoned minimum wage mechanisms and reduced the wage. But in Sri Lanka we actually increased our wages and increased social commitment. If you walk on the streets of Berlin or London, you need not walk more than 100 feet to see somebody in misery, without health care, or in deep trouble. All those who come here take photographs of somebody and publish in the newspapers and say we are mistreating our workers; they need to look at themselves to understand who is at fault. The world is telling us we want a cheaper product. When we go and offer a product at a fair price we get kicked out. We are asked to compete with one country or another. Our product is valuable because we want to take care of our workers, we provide free education, and free medical care. Kenya and India face short-term labour issues but we should not seek to exploit that because that would be at most a short-term benefit. We need to understand the bigger picture. Where does Sri Lanka fit in this competitive environment? We should not seek to compete with them because it would end up in price competition. We should compete on quality. What is important is not to sell 300 million kilos, but to sell 150 million kilos of Ceylon tea profitably. When I say profitably it must be profitable for the environment. We have to invest in soil regeneration, in agroforestry, make sure it is profitable for the community, and integrate the livelihoods of people into our business model. We should tell the world that we produce the finest tea on earth, that we look after our workers, our environment and that we want a fair price. If you do this you will find a reasonable gap between the cost of production, net sale average and Export FOB. We can use that gap to benefit social environmental issues. This year Dilmah will generate almost over Rs. 900 million over our 13 centres around Sri Lanka, supporting children with Down Syndrome, schools and hospitals on the plantations, environmental education, climate change centres etc. We are not compelled to do this, but we feel obliged because we are a Sri Lankan company benefiting from a Sri Lankan product and we have to share. This is my father]s philosophy. This is a business built on family values. We can do it because we have a brand. We tell our customers, we will give you the finest tea but you have to pay a fair price for it.</p><p>Q: The fertiliser ban imposed in 2021 created serious issues for the plantation sector. Now the regulations have changed. What is the current situation?</p><p>A: That ban was ranked as a stupidity. It was purely political. It]s unfortunate because it caused a catastrophe that is still rippling through our country years later. Now we have recovered to an extent. The availability of fertiliser and the fertiliser that has been applied since is resulting in more normal crops coming through. If you look at it and try to find a little bit of light at the end of that self-imposed tunnel, I suppose people are thinking a little bit about sustainable means of regenerative agriculture. This is important. We should not be reliant on fertiliser because the stupidity of the fertiliser ban was the ban in itself. As members of the tea industry who were part of that initial task force until we were kicked out, we recommended that there should be a progressive plan by setting a target of five or ten % gradually. That would have been a wise and insightful action. Several countries are working on this model. But the time frame is 30-40 years, not overnight. So yes we are recovering but the ramifications are still being felt</p><p>Q: Do you see any change in customer preference over tea especially with the new generation? Is the new generation shifting to substitutes like coffee or juice?</p><p>A: Consumers today are used to a multitude of options. The customer doesn't come with a predetermined notion of saying I]m going to drink tea or drink coffee. They look at what]s on offer. It's up to us to make tea look good. Does tea look good? Infinite variety in taste and the taste is determined in tea, not by the manufacturer. It]s determined by nature. You have Nuwara Eliya tea. Can you produce Nuwara Eliya tea in Ratnapura? No, because there are inherent geographical and climatic characteristics that define light bright tea. We must communicate this positively and say look here]s what we have in Sri Lanka. There]s a multitude of options. You have tea for your morning, for your afternoon, to have with your salad, to have with your biriyani, etc. So make the product relevant, and look good to the consumer. Create occasions. The new consumer isn]t moving away from tea. Today tea is more relevant than any other beverage. There is no herb like tea. It]s varied in taste, with natural plant antioxidant goodness, and a variety of taste. If we build a strong ethical and environmental sustainability proposition in tea we have a compelling offer. You have what a consumer would say, look when I drink this tea. Not only am I doing something good for my body, engaging my taste buds and appealing to my taste buds but also I]m helping the plantation workers in Sri Lanka. Because when they produce this and when I pay a fair price for this they get a fair wage. We just need to be able to communicate that and make tea look good.</p><p>Q: What is the future of the Sri Lankan tea industry?</p><p>A: I think the future has never been as bright as now. The reason for that is gen Z, the younger generation, millennial are conditioned by the pandemic for health and wellness. They]re looking for products that offer health and wellness. Any scientist or if you go online you would find over 45,000 research papers that confirm the natural antioxidant goodness in tea. So it is scientifically proven. Tea has a therapeutic impact on every single lifestyle disease such as diabetes. Tea enhances cognitive ability but also enhances mood. Tea reduces the impact of stress on the human body. Tea reduces the possibility of stroke. The list is endless. The future for Ceylon Tea has never been brighter than today in my opinion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2908202300026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6925-4DD1-JCH9-G0VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 29, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp; OTHER INVESTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D8SV</classCode><className>BEVERAGE SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001690</classCode><className>TEA MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000951</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001689</classCode><className>TEA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097GR</classCode><className>COFFEE &amp; TEA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp; OTHER INVESTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D8SV</classCode><className>BEVERAGE SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N111998QC</classCode><className>TEA FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001690</classCode><className>TEA MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N523110EC</classCode><className>INVESTMENT BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC381</classCode><className>SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

By 2028, according to forecasts, the global eucalyptus oil market is projected to exceed $213 million, while the worldwide market for eucalyptus pulp will expand to nearly $17 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the eucalyptus industry has a dark side. Eucalyptus plantations growing in regions spanning South America, southern Africa, southern Europe, and Australia have significant detrimental impacts on local communities and biodiversity.</p><p> Communities located near eucalyptus plantations are likely to face water shortages--as these plantations utilize huge amounts of water--and pollution from agrochemicals, including exposure to glyphosate, which has been linked to various health problems, including increased cancer risk.In addition, the presence of eucalyptus trees' leaves and roots hinders the growth of other plants beneath them because they contain a biocidal oil that inhibits the survival and decomposition of most soil bacteria that come into contact with them.</p><p>Brazil is the world's largest eucalyptus producer. With an estimated 7.</p><p>6 million hectares of eucalyptus plantations, Brazil maintains 30 percent of the world's total eucalyptus trees. In eastern Brazil, particularly in the states of Bahia and Espirito Santo, these plantations have replaced the diverse and endemic Atlantic Forest ecosystem, with some municipalities seeing nearly three-quarters of their land area being covered by eucalyptus plantations.</p><p> Large corporations such as Suzano, Fibria, and Veracel dominate this industry, exporting eucalyptus as pulp for manufacturing products like toilet paper.New Forest Threat: Genetically Engineered EucalyptusGenetically engineered (GE) varieties of eucalyptus trees are poised to exacerbate a new wave of ecological and social destruction.</p><p>Brazil has approved seven varieties of genetically engineered trees. Current plantations rob regions of water, destroy wildlife habitat, and transform large swaths of land within the Cerrado--an expansive, biodiverse tropical biome situated in eastern Brazil--into unnatural, destructive monoculture farms: rows upon rows of non-native eucalyptus trees without vegetation in their understory.</p><p> Many traditional communities and Indigenous people have opposed the spread of these plantations in the country.Varieties of GE eucalyptus are pesticide-resistant and are likely to increase the use of toxic chemicals such as Roundup, the glyphosate-based weedkiller developed by Monsanto in the 1970s, which is the world's most used herbicide--and was acquired by Bayer in 2018. Other engineered traits, such as increased growth rates, could make the trees more profitable for the pulp and paper industry but significantly more harmful to the environment.</p><p>International Opposition to GE EucalyptusThe Campaign to STOP GE Trees is an international alliance of organizations working to halt the introduction of genetically engineered trees into the natural environment to prevent ecological destruction and harm to local communities. It is an initiative of our U.</p><p>S.-based organization, Global Justice Ecology Project (GJEP), with support from the Uruguay-based World Rainforest Movement, which advances the cause of social justice in the forests.</p><p>n international delegation of the campaign, which was organized by GJEP, traveled to Brazil in July 2023 to meet with Indigenous and quilombola communities (descendants of escaped Afro-Brazilian enslaved people), members of the Landless Workers' Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, or MST, in Portuguese), government ministries, and academics. The delegation's goal was to learn about the history of resistance against the pulp and paper industry in the country and discuss how herbicide-resistant genetically engineered varieties of eucalyptus trees could increase the use of toxic herbicides and amplify ecological degradation, health impacts, and social injustice.</p><p>FASE (FederaaaPound o de orgaPound os para Assistencia Social e Educacional), a group that has been supporting communities opposing eucalyptus plantations for a decade, organized the logistics of the delegation, which included representatives from Argentina, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. Local representatives joined the delegation as it visited several Brazilian ministries to register official demands and testimonies from quilombola and MST community members from northern Espirito Santo and southern Bahia about the devastating impacts of eucalyptus plantations as well as new threats posed by GE eucalyptus trees.</p><p>\"The demands that we recorded were from several MST communities that we met with that are doing important agroecological work and have a whole agroecological school training people in the region about how to grow organically,\" said Anne Petermann, international coordinator of the Campaign to STOP GE Trees. She noted that \"there were also statements from members of traditional quilombola communities in that region who are suffering, very directly, the impacts of eucalyptus plantations.</p><p>\"The delegation also officially presented petitions from Rainforest Rescue, an environmental nonprofit based in Hamburg, Germany, signed by more than 100,000 people opposing the release of GE eucalyptus in Brazil to the ministries and Brazilian National Technical Commission on Biosafety.During the delegation's official meeting, Moises Savian, secretary of Brazil's Ministry of Agrarian Development, identified corporate interests driving the push for GE eucalyptus.</p><p>\"It makes no sense in my vision to have a transgenic [eucalyptus] associated with glyphosate,\" stated Savian. His comments highlighted the increasingly ubiquitous and dangerous as well as probable cancer-causing herbicide Roundup.</p><p> \"It is much more linked to market interests of the corporations that want to sell herbicide,\" the secretary noted.The Kafkaesque Incentive of Carbon CreditsAnother motivation behind the push for GE eucalyptus is the Kafkaesque incentive of receiving carbon credits for planting trees.</p><p> Corporations like Suzano--which has been called the \"world's largest pulp exporter\"--can be rewarded for planting enormous industrial tree monocultures--since they are technically planting trees, they are eligible for carbon credits--even though they first clear-cut and remove the carbon-dense native forests, which release vast amounts of carbon from the forest and the soil.The pulp industry in Brazil has accelerated the growth rate of their eucalyptus trees.</p><p> This is increasing the already enormous demands on water resources. So problematic is the expansion of eucalyptus monocultures on the hydrology and biodiversity of regions that they are often called \"green deserts.</p><p>\"\"They look green from a distance but are extremely fast-growing trees planted in perfect rows and columns optimal for mechanical harvesting. The huge plantations do not harbor wildlife, and the only biodiversity you find in them is ants and termites,\" explained Petermann, who led the delegation that traveled to Brazil.</p><p>One of the most insidious trends in false solutions to climate change is the idea that living or biological carbon can offset fossil fuel carbon. An expanding landscape of monoculture industrial tree plantations in Brazil--which rob the forests of biodiversity, displace communities and wildlife, and deplete regions of water resources--epitomizes the eco-swindle of carbon credits.</p><p>JoaPound o, a member of a quilombola community, told the delegation that when eucalyptus started being planted in Espirito Santo and Bahia, \"they removed the native plant cover and all the nutrients from the soil. People [here] used to do agroforestry, would use cover crops, [and would] let the land rest--but now, with eucalyptus, there is no rest for the soil.</p><p>\" The total eucalyptus plantation area in Bahia is estimated to be about 658,000 hectares, positioning it as the country's third-largest contributor to industrially cultivated eucalyptus.Dr.</p><p> Ricarda Steinbrecher, a biologist from the University of London who attended a forum hosted by the delegation, warned of unintended consequences of genetically engineered trees, stating that \"the risks of GE trees is extremely high in terms of the impact on biodiversity, the people living around it, and the global ecosystem and climate.\"Not only are current eucalyptus plantations destructive, but the premise that they are superior to natural forests for capturing carbon is also unsound.</p><p> In 2020, experts published a letter with the Institute of Physics stating that \"forests are superior to, and irreplaceable by, plantations as agents of terrestrial C [carbon] sequestration.\" They are harvested with incredibly short growing cycles for pulp and paper production, which releases the carbon back into the atmosphere.</p><p> But the scheme is profitable for Suzano and other pulp companies since they profit from the production of pulp and paper as well as carbon credits for planting trees.Belem DeclarationBrazil is home to numerous biomes, the most famous of which is the Amazon forest.</p><p> Known as \"the lungs of the Earth\" for the massive amounts of carbon dioxide the forest inhales and the oxygen it exhales, the Amazon is the focus of many conservation initiatives and agreements.In early August 2023, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hosted the Amazon Summit in Belem, the capital of the Brazilian state of Para, during which another conservation agreement was launched.</p><p> The eight nations party to the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (ACT) released the Belem Declaration, a document aimed to unify the shared objectives of the signatory nations, which are focused on preserving the Amazon and the rights of Indigenous people who live in it. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30 ) is slated to meet in Belem in 2025.In a press release, however, the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) stated that the Belem Declaration fell short of commitments to end deforestation in the Amazon and failed to address the issues related to the continued use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Nikki Reisch, director of CIEL's Climate and Energy Program, stated:\"The Belem Declaration does not commit to ending deforestation by 2030, or to addressing the primary, intersecting drivers of rainforest loss--industrial agriculture and the extractive and destructive industries that expose primary forests to land conversion.\"\"Glaringly absent from the declaration is any mention of the threat that continued production and use of oil and gas poses to the Amazon and the ecosystems, communities, and climate that depend on it.</p><p> Instead, exploration and development of new oil and gas projects continue--even at the mouth of the Amazon itself--directly undercutting leaders' pledges to prevent the region from reaching the point of no return. Allowing expansion of fossil fuel extraction in the Amazon is incompatible with human rights, including Indigenous Peoples' rights, biodiversity protection, and climate goals.</p><p>\"Similar deference to industry interests plagues the Cerrado, where eucalyptus plantations and agribusiness continue to run roughshod over Indigenous and traditional communities and destroy a lesser-known but equally precarious natural ecological system regardless of ostensible ecological concerns and overtures.The Demand for Paper PulpAs the global demand for paper pulp continues to climb, Brazil is expected to be the site of the most significant expansion of these production facilities in South America.</p><p>Two regions that the Campaign to STOP GE Trees' delegation visited are likely to face the negative impacts of the tremendous growth of eucalyptus plantations to feed the pulp and paper industry.Quilombola communities the delegation met with stated that in Espirito Santo, most of the municipal land has been turned into plantations by Suzano.</p><p> They also explained that tax incentives and infrastructure investment in the Tres Lagoas region by local and federal governments seek to attract investments by the pulp and paper industry to the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where much of the native Cerrado forest has been converted to eucalyptus plantation in the past decade.It is so lucrative that Suzano is building the world's largest pulp and paper mill in Mato Grosso do Sul.</p><p> The enormous facility is being built by 10,000 workers, most of whom are stacked in nearby man camps. The mill is expected to employ 10,000 people when completed.</p><p> The Cerrado Project, as Suzano has deemed it, is in a rural town that has a population of nearly 25,000. The project threatens grave environmental damage to natural habitat and biodiversity, water and air, and a devastatingly precipitous population influx.Additionally, the Chilean corporation Arauco is planning an even larger mill in Mato Grosso do Sul after the scheduled completion of Suzano's behemoth.</p><p>Robbing Land From Indigenous CommunitiesLand sovereignty of traditional communities has been a politically charged issue in Brazil, and the encroachment on lands belonging to traditional and Indigenous communities by agribusiness was a theme that the delegation heard repeated during its travels through Brazil, including in the affected areas of Espirito Santo, southern Bahia, and Mato Grosso do Sul. Born out of Brazil's colonial past and decades of military dictatorship, land distributions in the country are highly inequitable.</p><p> Agribusiness interests have been incredibly aggressive in the past and continue with this trend currently.\"What made us lose our land, our culture, was all those persecutions by agribusiness,\" stated Jose De Souza, an instructor at the Indigenous Ofaie school in Mato Grosso do Sul.</p><p> The Ofaie was \"once a large people,\" he said, noting that such agribusiness pressures almost made \"them extinct.\" Once having a population of tens of thousands, the Ofaie now live on a mere 45 hectares after being forcibly relocated twice.</p><p> \"It's not an ended thing,\" said Souza. \"They destroyed our forests and water.</p><p>\" The school where Souza teaches emphasizes Ofaie culture and language in classes often taught outside in the open. The Ofaie land is small but is an oasis of native forest hemmed in by vast stretches of industrial monoculture plantations.</p><p>The Struggle for Land: The MSTEucalyptus is as central to the Ofaie land struggle as it is to the MST, one of the most significant movements in South America. The group has nearly 2 million members, with hundreds of thousands of Brazil's poor living in MST camps as farmers.</p><p> The MST seeks to reverse Brazil's profound inequality of land distribution by occupying land for communal farms.The movement is a lightning rod of controversy in Brasilia, with lawmakers aligned with former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro trying to outlaw the movement.</p><p> Still, judges have often accepted the MST's interpretation of Brazilian law that allows unproductive land to be taken. The MST has occasionally included eucalyptus plantations as meeting the definition of \"unproductive\" and has occupied and repurposed them for communal farms.</p><p>The movement has been so successful in its occupation strategy that it is estimated that 460,000 families now live in encampments started by the campaign. The MST is forward-leaning with an eye to the future with agroecology schools that teach how to grow crops and food using agroecological methods.</p><p> They are now the largest exporters of organic rice in Latin America.Biden Administration Funding Eucalyptus ExpansionAs the MST, Indigenous people, and traditional communities in Brazil struggle against the spread of industrial eucalyptus plantations, the Biden administration is reportedly funding its expansion.</p><p>ccording to a June 2023 article on Mongabay, \"Biden promised funds from the U.S.</p><p> International Development Finance Corporation to conserve the Amazon and other critical Latin American biomes.\" Yet according to findings published by Mongabay, the debt investment, if approved by Congress, will primarily \"be funneled into mass-produced eucalyptus in Brazil's Cerrado savanna.</p><p>\"Mongabay reported that $50 million of the funding would go to Timberland Investment Group's (TIG) plan to expand its \"planted forest operations,\" which located its newest office near Suzano's Cerrado Project in Mato Grosso do Sul.PL 490: Curtailing Indigenous Land RightsDuring the delegation's visit to Brazil's capital, Brasilia, to meet with ministers and lawmakers, Indigenous peoples held a large demonstration to oppose a proposal, PL 490, a law its supporters claim would bring certainty and fairness to land disputes in Brazil.</p><p> Opponents, however, argue that the proposal would actually reverse hard-fought gains by Indigenous communities to have their land rights officially recognized.Proposed by Bolsonaro-aligned lawmakers, PL 490 would reset Indigenous land claims to October 1988--when the current Brazilian Constitution was adopted after the military dictatorship.</p><p> Since the lands were taken during the dictatorship, this is a land-grabbing ruse by extractive industries seeking to deny claims of land rights by Indigenous groups and even to erase gains they had made in the past. The Lower House of Congress gave its approval to this bill in May 2023.The push for PL 490 underscores how land sovereignty is a fundamental issue in Brazilian politics and is inextricably linked to the country's environment and the rights of traditional communities.</p><p> Monoculture eucalyptus plantations play a central role in the contest over land rights, an issue central to Brazilian politics and ultimately connected to the rights of traditional communities and the world's environmental health. With the specter of eucalyptus trees engineered for pesticide resistance and the Biden administration's embrace of false solutions to climate change, the balance is being further tipped in favor of the pulp and paper industry in that fight.</p><p>\"As Brazil goes, so does the world when it comes to the use of GE-engineered eucalyptus,\" said Petermann. \"The significance of the loss of the Cerrado to GE eucalyptus plantations cannot be overstated.</p><p>\"Credit Line: This article was produced by Earth | Food | Life, a project of the Independent Media Institute.Steve Taylor is the press secretary for Global Justice Ecology Project and the host of the podcast Breaking Green.</p><p> Beginning his environmental work in the 1990s opposing clearcutting in Shawnee National Forest, Taylor was awarded the Leo and Kay Drey Award for Leadership from the Missouri Coalition for the Environment for his work as co-founder of the Times Beach Action Group.Orin Langelle is the director of Langelle Photography.</p><p> His first assignment was photographing Vietnam War protests during the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.

Sea level rise, erosion, and storms affect the coastal zone while agricultural areas are threatened by erratic rainfall, droughts, floods, and soil degradation. Across the country and across key economic sectors, climate change already impacts livelihoods, lives, and human wellbeing, and is projected to become more severe in the coming decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka is also blessed with a rich biodiversity and a multitude of productive ecosystems. From cloud forests to grasslands, and from lowland rainforests, lakes, and coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, the island is home to a significant range of habitats and associated species of animals and plants, many of which are endemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Particularly in light of the new Global Biodiversity Framework and the intergovernmental climate negotiations, how can Sri Lanka's natural wealth help the country to address challenges such as climate change while also facilitating economic recovery and sustainable development?</p><p>The benefits of biodiversity</p><p>There are at least three ways in which biodiversity and ecosystems can be part of the solution and help to increase the resilience of human communities and systems.</p><p>First off, ecosystems provide a range of benefits, some of which can be directly expressed in monetary terms. These ecosystem services include provision of goods and ingredients for consumption, medicine, cosmetics, construction, and other purposes, prevention of erosion, regulation of air and water quality, protection against floods, storage of water, tourism and recreation opportunities, and many more.</p><p>Mangrove ecosystems, for example, have been estimated to provide services worth up to $ 50,000 per hectare in some cases, with $ 15,000 as the average value. Beyond these valuated benefits, natural ecosystems serve as animal habitats and hold intangible and hard-to-quantify aesthetic, cultural, or spiritual value, create a sense of place, and can improve mental health and resilience of nearby communities.</p><p>Secondly, while healthy ecosystems automatically provide the above-mentioned benefits to the environment, wildlife, and human communities, they can also be harnessed in targeted ways. Towards this end, ecosystem services can be incorporated into planning processes in direct, indirect, or hybrid ways.</p><p>Such nature-based solutions can, for example, take the form of green infrastructure such as green roofs, rain gardens, urban forests, urban wetlands, or urban agriculture that improve the resilience of human settlements by contributing to disaster risk reduction, flood control, food security, and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>Beyond improving cities and infrastructure, nature also offers ways to directly boost economic growth in sustainable ways. For an island nation like Sri Lanka, investing in a blue economy holds significant potential. Blue economy measures could include ecosystem solutions in the fisheries sector, seaweed or seagrass cultivation, coastal zone management, aquaculture, coastal and marine tourism, ocean-based transportation, or renewable ocean energy.</p><p>On land, integrated nature-based solutions can transform food systems and enhance productivity, production diversity, and resilience through agroforestry, or work towards more sustainable, cost-effective, and circular land and water management.</p><p>Thirdly, actions related to ecosystem conservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and assisted growth can help to mobilise much-needed finance and investment. There are various financial instruments and mechanisms that connect to natural ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, including green bonds, ecological restoration bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, impact investing, carbon credits (both on the voluntary market and in relation to a centralised mechanism being set up under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement), biodiversity offsets (for instance, for afforestation or habitat restoration), natural capital finance, resource efficiency financing, or bioprospecting (the exploration of biodiversity for commercially valuable genetic and biochemical resources).</p><p>Other mechanisms that can incentivise ecosystem conservation and link them to economic growth are payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanisms, ecosystem discounts for insurance premiums, eco-index insurance, or green mortgages.</p><p>Possible sources of finance for such interventions are varied and operate across all scales. Depending on available funding, nature-based solutions could take the form of national-level projects or public works, but also nature-based microfinance for local projects, such as in ecotourism or sustainable agriculture. Nature-based crowdfunding, donations, sale of conservation easements, special levies, or land trusts are potential other sources of biodiversity finance.</p><p>Aligning national and global goals</p><p>As highlighted in my previous column, the climate and biodiversity crises are neither separate nor are they confined to the country level. They are deeply interconnected global challenges-part of what can be called a 'polycrisis'-but must be addressed first and foremost through local and national action.</p><p>Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, global goals relate to climate change mitigation (emission reduction and curbing of temperature rise), adaptation (changing systems to avoid adverse impacts and seize positive opportunities), addressing loss and damage (support for those affected by climate impacts beyond adaptation limits), and providing support for developing countries, including through finance and technology transfer.</p><p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) adopted last month, global goals focus on biodiversity conservation and protected areas, halting species extinction, preserving genetic resources, halving food waste, and strengthening sustainable biodiversity management and usage. Furthermore, the GBF aims to mobilise at least $ 200 billion per year in financial flows from all sources to support these goals and ensure that adequate means of implementation are available to all Parties, particularly developing countries.</p><p>Individual countries communicate their contributions to these overarching goals through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Sri Lanka's NDCs, for example, include sectors such as forestry, water, biodiversity, and coastal and marine, while the country's NBSAPs reference climate impacts, biodiversity valuation, sustainable use of biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, and equitable sharing of biodiversity benefits, among other things.</p><p>Both documents contain targets related to the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of soil, water, forests, wetlands, agrobiodiversity, and coastal and marine areas. Conserving natural ecosystems and biodiversity contributes to achieving these targets as well as mitigating climate change by acting as carbon sinks.</p><p>If national, local, and sector-specific plans and interventions are aligned with these commitments, they can better access finance from global funds (such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environmental Facility), multi- and bilateral entities, financial markets, the private sector, the insurance industry, repurposed subsidies, and other countries.</p><p>With the new biodiversity finance target, pledges made to several funds at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, and a new upcoming global goal for climate finance, there is an important window of opportunity to link action on biodiversity and climate change.</p><p>Identifying synergies</p><p>Sri Lanka is endowed with valuable natural capital in the form of diverse ecosystems, fauna, and flora. Building on this capital in line with national and global commitments can provide a pathway to attract investment, access finance from a multitude of sources, and design interventions and policies with strong co-benefits and synergies.</p><p>If concrete, transparent, and well-designed actions are taken on different levels, they can not only prevent further biodiversity loss and preserve biodiversity benefits for future generations, but also utilise the full potential of ecosystems to address climate change, support economic growth, and mobilise investment from a multitude of sources.</p><p>(The writer works as Director - Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

The increasing franchise costs that entail imported coffees are also driving many popular coffee houses in Colombo and the suburbs to turn to local blends, some of them which have already tapped a lucrative export market. The coffee rust which ended the island's coffee romance in the British-occupied then Ceylon is given hope for resurgence today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The local coffee production and extent have increased over the years. Sri Lanka's coffee cultivation covers 4,787 ha. today, according to DEA's statistics. The production which was at 2,439 mt. in 2021, has increased to 2,537 mt. by the end of 2022.</p><p>The two main commercially important species of coffee locally grown are Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora). These two main species grown here include several varieties. While Arabica coffee varieties are recommended for mid and up country areas with an altitude of over 400m (Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Matale and Badulla), Robusta variety is recommended for mid and low country with an altitude of less than 600m (Kegalle, Kurunegala, Kandy and Matale). These recommendations are made depending on the temperature variation. While Arabica prefers a temperature of 15-28\u00baC, Robusta thrives in a temperature of 18-36\u00baC.</p><p>Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. The Coffee Market Report of April this year issued by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) notes that the world coffee consumption increased by 4.2% to 175.6 million bags in the year 2021/22. It is expected to increase by 1.7% to 178.5 million bags in coffee year 2022/23</p><p>Lak Parakum among top 10</p><p>More than 80% the world demand is for Arabica coffee says DEA's Additional Director General (Research) Dr. Ananda Subasinghe. Lak Parakum with its quality parameters, in terms of the yield, disease-tolerance and the texture of beans, stands among the best ten Arabica varieties in the world, he adds. Each kilo of Lak Parakum seed, according to DEA, could produce 2,000 to 3,000 plants and a sizeable amount of plants have been distributed among growers already.</p><p>Expanding exports</p><p>The export market for Sri Lankan coffee too expanded over the years. From 30.47 mt. in 2021, our coffee exports have increased to 50.56 mt. in 2022. Australia, UAE, USA, Maldives, New Zealand, Chile, UK and Germany are the major buyers of Sri Lankan coffee. Several new measures are now in place to tap a lucrative market for Sri Lankan coffee. Production of planting material with private sector nurseries, awareness programs for crop management, harvesting and processing practices for high quality products, promoting value addition, introduction of GAP (Good Agricultural Practices), certification to get premium prices and increasing the coffee extent to 5,800 ha and the export volume to 200 mt. by 2025 are among these.</p><p>The current average productivity of coffee is about 450-500kg per ha. However, this could easily double within a year with Productivity Improvement Programs (PIP) for existing cultivations, points out Dr. Subasinghe.</p><p>Although threats from rust diseases are still prevalent in coffee fields, they can be controlled with good management practices and available control measures, points out the DEA authorities. Apart from the rust disease, the major pest problem which threatens coffee is the berry borer damage. This too can be managed with good crop management practices, assures the DEA. Even though DEA has given a fertiliser recommendation for coffee, most of the farmers are not applying them due to different reasons such as, shortage of fertiliser, higher prices and their preference for only organic fertiliser and mulching practices, etc. If they can apply half the recommendation and Gliricidia mulch, it is more beneficial for a sustainable crop, Dr. Subasinghe points out. Conservation of the soil moisture up to six months after flowering is also crucial as the most important yield determining-practice for increasing the quantity of the coffee yield, he says.</p><p>The better price offered for Lak Parakum variety in the local market is another boost to revive coffee growing, says DEA's Deputy Director (Research) Thushari Liyanage. 'Due to the low prices offered for coffee, which was about Rs. 400 per kilo of beans, five years ago, many growers were discouraged and neglected coffee in the last few years, however, currently a kilo of quality coffee could fetch an average about Rs. 1,200 to 1,300 per kilo.'</p><p>Enhancing productivity</p><p>Immature coffee harvesting and bad processing practices lead to rejection of some of the local coffee beans by importing countries, points out Liyanage who goes on to note that if timely harvesting and good processing practices can be followed by growers and processors, the export potential for local coffee could be strengthened. Today only about 20-30% of local coffee meets international criteria for exports.</p><p>Applauding the contribution made by the private sector, Liyanage encourages 'Certification' among coffee growers and exporters. 'Unlike in the tea industry, certification processes are still not very popular in the local industry. However, if certification can be promoted, the recognition and the price offered for our coffee in the international market could be a lot more,' maintains the DEA official who also notes that coffee productivity needs to double along with good irrigation practices for the local coffee industry to be more competitive. She also cites the potential for new job opportunities within the coffee industry such as roasters, coffee baristas and coffee tasters with the expansion of it.</p><p>Coffee romance</p><p>History has it that coffee was introduced to us in 1503 by the Arab traders from Yemen. However, the planting of coffee as a commercial crop in the island commenced with the Dutch occupation and continued under British rule. Planter R.B. Butler, who had experience in coffee plantations in Jamaica, came here in 1837 and introduced methods to yield a better coffee crop. By 1863, the value of coffee imported into Europe from all parts of the world amounted to \u00a3 270 million, and we were exporting nearly a third of that.</p><p>The colonial 'Ceylon' was among the top coffee producing and exporting nations and a coffee-drinking culture complete with kopi kaday (coffee kiosks) and kopi kele (coffee forests) evolved. Christine Spittel-Wilson's famous book The Bitter Berry revolves around the ethos of a Ceylonese coffee plantation.</p><p>Sadly, the coffee rust of 1870 (caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix) destroyed all plantations bringing the coffee romance of the country to an end. Although rust-tolerant varieties were later introduced, today coffee is an intercrop with tea and coconut. However, the DEA encourages coffee growers to expand their coffee acreage as monocrop cultivations as well.</p><p>Reskilling skills</p><p>Tharanga Rajith Muramudali who has been in the coffee industry since 2012 promotes his own produce under the 'Helanta' brand today and is a leading exporter of premier Sri Lankan coffee. He exports premier Arabica coffee of 'shade planting', 'organic planting' and 'mixed planting' to Japan, Australia and Thailand. Sourcing coffee from his own lands in Kothmale, Tharanga also runs Natural Coffee Caf\u00e9 in Kandy. He is also a supplier of premier local coffee to some of the leading hotel chains in the country. Tharanga, who says that high quality Sri Lankan coffee supply cannot meet the demand, calls for fellow growers to expand their coffee coverage. 'Superior quality Arabica coffee could fetch from Rs. 6,000 to 10,000 a kilo in the export market, depending on the type of coffee. Special organic varieties are sold for about Rs. 10,000 a kilo and even more,' says the self-made coffee entrepreneur.</p><p>Tharanga's coffee has clinched several awards at international coffee festivals, scoring over 80 points which is a mark of eligibility to be among top coffee brands anywhere in the world, he says. 'Although we have enough land, we still do not have sufficient coffee nurseries,' lamented Tharanga whose own nurseries hope to expand to distribute 500,000 plants next year.</p><p>Nalin Priyantha of Kiyota Coffee fame produces eight signature tastes of coffee in his factory sourced from his own lands in Matale. A leading exporter of premium Sri Lankan coffee to Japan, Nalin points out that if the producers and exporters could enhance the quality of their produce, a larger export market could be tapped for local coffee. Comparing our Arabica coffee to a 'mound of gold covered in mud', Nalin also calls for increased empowerment of small holders. 'Our soil conditions, water quality of high elevations all contribute to producing some of world's best coffee and if growers could enhance their GAPs sky is the limit for our crop,' remarks Nalin, whose Amberlyplace Coffee Academy strives to add more muscle to the industry by opening several career paths as coffee roasters and baristas.</p><p>If timely harvesting and good processing practices can be followed by growers and processors, the export potential for local coffee could be strengthened. Today only about 20-30% of local coffee meets international criteria for exports</p><p>Expanding coverage</p><p>Since 2016, Elpitiya Plantations PLC (EPP) has been cultivating new tolerant-varieties of coffee in their poor tea-yielding lands in the up and mid-country (which were predominantly coffee estates back in time) as an intercrop. EPP's coffee extent of 103.05 ha. is to be increased to 283.36 ha. within the next five years, says EPP's General Manager, Up Country Cluster, L.M.C.P. Liyadipita. The coffee expansion exercise of EPP also envisages to train over 200 employees in planting, harvesting, processing and value addition for export markets.</p><p>Developments in all aspects of the Sri Lankan coffee market, including production, processing, marketing, and consumption, have been significant, points out the EPP's senior official. 'There is a steady increase in demand for specialty Arabica and fine Robusta coffee both in local and export markets especially in countries like Australia. New Zealand, Japan. UAE and Canada. The MDF (Market Development Facility) along with SL Coffee Association and the Department of Export Agriculture are jointly working with upgrading and sharing giving knowledge and rendering assistance to develop the coffee industry in the country to meet international standards.'</p><p>Braving climate change</p><p>Sri Lankan coffee with its unique quality, flavour and aroma, has a great potential for reaching an international niche market with proper branding, says Liyadipita. 'The country's highlands provide an ideal environment for cultivating high-quality Arabica beans, resulting in unique and flavourful profiles that set them apart from other coffee varieties. Additionally, Sri Lankan coffee is predominantly produced by smallholder and backyard farmers who employ organic and sustainable farming practices, ensuring the preservation of the environment's biodiversity.'</p><p>Higher temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, increased pest and disease outbreaks, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services are some of the adverse effects that coffee cultivation faces due to climate change, says EPP official. 'At EPP, we have implemented GAPs to counteract the negative effects of climate change and ensure a productive coffee harvest. We harvest over 259 million litres of rainwater in harvesting ponds to recharge the soil to mitigate the drought effect and incorporate soil with 61% organic compost. We have identified 166 ha. of stream reservation for restoration by planting native plants/bamboo. Development of catchment and connecting animal corridors with increasing green cover to preserve the micro climatic conditions is another initiative.'</p><p>EPP has also introduced several schemes to encourage small coffee holders both within the plantation company and outside in the neighbouring villages. Investing in R and D, enhancing the capacity and skills of coffee farmers and processors, enhancing the awareness and appreciation of Sri Lankan coffee, strengthening collaboration and coordination among multiple stakeholders in the coffee sector and supporting a conducive policy and regulatory environment are among the measures mooted by Liyadipita to take Sri Lankan coffee to the next level.</p><p>Sri Lankan coffee to the next level</p><p>Upcountry estates of the Kahawatte Plantations, expanded over the Nawalapitiya area of Kothmale Valley and the Dolosbage hills, produce high-quality, single-origin coffees for the world market, sourced from 21 ha. The company plans to expand the coffee coverage to 50 ha. by 2027. The estates, as Kahawatte Plantations PLC Director Plantations, Chaminda Gunarathna points out, have the ideal climatic conditions for coffee-growing in the country. 'Our elevation varies from 600 msl to 1,650 msl, which provides the most favourable elevation for Arabica coffee cultivation. Moreover, the soil factor in the Nawalapitiya area has improved with GAPs such as adding compost, planting green manure crops and adopting soil conservation methods, as coffee's performance is better on nutrient-rich soils.'</p><p>As a diversification strategy, Kahawatte Plantations commenced coffee cultivation in 2021 under the guidance of the DEA. 'As our existing coffee fields will be in the bearing stage in 2025, we have planned to commence a coffee processing centre by 2025 to produce high-quality value-added coffees required by the international market,' says its Director Plantations.</p><p>Coffee is the second most traded commodity next to crude oil in the world. Hence, the potential for penetrating the market channel will be directly determined by the quality factors of the coffee that the country produces, says Gunarathna. 'Although there is a good demand for Sri Lankan Arabica coffee in the global market, the price fluctuation has negatively affected the coffee farmers.'</p><p>To mitigate the impact of climate change, their plantations have adopted GAPs and climate resilience measures introduced by Dilmah Conservation such as mulching, shade management, proper irrigation, rain-water harvesting and maintenance of good ground cover, says Gunarathna. 'As a climate resilience measure, we cultivate and maintain our coffee as agroforestry models where we have a greater impact, especially in the case of pest and disease outbreaks. Further, we maintain our coffee fields with zero herbicide to ensure the proper biological properties in the soil.'</p><p>In a bid to assist smallholders of coffee, Kahawatte Plantations offer plants sourced by their nurseries and technical assistance. Enabling more mechanisation of field practices of coffee cultivation is critical if Sri Lankan coffee is to reach the next level, remarks Gunarathna. Expanding technical assistance from the government to expand large-scale cultivation and enhancing the specialty knowledge of coffee processing are also mooted by the senior official as necessary tools if Sri Lankan coffee is to compete in the international coffee market. 'At Kahawatte Plantations, we strive at all times to raise the bar for Sri Lankan coffee in the same way we did with our tea, earning a name as a leading brand in the international market,' Gunarathna notes.</p><p>A voice for the industry</p><p>As part of Lanka Coffee Association's (LCA) efforts in elevating the Sri Lankan coffee industry and enabling a platform to voice the industry's concerns to the Government, LCA in collaboration with the DEA and Market Development Facility, hosted the 'Coordination for Improvement of the Coffee Industry in Sri Lanka' program in Kandy last year to lend voice to the key concerns in the industry. In a bid to showcase Sri Lanka's specialty coffee, local baristas' coffee brewing skills and promote the emerging coffee culture, LCA is also to support Sri Lanka Coffee Festival and Barista Championship which will kick off in mid-May this year.</p><p>'As part of LCA's mandate, we are also working at the grass root level to improve the quality and quantity of coffee produced in Sri Lanka. In addition, we are hosting events such as the coffee festival to promote and showcase our coffee to the world. Through such strategic initiatives, we are able to attract a stronger international market for Sri Lanka. In addition, moves to obtain Geographical Indication (GI) for Sri Lankan coffee are also under consideration,' says LCA Chairman and Founder and CEO of Soul Coffee Company, Rinosh Nasar.</p><p>Soul Coffee, as its founder explains, is sustainably grown by over a 1,000 farming families across the luscious highland forests of Sri Lanka. 'Since its inception in 2014, the brand has been at the forefront in the revival of Sri Lankan coffee and tirelessly pushing to improve the coffee experience, and the quality of local coffee available to the everyday coffee drinker. We work closely with our hardworking and extremely skilled local farmers to grow our premium quality coffee, without using any environmentally devastating mono-culture practices, and following ethical farming standards. Our ethically conscious approach to present our customers with the perfect cup of coffee that they can enjoy without any reservation, is something we strongly believe in and reflects in our core values,' remarks Nasar.</p><p>Pic credit: Helanta Coffee and Kiyota Coffee</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT1805202300019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6886-5GS1-F00C-654D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35351\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 18, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000323</classCode><className>COFFEE MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NW</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D4DM</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS &amp;

This is the fat end of the world subsidy enterprise, in which there is a liberal infusion of money that's injected to boost industrialised farming each year - \" big farma\", if you will.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has castigated the organic fertiliser policy, and various pundits have inveighed against it from the safety of their air conditioned office cubicles in urban dystopia.</p><p>Support for the \"outsized\" meat and dairy industry in rich countries must be reduced, while subsidies for polluting chemical fertiliser and pesticides must fall in lower-income countries, the UN analysis states.</p><p>There must be considerable egg on the face of the critics who opposed the chemical fertiliser ban in its entirety - even though some criticisms on the modus operandi of the new policy would have been, at the very least, rational. But what did we have?</p><p>Hysterical rants basically extrolling the virtues of chemical fertiliser accompanied by tirades on the wooly headedness of the organic fertiliser initiative.</p><p>The Guardian article goes on: \"The UN report found that between 2013 and 2018, support to farmers totalled an average of $540bn a year, of which 87 percent ($470bn) was \"harmful\". This included price incentives for specific livestock and crops, subsidies for fertiliser and pesticides and distorting export subsidies and import tariffs.\"</p><p>Famished</p><p>The JVP and SJB know-it-alls have been tone deaf to the known negative effects of chemical fertiliser and now it appears they are at least by default in cahoots with the \"big farma\" subsidy culture that's ruining the planet.</p><p>How about those protests then, that have been mounted by the 'harried farming community'?</p><p>\"Changes in subsidy regimes are likely to be politically controversial and could spark protests among farmers and other groups,\" Morgan Gillespy of the Food and Land Use Coalition said. \"But just because it is hard, doesn't mean it shouldn't happen. The facts are now clear.\" (British Guardian.)</p><p>The farmer protests here have mostly been orchestrated by the JVP's overactive political machine. It's been their usual methodology - i.e.: to cause a crisis and then stage a protest citing negligence and worse.</p><p>For example, they agitate for Covid-19 related shutdowns at the drop of a hat and when the closures in fact take place, they bring out a parade of the \"hungry and neglected\" claiming the lockdowns kept these people famished and in abject penury.</p><p>The UN report substantially gives the lie to the campaigns carried on by vested interests on various fronts.</p><p>Strident interest groups for instance have been agitating to keep the imported milk food industry going. Powdered milk, in the form that it's sold, is useless to the consumer but then, these are highly subsidised \"big farma\" products that come to us from countries that have these industrial scale dairy farming projects in place, as it were, to dupe the consumers in foreign countries - and contribute in colossal quantities to global warming, to boot.</p><p>We can no longer have lobby groups - SJB, JVP or NGO backed, that stand the truth on its head by demonising organic fertiliser projects, and celebrating the use of chemical fertilisers, while deploring the import restrictions on foreign origin powdered milk food products.</p><p>In today's context, lobby groups that stick to such policies for whatever professed reasons, must be peopled by either ignoramuses and yokels - or those who have indentured themselves to vested interests for collateral reasons.</p><p>Juncture</p><p>The Government's move is towards global sustainability and it's a long game. Those who are opposed to it on principle are in the dark ages - because they are basically cheering on a project of laying waste to vast tracts of land.</p><p>The UN report cited above states that such acts of desertification caused by subsidised farming and chemical fertiliser usage could be rectified by the practice of agroforestry.</p><p>Agroforestry is \"the intentional integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems to create environmental, economic, and social benefits.\" It's is organic farming in its essence because it helps carbon sequestration which is the process by which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere to be held in the soil (for crop nutrition).</p><p>These are the enlightened practices that the JVP and the so called socially conscious elite should be cheering for if any one of them have a progressive bone in their body. But they have been getting along with the vested interests, now exposed in the UN report.</p><p>\"What is needed by Sri Lanka at the present juncture is to go for a second green revolution to improve its agricultural yields. As mentioned above, the first Green Revolution was based on the development of high yielding varieties, application of chemical fertiliser and pesticides.\" That's a quote from a recent article by a so called former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank.</p><p>Its one thing to oppose the organic fertiliser initiative based on the detail i.e. to say that it's too all-encompassing and so on, but the above quote shows how far into the dark ages the so called policy elite have regressed.</p><p>The former Deputy Governor wants more application of chemical fertilisers and pesticides- a second Green Revolution, he calls it.</p><p>From under exactly which rock did he emerge recently? The UN warns of the dire consequences of subsidised chemical fertiliser use and industrial scale dairy farming and so on, and points out that these practices are egregiously harmful to the planet, but here we have an ex-Central Bank policy mandarin saying we should double down on the toxic culture of the agriculture of the past.</p><p>Regressive</p><p>This sort of blanket caving into vested interests as the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna MP Mohommed Muzammil said on TV once, begs the question - how far have these vested interests gone in trying to influence people? Is it the money?</p><p>It cannot be put past these interest groups - the possibility that they have used material inducement to acquire supporters.</p><p>However, it's unlikely that the ex-Central Bank officer was in the pay. But shouldn't such folk be more aware of how damaging their support for these regressive causes can be - especially when they can be used by the aforementioned vested interests to promote their harmful practices?</p><p>Of course food security issues are ever present. They cannot be wished away. But does it mean that the obvious harmful effects of 'big farma' agricultural practices should be completely ignored? That we turn a blind eye to land desertification and so on that potentially could cause more hunger in the long run?</p><p>That's not just myopic, it's totally irresponsible behaviour.

Currently, residents of 16 estates in Kahawatte plantation, 16 estates in Talawakele plantation, 13 estates in Elpitiya plantations, and Dunkeld Estate have benefited from initiatives related to healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and education. The Dilmah Plantation action plan for 2021-2025 is a Rs. 200 million initiative embracing education, entrepreneurship, climate resilience, nutrition, childcare amongst other areas, the company said in a media release.</p><p>Winning the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 is considered a top honour in the Sri Lankan corporate field. The tea company further won category awards for Customer Relations, Environment Beyond the Business, and was chosen as one of the Top 10 Corporate Citizens of Sri Lanka. It was also a proud parent moment for Dilmah as Rainforest Eco Lodge, a venture initiated by the company, was awarded Certificate of Merit for Best Sustainability Projects.</p><p>To ensure that economic, social, and environmental sustainability exists at the heart of its operations, Dilmah established the Merrill J Fernando Charitable Foundation (MJF Foundation) and Dilmah Conservation to drive life-impacting initiatives ('Purpose Beyond Profit' is a free e-book, giving an overview of the overwhelming impact made through the two organisations),</p><p>The MJF Foundation works directly with estate workers and underprivileged communities to uplift lives and empowers them to pay-it-forward to their communities. The Foundation has improved the quality of life for plantation workers, residents, and the surrounding communities by establishing new housing, medical centres, and care for the entire resident population of the estates, pre-schools at 63 Child Development Centres, after-school programmes, and nutrition programmes.</p><p>The release said that the 2021-2025 Dilmah Plantation Action plan will revive the plantation community in 16 estates that form a part of primarily Dilmah-owned Kahawatte Plantations, Talawakelle, and Elpitiya Plantations. The action plan will bear a holistic framework aimed at elevating the community members' physical, mental, and emotional well-being and socio-economic status. The areas of focus are gender and women, youth, education, health and well-being, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), climate-smart agriculture including agroforestry, adopting Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) as plantation best practices, water, climate change, livelihoods, and entrepreneurship. Over 138,415 people in the plantations are expected to benefit from the programmes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM1104202100096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62DV-VBH1-F00C-63W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 11, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000834W</classCode><className>BEST INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS453998 ALL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS STORE RETAILERS (EXCEPT TOBACCO STORES)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>BEST (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp;

And it is made clear the urgent need to make global food systems more just.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An example of modern food injustice is that if you are poor or an ethnic minority in the US, you are less likely to have easy access to healthy food. This situation, worsened by COVID-19, has been termed food apartheid. It is also often the case that corporations, not local growers, control the food produced by communities: taking money out of their hands.</p><p>If this is to change, it is important to understand who wins within existing food systems and, more importantly, who loses by being pushed to the sidelines and losing out on access to healthy food.</p><p>To do this, those who design food systems need to consider how different factors that determine if someone is marginalized - like gender, age, disability, ethnicity and religion - can combine or intersect, making some people more vulnerable.</p><p>Vulnerable groups</p><p>For example, international development programmes by Governments and charities often focus on helping women because they are considered vulnerable. But this risks overlooking different causes of poverty including class and race issues, marginalising other vulnerable groups.</p><p>In Tanzania, this kind of oversimplification when deciding who receives resources has been found to reinforce existing power hierarchies within the communities, meaning that those who had little social power to begin with - such as poorer women - do not get to benefit from the resources provided.</p><p>In contrast, research shows that development projects tend to do better when they take local community norms into account. For example, in Bangladesh, men and women from Hindu and Muslim communities work in the wetlands, but each group plays a different role. Researchers found that community wetland management projects did better when people worked in accordance with their traditional roles according to both gender and religion.</p><p>Power dynamics</p><p>An intersectional approach helps us to move beyond simplistic categories like the \"vulnerable women\", instead drawing attention to the unequal flows of power that shape access to resources. This should be embedded at the deepest level within food science to ensure marginalised and vulnerable people are at the forefront of change.</p><p>It is also vital to understand how power dynamics structure decisions within food systems, whether that is within households or inside Government institutions.</p><p>When tackling issues faced by women and girls in Burundi, CARE International worked with a network of local male gender equality champions to analyse power systems, reflect on gender roles and encourage equal and active participation by women in community decisions. Outcomes included improvements in agricultural productivity as well as increasing women's empowerment and gender equality.</p><p>Creating inclusive, safe spaces for marginalised voices is also critical. Creative approaches, such as theatre, dance and music, provide a powerful medium through which to achieve this.</p><p>For example, Roktim: Nurture Incarnadine, an Ananya Dance Theatre production, explores feminist food politics through dance. Their performance highlights issues around sustainability and justice in food systems, and demonstrates the power of community action.</p><p>Historical injustice has a large part to play in the ongoing failure of food systems. For example, when it comes to global food systems, we need to understand how colonialism has shaped food processes and how it continues to do so today.</p><p>During the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, the colonial government in Zambia promoted maize production over that of indigenous crops like millet and sorghum. Nowadays, maize production continues to receive substantial support, with almost 80 per cent of the Government's annual agricultural budget spent on producing maize. Consequently, maize - which provides limited nutrients - dominates the Zambian diet, contributing to chronic food insecurity and inequality in the region.</p><p>Understanding how to better design food systems requires researchers to take into account how colonisation has helped shape them in the first place. This allows us to acknowledge how colonial processes of exploitation and destruction, such as the transatlantic slave trade, are reflected in modern maize-dominated food systems across Africa.</p><p>Decolonising research can also encourage us to identify and challenge power, privilege and inequality in research. For example, it is usually scholars from developed countries, rather than their counterparts in developing countries, who set research agendas and determine how money is spent.</p><p>And research from across the world is frequently only published in English, limiting the accessibility of that information within communities where English is not widely spoken or understood.</p><p>Traditionally, science has seen itself as a process of impartial observation. Yet all research reflects cultural biases, and as researchers we are profoundly influenced by our own values and ethics. Becoming aware of how our scientific knowledge is created is a key step in achieving justice.</p><p>From the co-development of agricultural technologies to the design and launch of food programmes, researchers have a huge impact on what kind of science gets prioritised - and who ultimately benefits from it.</p><p>Harriet Elizabeth Smith, Research Fellow in Climate Risk, University of Leeds; Ruth Smith, PhD Researcher in Agriculture, University of Leeds, and Todd Rosenstock, Senior Scientist, Agriculture and the Environment, World Agroforestry (ICRAF)</p><p>(This article is republished from The Conversation via Inter Press Service)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

The Agriculture Department and the Export Development Board at the invitation of the DAL continuously extend their expertise, maximum scientific and other consultations to Army troops working on those farms around the country.</p><p>In the meantime, those troops with the objective of producing rice for own domestic consumption are now busy cultivating paddy for all seasons at Kandakadu farm, Manik farm and Sri Jayawardenepura area around the Army Headquarters. In some of them, the harvest has already been reaped and made available for the troops to purchase those varieties of rice from the Army Seva Vanitha Unit-run welfare shops. Best quality rice varieties are grown in those fields, absent of chemicals or pesticides.</p><p>Likewise, the poultry farming, one of the large livestock projects of the DAL has now expanded and a few more than some 25,000 layer chickens in the Army-managed farms in Kandakadu, Galkanda, Nirawiya and Balalla are there to fulfil the egg requirement of the Sri Lanka Army. The Layer Chicken Project started in mid of 2020 with 5,000 layer chickens as a pilot move has proved to be a very productive project.</p><p>The DAL's Meals-Ready to Eat (MRE) ration packet production process at the Kandakadu Army Farm complex meanwhile reached new heights as its daily output has now increased to 1,000 packs a day, thereby cutting down a huge sum of foreign exchange to the country by way of import costs. The MRE packs, made up of textured and dehydrated nutrients are generally used by troops under training in jungles or those serving in distant remote areas.</p><p>Dairy products, such as milk packets and curd pots are also produced at Kandakadu as a routine and regularly distributed among all Army Seva Vanitha shops for consumption of troops, which have drawn popularity among consumers.</p><p>In the same manner, the Army farm at Palatupana, Yala which commenced the production of iodine mixed quality cooking salt has already received the SLS certification and those packets are delivered to the Sri Lanka Army Service Corps for distribution among Army camps and a stock is currently sold at minimal price to the members of the Army as one more subsidised item.</p><p>Similarly, afforestation roles of the Army in parallel with the Army Commander-initiated Thuru Mithuru Nawa Ratak green drive has so far proved effective and contributed to the national tree-planting campaigns all over the country, including the Wilpaththu Forest Reserve region. It has made an impact on the East, North and North Central Provinces where the rainfall is comparatively less.</p><p>Agroforestry roles of the Army also cover cultivation of different and rare herbal medicine saplings and Glidiciria plants, needed for regeneration of Nitrogen to the soil which is now widely used in the organic compost fertiliser production process in the Army, the latest addition to the nation-building projects of the Government on a Presidential directive. The Army has initiated the process for the production of 2,500 metric tonnes of organic fertiliser inside island-wide Army camps for use in the Maha season 2021, and samples of fertiliser thus produced were recently handed over to the Agriculture Department to ascertain the quality.</p><p>The beekeeping projects for the production of bees honey have also yielded impressive results and it is being expanded to other areas where climatic conditions are desirable for beekeeping schemes. The DAL has also planned to begin cultivation of about 35,000 Murunga, wood apple, lemon, tamarind saplings inside Army-managed farms and camp compounds in the forthcoming Maha Season.</p><p>The DAL with sustained guidelines given by Defence Staff Chief and Army Commander General Shavendra Silva who expects the Army to have its own products made or cultivated as many as possible for self-consumption, minimising the costs for imports, etc conducts regular long-term and short-term courses for troops on relevant updated aspects and modern techniques and is committed to going ahead with those impressive projects in a result-oriented manner under the close supervision of Director - Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock Brigadier Arosha Rajapakse, along with its dedicated troops in one Regular Battalion and three Volunteer Battalions.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Subsequently, there is a decline in rainfall, subjecting the area to drought. If rains stop falling, within a few years the area can become arid with the strong tropical sun baking down on the scrub-land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such losses of freshwater resources are considered one of the most immediate threats to national security. Freshwater - required for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial operations - or the lack thereof can have a tremendous effect on the social, economic, and political climate of a country. Under these circumstances, deforestation will adversely affect the survival of the nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wars for water - not for oil</p><p>Today Madagascar is largely a red, treeless desert due to generations of forest clearing with fire. River flows decline and smaller amounts of quality water reach cities and agricultural lands. In interior West African countries, the declining rainfall has, in part, been attributed to excessive clearing of the coastal rainforests. Similarly, new research in Australia suggests that if it were not for human influences - specifically widespread agricultural fires - the dry outback might be a wetter, more hospitable place than it is today.</p><p>The effect of vegetation change from forests that favour rainfall to grassland and bush can impact precipitation patterns. Colombia, once second in the world ranking for freshwater reserves, has fallen to the 24th place due to its extensive deforestation over the past 30 years. Excessive deforestation around Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, combined with the dry conditions created by el Ni\u00f1o, triggered strict water rationing in 1998, and for the first time the city had to import water. In the future, wars may be fought over water, not oil. In the 1990s, Egypt made it known to its upstream neighbours - Sudan and Ethiopia - that it is willing to go to war over the Nile's water. The evidence amply justify that the deforestation has a direct adverse impact on national security.</p><p>World forest cover</p><p>Forests cover 31 percent of the global land area. About half the forest area is relatively intact, and more than one-third is primary forest (i.e. naturally regenerated forests of native species, where there are no visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed). The total global forest area is 4.06 billion hectares, or about 5,000m2 (or 50 x 100m) per person, but forests are not equally distributed around the globe. More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China) and two-thirds (66 percent) of forests are found in ten countries.</p><p>Lanka's forest cover</p><p>Sri Lanka had a forest density of 82 percent in 1882. It was 29.5 percent as of 2015, according to Sri Lanka forest officials. The Forest Department says a survey is generally carried out once in 10 years. In the 1920s, the island had a 49 percent forest cover. Between 1990 and 2000, Sri Lanka lost an average of 26,800 ha of forests a year. This amounts to an average annual deforestation rate of 1.14 percent. Sri Lankans have cleared 52.5 percent of the forests in 133 years. This may be due to the rise in population, agriculture, development, construction of major dams and highways and urbanisation. 'The World Food and Agriculture Organisation ranked Sri Lanka as the 4th country with the highest rate of deforestation by 2010. We are holding the same position even now.'</p><p>Premadasa's National Green Initiative</p><p>Against such a backdrop, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, a nature lover, on March 3 introduced 'the National Green Initiative' concept. It aims to mainstream environmental conservation across all sectors as a precondition to achieve sustainable development.</p><p>He commissioned his political party Samagi Jana Balawegaya to be the first party in Sri Lanka. This environmental friendly concept needs to be appreciated and supported not only by nature lovers but also by all the citizens in the country.</p><p>Deforestation at present</p><p>The government says it is committed to increasing the national forest cover by 30 percent. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has emphasised the need for a sustainable environmental policy to support sustainable development and promised to increase the forest cover.</p><p>Despite the promise, what we see is the deforestation of protected areas. It is a nightmare for conservationists, environmentalists and nature friendly citizens.</p><p>The construction of the Neluwa-Lankagama-Deniyaya Road, the deforestation in Anawilundawa to establish a prawn farm and clearing of several forest areas around the country caught the attention of environmental activists. Furthermore, reports indicate the involvement of a few newly elected parliamentarians in deforestation activities.</p><p>However, the diffusion of the president's aims and vision to the relevant political authorities and bureaucratic authorities seems questionable, amid incidents of deforestation and increased human activity. The authorities have failed to produce environmental assessments for development projects in forest areas. Election promises, a lack of political authority and a lack of sustainable strategies have led to the blind advancement of unsustainable development projects.</p><p>Human survival and national security</p><p>Trees have always been intricately linked to the survival and flourishing of human societies: they give us clean water, they hold and protect the soil, they cool the air and they shelter the fauna. From climate change to organised crime and the spread of infectious diseases, forest degradation is directly tied to a series of both national and global security risks:</p><p>The most serious consequences of deforestation and forest degradation have been identified as:</p><p>Reduced agricultural output due to changes in precipitation</p><p>Water scarcity and irregular water supply</p><p>Air pollution</p><p>Organised crimes. Provincial political authorities, under the cover of party in power, destroy forest cover for commercial purposes. Illegal deforestation also plays a significant role in organised crime.</p><p>Infrastructure damage from wildfires</p><p>Increase in the spread of infectious diseases</p><p>reduction in biodiversity</p><p>Increase in migration due to non-availability of water</p><p>Shortened life span of irrigation channels and reservoirs</p><p>Soil erosion and associated</p><p>loss of soil fertility</p><p>Reduction of wood supplies</p><p>and the resulting price increase</p><p>of wood and wood products</p><p>scarcity of fuelwood in</p><p>some localities</p><p>Effects on wildlife and adverse effects in tourism and livelihood</p><p>Contribution to all existing security risks related to global warming</p><p>The consequences of deforestation are directly effecting the human survival in numerous ways endangering the existence of environment. when deforestation effects human survival, it adversely impact on national security. It can be named as environmental security vulnerability.</p><p>Conditions for successful implementation of deforestation</p><p>Based on the Sri Lankan experience, the following aspects have been identified as necessary conditions for the successful implementation of deforestation.</p><p>Development of appropriate policy, legislative and institutional frameworks: The development of appropriate policies with clear and functional definitions of conservation goals followed by suitable legislation and institutional arrangements is crucial. Furthermore, political will, Government commitment and support are necessary for effective implementation of the deforestation.</p><p>Development of alternative wood resources: Non-forest wood resources along with forest plantations can provide a viable alternative to timber from natural forests. Incentive schemes are necessary to encourage the private sector to establish forest plantations and plant trees in homegardens and agroforestry systems.</p><p>Demarcation of forest boundaries: Surveys and demarcation of forest boundaries are essential to prevent illegal felling and encroachment. Programmes should be prepared to survey and demarcate the large number of proposed forest reserves and other State forests, with financial assistance.</p><p>Relaxation of the private timber transport permit system: Sri Lanka's private timber transport permit system has been identified as a disincentive for private sector involvement in homegardens, agroforestry systems and other non-forest tree resources. Even though permits have been recognised as important to the domestic timber supply, relaxation of the present system to promote private sector and community involvement in tree planting and forestry development is proposed.</p><p>Adequate resources for forest protection and law enforcement: If the natural forests are to be protected against illegal felling and encroachment, the number of cadres from the Wildlife Department and the Forest Department has to be increased. Training should be provided to the field staff to strengthen their law enforcement capabilities.</p><p>Political and public awareness and forest extension: Decision makers need to be familiar with the benefits of conservation. The current extension and awareness programmes implemented by the Forest Department, the Wildlife Department and NGOs should be strengthened and expanded to cover all levels of the target groups.</p><p>Community and participatory forest management: The National Forest Policy recognises that the State alone cannot protect and manage the forests effectively. People's participation in forestry development and management should be promoted as one of the main strategies for forest conservation.</p><p>Improvement of the efficiency of forest industries: Old and inefficient equipment that has not been designed for small-dimension logs and inadequate management and labour skills are major problems in the forest industry. This leads to low recovery rates and poor overall productivity, particularly in the sawmill sector. The present average recovery rate has been estimated to be around 40 percent. Raising efficiency rates of wood-processing technologies is necessary to reduce waste.</p><p>Increase the range of timber species utilisation: Forest products and timber utilisation research needs to be strengthened to carry out more coordinated, product-oriented research and to disseminate information with greater emphasis on lesser-known timber species.</p><p>Development of a monitoring system for sustainable forest management: Development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management is an important aspect. Although there have been several international initiatives, Sri Lanka is still in the initial stages of this process.</p><p>Will deforestation impact national security?</p><p>When the forest cover is lost, runoff rapidly flows into streams, elevating river levels and subjecting downstream villages, cities, and agricultural fields to flooding, especially during the rainy season. During the dry season, such areas downstream of deforestation can be prone to months-long droughts which interrupt river navigation, wreak havoc on crops, and disrupt industrial operations. Deforestation effects water scarcity to industrial output, food insecurity, health hazards to job insecurity including air pollution. All the scientific reasons have logically suggested that deforestation effects the National survival and National security.</p><p>The death of the forest is the end of our life.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM28032021000534</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62C0-FXH1-JCH9-G0YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 28, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Droughts are expected to have a significant impact on rice crop yields. Climate change is widely expected to have a negative impact on vegetable and fruit production. As a result, this will create a serious food shortage and also severely restrict farmer income generation. Consequently, a large number from the rural community will migrate from agricultural areas of Sri Lanka to already congested urban areas. This will necessitate a long-term solution. Today's Sri Lankan population under the age of 50 will definitely bear the brunt of this situation. However, the majority of today's policymakers and policy implementers are over the age of 50, and they may not be concerned enough about this situation.</p><p>However, it must be noted that despite massive constraints, areas outside of urban Sri Lanka produce roughly 80% of the national food supply. Nevertheless, according to a recent survey, a farming household with a 4.5 family size earns around US$ 6.0-8.5 (or US$ 1.3-1.9 per person) per day. Hence, 82% of farmers work outside of agriculture to supplement their family income. Significant poverty and inequality persist in these food-producing agrarian communities, where four out of every five people live below the international poverty line and one-third of women are unemployed. As a result, the majority of people in this community are forced to seek employment in cities in order to support their families. If they are unable to find work near their home, they either migrate to cities or send a family member to work abroad.</p><p>This means that 82% of farmers work part-time which can have a direct influence on high input-high output agriculture, resulting in low productivity. Furthermore, crop productivity is heavily dependent on rainfall. The impending climate change situation will harm commercial agriculture and rural economies. This situation may affect the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the fact that agriculture's economic importance is declining, this situation emphasizes the importance of improving household income of our food producers. Hence, it is still an important part of the island's economy and cultural foundation. Politicians, planners, businesspeople, and consumers have yet to recognize the importance of this agrarian population, which relies on rain-fed income sources like agriculture, livestock, plantation, and inland fisheries.</p><p>Aside from climate change, the current Corona pandemic has caused agricultural input price increases, which have become a serious threat to the commercial food production system today. Furthermore, traditional agricultural practices that have been used for thousands of years cannot be used in commercial food cultivation due to a variety of constraints. Replacing inorganic fertilizer with organic fertilizer abruptly is not the solution for fertilizer response hybrid seed. These traditional agricultural practices, on the other hand, can be applied immediately in the now-defunct home garden farming systems, and then later to commercial agriculture.</p><p>The transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural society was significant, but humans continued to coexist with forests by creating this forest-inspired home garden. This man-made forest, also served as a source of food, fuel, fiber, and medicine. Traditional practices such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, which could be implemented in this home garden became a success, as they had the potential to increase food security while mitigating climate change. Furthermore, this traditional home garden farming system is the best solution for ensuring year-round food security in the face of climate change. Resilience of our rural societies to sustain livelihoods in the face of climate change disasters can be enhanced by this home garden. The strength of this artificial forest or home garden is that it has evolved into a farming system that combines physical, social, and economic functions on land adjacent to the family home. This area is easily accessible to all family members for farm produce work, storage, and processing, as well as a location where household waste is disposed of or recycled. To ensure its long-term viability, all of these functions are frequently equally important and intertwined with one another. Unlike commercial agriculture, which relies heavily on imported inputs, this will ensure low-input food production to the household.</p><p>As a result of this interdependence, low-input dairy cattle and backyard poultry production became a source of strength for the farming family. Furthermore, not only does it fit the home garden farming system, it also increases the asset value of the farming household. Moreover, in the past, the home garden farming system served as a repository for indigenous crop, medicinal, and livestock genes. These traditional food crops and farm animal genetic resources are bio-assets with the potential to solve future food issues caused by climate change.</p><p>These indigenous poultry breeds are still managed by women. Small-scale poultry production systems, also known as \"Family Poultry\", rely on family labour and locally available feed resources. Aside from nutrition, another function of \"Family Poultry\" is to generate income. Chickens are among the most affordable livestock in resource-poor settings, and they can be sold or exchanged for sequentially larger and higher-value species (such as goats or cattle), as well as to increase a household's asset base or cash income in times of need. The production model of the home garden farming system is critical in establishing a year-round food production system, as commercial food production may be affected by climate change and destroyed. As a result, increased family income and stability will, on the one hand, prevent this community from migrating locally and internationally, while also enabling the achievement of SDGs by 2030. This proposed system has existed since man's transition from hunting to farming.</p><p>Men and women's socially constructed gender roles have a significant impact on household food production, consumption, nutrition, and income generation. Women prepare all food in Sri Lanka, and traditionally, women are limited to housework. Men perform the majority of commercial crop cultivation activities, with women participating in some areas such as home gardening, livestock and poultry, transplanting, weeding, harvesting, and processing. These strenuous activities performed by women are not considered as employment. As a result, according to government statistics, one-third of rural women in Sri Lanka are unemployed. Based on this information, the government changed its policies to empower women by employing them in garment factories in rural Sri Lanka or finding them jobs in other countries. Because most year-round food-producing home gardens were neglected, this exacerbated the problem. Furthermore, the loss of labour provided by these household women's employment elsewhere impacted the commercial food production system.</p><p>Developing a home garden system is critical to stop rural people from migrating to cities and face food shortages as a result of impending climate change. This process can be accelerated by incorporating backyard poultry and dairy cattle in the hopes of revitalizing the now-defunct home garden.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

This is a good, and vital, initiative. Without quick action to clean up the fallout of humanity's scorched-Earth economic systems, goals on hunger, biodiversity and climate will be unattainable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in examining restoration projects already underway across the globe, a group of scientists has found that restoration action is at risk of failure if it doesn't make social and political considerations at the centre of efforts.</p><p>\"Biophysical considerations are usually central to restoration efforts,\" said Marlene Elias, a CGIAR gender researcher at the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. \"While there's usually a peripheral nod at other issues, there generally isn't substantial engagement with the social, human and political dimensions of restoration.\"</p><p>The research is part of a special edition of Ecological Restoration titled \"Restoration by Whom, for Whom,\" published in June 2021. The 11 papers include a successful kelp restoration project on Canada's West Coast, centred on the worldviews, ethics, and values of the Haida First Nation, with co-authors from the Haida First Nation. There is a study of a lake restoration project in Bangalore, India, where the lake ecosystem was \"successfully\" restored but the main beneficiaries were well-heeled urban residents at the exclusion of more vulnerable local communities who used to depend on the lake to fish, water their livestock, and more. Another group of authors reflect on inclusiveness in restoration based on their experience developing a mangrove restoration project with local communities.</p><p>Other research included work on farmer-managed natural regeneration in Ghana, on-farm experiments and payments for ecosystem services in Kenya, a government-led tree planting initiative in Vietnam and the use of an adapted Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology in India. The remaining papers provide perspectives on multi-stakeholder engagement and restoration approaches that offer entry points for inclusive restoration.</p><p>Authors include scientists from the CGIAR's International Food Policy Research Institute, International Water Management Institute, and World Agroforestry, as well as from universities, indigenous communities, NGOs, governments, the World Resources Institute, and other organizations from around the globe.</p><p>\"Restoration projects need to be more inclusive,\" Elias said. \"If you're looking at major goals like restoring millions of square kilometres of land, planting a trillion trees, or rehabilitating marine ecosystems, you're almost certainly not going to have success unless you put people at the centre of the work.\"</p><p>In the collection's introductory paper, Elias and the special issue's co-guest editors, Deepa Joshi and Ruth Meinzen-Dick, delve into \"feminist political ecology\" (FPE) and what this means in the context of Ecological Restoration. Meinzen-Dick said that one reason that social and political issues are often left out of restoration projects is because they're \"messy.\"</p><p>Top-down, one-size-fits all \"solutions\" tend to fail because land-rights issues, complicated relations among stakeholders, divergent worldviews and value systems, and potentially unequal distributions of benefits and costs are not addressed at the outset. While many oft-disenfranchised groups are left out of restoration plans, rural women face some of the most significant constraints in top-down restoration projects.</p><p>\"Our aim is to prompt critical reflection that can open new avenues for meaningful engagement with issues of power and justice in restoration, to challenge the assumptions and discourses that (re)produce the status quo, and suggest ways forward for more political, inclusive agendas,\" Joshi writes.</p><p>The FPE approach focuses on three main pillars: gendered power relations, historical awareness and scale integration. The first refers to the inter-relations and inequalities on the basis of gender and other factors of social differentiation that shape rights to resources, decision-making, labour, and more that critically influence natural resource management.</p><p>Historical awareness means recognizing that current patterns of resource use and management can't be understood within the historical social, economic, political, and ecological contexts within which they are embedded. Scale integration refers to the fact that local resource management strategies are a function of factors (such as institutions) that go far beyond the local scale, such as international agendas, national policies, markets and commodity prices.</p><p>\"We conclude that much needs to change to address the systemic fault lines that create exclusions in restoration policies and practice, and to legitimize the plural voices, values, meanings and situated knowledge of what makes the environment or Nature in order to sustainably transform degraded landscapes,\" they write.</p><p>None of this undermines the importance of applied ecological science in restoration initiatives: the understanding of ecosystem function, interactions between diverse species ranging from fungi to trees, and the importance of biodiversity in restoration are all key to successful restoration.</p><p>\"But the dominance of the natural sciences over the social sciences in the field of restoration results in a framing of restoration as a primarily technical issue, rather than as a socio-ecological issue with multiple, intricately intertwined dimensions,\" Elias said. \"Ecological outcomes cannot be sustained without addressing social inclusion and equity. The point of restoration is not only to enhance ecosystem services, but to ensure the ecological, social, economic, cultural, and other functions that landscapes under restoration provide to improve human wellbeing.\"</p><p>(Eurasia Review)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Forest restoration is one of the priority areas for mitigating the effects of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Restoration and sustainable management of forests will help absorb atmospheric pollutants, re-build natural habitats and sustain life on earth. This blog discusses Sri Lanka's declining forest cover and offers suggestions on how the drivers of deforestation can be countered.</p><p>Sri Lanka's declining forest coverSri Lanka is endowed with a diverse range of forest ecosystems thanks to different topographic, climatic and soil conditions. Dry monsoon forests, lowland rain forests, moist monsoon forests, montane forests, riverine dry forests, savanna and mangrove forests are the major types of forests found in the country.</p><p>However, recent technical reports and mainstream media reports both signal a rapid increase in deforestation and degradation of forests in Sri Lanka. An estimated 70% of the island was covered with forests at the beginning of the 19th century, which has since reduced to 29.7% (1.95 million hectares) in 2017. Figures from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) suggest that in 2020, the forest cover has further reduced to 28.39% (1.86 million hectares) of the entire land area (Figure 1).</p><p>n estimated -3.16% change in forest area has been observed during the period from 2015-2020. Primary forests are the most affected forest types. In 1999, the island had been covered by 257,000 hectares of primary forests whereas in 2020, only 167,000 hectares remained.</p><p> A new study conducted by Rathnayake, J. and Soto-Berelov (2020) which employs satellite data analysis confirms the disturbances to the protected areas (see Figure 2).</p><p> Red dots on the protected areas provide evidence of deforestation taking place within the protected areas. Drivers of deforestationA detailed account of the drivers of deforestation in Sri Lanka is published in a report under the UN-REDD program in 2015. The report identifies the catalysts of deforestation from past, present and future perspectives.</p><p> Most of the drivers are socio-economic in nature.In the current context, land encroachment, development projects and expansion of private agricultural ventures are the main proximate drivers of deforestation.</p><p> People encroach protected areas for agricultural and mining activities. With population growth, local demand for land and field crops as well as global demand for export crops and aquaculture products (,shrimps etc.</p><p>) rise. Hence, people who are pressurised by these drivers along with severe land scarcity, encroach into protected areas.</p><p>On the other hand, government policy objectives to increase local agricultural production and reduce agricultural imports such as sugar and milk also lead to an expansion of agricultural ventures. Besides, demand for precious stones like gems accelerates the degradation of forests through encroachment for mining activities.</p><p> Infrastructure development is another driver of deforestation and degradation of forests.Examples are projects on urban development, resettlements, tourism, livelihood development, infrastructure development like roads, highways and airports and voltage transmission lines.</p><p> Moreover, local demand for timber from both households and industry contributes to the illicit felling of trees. The way forwardStrengthening environmental safeguard measures: The incoherence in existing policies on forest conservation along with new initiatives to expand agricultural production or other development projects can encourage encroachments and deforestation.</p><p> For instance, in 2020, Sri Lanka cancelled three circulars that protected 700,000 hectares of forests recognised as other State forests.These areas are not classified as protected areas, yet account for 5% of the remaining forest cover.</p><p> At present, protected areas are being managed by two agencies with limited integrationthe Forest Department and Department of Wildlife Conservation with different official mandates, yet required to combine efforts to protect forest areas and their biodiversity. Therefore, the government should take necessary action to strengthen environmental safeguards associated with development programs and carry out monitoring activities.</p><p>wareness creation: Awareness creation can be an effective initiative with long-lasting impacts on forest restoration and conservation. On many occasions, people do not recognise the importance of multiple ecosystem services offered by protected areas and push for harnessing short-term economic benefits alone.</p><p> Thus, greater awareness initiated by both private and public entities would ensure a sustainable use of forest lands through restoration and reduced disturbances.Participatory approach: Public, private and community partnerships are essential for sustainably managing protected areas.</p><p> Private ventures can adhere to minimal deforestation policies or implement offset policies such as replanting. Communities can initiate partnerships with public and private authorities to carry out replanting programs.</p><p> Such programs can be further developed as social ventures like the Smallholder Farmers Alliance (SFA), a non-profit social venture in Haiti, which planted five million trees to offset the severe deforestation rates in the country.Reforestation: Replanting endangered and endogenous species in degraded natural forests and private lands would support the reforestation efforts.</p><p>Promote substitutes for timber: Substitutes for timber such as aluminium, steel and processed wood from sources like bamboo should be promoted. However, these substitutes should not harm the environment.</p><p>Innovative agriculture: Development of agroforestry models, increased tree cover of non-forest lands and sustainable management of plantations would minimise the pressure on forest lands. These interventions would ensure the sustainable utilisation of forest ecosystems supporting the reforestation efforts as well.</p><p> (Link to original blog on Talking Economics: a)  (Ruwan Samaraweera is a Research Officer at IPS, with a background in entrepreneurial agriculture.

Fernando's belief in the purpose of business is reflected in his philosophy that 'business is a matter of human service'. He embedded that into the foundation of his business when he launched his brand and began a multi-generational and uncompromising commitment to a new way of doing business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When Dilmah was first born in 1988, it was the first time a tea grower had offered his produce to the world, direct and genuinely ethical. The paradigm shift that Dilmah represents has delivered over Rs. 5 billion of humanitarian benefit through the work of its MJF Foundation, and over Rs. 500 million for Dilmah Conservation's environmental interventions.</p><p>Dilmah Tea was awarded the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, with their independent panel of judges assessing the company's commitment to quality, tradition, customer, employees, innovation, ethics, integrity, and sustainability. As a family-owned tea company, the sustainable development of Dilmah's plantations - its community and environment - is integral towards creating long-term value.</p><p>Currently, residents of 16 estates in Kahawatte plantation, 16 estates in Talawakelle plantation, 13 estates in Elpitiya plantations, and Dunkeld Estate have benefited from initiatives related to healthcare, housing, infrastructure, and education. The Dilmah Plantation action plan for 2021-2025 is a Rs. 200 million initiative embracing education, entrepreneurship, climate resilience, nutrition, childcare amongst other areas.</p><p>Merrill J. Fernando is an ordinary Sri Lankan and his achievement in founding a company and integrating principles of sustainability into its core at a time the world was yet to understand sustainability, was visionary. The viability of a business today depends on using resources from healthy ecosystems and on the stability of a just society.</p><p>To ensure that economic, social, and environmental sustainability exists at the heart of its operations, Dilmah established the Merrill J. Fernando Charitable Foundation (MJF Foundation) and Dilmah Conservation to drive life-impacting initiatives ('Purpose Beyond Profit' is a free e-book, giving an overview of the overwhelming impact made through the two organisations).</p><p>The MJF Foundation works directly with estate workers and underprivileged communities to uplift lives and empowers them to pay-it-forward to their communities. Some of its core initiatives are the countrywide MJF centres, small-medium enterprises with over 2,000 small entrepreneurs, 'Empower' Culinary  and  Hospitality school, and 'disABILITY' teletherapy app.</p><p>The MJFCF scholarship program has currently awarded 425 scholarships including 262 scholarships for university education empowering children in plantations to enter university and has succeeded in producing doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers, and several other professionals.</p><p>The Foundation has improved the quality of life for plantation workers, residents, and the surrounding communities by establishing new housing, medical centres, and care for the entire resident population of the estates, pre-schools at 63 Child Development Centres, after-school programs, and nutrition programs.</p><p>The sustainable development of the plantations and people cannot be separated from the environment. Tea plantations situated in Sri Lanka's wet zone region are among the first places expected to be impacted by climate change. Focusing on conservation efforts that will directly benefit the environment, people, and wildlife that co-exist with them, Dilmah Conservation (DC) influences over 8,000 new individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices each year. DC is keen on providing nature-based solutions and has delivered 12 such initiatives.</p><p>Among these are the recently concluded one million cashew planting that annually feeds Rs. 2 billion into Sri Lanka's Eastern economy, energy usage reduction initiatives, organic practices that increase agricultural productivity of the lands, construction of nature corridors that increase the biodiversity of Dilmah's estates, green recovery programs for plantation habitat revival, and use of smart tools such as resource-efficient hydroponics for sustainable agriculture.</p><p>The reach of Dilmah's environmental arm extends beyond Colombo to include several initiatives that are among the first to be established by a private company such as a dedicated climate change research centre, urban arboretum, and open-air butterfly garden. As a commitment to a truly sustainable vision, Dilmah Conservation has further blazed a trail in the corporate sector by promoting sustainable beekeeping, home gardening, climate-smart irrigation, and diversification of monoculture with a key focus on educating the public.</p><p>Understanding the importance of SDG 17: partnering for sustainable development goals, Dilmah has pioneered and led the way in corporate advocacy, engaging the corporate sector towards building a better planet through its initiated Biodiversity Sri Lanka - a national platform that aids businesses in finding solutions to adjust their activities to ensure fair income and sustainable growth while benefiting biodiversity and ecosystems. Dilmah further complies with UN Global Compact Guiding Principles, embedding them in its business strategies.</p><p>The 2021-2025 Dilmah Plantation Action plan will revive the plantation community in 16 Estates that form a part of primarily Dilmah-owned Kahawatte Plantations, Talawakelle, and Elpitiya Plantations. The action plan will bear a holistic framework aimed at elevating the community members' physical, mental, and emotional well-being and socioeconomic status.</p><p>The areas of focus are gender and women, youth, education, health and wellbeing, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), climate-smart agriculture including agroforestry, adopting Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) as plantation best practices, water, climate change, livelihoods, and entrepreneurship. Over 138,415 people in the plantations are expected to benefit from the programs.</p><p>Winning the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Award 2020 is considered a top honour in the Sri Lankan corporate field.

Brazil, China, India, and South Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consequently, a number of management options are being implemented in these countries to reduce their environmental impacts. In several tropical countries, eucalypts are being raised as a constituent of mixed species agroforestry stands (as opposed to large-scale monoculture plantations) thus providing benefits to smallholder farmers.</p><p>However, the Forest Department of Sri Lanka, having raised monocultures of Caribbean pine and Australian eucalypt plantations in denuded and infertile landscape so successfully for over half a century or more, has been somewhat reluctant still to yield to the conservationists' and environmentalists' pressures. This is mainly due to the repeated failures and setbacks in their past approaches with native species restoration and possibly inadequacy of knowledge and training in ecological restoration methodology.</p><p>The primary reason for past failures in raising mixed native species plantations was that the native species selected for restoration were mostly from among mature phase canopy species of the respective forest type. Seedlings or saplings of these canopy species are ecologically ill-adapted to establish themselves in larger forest openings resulting from deforestation. Furthermore, these forest gaps often get quickly overgrown with shade intolerant and faster growing pioneers and climbers smothering the advance regeneration of the saplings. Even though seed sources are available within the surrounding degraded forest landscape, the natural regeneration of mature phase native species has been painstakingly slow for these reasons.</p><p>At the same time, most of the fernlands and grasslands in these regions are maintained by frequent human-induced fires during short-dry periods each year. Consequently, the natural successional trajectories towards reaching a climatic climax of a natural forest are almost completely stalled in them.</p><p>Pines and eucalypts with their superlative ability to tolerate strong sunlight and poor soil conditions as seedlings/saplings show impressive growth as compared with native canopy species of the mature forests. This is clearly evident from the research trials being conducted by the Forest Department in Welanhinna (near Welimada) and Conical Hill Forest Reserve in Nuwara Eliya comparing the growth of exotic eucalypts vs. native forest canopy species of those climatic regions.</p><p>A recent research article published in the Journal of Applied Ecology (<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13513\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13513</url> [2020]) has reported some very relevant findings using exotic eucalypts globally branded as 'demons' or 'devils' in the Atlantic Forests of Brazil where selective logging of strips or rows of plantations for timber, bioenergy, pulp and paper, has been able to offset 45% - 75% of restoration implementation and maintenance costs partially overcoming the financial hurdle in undertaking active restoration projects by prospective investors.</p><p>In our own studies in Sri Lanka, equally demonised exotic pines have been used as partners in ecological restoration in the NW buffer zone of Sinharaja World Heritage Site and also in Lower Hantana in Kandy District for about 30 years. This healthy partnership between exotic and native species opens up a conciliatory middle path as the proverbial 'rawulath theagene kendath bema'- i.e., raising exotic and naturalized/native fast-growing plantations (some of which are demonised as invasive), as the first step in forest restoration initiatives. These exotics or naturalised 'nurse' trees can then be replaced sequentially by suitable native species along an ecological successional gradient leading to a successful forest restoration programme.</p><p>In both Sinharaja and Lower Hantana Peradeniya University campus land we have successfully converted pine plantations into native and naturalized plant species of utility value using these successional methods. They are being regularly used for training restoration ecologists and others for over two decades.</p><p>During this 'Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021 - 2030', ecologically driven Forest Landscape Restoration is being promoted as the main driving force for global scale forest restoration. Sri Lanka has pledged to restore 200,000 ha of degraded forests as its 'Nationally Determined Contribution' towards the Bonn Challenge which has set a global target of restoring 350 million ha during this decade. While the monoculture plantations of pines and eucalypts have provided superior growth and impressive timber volumes, the downside is that they are not the best for the provision of enhanced ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement, water and soil conservation, reduction of fire and landslide hazards and amelioration of the environment. As such, we sincerely hope the Pinus and Eucalypt plantations already established particularly in critical watersheds in Sri Lanka would be given a high priority in systematically converting them to native species using sound ecological principles with a view to increase the ecosystem services they provide to downstream communities.</p><p>Forest landscape restoration can best be done using ecological succession-based principles. One of these is known in silviculture (the science and art of growing and cultivating forest trees, based on a knowledge of their ecological characteristics) as relay floristic method of forest restoration. Both eucalypts and pines are 'early successional' species that have the ability to grow in relatively poor soil and under strong light conditions common in degraded landscapes like cultivated and abandoned pathanagrasslands and kekillafernlands. The other suitable candidates for this step/lap of the relay are Havari nuga, Kenda, Gedumba, Lunu midella, Ipil Ipil, Acacia spp., Caliandra sp. Such common plants can colonize the open and degraded lands rapidly and provide some partial shade facilitating the introduction of native species of the second lap. At the same time, they keep away the aggressive grasses and ferns by providing shade to the ground rather quickly due to their rapid growth.</p><p>The pine and eucalypt stands which have reached maturity in mountain landscapes particularly in the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces can be manipulated by creating appropriately sized openings simulating gaps in natural forests. In native forests, such gaps originate from natural phenomena such as standing tree deaths due to old age, lightning strikes, wind throws and landslides. The native species selected based on their ecological characteristics either as habitat generalists or specialists for each climatic/floristic region can be introduced in successive laps as in a relay in these artificially created gaps in pine stands. Both timber and non-timber species of utility value such as hora, hal, bedi del, yakahalu, dun, nawada, kitul, weniwel, wevel, enasal, thippili, etc. have been introduced in our demonstration restoration trials in Sinharaja (30 years old, now) and Hantana (15 years old, now).</p><p>Unfortunately, despite these pilot-scale successful trials which have the potential for scaling up, there are silvicultural operations going on that are evidently harmful to the environment as in Hirikatu Oya region in Ratnapura forest division. Large scale clear felling of Pinusplantations on steep slopes has resulted in extensive environmental damage not only to the site itself but also to the downstream areas. Subsequent reforestation efforts have not progressed as expected and resulted in heavy gulley erosion and soil degradation.</p><p>There are moves to repeat similar large-scale clear-felling operations in mature pine stands in Diyatalawa-Bandarawela regions. While this is likely to be environmentally harmful as in Hirikatu Oya, it also prevents an excellent opportunity to make these so called 'demonis ed' exotic plantations partnering in systematic conversion of them to native species forests.</p><p>The ecological principles and methods showcased in our demonstration models in Sinharaja and Lower Hantana could be extended to this region, initially as a trial conversion. These mature pine plantations would serve as the first lap in a relay floristic model. The key is to select the right mix of native species for second and third laps of the relay floristic silvicultural succession suitable for this climatic and floristic region. They could include not only woody species but others of traditional utility value such as medicinal, ornamental, artisanal and food value. We are in the process of preparing a list of such potential species for each subsequent lap.</p><p>It is our fervent hope that we learn from the environmentally costly experiments of clear felling of forest plantations in steep slopes as evident from Hirikatu Oya example in Ratnapura/Balangoda forest region and not repeat the same mistake in Diyatalawa/Bandarawela or any other similar landscapes. Proven silvicultural methods such as Relay Floristics methods are available to be adapted to suit the site conditions of this climatic region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM3110202100059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6418-4381-JCH9-G2KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 31, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

With rice being the staple food in the country great importance has always been attached to its cultivation. Nearly 34 percent of the cultivated land in Sri Lanka bears the golden crop. However, for a number of years paddy cultivation and agriculture itself which once flourished on the island has been on the decline for various reasons. Led by the country's youth paddy cultivation is seeing a period of revival as a movement to cultivate fallow paddy fields has spread across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week in a bid to support this movement, the Sri Lanka Army began with harrowing a 12-acre fallow paddy field it owns in the vicinity of its new Headquarters in Akuregoda, Battaramulla. The program was launched as the second phase of the Army's Thuru Mithuru Nawa Ratak - eco-friendly beautifying, afforestation and re-harvesting project which was launched in December led by its Commander and Acting Chief of Defence Staff Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva. The ploughing of the paddy field began after the observance of age-old traditional rituals linked to paddy farming which was attended by the Commander.</p><p>\"In recent times we saw the youth in this country leading the way to cultivate fallow paddy fields,\" he said at the event adding that this movement made the Army decide to re-cultivate the 12-acre plot which has been long abandoned. The project has been put into action through the Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock according to the Commander. \"We are engaging in these projects in addition to the Army's primary duties. We consider this as a service to the country as well,\" the Commander said. Following the ploughing, the Army will sow several indigenous types of paddy in the field.</p><p>In addition, a patch of the same marshy land is expected to be utilised to grow organic vegetables as part of the project. Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock in close cooperation with local state has already selected the plot for this purpose in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and other state, sources from the Army said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Commander also expressed the Army's willingness to assist members of the public seeking to support the movement and cultivate abandoned paddy fields in their area. \"If they request our help, and if it is the kind of support the Army can provide without a hindrance to their regular duties, then we will do so through Army platoons in the area,\" he said.</p><p>As part of the day's events, the Army also planted 140 saplings of endemic trees including Mee, Karanda and Kobo Neela. During the first phase of the program in December, the Army planted 170 frangipani saplings to beautify the 1.5 km stretch from Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha leading to the Sri Lanka Army Headquarters located within the newly constructed Defence Complex.</p><p>According to the Army, the program has been launched inspired by the government's environment-friendly Green Project concept to plant trees and establish urban forests, green paths, green roofs and agroforestry systems as set out in the Saubhagye Dekma policy statement.The Army will also continue to expand its beautification and reforestation parts of the project.

But towards the end of the journey, after a sharp turn at the village of Wepathana, we changed vehicles at a forested nook. Aboard an open-backed 4WD, we rumbled to Polwaththa Eco Lodges where hot dinner and lodgings awaited. Not long after, I walked a muddy path by torchlight to an isolated cabana in a forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Left alone, I drank in the surrounding tangle of trees, shrubs and vines shrouded by darkness. Thoughts of the urban jungle and the vicissitudes of the COVID-19 pandemic gave way to delight in the crisp air scented with damp earth, wood and mulch, solitude serenaded by a thousand crickets. Sleep came easily that night, in the wood cabana, cool without fan.</p><p>Polwaththa Eco Lodge is no-frills with 13 cabanas spread out across a five-hectare property. The basics included a double bed, coat rack, torches, drinking water (with free refills in the restaurant),and a spacious room and bathroom with warm solar-heated shower and soap. Each room opens to a patio, with deck chair. Any missing amenities pale into insignificance at the sight of the luxurious Kandyan Forest Garden at your doorstep.</p><p>When proprietor Nihal Ellegala, a Trinitian from Kandy, inherited the property from his father in 1993, it was populated with coconut trees interspersed with fruit, medicinal and other indigenous forest trees and food plants. 'The land conformed to the principles of Kandyan forest garden, an environmentally-friendly polyculture system compared to environmentally-harmful mono-culture systems.We left it alone because we didn't want to disturb the environment,' Nihal said.</p><p>Instead, Nihal and his wife, Nel Kapteyn from Holland, and their son Remon planted more trees and let nature have her way. Some years later, the family built a home on the land, and in 2009, launched Polwaththa Eco Lodges with a single cabana.</p><p>The giving forest</p><p>Forest gardens have been around for millennia worldwide, possibly from an ancient past when man gathered edible plants in the jungle. Over time, this simple arrangement evolved into several agricultural systems, of which the forest garden system allowed man to work with the natural rhythms of the earth, introducing useful and edible plants in a mix that mimicked forest vegetation from ground up. Ecologically, this is the least invasive form of agriculture and low maintenance because its rich biodiversity is largely self-supporting.</p><p>The Kandyan forest garden is a centuries-old system native to the Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces. It has the characteristics of a tropical rain forest, and includes a combination of different tree types such as forest trees, fruit and spice trees, vegetables and yams - to qualify as a Kandyan forest garden, this mix should provide food for a home.</p><p>Polwaththa has a rich mix of medicinal trees, fruit trees like orange and papaya, star fruit, grapefruit and banana and spice trees like cloves, and creepers like passion fruit, pepper, robusta and arabica coffee, and yams like manioc.It is home to wildlife species such as porcupine, barking deer, monkey, giant and flying squirrel and the wild boar with a taste for bread that came right up to the kitchen door for a bite. Nihal says the forest supports 62 species of birds including 17 of the 30-odd species endemic to Sri Lanka.</p><p>Maintaining a forest garden isn't easy, says Remon. Deer and wild boar destroyed hundreds of saplings that Nihal planted until the family came up with a solution - protect the saplings with chicken mesh enclosures that the animals would not be able to break through. Keeping to world standards of sustainable tourism, Polwaththa works closely with neighbouring villages Wepathana and Gomagoda. Ten young men and women, 80 percent of the Lodge staff, are from these villages and from Digana. Handicrafts from the village are sold at the Polwaththa boutique and all groceries are purchased from stores within a radius of five km. Villagers are employed in building projects and consulted on new projects.While I was there, Nihal and some village youths tested a bulk fruit-drying device they had invented themselves: although the first attempt went up in flames, it is successful and four new drying units are being prepared.</p><p>Twenty percent of Polwaththa's profits are channelled back to the villagers through the local temple and school and used for local initiatives; for example, a road was repaired and a dam built for the village, and a group of women were helped to generate an income by sewing items to sell to tourists.</p><p>The Lodge's rustic buildings complement its forest environment. 'Our aim is to provide, besides an enjoyable holiday with a natural rural environment, an experience that uplifts the spirit rather than material comfort,' says Nihal.</p><p>The birth of Bululand</p><p>In 2016, the Ellegalla family went a little further. Nihal in partnership with Dutch agroforestry expert Henk Kieft, purchased a two-hectare plot of denuded forest in the neighbourhood.</p><p>'Nel was upset about the logging going on there for firewood,' said Nihal, adding that he was drawn to the land's stunning lake view. Within three months, 300 new saplings, from large indigenous forest trees to wild flowering trees, fruit trees and coffee had been planted. Today, there are 550 new trees. These reforestation efforts have had 70 percent success, and a lush secondary forest is forming. Nel has named the plot Bululand, after a large bulu tree she loves.</p><p>To generate income for its upkeep, Nihal added a large outdoor yoga and meditation hall and built two more cabanas that would serve as solitary forest retreats on Bululand. One affords a spectacular view of Victoria Lake.</p><p>Importantly, Bululand led to the birth of the Forest Healing Foundation (FHF) of which Henk Kieft is President and Nihal is Secretary.A non-profit organisation, FHF seeks to protect threatened high-biodiversity forests, reforest barren lands and advocate for the value of forests.With Bululand serving as their showpiece, they would like to take their message across Sri Lanka.</p><p>Up until the COVID-19 pandemic this year, Polwaththa Eco Lodges registered an average of 60 percent occupancy, patronised by LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability) travellers and nature lovers interested in community or rural life. Positive reviews have brought them Trip Advisor Certificates of Excellence for four straight years up until 2019. However, business took a dive after the Easter bombings, and COVID-19 struck just as it was beginning to pick up again.</p><p>Yet during lockdown, FHF created educational resources for schools to help children reconnect with nature. Emma Marsden from England, programme coordinator of FHF, said that educational platforms and institutionshad been contacted online and schools will soon be visited.</p><p>This year, Polwaththa Eco Lodge also launched a new line of organic products, Eko Land Produce, with their own spices, and fruit such as jak, wild cinnamon, and vegetables, and spices and fruit purchased from the villages.Robusta and arabica coffee plants are aplenty, and Polwaththa have their own house coffee,Eko Land Produce coffee, a flavourful fusion of robusta and arabica that will soon be sold online.</p><p>It's a simple, mindful existence here, says Nihal, adding he would like more Sri Lankans and expatriates to visit to experience the wholesome,rural way of life that strikes a healthy balance between community and environment.</p><p>Useful links</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.polwaththa-ecolodges.com\">https://www.polwaththa-ecolodges.com</url>/</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foresthealingsrilanka.org\">https://www.foresthealingsrilanka.org</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNTIM-SUNTM02082020000536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNTIM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-MCJ1-JCH9-G21P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416463</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1279\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 2, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DKUI</classCode><className>WATER RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX309</classCode><className>COLOMBO, SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC381</classCode><className>SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Partnering with The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), Sri Lanka's foremost provider of integrated sustainability solutions, Ansell recently launched an agroforestry project to create a biodiversity corridor connecting Haycock and Dunawala, two separate and protected rainforests in the southern region of the island.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 'Ansell Bio-Link', as the project is called, will be validated and certified under ISO 14064-2 and will become Sri Lanka's first forestry project to be certified under this standard and also the country's first carbon insetting project. Carbon insetting, an innovative carbon emissions reduction methodology, is gaining awareness especially among European brands such as Chanel, Nespresso and L'Oreal which have embarked on major carbon insetting projects at global locations within their supply chains.</p><p>'On behalf of the 4,500 Ansell employees and their families living in Sri Lanka and our stakeholders worldwide, we are proud to support the creation of the Ansell Bio-Link,' said Darryl Nazareth, Senior Vice President, Global Operations and R and D, who signed the agreement with CCC on behalf of Ansell. 'Ansell continues to work towards reducing its environmental impact through climate efficiency, identified as one of the key Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations.'</p><p>Two thousand trees will be planted during the first year of the project and 1,000 trees each year afterwards, for a minimum of five years. The species of trees planted within the Ansell Bio-Link will be predominantly native and endemic rainforest trees.</p><p>To mark the signing agreement, a ceremonial planting of 'Indian Beech' saplings took place at the Ansell Biyagama plant premises as well as at one of the selected project sites.</p><p>CCC CEO Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne remarked, 'The devastating floods that many Sri Lankans had to face only a few months ago, and the severe droughts that many parts of the country are currently experiencing, serve as dire warnings of the dangers of Climate Change through causes such as deforestation. The accelerated rate of deforestation has to be curtailed at all costs. This is where companies can come in to fulfil one aspect of their corporate environmental responsibility. We are encouraged that a global protection company such as Ansell has chosen to focus their efforts here in Sri Lanka and are proud to partner with them in this great initiative.'</p><p>Benefits of carbon insetting: Tackling environmental and social challenges</p><p>Unlike traditional carbon offsetting, carbon insetting takes a holistic approach, addressing both environmental and social challenges, including poverty in rural communities. This particular project involves local smallholder farmers who will be compensated to plant and maintain the trees within the Ansell Bio-Link. To generate extra income for the project participants, 25 percent of the trees planted will constitute 'non-timber forest products' (NTFP) as well.</p><p>Additionally, CCC will coordinate training for the farmers on additional income generation related to agroforestry, such as organic farming, beekeeping, composting, plant budding and nursery management, and support the creation of a Community Based Organisation to enable the farmers to sell their NTFP. Through this project, CCC estimates that the average income of farmers in the Ansell Bio-Link area will increase by 10 to 15% annually.</p><p>In addition to reforestation, the Ansell Bio-Link will support additional positive benefits to the rainforest ecosystem, including improved soil, water and air quality, the prevention of soil erosion, and watershed protection.</p><p>'Ansell is investing in this initiative because it sees carbon insetting as a smart environmental choice,' concluded Darryl Nazareth. 'The trees will offset manufacturing emissions and add to the preservation of natural resources in Sri Lanka, and at the same time help farmers with better land, ecosystems, and revenues.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT0811201700052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PX4-TD51-JCH9-G2HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 8, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00024UV</classCode><className>L'OREAL SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2844 PERFUMES, COSMETICS, &amp;

The State Secretary for the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment Mapa Pathirana, Director - Forest Resources Latheefa P. Liyanage, Conservator of Forests P.A.G.S. Nandakumara and many distinguished guests including high ranking officers of Sri Lanka Army were also present at the occasion.</p><p>This project has been launched in parallel to the World Environment Day and in addition, a program is in place to plant trees along the sides of Megoda Kelaniya Road by National Savings Bank under the guidance of Keleniya Raja Maha Vihara.</p><p>With a view to contributing to the national and global course of environmental conservation, National Savings Bank has launched the NSB Agroforestry Project under which, 26,000 and 76,000 plants with an economic value have been distributed among the customers respectively on the World Thrift Day in 2017 and 1 January 2019. Further, vegetable seeds were distributed under the theme, 'A Picturesque Garden - A Robust Economy' in commemoration of World Thrift Day, 2018 while plants were distributed among the customers in line with the auspicious time declared for planting trees for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, 2019.</p><p>Deforestation is one of the gravest environmental issues that we have encountered during the past few years in Sri Lanka. The current forest cover in the country is approximately 29.7% which needs to be increased to 32% by 2030 and to achieve this target, it is imperative to grow trees in an additional area of 145,000 hectares. National Savings Bank, the premier savings bank in the country, looks forward to ensuring its maximum contribution to achieve this purpose by implementing many more projects of this nature in future to build an evergreen environment for the future generations of the country.</p><p>National Savings Bank invites all of you to join hands with them to save with care.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT1007201900028</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-X4V1-JCH9-G55N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

The company's dedication towards the well-being of our environment was highlighted in the efforts made to bring the essence of this day to both their clients and employees.</p><p>They handed off the green to their workforce on 5 June during the plant distribution event at the World Environment Day celebrations at JLanka Technologies. The celebrations focused on a wide array of environment-related concerns with a touch of the immense contributions of solar power to uphold the cause. The theme was in line with that of the global World Environment Day celebrations this year.</p><p>Their clients too were encouraged to carry out a noble act to cherish the spirits of the day by holding a photography competition via the company's official Facebook Fanpage. The best photo of a tree planted commemorating World Environment Day 2019, was to be awarded a special discount on a solar power system purchased from the company.</p><p>The United Nations is well aware that the protection and improvement of the human environment is a major issue, which affects the well-being of people and economic development throughout the world. They've designated 5 June as World Environmental Day to provide a chance to take responsibility for the conduct of individuals, enterprises and communities to direct themselves to preserve and enhance the environment. Since 1974, it has grown into a global platform for public outreach. UN Environment Program (UNEP, or UN Environment) organises events for World Environment Day, shedding light on all aspects of our environment. In 2019, China will host the global World Environment Day celebrations with 'Air Pollution' as the theme.</p><p>World Environment Day is the ideal exposure for environmental savvy decisions. This year's theme urges all to strongly adjust our lives to reduce the intoxication due to air pollution of our home Earth. Approximately seven million people die prematurely each year from air pollution, while four million of these occur in Asia-Pacific. World Environment Day 2019 will urge governments, communities, industries and individuals to explore renewable energy and green technologies, and improve air quality in cities across the world.</p><p>International studies on forest effects on air quality and human health, have discovered that certain toxic substances, are retained on tree surfaces, while leaves act as filters, absorbing polluting gases. However, the deposition of air pollutants on leaves hinders photosynthesis. In hot climates, tree cover can reduce energy expenditure on air conditioning, in turn driving down the consumption of fossil fuel. Investigations and modelling studies have shown that shade from trees can reduce the air conditioning expenses of detached houses by 20%-30%. Trees could reduce temperatures in cities up to 8\u00b0C, lowering use of air conditioning and related emissions by up to 40% according to Simone Borelli, an Agroforestry and Urban/Periurban Forestry Officer with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. JLanka Technologies had been influential in setting a trend in the domestic solar technology market showcasing how to 'Redefine Renewable Energy' in Sri Lanka. The tree planting creates a sense of responsibility in the society about safeguarding the atmosphere and environment and adjusting ourselves to an eco-friendly lifestyle. The success of their efforts have been revealed via statistics such as having planted over a 54,000 trees within a year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT0407201900041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGR-2K51-F00C-62WB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 4, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Combatting climate change is a collective global responsibility and with our industry, we believe that it is ultimately the RPC sector which will pave the way for a new chapter in the plantation industry, both locally and globally.</p><p>\"As our efforts in this field intensify, Bogawantalawa Tea is now racing towards Climate Positive status, and we believe that the potential exists for the entire RPC sector to learn from our experiences and adapt their business models accordingly. While it will require significant investment and effort, we believe that there is an extremely compelling economic and environmental case in favour of climate positive business models.</p><p>\"The effects of climate change and global warming are clear to see across the world and are growing increasingly severe with each passing year. As a major agricultural entity, we cannot stand idly by and allow business to continue as usual while the fate of future generations is in major jeopardy. We want to set an example which will be emulated not just across the industry but throughout the country.\" Bogawantalawa Tea Ceylon, General Manager of Sustainability and R&amp;#38;D, Thusitha Bandara</p><p>Comprehensive carbon audit</p><p>BTE and Bogawantalawa Tea Ceylon (Pvt) Ltd. (BTC) were certified Carbon Neutral by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund, which operates under the Ministry of Environment. Assessment was carried out over Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions.</p><p>This required major revisions not only to operational procedures at the estate level but also at the company's Colombo facilities, where it took stock of every aspect of the business from packing materials to sourcing.</p><p>Where the scope of a typical tea company's carbon emissions audit would be limited to the estate, BTE extended the range of its audit right up to the point where their tea reaches the port. A comprehensive list of emissions sources are factored into BTE's analysis - including everything from emissions generated via production of fertilizer and agro-chemicals to transmission loss of electricity to factories. Going beyond rudimentary analysis however, BTE also factors in transport, and even travel of overseas business visitors within the scope of their audit. In order to maintain complete transparency, the company shares the entire set of details around its CO2 audit as part of its regular stakeholder reporting.</p><p>Maintaining Carbon Neutral status and shifting towards being a Climate Positive tea grower, manufacturer and marketer have required both BTE and BTM to maintain extremely rigid standards and controls across the company's entire value chain, developed in alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>These strategies encompass renewable energy, energy management, plantation forestry, conservation forestry, social forestry, organic farming, use of bio-fertilizers, organic pesticides, water and waste footprint management, sustainable soil development, eco designing and climate action.</p><p>A progressive approach agriculture techniques</p><p>Progressive soil management techniques are fundamental to the continuing success of BTE's approach. Notably, BTE has successfully developed its own inorganic &amp;#38; organic fertilisers, which serve to protect and enhance soil physical, chemical and biological properties.</p><p>It complements the use of these breakthrough fertilisers with internally developed organic pesticides for which BTE's dedicated research and development cell is currently working to patent and upscale to the level of commercial production. Combined with soil mapping techniques that determine individual fertilizer requirements for each field, BTE is able to ensure optimal nourishment uptake with unprecedented precision.</p><p>In addition to developing its own products, the company's strategy of integrated pest and disease management augments biological controls together with shade and ground cover management to ensure that its crop is kept healthy while avoiding excessive inorganic inputs.</p><p>BTE also optimizes water management through techniques such as drip irrigation, moisture conservation, large-scale rainwater harvesting and together with a host of measures aimed at conserving the company's water footprint and even extending into awareness building programmes at the community level.</p><p>Efficiency and renewable energy</p><p>In addition to optimizing electricity usage, BTE has also invested significantly in harnessing of renewable energy such as hydro and solar. Currently, the company generates a collective 12 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy through 2GWh of solar and 10 GWh of hydropower. Over the medium term, the company is working to rapidly upscale renewable energy capacity with a potential 41 GWhs through expansions of existing solar and hydropower and the introduction of new wind energy leading to even greater carbon sinking capacity. This investment in renewable energy sources will help BTE to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 30,088-tonnes.</p><p>Trees for the future</p><p>BTE's agroforestry activities also contribute significantly to long-term sustainable development within both the community and its estates. It attains this through plantation forestry, social forestry and conservation forestry programmes.</p><p>With its plantation forestry work, BTE has initiated commercial-scale planting and harvesting projects. Its central nursery, currently Sri Lana's largest timber nursery, grows 200,000 seedlings of varying varieties such as timber, firewood, herbs and fruit plants each year. Moreover, as part of its Agroforestry efforts, BTE aims to plant one million trees by 2020. It is steadily approaching this goal, having already planted 600,000 trees.</p><p>Furthermore, BTE shares the benefits of its planting programmes with the community, distributing planting materials as well as its fruit, herb and native species of plants, which are presented free of charge. Special emphasis is placed on schoolchildren looking after these plants, with each plant given a name and a child tasked with the responsibility of looking after it. These initiatives go a long way in aiding the enrichment of community gardens through the promotion of organic vegetable farming.</p><p>The company's commitment to social conservation and plantation forestry is reflected by its significant investment in these causes, which amounts to between Rs. 20 million and Rs. 25 million annually. These investments are channelled into conservation of sensitive areas, biodiversity enrichment, watershed conservation, together with training and awareness building programmes.</p><p>At the level of social forestry, BTE also distributes planting material and runs planting programmes that are open to the public. These forums focus on promoting organic vegetable farming and the enrichment of home gardens.</p><p>Growing global recognition</p><p>Given the unprecedented innovations taking place at Bogawantalawa Tea Estates, the company has already been certified to the highest international accredited standards in terms of sustainability, food hygiene and ethics, and is rapidly gaining global attention for its pioneering work. All its estates in the Central Province's Golden Valley are Rainforest Alliance, Ethical Tea Partnership, Fairtrade, ISO 22000:2005 and ISO 9001:2008 certified.</p><p>BTE claimed the prize for New Sustainable Product at the Sustainable Food Awards in Amsterdam last year.

For the producer of some of the country's finest tea, this means a rapid migration towards official Climate Positive status - the point at which it will go beyond just achieving net zero carbon emissions and actually begin removing additional carbon dioxide from the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The journey towards this objective is now firmly underway, with the scope of the company's environmental efforts spanning all of BTE's units.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bogawantalawa Tea Ceylon General Manager (Sustainability and R and D) Thusitha Bandara said: 'As the first tea company to be formally certified as Uncompensated Carbon Neutral, we can state with confidence that there is incredible potential in the Sri Lankan Regional Plantation Company (RPC) sector to set a new global standard for the plantation industry. Combatting climate change is a collective global responsibility and with our industry, we believe that it is ultimately the RPC sector which will pave the way for a new chapter in the plantation industry, both locally and globally.</p><p>'As our efforts in this field intensify, Bogawantalawa Tea is now racing towards Climate Positive status, and we believe that the potential exists for the entire RPC sector to learn from our experiences and adapt their business models accordingly. While it will require significant investment and effort, we believe that there is an extremely compelling economic and environmental case in favour of climate positive business models.</p><p>'The effects of climate change and global warming are clear to see across the world and are growing increasingly severe with each passing year. As a major agricultural entity, we cannot stand idly by and allow business to continue as usual while the fate of future generations is in major jeopardy. We want to set an example which will be emulated not just across the industry but throughout the country.'</p><p>Comprehensive carbon audit</p><p>BTE and Bogawantalawa Tea Ceylon Ltd. (BTC) were certified Carbon Neutral by the Sri Lanka Climate Fund, which operates under the Ministry of Environment. Assessment was carried out over Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions.</p><p>This required major revisions not only to operational procedures at the estate level but also at the company's Colombo facilities, where it took stock of every aspect of the business from packing materials to sourcing.</p><p>Where the scope of a typical tea company's carbon emissions audit would be limited to the estate, BTE extended the range of its audit right up to the point where their tea reaches the port. A comprehensive list of emissions sources are factored into BTE's analysis - including everything from emissions generated via production of fertiliser and agro-chemicals to transmission loss of electricity to factories. Going beyond rudimentary analysis however, BTE also factors in transport, and even travel of overseas business visitors within the scope of their audit. In order to maintain complete transparency, the company shares the entire set of details around its CO2 audit as part of its regular stakeholder reporting.</p><p>Maintaining Carbon Neutral status and shifting towards being a Climate Positive tea grower, manufacturer and marketer have required both BTE and BTM to maintain extremely rigid standards and controls across the company's entire value chain, developed in alignment with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>These strategies encompass renewable energy, energy management, plantation forestry, conservation forestry, social forestry, organic farming, use of bio-fertilisers, organic pesticides, water and waste footprint management, sustainable soil development, eco designing and climate action.</p><p>A progressive approach in agriculture techniques</p><p>Progressive soil management techniques are fundamental to the continuing success of BTE's approach. Notably, BTE has successfully developed its own inorganic  and organic fertilisers, which serve to protect and enhance soil physical, chemical and biological properties.</p><p>It complements the use of these breakthrough fertilisers with internally developed organic pesticides for which BTE's dedicated research and development cell is currently working to patent and upscale to the level of commercial production. Combined with soil mapping techniques that determine individual fertiliser requirements for each field, BTE is able to ensure optimal nourishment uptake with unprecedented precision.</p><p>In addition to developing its own products, the company's strategy of integrated pest and disease management augments biological controls together with shade and ground cover management to ensure that its crop is kept healthy while avoiding excessive inorganic inputs.</p><p>BTE also optimises water management through techniques such as drip irrigation, moisture conservation, large-scale rainwater harvesting and together with a host of measures aimed at conserving the company's water footprint and even extending into awareness building programmes at the community level.</p><p>Efficiency and renewable energy</p><p>In addition to optimising electricity usage, BTE has also invested significantly in harnessing of renewable energy such as hydro and solar. Currently, the company generates a collective 12 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy through 2GWh of solar and 10GWh of hydropower. Over the medium term, the company is working to rapidly upscale renewable energy capacity with a potential 41 GWhs through expansions of existing solar and hydropower and the introduction of new wind energy leading to even greater carbon sinking capacity. This investment in renewable energy sources will help BTE to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 30,088-tonnes.</p><p>Trees for the future</p><p>BTE's agroforestry activities also contribute significantly to long-term sustainable development within both the community and its estates. It attains this through plantation forestry, social forestry and conservation forestry programmes.</p><p>With its plantation forestry work, BTE has initiated commercial-scale planting and harvesting projects. Its central nursery, currently Sri Lana's largest timber nursery, grows 200,000 seedlings of varying varieties such as timber, firewood, herbs and fruit plants each year. Moreover, as part of its Agroforestry efforts, BTE aims to plant one million trees by 2020. It is steadily approaching this goal, having already planted 600,000 trees.</p><p>Furthermore, BTE shares the benefits of its planting programmes with the community, distributing planting materials as well as its fruit, herb and native species of plants, which are presented free of charge. Special emphasis is placed on schoolchildren looking after these plants, with each plant given a name and a child tasked with the responsibility of looking after it. These initiatives go a long way in aiding the enrichment of community gardens through the promotion of organic vegetable farming.</p><p>The company's commitment to social conservation and plantation forestry is reflected by its significant investment in these causes, which amounts to between Rs. 20 million and Rs. 25 million annually. These investments are channelled into conservation of sensitive areas, biodiversity enrichment, watershed conservation, together with training and awareness building programmes.</p><p>At the level of social forestry, BTE also distributes planting material and runs planting programmes that are open to the public. These forums focus on promoting organic vegetable farming and the enrichment of home gardens.</p><p>Growing global recognition</p><p>Given the unprecedented innovations taking place at Bogawantalawa Tea Estates, the company has already been certified to the highest international accredited standards in terms of sustainability, food hygiene and ethics, and is rapidly gaining global attention for its pioneering work. All its estates in the Central Province's Golden Valley are Rainforest Alliance, Ethical Tea Partnership, Fairtrade, ISO 22000:2005 and ISO 9001:2008 certified.</p><p>BTE claimed the prize for New Sustainable Product at the Sustainable Food Awards in Amsterdam last year. This success caught the attention of Nina Pullman, a respected freelance journalist for the Guardian in the UK and the Deputy Editor of Fresh Produce Journal, who travelled to the Golden Valley for a story which was published in the reputed Huffington Post of the UK.</p><p>Bogawantalawa Estates was also declared a Green World Ambassador and presented with a World Green Apple Award in the F and B at a prestigious ceremony held in the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYFIN-DFT2803201900037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRV-2251-JCH9-G3GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416461</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1456\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Wijeya Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Financial Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000D2HL</classCode><className>BOGAWANTALAWA TEA ESTATES PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS311920 COFFEE &amp;

Key issues of technology development have been:</p><p>* To optimise the quantity and application of organic manure. A close integration of crop production and animal husbandry and the systematic recycling of organic waste are basic elements.</p><p>* To improve organic waste processing techniques to obtain high quality manure. Through composting of animal and plant residues losses in the humification process are minimized and a higher proportion of the solid humus fraction is achieved.</p><p>The composting process</p><p>Long and diversified crop rotations and legume cropping are further characteristics of Organic Agriculture that help to increase SOC.</p><p>In conventional agriculture, conservation tillage is largely promoted as a measure to sequester carbon dioxide.</p><p>This technology combines minimum tillage with organic covers, herbicides and often herbicide resistant GMO crops.</p><p>Both of the last two are prohibited in organic agriculture. Latest research results revealed that gains in soil organic carbon have been overestimated and are partly or completely offset by increased N2O emissions.</p><p>Thus it can be concluded that minimum tillage combined with mineral fertilizer application compares less well with Organic Agriculture if the focus is on GHGs in general rather than considering carbon sequestration alone. The task of Organic Agriculture will be to integrate conservation tillage in a way that negative effects are avoided.</p><p>Agroforesty - a management system that integrates trees in the agricultural landscape - is another technology that is systematically applied in Organic Agriculture. It is a feasible method to succeed shifting cultivation systems but also to improve and add value to low productive cropland.</p><p>Agroforestry holds the biggest potential of agricultural carbon sequestration in tropical countries.</p><p>It is worth noting that the sequestration of carbon, i.e., an increase of soil organic matter is also leading to more fertile soils, better water retention capacity and reduced nutrient leakage.

There is now proof that the multiple effects of Global Warming could have serious effects that may in the distant future, lead to the extinction of life on the Planet. Scientists have evidence to believe that this has happened in the past - as in the sudden disappearance of the Dinosaurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experts from the University of Exeter, warn Earth's climate has hit more than half of the tipping points identified a decade ago as points of no return for climate change.</p><p>Lead author of the report Tim Lenton says the growing threat of rapid, irreversible changes means it is no longer responsible to wait and see. The situation is urgent and we need an emergency response. The tipping points according to the report include reductions in the size of the Amazon rain forest and the great ice sheets of Antarctica. While sections of the US and its President Donald Trump continue to firmly deny climate change, the rest of the world has begun to take the threat much more seriously.</p><p>Anxiety is growing globally that governments are not doing enough to reach the Paris Agreement's target of curbing emissions sufficiently to keep temperature rises to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels and 28-nation EU says it wants to be at the forefront of action. Reuters reported on Friday that in Europe the EU (European Union) executive will propose by March 2020 a new climate law to turn the bloc neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 and help lead the struggle against global warming.</p><p>Last week also saw hundreds of thousands of young people who have taken to the streets from Manila to Copenhagen as part of the latest student climate strikes to demand radical action on the unfolding ecological emergency. School and university students around the world walked out of lessons on Friday with large turnouts in Madrid, where world leaders will gather on Monday for the latest UN climate summit, and Sydney, where protesters demanded action following devastating wildfires.</p><p>Friday's action comes after more alarming news on the scale and scope of the climate crisis. This week scientists warned the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points posing an \"existential threat to civilisation\". Two days earlier a separate study from the UN's World Meteorological Organization revealed that the concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere had hit a record high.</p><p>But there are divisions. Some EU countries dependent on coal for energy oppose the 2050 carbon neutral target, saying they need help transforming energy production. To win them over, the Commission, whose proposed laws require consent of members and the European Parliament, wants to create a \"just transition fund\" to wean economies off coal.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, many of us remain complacent, living in a country that has more or less a stable climate throughout the year. We have no volcanoes and by and large have been lucky to have escaped the effects of hurricanes, whirlwinds and the likes. Yet, more recently our country has been subject to severe unseasonal rainfall, deluge, floods, landslides and long droughts, which are now becoming frequent occurrences.</p><p>Floods and landslides caused by torrential rainfalls during September 2019, The monsoon floods affected 13 districts and in its wake left at least two persons dead, while injuring six and another approximately 116,000 people displaced. Between December 22 and 23, 2018 saw more than 250mm of rain to the Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts. By January 6, 2019, more than 123,000 people were affected, with two fatalities reported.</p><p>The rate of these natural hazards have increased significantly over the past ten years, leading to Sri Lanka being positioned second in the recent ranking based on vulnerability to climate change. Germanwatch, publishing the 2019 Long-Term Climate Risk Index.</p><p>While our country has been placed second on the vulnerability list, we as a nation, do not seem to be sufficiently aware of the dangers that we are facing. Last week's student strikes worldwide went largely unnoticed among students and adults alike. Our governments have done little or nothing to halt the illegal clearing of our forests, which continue to take place as pressures of agriculture and urbanization have caused heavy losses of forest cover.</p><p>However, small steps or experiments are taking place, A new concept termed \"Agroforestry\" has developed. Dr. Pethiyagoda writing in the Daily Mirror showcases the example of retired tea planter F. H. (Sam) Popham who resuscitated degraded forest land in the dry zone.</p><p>Will our governments promote such initiatives? Or will soon face the disastrous effects of climate change?</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

While interventions are needed, each ecological zone must be treated according to its environment and social circumstances,\" said Dr. Mattsson, while addressing the International Research Symposium on Valuation of Forest Ecosystems and their Services, in Colombo.</p><p>It was added that long-term transdisciplinary and datadense research programmes are required with clear monitoring and evaluation methods based on clear indicator frameworks.</p><p>According to Dr. Mattsson, such would assist in further understanding the dynamics of the said ecosystems in relation to the changes in society and environment.</p><p>Noting such programmes would aid in merging the aspirations of individual farmers with low carbon development on the large, the relevant authorities were urged to look at stepping up funding and commitment. Authorities were also asked to reconcile different landbased activities, reconnect with the environment and people in an integrated and sustainable manner by opting for a 'bottom-up approach' to land-use planning.</p><p>Stressing that work is required across sectors and government institutions, Dr. Mattsson opined that there is a need to get right the right mix of land uses - from strictly protected areas to agroforestry, home gardens to intensive agriculture.</p><p>\"Ensuring compatibility between the entities will take a range of approaches and actors working in together. It is important to harmonize national development programmes highlighting food security with international programmes for climate mitigation, adaptation and sustainability to identify trade-offs and synergies,\" he said.</p><p>Dr. Mattsson asserted such is imperative since there isn't enough research about tradeoffs, synergies and risks between the preferred choices made by individual farmers and those options that are most preferable from climate mitigation or an ecosystem services perspective.</p><p>Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.
