In this market, project developers create and sell credits, while companies and intermediaries buy them to offset their emissions.</p><p>However, the market faces challenges such as a limited supply of high-quality credits and a lack of trust in some existing credits, according to the paper.

He also said that the idea of 'just transition' - an approach advocated by top officials in the region to ensure that the negative consequences of energy transition on society are mitigated - should not be used as an excuse to slow down.\"We've got to enable and support companies, not get them to slow down. Now a lot of the just transition is 'Hang on, take it easy, we're gonna lose a lot of workers.' That is the bad way. That is the problem. Rather, go full steam ahead. But make sure you've got someone behind you to pick up the people who have been left behind,\" he said. Kidney said that role should be mainly left to governments to make sure they get trained and find new work, such as in the case of Sweden.\"The reason we're talking about special just-transition schemes is the failure of the state to support many places,\" he added. When asked about whether there is fairness in expecting emerging economies to move at the same pace as advanced economies, Kidney said: \"I mean, there's a lot of unfairness going on in the world, as if that's ever changed anything\". \"By all means go red in the face and talk about unfairness. But let's just get real about managing our world... Guilt hasn't been motivating change in the last 20 years, don't think it's going to make any difference now,\" he said. What Asean economies need to do, in its decarbonisation journey, is to push for cheap capital, he added. \"We're not going to get handouts, we're not going to get grants. We're not going to get justice.\"However, Madelena argued that most of the financing for emerging markets in Asean do not come cheap, even those offered by multilateral development banks. \"They may, actually for instance, give you concessional rates, but it is actually in foreign currency. So then you have to take the foreign exchange risk. So at the end of the day, you know, all in, it is expensive,\" she added.Notwithstanding the hurdles, central banks in Asean are pressing on with their efforts to push forward decarbonisation in the region, Madalena said.An Asean task force co-chaired by Madelena and comprising central banks in the region, has put together a report on the roles of central banks in the region in mitigating climate risks in November 2020, and they are in the midst of implementing these recommendations, though they are non-binding. Some of these recommendations include setting up an Asean green map, building up capacity and awareness on climate change, as well as establishing an Asean taxonomy. The first version of the Asean taxonomy, which provides definitions of what can be considered green for the purpose of obtaining sustainable finance, was published in Nov 2021. The Asean Taxonomy Board is currently in the midst of preparing the second version. \"I think whatever that is being worked on now, there's a need for us to give time for that to happen, to take place,\" Madalena said. \"So the key thing is, you have the recommendations, but now it's really to implement it.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["[SHARM EL-SHEIK, EGYPT] Advanced economies, particularly those in the European Union, are trying to impose their own decarbonisation pathways onto emerging markets in South-east Asia without working together with the less developed countries, said Madelena Mohamed, director of Bank Negara Malaysia's sustainability unit.
