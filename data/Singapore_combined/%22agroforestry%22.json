In doing so, those developer teams can focus their full attention on their dApp's functionality, without worrying about the overheads that normally come with creating a blockchain, or working within the confines of an existing network that struggles with scalability, such as Ethereum. The Aurora Cloud Console will generate all of the underlying code and deploy the customized blockchain as a Virtual Chain on NEAR Protocol's high-performance, EVM-compatible network, with rapid transaction speeds and enterprise grade security.</p><p>Aurora's Virtual Chains can be further refined with a series of Web3 plugins available in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://marketplace.auroracloud.dev/\">Cloud Console Marketplace</url>, where developers can integrate ready-made services such as decentralized identity protocols, reputation management, compute, domain name services and so on, with just a couple of clicks.</p><p>In this way, Aurora is setting a new standard for blockchain accessibility, eliminating the need for extensive engineering and programming skills, so anyone can build a dedicated chain for their dApp.</p><p>Who's Building Virtual Chains?</p><p>Aurora launched the Aurora Blocks Incubator to encourage dApp developers to see what they can build with its unique platform. The program offers access to Aurora's infrastructure, partner mentorship and strategic support \u2013 including grants \u2013 and after six very busy weeks, it unveiled its first cohort at a special Demo Day event last month.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/5FuBsq9yzw\">https://t.co/5FuBsq9yzw</url></p><p>\u2014 Aurora (@auroraisnear) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/auroraisnear/status/1950943671261778392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2025</url></p><p>The five projects span a wide range of blockchain applications. For instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.optima.financial/\">Optima Financial</url> says it's the first EU-regulated tokenized investment platform, offering DeFi users the chance to engage with hedge fund-level investing strategies and \"earn like the top 1%\". The strategies are bundled into separate tokens that are automatically rebalanced and traded as regulated blockchain certificates. For instance, the OP20 token is a basket of the top 20 performing cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, while OPAI is a basket of tokens designed to power blockchain-based AI projects. Optima Financial built its protocol atop of the Optima Virtual Chain to ensure speed and stability, with governance powered by its native OPTIMA token.</p><p>Another interesting project is <url normalizedValue=\"https://sproutlyrwa.com/\">Sproutly</url>, which is the first UN-verified carbon credit platform, offering access to tokenized CO2 offsets and trees, targeting companies striving to achieve their net-zero targets.

It abstracts away all of the complexity involved in blockchain, so newcomers can participate in gamified quests and earn social rewards within a familiar, Web2-like environment.</p><p>While the above projects are all building on existing ideas, a couple are forging new concepts entirely. For instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://tradable.app/\">Tradable</url> is a consumer-focused, automated crypto trading platform powered by artificial intelligence, designed to help anyone better navigate the volatility of the crypto markets.

It's a high-performance, sovereign network that unifies liquidity and scalability and streamlines real-world asset integration. Omega promises to solve common problems developers face on existing networks, such as slow and expensive transactions (Ethereum), a lack of composability (Avalanche) and a lack of sovereignty (Arbitrum), while enabling frictionless dApp development.</p><p>What's Coming Next?</p><p>The first cohort dramatically enhances the utility available within Aurora's nascent ecosystem of Virtual Chains, but more importantly they demonstrate its infrastructure's ability to support the kinds of sophisticated dApps found on more established networks such as Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. The Demo Day pitches can be viewed on Aurora's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/pBX1D93JrmE?t=1s\">YouTube channel</url>.</p><p>While Aurora Aurora Blocks Incubator will now turn its attention to identifying candidates for its second cohort, Aurora Labs promised it will continue to support the growth of the original five, in line with its grand ambition to foster an ecosystem of as many as 1,000 Virtual Chains by the end of the year.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Currently, there are 54 nature ways in Singapore, stretching 240km in total.</p><p> An example of a nature way is the Lornie Nature Corridor, which comprises a nature way and a park connector, and acts as a buffer to the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The corridor has more than 100 species of trees and shrubs so far. </p><p> For example, the pink mempat (Cratoxylum formosum) and kempas (Koompassia malaccensis), which are both native and endangered, were planted to provide food and habitat to support various insects and birds.</p><p> NParks has also tried to re-introduce endangered plant species such as the native Singapore kopsia (Kopsia singapurensis), a tree that is considered critically endangered here.</p><p> Nature ways can help wildlife move around to find food and mates, said butterfly expert Khew Sin Khoon. </p><p> \"They are not merely green corridors, they are critical ecological highways that enable urban biodiversity to move between major nature nodes across the island,\" added Mr Khew, who is also head of Singapore butterfly interest group ButterflyCircle. </p><p> Butterflies such as the rustic (Cupha erymanthis lotis) are usually found in forests. </p><p> But these can now be seen in park connectors and even urban parks, Mr Khew said.</p><p> This could be due to the planting of the caterpillar's host plant, rukam masam (Flacourtia inermis) along roads, park connectors and urban gardens, said Mr Khew.</p><p> NParks has also planted native shrub species like the common sendudok (Melastoma malabathricum) which attracts birds like the scarlet-backed flowerpecker (Dicaeum cruentatum) and insects such as the striped nomia bee (Nomia strigata).</p><p> Improved connectivity between Singapore's green spaces will improve the gene flow between populations and also increase the butterfly's resilience to environmental changes, Mr Khew added.</p><p> A separate study by NTU in February found that road verges with a higher diversity of flowering plants attract more butterflies due to the year-round availability of nectar, as plants bloom at different times.</p><p> The researchers include Dr Tharaka Priyadarshana and Associate Professor Eleanor Slade from the Tropical Ecology and Entomology Lab at NTU's Asian School of the Environment. </p><p> While the road verges studied are not formally part of Singapore's nature ways, the researchers said they serve a similar ecological function on a smaller scale by providing resources such as nectar and shelter.</p><p> They also serve as important connectors that help butterflies move across urban landscapes of unconnected greenery, complementing the broader connectivity provided by nature ways, said the researchers.</p><p> Mr Khew said: \"Nature ways represent a science-based, scalable solution to keep Singapore's City in Nature vision alive -- not just for humans, but for the butterflies, birds, and countless other species that share our city.\" </p><p> Planting trees,  growing rootsAs part of the City in Nature push, Singapore in 2020 launched the OneMillionTrees movement. </p><p> The aim is to plant a million more trees across the island by 2030. </p><p> As at June, 800,868 trees have been planted across Singapore, according to NParks' website.</p><p> More trees have been planted in places such as schools and residential and industrial estates since the launch of the movement. </p><p> On industrialised Jurong Island, for example, more than 34,000 trees have been planted since 2020. More than 80 species of trees such as the common sterculia (Sterculia parviflora) and the shore laurel (Neolitsea cassia) were chosen to line the island -- one of Singapore's warmest areas. </p><p> The tree species were chosen based on their ability to tolerate drought, their colourful flowers and wide crowns that can provide shade. </p><p> Trees act as natural air filters, providing clean air. They also provide cool and shaded environments, helping to reduce the urban heat island effect -- where urban structures trap heat in the day and release it at night.</p><p> Forests also provide habitats for wildlife like the critically endangered straw-headed bulbul, a songbird, and the Sunda pangolin, and store carbon to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p> A nation's transformationAs Singapore celebrates its 60 years of independence, the country's transformation over the decades is reflected in its greening journey, said experts. </p><p> \"In a way, this whole journey mirrors the growth of a nation -- from trying to survive, to trying to impress, to now trying to sustain,\" Dr Lahiru said. \"It reflects how we think as a society, how we see ourselves, and what we believe we need in order to survive and thrive.\"</p><p> As Singapore transitions from Garden City to City in a Garden to City in Nature, Dr Lahiru said that the City in Nature could be the \"most honest\" version of what the country has been trying to do -- to create a home for both humans and nature. \"It brings in ideas of resilience, biodiversity, and responsibility. It's no longer about making things green -- it's about making sure nature survives, so we do too,\" he noted.</p><p> Dr Lum added: \"It is now up to all of us to embrace the City in Nature, and to nurture this seed and to care for it so that it can become an inspiring thing of beauty and wonder.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["As vegetation snakes its way through the urban landscape and nature is restored in the city through \"rewilding\" efforts, animals once thought to be extinct in Singapore, such as the oriental pied hornbill and smooth-coated otter, have made a comeback.

In 2025, significant drivers of structural change include the implementation of US President Donald Trump's post-election promises and key regulatory decisions in global markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These will prompt new business plans and budgets at the corporate level, influenced by supply-chain dynamics, potentially higher funding rates, and intensified merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity. The following analyses and insights are driving our high-conviction themes for 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Fintech and financials back in favourFintech experienced a robust resurgence in 2024, driven by strong operational results, attractive valuations, and optimism surrounding Trump 2.0. Traditional financials also thrived, buoyed by \"higher for longer\" rates and increased net interest income. </p><p> Looking ahead, economic growth, reduced regulation, and fintech initial public offerings are expected to sustain momentum. Although the interest rate cycle may be nearing its peak, we do not anticipate a significant decline in banking profits, as many banks continue to benefit from strong fee-based income streams that are less sensitive to interest rate changes. </p><p> Additionally, lower rates could stimulate more M&amp;A activity, unlocking scale, innovation, and profits in fintech and traditional financial sectors. </p><p> In the consumer space, the demand for immersive, personalised experiences across travel, entertainment, and digital platforms is rising. Increased digitalisation is driving demand for credit solutions and cross-border transactions, particularly in underserved markets, boosting traditional payment companies such as Visa.</p><p> The broadening of markets and reduced emphasis on the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) should also benefit financials, particularly fintech, which is rich with overlooked and underappreciated artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Tech innovations.</p><p> Digital innovation: AI must show real gainsIn 2024, AI once again emerged as the driving force behind technological innovation and earnings growth. Investors and corporates will increasingly demand tangible productivity gains over speculative potential in the high-performance semiconductor and supportive infrastructure sectors.</p><p> Software sector revenue growth is forecast to accelerate to 14 per cent by 2025, with cloud computing and software-as-a-service revenues projected to expand at nearly twice that rate, underscoring the growing influence of AI-enabled platforms in driving real digital transformation across the economy.</p><p> AI is making significant inroads into the physical world, arriving at a critical time when production bottlenecks and geopolitical security concerns renew interest in reshoring manufacturing. AI, robotics, and automation will help overcome reshoring challenges such as high labour costs, worker shortages, and rapid operational scaling. Consequently, we anticipate accelerated spending on new and retrofitted manufacturing facilities that integrate AI. </p><p> Healthcare: diverse trends and innovationA shortage of doctors and rising healthcare costs indicate that AI will be valuable for the healthcare sector. AI-powered advances in medical imaging and life-science tools are enhancing early detection, treatment outcomes, and personalised therapies. </p><p> On the dietary front, the shift towards healthy and sustainable foods benefits upstream ingredient companies, supporting superior growth, compared with downstream consumer-facing staples. </p><p> Trump's healthcare agenda is expected to drive the performance of pharmacy benefit managers, managed care networks, Medicaid beneficiaries, and vaccines in the first half of 2025. In the long term, population growth, higher life expectancies, shifting demographics, rising lifestyle disease burdens, and the emerging middle class will drive strong demand for healthcare services. </p><p> Circular economy: stricter laws boost circular producersA key principle of the circular economy is replacing hazardous substances with non-harmful alternatives and preventing their release into the environment. This includes the recent US Food and Drug Administration's push to simplify nutrition labels on food packaging. These efforts are expected to drive growth among companies specialising in naturally non-toxic ingredients for food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.</p><p> Additionally, a growing number of food chains are dedicated to bio-labels and healthy food alternatives. The European Union's newest packaging laws will also benefit holdings involved in recycling and biodegradable packaging. </p><p> Smart grids: solution for security and power demandsGlobal electricity demand is accelerating, underscoring the urgency to expand infrastructure. The International Energy Agency projects that power consumption from data centres, AI, and the cryptocurrency sector may double by 2026. In the near term, renewables, gas, and storage solutions are the most viable technologies to meet surging demand. </p><p> Energy security remains a top political priority, with government incentives for clean energy infrastructure driving new construction projects to upgrade energy systems and modernise the grid. </p><p> Although policy risks may challenge offshore wind and higher-cost technologies, increased US protectionism could benefit domestic solar module manufacturers. </p><p> Growing power demand, driven by data centre expansion, favours low-carbon, low-cost electricity developers and utilities.</p><p> Mobility: revving up EV markets China's overall electric vehicle (EV) penetration rate could climb to 75 per cent in 2025, according to some industry experts. In Europe, stricter new fleet CO2 emission standards will drive the production of new EV models and increase consumer uptake. </p><p> The growing use of cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries will further support consumer adoption and producer profitability. Declining lithium prices in 2025 are expected to create significant investment opportunities in smart mobility.</p><p> Assisted and autonomous driving is poised to be a life-changing AI application, with 2025 likely to be its breakout year. </p><p> Water: diverse demands make it an evergreen investment Water challenges are set to intensify as stringent regulations target pollutants and biological threats. Clean drinking water and micropollutant control remain bipartisan priorities in the US for 2025, positioning advanced water treatment and infrastructure providers for long-term growth. </p><p> Additionally, the demand for treated water is increasing from US-based industries and municipalities, driven by reshoring trends for semiconductors, EVs, and other manufacturing sectors, which fuels advancements in water-testing and analytics, recycling, and wastewater management.</p><p> Biodiversity: new laws and practicesResource scarcity and degrading ecosystems are elevating biodiversity in corporate and political agendas. The EU's Nature Restoration Law, enacted in 2024, sets binding targets to rehabilitate EU ecosystems, benefiting industries such as engineering consulting, construction, and forestry. </p><p> Sustainable practices such as organic farming, agroforestry, and advanced land management are expected to drive biodiversity investments, enhancing soil health, water quality, and carbon sequestration.</p><p> Smart materials and manufacturingManufacturing capital expenditure and construction are strengthening, thanks to Trump's \"America First\" industrial policies. </p><p> Although tariffs and trade tensions may be challenging in the short term, they are expected to accelerate investments in automation and robotics in response to reshoring trends. </p><p> An anticipated fiscal stimulus should also reignite automation investments in China. </p><p> Electrification and automation segments are expected to grow robustly in the mid-20 per cent range, further supported by lower interest rates and the re-emergence of M&amp;A activity. Inflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2025, creating opportunities in commodities and critical minerals as demand stabilises.</p><p> Structural trends such as renewable energy adoption and energy independence should drive demand for lithium, copper, and rare earths, while decarbonisation policies and financing from the EU Green Deal will provide tailwinds for energy-efficient materials. </p><p> We are constantly reminded that AI is the future, and this drives investors to eagerly seek opportunities. </p><p> However, decades of thematic investing have shown that innovation does not occur in isolation. Regulation, macroeconomics, and resource scarcity are crucial to its deployment, adoption and scaling. </p><p> Investors should factor in the technological, political, and market currents to best position their investments for short and long-term growth. </p><p> By closely navigating these themes and their impacts, they may enhance portfolio returns while helping to reshape the future. </p><p> The writer is head of thematic investing, Robeco</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Water: diverse demands make it an evergreen investment Water challenges are set to intensify as stringent regulations target pollutants and biological threats.

The remaining 14 per cent will come from restoring degraded habitats through replanting, for example. </p><p> The researchers calculated that conserving and restoring these habitats can reduce about 770 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. This amount is nearly double Malaysia's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, they said. </p><p> These findings were published in scientific journal Nature Communications on Jan 28. Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and James Cook University in Australia also contributed to the study.</p><p> Mangroves can store up to five times as much carbon as tropical forests. Although swampy peatlands cover just 3 per cent of the earth's land surface, they store twice as much carbon as all of the world's forests combined. </p><p> But peatlands have for decades been viewed as unproductive wasteland, eyed by agriculture giants and farmers for conversion into plantations and farmland. Between 2001 and 2022, about 40 per cent of peat swamp forests in South-east Asia in 2000 were lost. </p><p> By 2017, the annual rate of loss of these forests had been 108,458ha a year, the study found. The size of that annual loss is larger than Singapore's land area, which is over 71,000ha.</p><p> Peatland fires caused the 2015 haze that shrouded Singapore and the rest of the region, producing emissions higher than the levels in the whole of the European Union. </p><p> Therefore, losing more of these carbon reserves to forest fires and agricultural use will pump enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. </p><p> \"Conservation is the most effective strategy to mitigate emissions from peatlands and wetlands. So it's an easy win if we just conserve these ecosystems, as opposed to developing a lot of funding and projects in restoration that provide fewer benefits when compared to conservation,\" said Assistant Professor Pierre Taillardat, a co-author of the paper and scientist at the NTU Asian School of the Environment's Wetland Carbon Lab. </p><p> At the same time, avoiding deforestation of peatlands allows more carbon to be absorbed, compared with regrowth in the short term, particularly in the context of countries' net-zero goals by 2050. This is because of the extended time taken by a regenerating forest to reach maturity and achieve maximum carbon accumulation, stated the paper.</p><p> Its senior author, Associate Professor Massimo Lupascu from the NUS Department of Geography, also noted that restoration is costlier than conservation. </p><p> Restoring peatlands costs up to US$7,000 ($9,500) per hectare, compared with a few thousand dollars per hectare for conservation. It is also known to be difficult to successfully reforest a degraded mangrove or peat forest due to technical complexities and governance barriers. </p><p> \"Maintaining a high water table in tropical peatland is one of the key elements to prevent carbon loss, but it's very difficult. Restoration involves replicating ecological conditions that have developed over centuries. And mangroves depend on tidal dynamics. In many of the degraded areas, the hydrology and physical conditions of the coasts have been altered,\" explained Prof Lupascu. </p><p> \"And on top of that, peatlands have the risk of fires. As for governance challenges, many restoration projects struggle to succeed because there are overlapping land claims, unclear tenure rights and weak law enforcement.\" </p><p> A 2024 global study found that planted mangroves fall short in carbon storage compared with natural mangrove forests. Although planted mangroves can store up to 73 per cent of the carbon found in an intact mangrove forest of the same coastal environment, this level of carbon storage is achieved only after around 20 years of growth, the study showed. </p><p> While conservation should take higher priority, restoration still has a role, said the researchers, given the huge amounts of carbon both ecosystems store.</p><p> According to the Asean Peatland Management Strategy 2023-2030 report, there are very few, if any, pristine peatlands left in the region. Some projects on the ground incorporate both conservation and restoration. </p><p> Commenting on the research, Dr Lahiru Wijedasa, an ecologist at environmental consultancy and agroforestry firm ConservationLinks, said that what needs to be done on the ground is to map out the completely intact peatlands, slightly degraded sites, and completely degraded ones under threat. </p><p> \"Prioritise the easy ones first, and get those conserved, with the idea that these are not just for carbon source and environmental health, but also the seed stock for restoration later,\" he said. </p><p> Conservation is not easy.

It also requires proper systems in place to prevent fires, encroachment and poaching. </p><p> Dr Lahiru added: \"For a huge protected area that the government needs to run, they don't really have the people, money and infrastructure to do this.\" </p><p> He and the researchers also said conservation needs to be balanced with community livelihoods. One way is to help communities switch to crops suitable for wet peat, thus preventing the draining of peatlands for agriculture and small-scale oil palm. </p><p> Prof Lupascu said: \"If we propose to switch to water spinach, sago or jelutong (wood), from a business point of view, it's not that appealing for small-scale farmers because they generate lower profits.

Instead of being rich and dark, the red soil is barren and desert-like, robbed of nutrients -- scars from the monoculture farming that has taken place on this land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As our group of about 20 walks, Mr Chua urges us to ponder over the state of the degraded soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We are not just here to learn, but to also observe and feel. Some of us who are more sensitive may feel pain, anger and sadness, wondering why we have done this to our land. But it's okay to let yourself feel as much as possible,\" he says.</p><p> It is the first sign that this is not your usual farm tour. In February, I visited A Little Wild's (ALW) monthly open farm day in Kota Tinggi, a town in Johor, Malaysia. </p><p> Online, the ALW team outlines its plan to transform a 55ha land parcel, which has been a palm oil plantation since the 1980s, into an educational agroforest flourishing with fruits and vegetables. But I did not fully grasp what that meant until my visit.</p><p> A land scarredAs the group traipses through the first plot of palm oil trees, co- founder Imran Hassan, the farm's 38-year-old full-time manager, explains the origins of monoculture farming in industrial agriculture. This refers to the practice of growing one, or a few, crop species at a time.</p><p> Large-scale monoculture plantations were established in South-east Asia by the early capitalist endeavours of European colonists. These ranged from rubber and coffee to tea and palm oil plantations. </p><p> This intensive farming system forces the land into an unnatural state, where yields and uniformity are prized. Farmers use chemicals to kill pests, weeds and organisms in the soil.</p><p> As a result, people are eating very \"stressed fruits\" that rely on costly and resource-intensive methods. Soil is viewed as a lifeless medium, its quality steadily stripped of its natural nutrients and complex life, says Mr Imran, who has worked in various regenerative farms and other projects across South-east Asia since 2010. </p><p> Soil destruction creates a vicious circle. When topsoil deteriorates, it loses its ability to hold carbon below and above ground. This carbon is released into the atmosphere, causing the planet to get hotter. More difficult soil and climate conditions require more chemicals and pesticides to achieve the same yields. </p><p> ALW's guiding ethos is to help the land heal. </p><p> \"Every land dreams of becoming a forest,\" says Mr Chua, one of the farm's four founders along with Mr Imran and two more friends. </p><p> The quartet founded the farm in 2020, coming together through their shared disillusionment with the modern food system. </p><p> They saw food production, in addition to being a cause of chronic diseases, as accelerating biodiversity loss and climate change. </p><p> The land was bought with a goal of showing that regenerative agriculture can be financially viable, and to share their experience and applied research with current and aspiring farmers who want to transform the food production system.</p><p> Mr Chua spends four to five days a week at the farm, where he helps out in the plots, supports the building of new facilities, assists with tours and workshops and manages volunteers. </p><p> A former public servant working in Singapore and civil engineer with a master's degree in public policy, he also co-founded Feed Our Loved Ones (Folo), a community farm in Johor using compost made out of food waste to produce organic vegetables.</p><p> To heal the landALW bills itself as South-east Asia's first commercial-scale syntropic agroforestry farm. This means it does not rely on irrigation, with no agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides.</p><p> Founders draw inspiration from Swiss farmer Ernst Gotsch, who pioneered the syntropic farming movement. This approach mimics natural ecosystems by integrating diverse crops and trees, enhancing soil fertility and biodiversity.</p><p> Having experimented with syntropic agroforestry for the last three years, Mr Chua says this is one of the best nature-based solutions in the tropics to heal soil life -- regenerating forests and drawing down carbon while growing food.</p><p> \"Syntropic agroforestry is a solution that does not require more intense energy and resource extraction because it harnesses the billion-year wisdom of the tropical forest in harvesting the sun, the rain and nutrients to sustain life,\" he explains.</p><p> At ALW, the process looks like this. </p><p> Initially, degraded soil supports only pioneer species, normally known as weeds, such as mimosa, senduduk and lalang. So, farmers choose the best weeds -- typically mombasa grass which regrows fast and produces plenty of biomass (organic matter such as wood, forest residue or plant material) -- to enrich the barren soil. </p><p> From there, the team plants varieties of species in layers, based on their complementary characteristics. Diversity is key, with more than 80 species in every tree row to mimic the stratification, natural succession and dynamics of a biodiverse rainforest.</p><p> Towering above the forest are emergent trees -- such as the acacia, coconut and durian -- which require constant sunlight. </p><p> Next are the canopy trees that do not mind a bit of shade, like the jackfruit or rambutan tree, followed by the medium layer, which includes mangosteen and lime. Finally, they plant the low- lying layer of coffee, cacao and ginger family plants. </p><p> Mr Chua says that when they mimic the agro-ecological conditions of nature, trees are able to act as a community, building collective resilience to ward off diseases and insects. </p><p> As we meander through the lush greenery, we witness how the land has slowly come back to life. The soil is dark and moist, packed with mycelium, bacteria and all types of organisms. Now, the forest is home to civet cats, wild boars and the like. We pause by the water body, which plays host to a resident eagle and heron. </p><p> Along the way, we chance upon other delightful sights, including a field of tall Mexican sunflowers surrounded by butterflies, red dragon fruit perched on thorny leaves, sweet papayas and flowering coffee trees in abundance. </p><p> The output is modest as the agroforest system is young and the soil is still healing, but the farmers are grateful for its output. The farm has produced pineapples, papayas, 15 types of bananas and rollinia (similar to custard apples), along with a scattering of passion fruit, dragon fruit and breadfruit. </p><p> The farm sends around 120kg of produce to Singapore each week, including to customers who order fruits delivered to their doorstep and to restaurants, such as farm-to-table joint Air CCCC in Dempsey. </p><p> Lessons from the landPart history lesson, part activism and part philosophy lecture, sprinkled with spiritual teachings, the tour takes us on a surprisingly emotional journey.</p><p> We learn that each plant and tree plays its own unique roles to help one another blossom.</p><p> Take, for instance, the sun-loving papaya, which needs fairly good soil over a period of three to five years. To help it thrive, the ALW team plants a tall acacia tree to supply it with nitrogen and a companion ciku plant so that the papaya grows vigorously to take care of it. </p><p> More than process, agroforestry carries a philosophy.</p><p> Near a shady plot of banana plants, Mr Chua poses a question to the group: What does the banana do to help the land become a forest'</p><p> Because of its large size, each banana produces a lot of biomass and oxygen. It is also an ideal home for hundreds of earthworms, whose nutrient-rich excrement replaces fertiliser. </p><p> Mr Chua dramatically slices through the banana stalk, revealing a cross-section of glistening water that can feed nearby plants and trees for a week. He describes the plant as a giver, where 60 per cent of its energy is used to grow itself, while the remainder goes back to the soil and other trees.</p><p> \"A banana plant is so wonderful that, sometimes, it even gives us bananas,\" he says happily.</p><p> As the group moves on, I spy a trio of friends who grab fallen banana leaves to form makeshift umbrellas under the hot sun. </p><p> At another plot, Mr Chua offers a lesson in gratitude.</p><p> Just as people's grandparents and parents created good lives for them, the pioneering early-stage trees and shrubs -- such as acacia, cassava and Mexican sunflower -- paved the way for the next generation of plants to thrive. Now, the land has become lush, flowering and beautiful, like the jackfruit, orchid and cacao plants we see today, he says.</p><p> Stewards of the landGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, the ALW team is on a mission to share its journey with more people.</p><p> Besides open farm days and private tours, the farm welcomes volunteers, who can stay for a minimum of two weeks, to help meet its goal of planting another 40ha of agroforest and re-wilding more areas in the coming years.</p><p> From May, it also plans to roll out weekend syntropic agroforestry basic workshops, as well as agroforestry and mindfulness retreats. </p><p> Already, the tour has seeded new ideas among my fellow participants, some of whom comprise former and current staff at social enterprise Green Nudge in Singapore.</p><p> \"Farmer Will's thoughtful inclusion of the farm's philosophy enriched our understanding of the importance of connecting with our food sources,\" says Singaporean Charmayne Lee, 24, Green Nudge's marketing and communications associate.</p><p> It is nearly noon by the time we return from the tour, hot and sweaty. </p><p> In a warung made of re-engineered wood waste designed by a Kuala Lumpur architect, volunteers have laid out a spread of the forest's gifts: cold cuts of rollinia fruit and papaya topped with passion fruit seeds, jackfruit murukku and steamed cassava served with hot sauce and various dips prepared by Folo Farm. </p><p> We snack on chips made from bananas, yam and cassava by Orang Asli -- indigenous communities in Pahang who attended ALW's workshops. This is done in partnership with international non-profit organisation Global Peace Foundation, which works with Orang Asli in Pahang to teach them how to farm. </p><p> There is also an enzyme bar, where we are served gut-friendly fermented fruit drinks by a long-term farm apprentice who had spent some time in a New York sake brewery. </p><p> As I munch and mingle with the participants on the tour -- a mix of Singaporeans, Malaysians and overseas guests -- we share a newfound sense of gratitude for the food nourishing our bodies. </p><p> I think about how more city folks like myself feel an increased yearning to connect with the earth again. We need to start questioning the systems we have in place and carve out alternative models of land stewardship. Drawing on shared strength in the community, we can chart a new way forward. </p><p> 1.

They saw food production, in addition to being a cause of chronic diseases, as accelerating biodiversity loss and climate change. The land was bought with a goal of showing that regenerative agriculture can be financially viable, and to share their experience and applied research with current and aspiring farmers who want to transform the food production system. Mr Chua spends four to five days a week at the farm, where he helps out in the plots, supports the building of new facilities, assists with tours and workshops and manages volunteers. A former public servant working in Singapore and civil engineer with a master's degree in public policy, he also co-founded Feed Our Loved Ones (Folo), a community farm in Johor using compost made out of food waste to produce organic vegetables. To heal the landALW bills itself as South-east Asia's first commercial-scale syntropic agroforestry farm. This means it does not rely on irrigation, with no agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides. Founders draw inspiration from Swiss farmer Ernst Gotsch, who pioneered the syntropic farming movement. This approach mimics natural ecosystems by integrating diverse crops and trees, enhancing soil fertility and biodiversity. Having experimented with syntropic agroforestry for the last three years, Mr Chua says this is one of the best nature-based solutions in the tropics to heal soil life -- regenerating forests and drawing down carbon while growing food. \"Syntropic agroforestry is a solution that does not require more intense energy and resource extraction because it harnesses the billion-year wisdom of the tropical forest in harvesting the sun, the rain and nutrients to sustain life,\" he explains.", "A former public servant working in Singapore and civil engineer with a master's degree in public policy, he also co-founded Feed Our Loved Ones (Folo), a community farm in Johor using compost made out of food waste to produce organic vegetables.

At ALW, the process looks like this. Initially, degraded soil supports only pioneer species, normally known as weeds, such as mimosa, senduduk and lalang. So, farmers choose the best weeds -- typically mombasa grass which regrows fast and produces plenty of biomass (organic matter such as wood, forest residue or plant material) -- to enrich the barren soil. From there, the team plants varieties of species in layers, based on their complementary characteristics.", "To heal the landALW bills itself as South-east Asia's first commercial-scale syntropic agroforestry farm.

Lessons from the landPart history lesson, part activism and part philosophy lecture, sprinkled with spiritual teachings, the tour takes us on a surprisingly emotional journey. We learn that each plant and tree plays its own unique roles to help one another blossom. Take, for instance, the sun-loving papaya, which needs fairly good soil over a period of three to five years. To help it thrive, the ALW team plants a tall acacia tree to supply it with nitrogen and a companion ciku plant so that the papaya grows vigorously to take care of it. More than process, agroforestry carries a philosophy. Near a shady plot of banana plants, Mr Chua poses a question to the group: What does the banana do to help the land become a forest' Because of its large size, each banana produces a lot of biomass and oxygen. It is also an ideal home for hundreds of earthworms, whose nutrient-rich excrement replaces fertiliser. Mr Chua dramatically slices through the banana stalk, revealing a cross-section of glistening water that can feed nearby plants and trees for a week. He describes the plant as a giver, where 60 per cent of its energy is used to grow itself, while the remainder goes back to the soil and other trees. \"A banana plant is so wonderful that, sometimes, it even gives us bananas,\" he says happily.", "At another plot, Mr Chua offers a lesson in gratitude. Just as people's grandparents and parents created good lives for them, the pioneering early-stage trees and shrubs -- such as acacia, cassava and Mexican sunflower -- paved the way for the next generation of plants to thrive. Now, the land has become lush, flowering and beautiful, like the jackfruit, orchid and cacao plants we see today, he says. Stewards of the landGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, the ALW team is on a mission to share its journey with more people. Besides open farm days and private tours, the farm welcomes volunteers, who can stay for a minimum of two weeks, to help meet its goal of planting another 40ha of agroforest and re-wilding more areas in the coming years. From May, it also plans to roll out weekend syntropic agroforestry basic workshops, as well as agroforestry and mindfulness retreats. Already, the tour has seeded new ideas among my fellow participants, some of whom comprise former and current staff at social enterprise Green Nudge in Singapore. \"Farmer Will's thoughtful inclusion of the farm's philosophy enriched our understanding of the importance of connecting with our food sources,\" says Singaporean Charmayne Lee, 24, Green Nudge's marketing and communications associate. It is nearly noon by the time we return from the tour, hot and sweaty. In a warung made of re-engineered wood waste designed by a Kuala Lumpur architect, volunteers have laid out a spread of the forest's gifts: cold cuts of rollinia fruit and papaya topped with passion fruit seeds, jackfruit murukku and steamed cassava served with hot sauce and various dips prepared by Folo Farm. We snack on chips made from bananas, yam and cassava by Orang Asli -- indigenous communities in Pahang who attended ALW's workshops."]}, {"relevance_score": 51, "title": "From Bytes to Barns: How Tokenized Real-World Assets Are Changing Sustainable Agriculture and Beyond", "published": "2024-07-30", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">RWA tokenization has acquired a lot of popularity in recent years; <url normalizedValue=\"https://messari.io/report/welcome-to-the-real-world\">according to blockchain analytics company Messari, the sector is expected to reach $8 billion in total value locked (TVL) in 2024 alone.</url> This novel approach, which turns tangible assets into blockchain-tradable tokens, is currently being used to facilitate and advance sustainability initiatives in a number of industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tokenized RWAs are beneficial in achieving a number of sustainability objectives.

Despite uncertainties in the pace of energy transition, the trend towards lower-carbon sources is crucial for major investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than 80 per cent of Nuveen's 2024 EQuilibrium survey respondents consider or plan to consider energy transition in their investments; 55 per cent believe they can significantly influence it through capital allocations. Institutional investors worldwide are eager to align with this unprecedented capital movement, projected to require US$275 trillion in cumulative spending on physical assets till 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We have identified 10 key indicators to help investors evaluate their portfolios and uncover compelling opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 1. Clean-energy capital expenditure: Capital expenditure is crucial for scaling up low-carbon energy and displacing high-carbon sources. Over the past decade, lower costs and improved technologies have made renewables economically attractive. More renewable capacity is projected to be built in the next five years than the total installed since clean energy became viable, and the evolution of capital deployment will have widespread impacts. </p><p> If clean-energy investments lag, global warming may increase, creating more adaptation opportunities and risks. Conversely, faster clean-energy investment could disrupt commodity demand and shift geopolitical dynamics, initially causing inflation but potentially deflation in the long term.</p><p> 2. Electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure: Expanding EV-charging infrastructure is crucial to reduce oil demand, as transport accounts for about 50 per cent of global oil consumption. However, high upfront costs for building and connecting fast chargers are slowing this expansion. Government subsidies and technological innovations can help, but significant growth is needed.</p><p> If all new car sales were EVs, public charging stations would need to increase from four million to 31 million. Improved infrastructure will boost EV demand, have an impact on critical mineral and battery producers, and increase electricity demand. Accelerated adoption could lower oil prices, affecting inflation, interest rates, and the fossil fuel industry.</p><p> 3. Corporate carbon reduction: Capital expenditures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among major corporate emitters are crucial for climate finance and emissions reduction, enhancing business model resiliency. While the supply and demand of low-carbon energy drive decarbonisation, monitoring corporate strategy and capital expenditure changes reveals economic shifts. </p><p> Influenced by stakeholders, many companies have set voluntary carbon-reduction targets, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. In 2022, corporations contributed US$192 billion to climate finance, and investors must monitor corporate commitments to ensure progress towards net-zero targets.</p><p> 4. Emerging-market cost of capital: Emerging markets have significant economic growth potential, driving increased energy demand. Ensuring that this growth is met with clean energy is crucial to decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. About 88 per cent of the electricity demand between 2019 and 2040 is expected to come from these markets, making their energy choices pivotal for global carbon emissions. </p><p> Clean-energy projects face high upfront costs and limited affordable financing, creating a climate investment trap. Financial support from entities such as the Green Climate Fund and blended finance mechanisms can mitigate risks and enhance investment appeal. Reducing financing costs can accelerate the energy transition, benefiting both investors and emerging markets.</p><p> 5. Carbon pricing: Carbon trading and pricing schemes are vital for climate financing and incentivising decarbonisation. Effective carbon pricing can mobilise substantial funds for energy transition, with higher prices and broader industry coverage significantly boosting required capital. In 2023, carbon pricing generated over US$104 billion but covered only 24 per cent of global GHG emissions.</p><p> International trade tariffs based on carbon content could encourage countries to adopt their own pricing schemes, retaining revenue domestically. Compliance and voluntary carbon markets face challenges such as low prices and the lack of standards. Investors should expect higher carbon taxes and broader coverage, driving investments in clean technologies and potentially increasing inflation.</p><p> 6. Coal phase-out: As countries committed to the Paris Agreement work towards reducing GHG emissions, phasing out coal plants becomes crucial. Each country's climate action plan outlines specific strategies to curb emissions, leading to stricter regulations. Reliable substitute power generation, such as utility-scale solar, battery assets, or natural gas, is essential for this transition. </p><p> In 2023, 23 gigawatts of coal capacity were retired, but global coal power capacity continues to rise, driven by China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Russia. Increasing energy demands, driven by the rising use of artificial intelligence and the reshoring of manufacturing, add pressure to coal phase-out plans. Monitoring coal plant retirements offers investors insights into growth opportunities for low-carbon power generation.</p><p> 7. Trade policy: Countries aiming to compete globally now face stronger incentives to decarbonise, with energy security becoming increasingly important. Economic nationalism has led to subsidies and tax credits for clean-energy projects, while businesses reduce the carbon intensity of exports to gain a share in the clean-energy technology value chain. Government funding through policies such as the European Union's Green Deal and the US' Inflation Reduction Act is expected to stimulate private financing, creating investment opportunities.</p><p> Carbon border adjustments (CBAs) and tariffs based on carbon intensity incentivise cleaner production methods. Investors should consider the impacts of CBAs, tariffs, and major industrial policies on global trade dynamics and sovereign debt, as well as the potential for substantial private-capital investment.</p><p> 8. Land management: Forests, oceans, and soil act as carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide than they release and mitigating climate change. Despite efforts, deforestation continues at high rates, releasing stored carbon. Comprehensive reforestation policies are lacking, limiting large-scale restoration and carbon sequestration. Carbon-friendly agricultural practices such as agroforestry and conservation tillage are not widely adopted.</p><p> However, policies to protect carbon sinks are emerging. Investors should consider the impact of stringent environmental regulations on companies reliant on natural resources, and explore opportunities in sustainable land-use practices.</p><p> 9. Climate-tech funding: Innovation and technology diffusion are crucial for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and enhancing decarbonisation incentives. Technological advancements in energy production and consumption improve efficiency, lower costs, and make low-carbon activities more attractive. This is vital for emerging markets to bypass carbon-intensive development paths.</p><p> Private equity and venture capital funding are essential for developing technologies such as energy storage and green hydrogen. Climate tech now accounts for more than 10 per cent of global investments, up from less than 2 per cent in 2014. As these technologies mature, they attract more investors, especially in hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, mining, steel, and chemicals.</p><p> 10. Nuclear as well as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS): Nuclear power and CCUS are vital for ensuring baseload power and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Emerging technologies such as small modular reactors and nuclear fusion could revolutionise the energy sector, despite challenges such as cost overruns and supply chain issues. </p><p> CCUS growth is driven by capital deployment, subsidies, industry coordination, and the willingness of customers to pay for low-carbon products. Investors should consider carbon-free baseload power and the longevity of fossil-based activities with CCUS, transitioning to stable, growth-oriented opportunities.</p><p> Rebuilding the world's energy system is a monumental task that demands significant effort and resources. This unprecedented shift in capital will have far-reaching consequences for investment portfolios, influencing both opportunities and risks. </p><p> To extract value and mitigate risk, investors may need to venture into unfamiliar territory, adopting innovative strategies to achieve a resilient and climate-aware strategic asset allocation. This approach not only ensures sustainability, but also aligns with the evolving global energy landscape.</p><p> The writer is managing director, Nuveen Responsible Investing</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Investors should consider the impacts of CBAs, tariffs, and major industrial policies on global trade dynamics and sovereign debt, as well as the potential for substantial private-capital investment. 8.

To protect the seedlings from these threats, they use a bamboo sheath to surround the plant.</p><p> \"If you plant but you don't monitor, I can guarantee you that the seedlings will not grow. Planting is easy but making sure the mangroves grow well is very difficult,\" said senior scientist Herry Purnomo, country director for CIFOR-ICRAF in Indonesia.</p><p> At this site, only about 50 per cent of planted seedlings survive, he said.</p><p> Monitoring is critical so damaged seedlings can be replanted. It is done through an app-based system. The app captures information such as how many mangrove plants stay alive, which ones die and where, and pest infestations.</p><p> The researchers also pointed to the importance of getting the support of the local community for the restoration efforts, without which the replanted stands of mangrove trees could be cut down again. </p><p> Many coastal communities throughout South-east Asia, including the villages in Banyuasin, rely on nature for their livelihoods.</p><p> To support their families, mangroves in the area had been cleared to make room for agriculture use such as coconut plantations.</p><p> Understandably, the villagers were not supportive of the initial mangrove restoration efforts, as they were afraid their livelihoods would be compromised, said Dr Zia. \"When I first asked for directions, they pointed me the wrong way,\" he added. </p><p> Currently, three alternative income-generating activities are being explored at the site -- the sale of mangrove seedlings to companies, ecotourism, and crab-rearing. </p><p> Former fisherman Ratam, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, now earns an income from the sale of mangrove seedlings to state-owned companies.</p><p> So far, some 30,000 seedlings have been sold, amid a global resurgence of interest in nature-based solutions such as mangrove restoration as a way of tackling climate change.</p><p> On the ecotourism front, the village hopes the restored mangrove site can be an eco-education tourism hub, attracting students, researchers and visitors.</p><p> Some 1,300 visitors have visited the mangrove ecotourism area -- their visits boosting local incomes with food sales, homestays and transportation.</p><p> A group from the nearby Marga Sungsang Village approached CIFOR-ICRAF to restore mangroves in their village to support the creation of a crab farm. </p><p> They told Dr Zia: \"We know that without mangroves, there are no mangrove crabs.\"</p><p> Said Dr Zia: \"Usually, projects start from the top down but this project started from the bottom up.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you once again for the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources. I thank Simon and his team from SIIA for organising this event. This year's edition coincides with some key developments.<br/><br/>2. First, the cost of renewable energy has fallen in recent years. Today, power from renewables has become comparable with those from fossil fuels. The International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, highlighted that the high fossil fuel prices will cement a structural shift in renewable energy being the cheapest source of power generation.<br/><br/>3. Second, many governments around the world are entering elections. There are concerns that the political commitment to tackle climate change might wane in some countries. However, changes in governments do not stop climate change. We must institutionalise climate action, so that they can be more resilient regardless of the political cycles.<br/><br/>4. Third, recent climatic events remind us that realities are changing. The region has experienced blistering heatwaves in recent months; Myanmar recording its highest ever April temperatures of 48.2C; and the Philippines and Thailand seeing record temperatures with new highs and Thailand's heat index listing above 52C.<br/><br/>5. Elsewhere, we see rising incidence in flooding events in Pakistan and China. Last month, northern ASEAN was blanketed with thick haze, and the UAE experienced the heaviest rainfall in 75 years.<br/><br/>6. These have a direct impact on health, the economy, productivity, and food production.<br/><br/>COP28 Global Stocktake<br/><br/>7. The inaugural Global Stocktake at COP28 acknowledged that the world has made some progress on climate action since the Paris Agreement, but emphasised the need for more urgent and decisive climate actions within this critical decade to keep our 1.5C goal within reach.<br/><br/>8. The Global Stocktake was an important milestone, as the international community collectively agreed to move from setting broad-based net zero targets to definitive steps towards the implementation of transition pathways and climate mitigation.<br/><br/>9. When the gavel fell at COP28, there was agreement by all Parties to transition away from fossil fuels in our energy systems, triple renewable energy capacity globally, and double energy efficiency improvements globally by 2030. Parties also agreed to accelerate zero and low-emission technologies, including nuclear, carbon capture, utilisation and storage and low-carbon hydrogen. This may not seem very earth-breaking shattering to industry outsiders, but within the climate circuit, technologies such as nuclear and carbon capture have not always been universally accepted. The fact that they were all mentioned as an acceptable pathway at COP28, to Singapore, a country that requires these technologies, was a significant step. It has a knock-on effect on the industry. It sends a signal to the industry and investors that these are acceptable technologies that will have its place in climate action.<br/><br/>10. It was also significant that Parties further agreed to strengthen their adaptation actions and to implement National Adaptation Plans by 2030. Our planetary ecosystems are intertwined. We have emphasised heavily on mitigation, but the world needs to focus on adaptation as well.<br/><br/>11. There will be resources needed for adaptation plans. We have seen in the Singapore Green Plan that adaptation measures impact our carbon footprint. Adaptation plans such as desalination is energy intensive, and it eats into our carbon footprint and budget. Singapore has included adaptation when we talk about our net zero goals. This means having to also offset carbon emissions incurred by adaptation measures. When countries discuss about their net zero goals, they must also include national adaptation into their climate action plans. It makes mitigation plans more complete and includes in this a significant element that has been missing from some countries' net zero chart. This approach ensures that no sectors or gases, including agriculture and methane emissions, are left out. That is an important move on UNFCCC's part to have our net zero target comprehensive, all-encompassing, and detailed.<br/><br/>12. Singapore is committed to following up on the UAE Consensus adopted at COP28. We have been advancing our transition efforts through the Singapore Green Plan, which includes pursuing efforts in greening the environment, promoting green transportation, pursuing zero waste, and increasing proportion of renewable energy in our energy mix, and adapting to sea level rise.<br/><br/>13. Today, I would like to focus on the opportunities in regional cooperation for green growth.<br/><br/>Green Growth Cooperation in ASEAN<br/><br/>14. A report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) stated that 5 out of the 20 countries most impacted by climate change will be in Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative for the region to accelerate climate action to safeguard lives and protect the economy. ASEAN countries need to ride on the momentum of the Global Stocktake and push ahead with their green ambitions.<br/><br/>15. It is reassuring that there is political consensus for climate action. All ASEAN nations have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and most have set net-zero targets.<br/><br/>16. However, a green, sustainable future cannot be achieved by any one country in isolation. Our collective efforts are more effective when we work together. We need effective partnerships and international cooperation to fast-track our region's energy transition. I would like to highlight some possible areas.<br/><br/>17. First, ASEAN can enhance trade of renewable energy. The Power Integration Project with Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore has been a pathfinder for a wider regional grid. By promoting renewable energy trade, ASEAN not only benefits by decarbonising the power sector, but also strengthens our joint grid resilience. This is well illustrated with the Ukraine-Russian War. Europeans, who relied on the grid that has been working well for the longest time, became more resilient when there was a disruption in the energy supply. We should take lessons from that and work on a resilient regional grid to help ASEAN weather any disruption in the future. The next step is to expand regional energy trading and aim for an ASEAN-wide power grid. The uneven distribution of renewable energy resources and the need to address the associated intermittencies of renewable energy compel us to move in this direction.<br/><br/>18. Second, ASEAN can collaborate to harmonise standards of monitoring, reporting and verification. This will not only enhance the accountability of our climate actions but also support the development of interoperable carbon markets. Since 2019, ASEAN and Japan have worked together through the Partnership to Strengthen Transparency for Co-Innovation (PaSTI), to build capabilities for MRV. The next step is a pilot implementation of greenhouse gas emission monitoring and reporting guidelines across ASEAN Member States.<br/><br/>19. Third, ASEAN can accelerate green value chain integration by leveraging trade complementarities. For example, an integrated feedstock pathway for biofuels in ASEAN can bring about win-win opportunities.<br/><br/>20. Fourth, ASEAN can attract and deploy green capital. As a financial hub, Singapore is supporting the development of transition financing. At COP28, we launched the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships (FAST-P) blended finance initiative to mobilise up to US$5 billion from public and private sector to derisk transition projects. We also launched the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION) with like-minded partners (such as DBS, OCBC, Standard Chartered, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) at COP28 to create solutions for transition credits.<br/><br/>21. Fifth, ASEAN can pool the experience of all Member States and facilitate sharing of best practices to advance climate action. Singapore offers the Sustainability Action Package of capacity-building programmes, which covers climate change adaptation, mitigation, and green finance. We will also be sharing data from the Third National Climate Change Study with ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre, so that the data can be used by ASEAN Member States to make better-informed decisions, particularly in our adaptation plans and strategies.<br/><br/>22. Finally, ASEAN can promote and share solutions for sustainable agroforestry. Properly managed agroforestry systems act as carbon sinks and enhances agricultural production. It helps to lower the risks of forest fires, which in turn will protect the lives and livelihoods of the farmers and local communities.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>23. It is imperative that ASEAN work together to accelerate its green transition. ASEAN can leverage the benefits of regional complementarity, create economies of scale, and drive opportunities for green growth.<br/><br/>24. In so doing, it not only helps ASEAN countries to meet their respective net-zero and sustainable development goals, it also brings prosperity to the 670 million population in the region through green investment and job creation.<br/><br/>25. I hope the 11th Singapore Dialogue for Sustainable World Resources will inspire stakeholders to push for greater regional collaboration, and I would like to thank SIIA once again for their efforts today.<br/><br/>26. I wish you fruitful discussions ahead.

These include carbon capture technologies, forest restoration, swopping pollutive cookstoves for cleaner ones, and renewable energy projects. </p><p> Not all projects can make the cut. In late 2023, Singapore released a set of eligibility criteria to ensure that credits and projects are of high quality. </p><p> For example, in calculating the amount of emissions removed by a mangrove planting project, the calculations must be made in a conservative and transparent way, and measured and verified by an independent third party. </p><p> The National Environment Agency also released a list of specific types of projects or methodologies that Singapore is willing to accept, based on existing carbon crediting programmes. These include international carbon credits that come from offshore wind technology and cleaner cookstoves. </p><p> Internationally, a recent oversupply of carbon credits from renewable energy projects failed to deliver additional climate benefits, noted Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p> How far along is Singapore in trading carbon credits'Of the 19 countries Singapore is collaborating with on carbon credits, two have finalised bilateral agreements with Singapore so far -- Papua New Guinea and Ghana. These are known as implementation agreements. </p><p> This means companies here can buy carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided the carbon projects in Papua New Guinea and Ghana meet Singapore's eligibility criteria. </p><p> Steps must be taken to prevent the double-counting of emission reductions in both the carbon credit buyer (Singapore) and the host country's national greenhouse gas inventories. </p><p> And in each agreement, climate adaptation for the host country and the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions must be prioritised. </p><p> For example, carbon credit project developers must contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana. </p><p> Project developers must also cancel 2 per cent of carbon credits at first issuance, so that those credits will not enter the carbon market. The 2 per cent has the sole purpose of reducing emissions.</p><p> These requirements are based on Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which governs the bilateral trade of carbon credits between countries. </p><p> Of the remaining 17 countries, Singapore has concluded negotiations on similar carbon credit schemes with Vietnam, Paraguay and Bhutan. The next step will be to sign the agreements. </p><p>Singapore has also signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with other countries such as Laos, Indonesia and Fiji, with the intention of collaborating on carbon credits.</p><p> A fair amount of negotiations takes place before an MOU becomes a bilateral agreement, said Ms Low. </p><p> \"This would include an assessment of the respective countries' climate targets and level of ambition and whether the respective countries have arrangements in place to transparently report on their greenhouse gas inventories,\" she added. </p><p> It took 10 months for Singapore and Ghana to conclude negotiations on their deal.</p><p> As at May, only one carbon credit transaction under Article 6.2 has taken place between Thailand and Switzerland. </p><p> According to a carbon market explainer by The Nature Conservancy, such international transactions will take time, and bilateral agreements are only the first step.</p><p> \"Countries still have several additional steps, such as providing letters of authorisation, complying with reporting requirements and, once the project is concluded, starting monitoring and verification processes. Only after the first monitoring cycle is completed can the first issuance and first transfer (of credits) take place,\" stated the report.</p><p> Checks by ST in January revealed that Singapore companies looking to buy carbon credits from Papua New Guinea must wait longer for eligible projects that are of high quality, as none of the available credits for sale currently meets the criteria set by the Singapore Government. </p><p> On June 20, it was announced that more than 100,000 improved cookstoves will be distributed to communities in Papua New Guinea that still rely on open-fire cooking. This project was approved by carbon crediting programme Verra. </p><p> The project's developer, Tasman Environmental Markets, said it is working with Singapore and Papua New Guinea to finalise the approval of its project under both countries' carbon credit agreement. </p><p> In July, Verra suspended 27 cookstove projects over allegations of over-issuance of millions of carbon credits, Ms Low pointed out.</p><p> \"So, it remains to be seen if cookstove projects in Papua New Guinea will eventually be eligible for use under Singapore's framework,\" she said.</p><p> Ms Low added that the authorities are organising a business mission to Ghana in July, and this may help companies in Singapore explore opportunities there. </p><p> How does carbon trading benefit Singapore and the host country'Carbon markets help to channel funds to nature-based and underfunded forest conservation projects that would not otherwise have been implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives. </p><p> Carbon projects can further the sustainable development of host countries, benefit local communities in terms of job creation and access to clean resources, and improve their energy security. Environmental pollution can also be reduced while protecting the rights of indigenous groups. </p><p> Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. It involves replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield the plantations from disasters and pests. </p><p> Jobs in farming and agroforestry training will be created, and there will be new income opportunities for indigenous communities. The verification of carbon credits from the Ghana project will begin in 2028.</p><p> As for Singapore, buying carbon credits can benefit carbon-tax-liable firms as the tax is set to increase. The carbon tax in 2024 has increased to $25 per tonne of CO2 emissions, up from $5 per tonne previously. By 2030, the tax will eventually reach $50 to $80 per tonne. </p><p> Companies can potentially cut their carbon tax liability if they can procure carbon credits that are lower than the prevailing tax rate of $25 per tonne, noted Ms Low. </p><p> Being an alternative-energy-disadvantaged country, Singapore can tap carbon credits to meet its national climate targets, also known as NDCs. </p><p> But this will have trade-offs for the host country. The more credits a host country exports to Singapore, the less mitigation can be claimed against its own climate goals, stated The Nature Conservancy explainer. </p><p> \"Even when domestic frameworks are in place, a more complex issue will arise as host countries define what sectors, how many units at what price they could transfer internationally without undermining the achievement of their NDCs,\" the report stated.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["How does carbon trading benefit Singapore and the host country'Carbon markets help to channel funds to nature-based and underfunded forest conservation projects that would not otherwise have been implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives.

Another edition of the World Economic Forum (WEF) has come to an end -- but what have we learnt? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Compared with a year ago, the world seems a somewhat different place. Right before the start of the gathering in Davos, WEF released its annual Global Risks Report, effectively a survey of some 1,500 global leaders across business, academia, government and others. Last year, the cost-of-living crisis topped the near-term concerns, alongside nature risks and geo-economic confrontation. This year, the tone is different. \"Misinformation and disinformation\" led the list of near-term fears, with \"societal polarisation\" not far behind. </p><p> In a year in which some four billion people are eligible to vote in an election, conversations at Davos struck a markedly more geopolitical tone. Among the first to open this year of elections, Taiwan has already gone to the polls to vote through a third term of the ruling government, while the United States election will take centre stage later in the year. Markets remain undecided on the outcome, even as discussions on geopolitical conflicts seeped their way into the Davos formal and informal nightcap sessions.</p><p> One thing remains unchanged. While perceptions of near-term risks have shifted, nature risks top the 10-year outlook. Extreme weather events, critical changes to Earth's systems and biodiversity loss head the list of concerns. And with good reason. 2023 was, like the preceding year, the warmest year on record. At a nature dinner organised by Lombard Odier to kick off the week in Davos, Professor Johan Rockstrom reminded the audience that it is now inevitable that the world will overshoot the key 1.5 degree Celsius target, with a best outcome likely seeing increases to at least 1.7 deg C or 1.8 deg C in the coming decades, before we have a hope of returning to the 1.5 deg C target.</p><p> On the Promenade, a central road running through Davos, the sustainability billboards have largely disappeared. Instead, discussions on how to tackle transitions to net zero and, increasingly, a nature-positive economy, have moved from the outdoor signboards to panel discussions and fireside encounters. </p><p> Virtue-signalling is no longer the name of the game; figuring out who has the right strategy and partnerships to quickly adopt cleaner, greener and more efficient business models that can disrupt entire industries is the new play in town. A lone billboard that still declares \"sustainability is just a few steps away!\" feels eerily out of place. Inside the improvised meeting rooms that transform a skiing village into a meeting place for the global who's who, it is all too clear that these transitions will be far from easy, but may yet allow those with the right strategy to leapfrog forward.</p><p> Getting behind AIOutside, other billboards vie for attention. Replacing the proclamations of net-zero commitments are the new signs advertising each business' respective breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). A year ago, the sudden emergence of generative AI was already the word on the snowy streets of Davos. In 2024, AI and discussions on its myriad disruptive effects were on the agenda everywhere. The shift in advertising focus from sustainability to AI is perhaps a sensible one: one represents the challenge, whereas digitally enabled optimisation and innovation may well be a central part of the solution. </p><p> Besides AI, the wooden interiors of the Davos chalets and meeting rooms perhaps provided an appropriate setting for the other topic that ascended up the WEF agenda: nature. From sessions on risks to the global food system, to a heavily over-subscribed \"nature positive dinner\", WEF participants sought to come to grips with an inevitable and increasingly clear realisation: for all the maladies and opportunities facing the global economy, the economy is vitally dependent on the ecosystem services provided by natural capital, the world's single most productive asset. </p><p> The solutions too are beginning to emerge. Recognising the not-so-hidden value of nature is but a mere first step. Encouraging markets to adequately value and allocate capital to its preservation and restoration is the much greater challenge. Shortly before Davos, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures announced that an initial cohort of 320 businesses had signed up to its much-awaited framework aiming to drive the disclosure of nature risks and opportunities. In other roundtables, financial institutions looking to engage on nature recognised that allocation capital to nature-based solutions at scale, in fact, requires us to reconsider asset allocations -- with nature emerging as a new asset class. </p><p> At Lombard Odier's own \"re-nature\" dinner, speakers and the audience explored opportunities to put theory into action, highlighting investment opportunities around the development of regenerative value chains. Coffee is a US$225 billion example, dominated by production from tropical monocultures, often characterised by falling yields and degraded soils, and with as much as half of all coffee production at risk from climate change. Transforming extractive models to ones based on agroforestry and rewilding, and a shortening of value chains to consumers, may be part of the solution to begin to drive more capital to nature at speed and scale. </p><p> Keeping up with a fast-moving worldSo in the end, did Davos 2024 change the world? Perhaps that would be too high an expectation. The world is moving quickly, and perhaps the business community assembled at Davos was struggling to keep up. But, in a year where concern over misinformation and societal cohesion is rife, this year's theme of Rebuilding Trust appeared well-chosen. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer released just before the event, global levels of trust in institutions and leaders have been on the decline, but businesses today are more trusted than government leaders. With innovation and new global challenges facing business leaders and investors, maintaining that trust requires a balancing act. </p><p> To investors, there are plenty of takeaways. Transitions to a decarbonised economy are accelerating. Parallel concerns over energy security, energy affordability and clean energy all point to the single solution of a further ramp-up in investment in new energy systems. Transformation of value chains to more regenerative alternatives will drive investment to new technologies, business models and nature-based solutions. AI will accelerate all of these transitions, enabling solutions that outcompete existing alternatives in terms of efficiency, environmental impact and financial returns. The transition is in motion, and investors on board the Davos trains appeared to be on board. </p><p> The writer is head of sustainability research at Lombard Odier Investment Managers</p>", "publisher": "The Business Times Singapore", "instances": ["Encouraging markets to adequately value and allocate capital to its preservation and restoration is the much greater challenge.

The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will rise by almost 90 per cent to 5.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over the same period.Mitigation gapThat growth rate will pose a challenge for the region to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The food, land and agriculture sector should reduce emissions by 72 per cent from base-year levels by 2050, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, according to the Science Based Targets Initiative.Ending deforestation - which occurs not only when land is cleared for livestock, but also to grow feed for animals - has the potential in most major Asian markets to lower the most emissions from the protein supply chain, ARE said.But even in the best-case scenario, in which the region achieves zero deforestation and peak industrial production by 2030, protein supply chains will not be able to sufficiently reduce emissions to be \"climate safe\" by sticking to conventional protein, which consists of meat, seafood, dairy and eggs. </p><p>To make up for that shortfall, consumption must shift significantly towards alternative protein, ARE said. Alternative proteins comprise plant-based and fermentation-derived meat substitutes, and cultivated meat.Take China, for instance. The world's largest consumer and producer of proteins, China's total annual protein consumption is expected to reach 24.9 million tonnes by 2060 under business-as-usual conditions, by ARE's estimate. That will place China's emissions at 17.9 gigatonnes of CO2e over what the country can afford in order to be climate safe. The best-case scenario from deforestation, food-waste reduction and other mitigation measures apart from transitioning to alternative proteins will reduce emissions by just 13.7 gigatonnes, leaving a shortfall of 4.2 gigatonnes.If China can switch half of its protein consumption to alternative proteins by 2050, that will reduce emissions by a further 3.8 gigatonnes, which would take the country closer to what is required to achieve net zero, ARE said.The non-protein-transition mitigation measures were insufficient in most of a further nine Asian markets that ARE analysed: India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Given that the non-protein-transition estimates were done on a best-case basis, ARE argued that transitioning towards alternative proteins is critical for the region to hit climate targets.Slow goingARE said that protein companies in Asia are slow to decarbonise. Of the 158 Asia-listed protein companies reviewed by ARE, none acknowledged the risk of deforestation-linked soya in their supply chains.While leading Chinese food companies are taking initial steps to evaluate deforestation risks in their supply chains and sourcing soya certified as \"deforestation-free\", few Chinese commodity companies, animal producers, retailers and restaurants have established verified sourcing or committed to zero deforestation, ARE said.Protein transition is still a developing space for banks in the region, ARE added. For instance, DBS has held off on committing to net-zero targets for the food and agribusiness segment, citing the lack of data and effective mitigation solutions in the sector.\"The opportunity in Asia for a first mover offering protein transition finance remains wide open\", ARE said.Still, a gradual transition to alternative proteins could be underfoot.

Human beings are displacing the planet's other species at an unprecedented rate, a disaster that the landmark UN Biodiversity Conference known as COP15 is focused on this week in Montreal. We are a unique menace, but we at least have a unique ability to recognise it and do something about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The first step towards recovery, of course, is admitting your problem, and the conference's draft plan warns upfront that a million species will face extinction if we do not clean up our act. But while the delegates in Montreal are pointing fingers at everything from plastics to pesticides to invasive species, biodiversity loss is not that complicated a mystery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The basic problem is that we have converted half of the earth's habitable land into agricultural land. We are destroying and degrading the habitats of other species to grow food for our own.</p><p> This means the fate of the world's bugs, bunnies and other creatures and critters -- and what is left of the forests, wetlands and other habitats they call home -- depends more than anything else on what we put in our mouths and how it gets made. Unfortunately, telling people what to eat and farmers how to farm are politically unpalatable tasks, which helps explain why yakfests like COP15 tend to obscure the problem with word salad.</p><p> Environmentalists hope to leave Montreal with commitments from governments to preserve 30 per cent of the earth by 2030 and to meet 21 other targets. But governments have already failed to achieve less ambitious conservation goals set for 2010 and 2020. There is also buzz around nailing down corporate commitments to greener supply chains, but COP15 is mostly dancing around the crux of the biodiversity crisis.</p><p> The crux is that if current eating and farming trends continue, the world will clear land equal to at least 1 1/4  Indias by 2050. That would be a disaster for the climate and wildlife, dooming carbon-rich and biodiverse ecosystems such as the Amazon and Congo rainforests.</p><p> So those eating and farming trends better not continue. Humanity needs to start shrinking our agricultural footprint and expanding our natural footprint, after thousands of years of doing the reverse.</p><p> This will be an extraordinary challenge, because we will also need to produce more than 7.4 quadrillion additional calories every year to feed our growing population, in an era when climate-fuelled droughts, heatwaves, floods, and blights could make it harder to grow food.</p><p> You can see why word salad can seem more appetising.</p><p> You can also see why promises to conserve land or promote deforestation-free products can ring hollow. Governments can pledge to ban land clearing, but when their people get hungry, land will get cleared. Some companies might sign agreements to avoid soya or beef from newly deforested land, but it would not do much if other companies keep buying soya or beef from newly deforested land.</p><p> If we are serious about cleaning up the mess we are making for less influential species, there are four things individuals as well as nations and corporations can do.</p><p> What we can doThe first is to eat less meat, which would be a lot easier if meat were not so beloved and delicious. Limiting access to cheeseburgers can turn politicians into former politicians, so it is no coincidence that the Montreal draft mentions changing diets only in passing in its 16th target. But the inconvenient truth is that when we eat cows, chickens and other livestock, we might as well be eating macaws, jaguars and other endangered species.</p><p> That is because livestock chew up far more land per calorie than crops. Producing beef is 100 times as land-intensive as cultivating potatoes, and 55 times as land-intensive as peas or nuts. Livestock now use nearly 80 per cent of agricultural land while producing less than 20 per cent of calories. Cattle are the leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon, followed by soya beans, another commodity, which get fed to pigs and chickens.</p><p> Meat consumption is expected to increase dramatically as billions of the global poor escape poverty. If Americans continue to average three burgers a week while the developing world starts to follow our path, it is hard to see how the Amazon survives.</p><p> But it is at least possible that we could shrink agricultural footprint by shifting our diets towards meat made without livestock, like the plant-based substitutes offered by companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat or maybe someday cultured meat grown from animal cells.</p><p> The next thing we need to do is waste less food. About a third of the food grown is lost or tossed before it reaches our mouths, which means a third of the land (as well as the water, fertiliser and other resources) used to grow that food is also wasted. But the Montreal text includes only a single mention of the need to \"halve per capita global food waste\", with no suggestions of what technological, behavioural and policy changes could help to meet such an ambitious goal.</p><p> Every hectare of land matters, because we desperately need to grow more food, provide habitats for more native flora and fauna and store more carbon to limit climate change. And that is why it is particularly crazy to use the earth's limited land to grow fuel. </p><p> The third way to ease the global land squeeze would be to stop using productive farmland for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel -- and to stop burning trees for power -- but the Montreal plan does not even address the topic.</p><p> In fact, there is global momentum to expand bioenergy's dominion over the land. A new paper in the journal Nature estimates that new European Union policies could wipe out half the continent's most biodiverse grasslands and divert a fifth of its cropland to energy crops, which would lead to land clearing overseas to replace the lost food. The EU is also promoting wood-burning power plants, a recipe for massive forest cutting around the world.</p><p> Farm and forest interests have so much political power that government efforts to increase demand for crops and wood are often considered untouchable. But if biodiversity is a real priority, they cannot be.</p><p> Finally, if we are going to shrink our agricultural footprint enough to stop deforestation and hopefully restore some degraded ecosystems, so they can once again serve as wildlife habitats and carbon sinks, farmers will have to supersize their yields enough to make a lot more food with a lot less land. And while the 20th-century's Green Revolution raised yields by using fossil fuel-derived fertilisers, toxic pesticides and other environmentally damaging innovations, the 21st century will require some greener ones that can ramp up productivity without messing up the planet.</p><p> Once again, this does not seem like a priority in Montreal. There has been much more focus on regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and other gentler, lower-yield alternatives to intensive industrial farming that can improve biodiversity on farmland. The problem is that they can require more farmland to produce the same amount of food, accelerating the destruction of the natural lands that provide far more biodiversity than farmland ever can -- and suck far more heat-trapping carbon from our overloaded atmosphere.</p><p> Earth now has more than 5 billion ha of agricultural land, an area twice the size of North America.

This could lead to existing plantations being counted as forest and the establishment of new ones considered reforestation.  First proposed in 2018, such a move is gaining traction with a team of forestry experts at Bogor-based IPB University finalising research that includes water absorption, carbon emissions and wildlife diversity. The research has received funding from the Indonesian Oil Palm Growers Association. </p><p> The idea is to allow growers and companies to cultivate the valuable crop in degraded forest, Professor Yanto Santosa, leader of the research team, told The Straits Times in an interview. He underlined that he was against the move to clear natural forests for oil palm.  \"The fact is the government has yet to be capable of meeting its target to rehabilitate degraded forest that totalled around 14 million ha,\" he said, referring to 2018 data. Prof Yanto said that when oil palm is cultivated in degraded forest areas, it will count as reforestation. \"Oil palm planted in forest areas should not be a problem then,\" he said.  Around 126 million ha, or nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's land mass, are designated as \"forest area\". Much of it, or 70 per cent, still has tree cover, while the remainder is categorised as \"degraded\" forest.  However, any kind of clearing is normally prohibited on land classified under both categories. Certain \"productive\" activities, such as agroforestry and logging, are allowed, but oil palm cultivation is prohibited. Most oil plantations are on agricultural land.  The IPB proposal also encourages the inclusion of oil palm plantations in Indonesia's carbon reduction goals, in contrast to studies showing that clearing forests for oil palm causes a huge amount of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss.  Indonesia has 16.4 million ha of oil palm plantations and reclassifying oil palm as a forest crop will automatically result in additional forest area, said Prof Yanto.  \"That should be counted in the NDC (nationally determined contribution),\" he said. NDCs are national climate plans that are pledged under the United Nations' Paris climate agreement as steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Last July, Indonesia, among the world's top 10 carbon emitters, brought forward its target for net-zero emissions from 2070 to 2060 or sooner. It is also working towards a goal to cut emissions by 29 per cent by 2030 or by 41 per cent with international financial support. Forestry, energy and transportation make up 97 per cent of its NDC.  The dean of IPB's school of forestry, Dr Naresworo Nugroho, said oil palm can absorb 57.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare each year, more than other timber trees such as teak (21 tonnes) and pine (20 tonnes).  Other academicians and green groups, however, have criticised the proposal. Dr Sigit Sunarta, the dean of the forestry school at Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada University, told ST that if the proposal is adopted and oil palm is planted in forest areas, Indonesia will lose international recognition for its fight against deforestation.  Cultivating oil palm in forest areas will further \"change the configuration of Indonesia's tropical rainforest\", Dr Sigit said. Massive expansion of the plantations in forest areas has already triggered rampant deforestation, reduced biodiversity and significantly increased the frequency of ecological disasters such as drought, floods and forest fires, he noted.  An agroecology expert from the University of Jambi, Dr Asmadi Saad, echoed this view, saying that the widespread expansion of oil palm plantations in Jambi province in Sumatra has caused a number of ecological changes.  He cited Batanghari River in the province, where the flow of water has been affected because much of the land at its headwaters has been converted into plantations. The number of fish, such as eels, has also dropped sharply.  Dr Asmadi also fears that with the IPB proposal, forest will be destroyed first to turn it into \"degraded\" forest to justify the cultivation of oil palm. This has already been seen in the past when large areas of land earmarked as forest concessions for logging activity were converted into plantations.  Ms Anggalia Putri, the knowledge management manager at green group Madani Berkelanjutan, is concerned that the proposal will change mindsets, serving as justification for the expansion of oil palm plantations to grow the industry.  \"The time has come for Indonesia to put a cap (on the size of oil palm plantations it can have) and a road map on this commodity. Otherwise, the industry will get stuck in the upstream side and keep on expanding in idle forest areas,\" she told ST.      126m ha Indonesia's land mass designated as \"forest area\"  16.4m ha Area occupied by oil palm plantations.   </p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["Prof Yanto said that when oil palm is cultivated in degraded forest areas, it will count as reforestation. \"Oil palm planted in forest areas should not be a problem then,\" he said.

But the study also pointed to ways to overcome these constraints. \"Even a moderate reduction in opportunity costs could almost double the climate mitigation potential of reforestation,\" said Dr Zeng. This could include solutions such as involving farmers in the reforestation process through agroforestry initiatives, he said. Such efforts, which involve the planting of stands of forests on agricultural land, could allow reforestation to be carried out without compromising on community livelihoods or food security. Professor Nophea Sasaki, a forestry and carbon expert at the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand who was not involved in the latest study, said the paper provides useful information about the potential land availability for reforestation in South-east Asia and the implications for climate policy. \"Reforestation can also improve ecosystem functions and services, and stimulate local economic growth through job creation and conservation of biodiversity,\" said Prof Sasaki. But he noted the importance of selecting the right tree species for reforestation, as choosing non-native species could have adverse consequences for the environment. More research needs to be done on how reforested lands can be managed to inform policy, he said."]}, {"relevance_score": 17, "title": "Economic benefits of protecting nature exceed cost: Report", "published": "2020-07-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The economic benefits of protecting nature in just 30 per cent of the planet's land and ocean areas far outweigh the cost of doing so by a factor of five to one, a new and extensive report on the issue has shown.</p><p> Currently, roughly 15 per cent of the world's land and 7 per cent of its ocean has some degree of protection.</p><p> The report, published yesterday, said additional protections for nature would lead to an average of US$250 billion (S$348.9 billion) in increased economic output and an average of US$350 billion in improved ecosystem services annually.</p><p> The independent report by more than 100 scientists and economists for National Geographic and Campaign for Nature, which works with scientists, indigenous people and over 100 conservation organisations around the world, is titled \"Protecting 30 per cent of the planet for nature: costs, benefits and economic implications\".</p><p> It analysed the cost and benefits across multiple sectors, including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and nature conservation.</p><p> It also measured the financial impact of protected areas on the global economy, and highlighted the non-monetary benefits, such as ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, flood protection, clean water and soil conservation.</p><p> \"Across all measures, the experts find that the benefits are greater when more nature is protected as opposed to maintaining the status quo,\" the report said.</p><p> The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity has included the 30 per cent protected-area goal in its draft 10-year strategy, which is expected to be finalised by the convention's 196 parties next year in Kunming, China.</p><p> \"With such clear economic and scientific data, momentum continues to build for a landmark global agreement,\" said the report.</p><p> It said the findings followed growing scientific evidence that at least 30 per cent of the planet's land and ocean must be protected to address the alarming collapse of the natural world that now threatens up to one million species with extinction.</p><p> \"Our report shows that protection in today's economy brings in more revenue than the alternatives and likely adds revenue to agriculture and forestry, while helping prevent climate change, water crises, biodiversity loss and disease.</p><p> \"Increasing nature protection is sound policy for governments juggling multiple interests,\" said Dr Anthony Waldron, a biodiversity finance and agroforestry specialist, and lead author of the report.</p><p> \"You cannot put a price tag on nature - but the economic numbers point to its protection,\" he added.</p><p> The world currently invests just over US$24 billion a year in protected areas.

There is enormous potential for nature if we take the right approach.\"</p><p> Pollination and HSBC have formed a venture to invest in nature-based solutions, and other major investors around the globe, including Singapore, are also eyeing the burgeoning carbon market. That's good for Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya. Both have seen a surge in buying of their carbon offsets and expect prices to steadily rise from the present range of US$4 to US$8 a tonne, with buyers keen to lock in future flows of offsets even if prices are higher.</p><p> TRACK RECORD What helps is that both projects have a strong track record and have achieved the highest standards in the market covering carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection and community development. Rimba Raya last year was certified as meeting all 17 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> Both projects use carbon credit sales to support more than 40 villages - 34 for Katingan Mentaya and 11 for Rimba Raya. The projects have developed a wide variety of livelihood and health programmes, including food production as well as employing locals as fire wardens and in tree nurseries for replanting cleared areas. Katingan Mentaya employs more than 400 local people to protect the forest during the fire season and has also replaced \"river toilets\" with cleaner land-based latrines.</p><p> Rimba Raya has expanded its orangutan release sites deep in the forest, is replanting mangroves along the coast nearby and also launched a floating health clinic that travels along the Seruyan river, which borders the project.</p><p> \"We built a boat and staffed it with government nurses and doctors and it goes village to village.

Investors, such as Pollination Group, a climate advisory in Australia, and banking giant HSBC, say that nature is greatly undervalued and billions of dollars of investment are needed to create nature as a new asset class.</p><p> \"It is critical to finance global rainforests,\" says Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founder. \"They are not only critical to climate change but also to the preservation of global biodiversity. They are disappearing at a rate of knots and they need large-scale climate finance. And critically they are home to indigenous communities. There is enormous potential for nature if we take the right approach.\"</p><p> Pollination and HSBC have formed a venture to invest in nature-based solutions, and other major investors around the globe, including Singapore, are also eyeing the burgeoning carbon market. That's good for Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya. Both have seen a surge in buying of their carbon offsets and expect prices to steadily rise from the present range of US$4 to US$8 a tonne, with buyers keen to lock in future flows of offsets even if prices are higher.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TRACK RECORD&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; What helps is that both projects have a strong track record and have achieved the highest standards in the market covering carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection and community development. Rimba Raya last year was certified as meeting all 17 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> Both projects use carbon credit sales to support more than 40 villages - 34 for Katingan Mentaya and 11 for Rimba Raya. The projects have developed a wide variety of livelihood and health programmes, including food production as well as employing locals as fire wardens and in tree nurseries for replanting cleared areas. Katingan Mentaya employs more than 400 local people to protect the forest during the fire season and has also replaced \"river toilets\" with cleaner land-based latrines.</p><p> Rimba Raya has expanded its orangutan release sites deep in the forest, is replanting mangroves along the coast nearby and also launched a floating health clinic that travels along the Seruyan river, which borders the project.</p><p> \"We built a boat and staffed it with government nurses and doctors and it goes village to village. People line up for health checks. That's been an incredible success,\" says project co-developer Jim Procanik.</p><p> Mr Todd Lemons, chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based firm InfiniteEarth, which is the project's developer, says: \"Optometry has been the big one. Giving people glasses so they can see for the first time.\"</p><p> Mr Procanik adds: \"The other thing that is life-changing is we have dug wells in many of the villages and set up a water filtration system. We've set it up as a local business that they own.\"</p><p> Speaking from the US, they say that the increase in carbon revenues of late means that they can spend more on programmes, including more orangutan release sites and running the health clinic more often.</p><p> And, after more than a decade and spending about US$5 million, the project is finally paying for itself. \"We are just now beginning to pay back investors,\" says Mr Lemons. \"As things have improved, we are dramatically stepping up what we're doing this year and next year, things that we always wanted to do but were big-ticket items.\"</p><p> One of those is agroforestry by developing previously degraded areas and planting native crops in a mixed-crop fashion. \"But they will all be cash crops - spices, oils. So they can reforest in the most polycultural fashion possible and also that this will deliver permanent income to communities,\" Mr Lemons says.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GET WILD&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; These sorts of community benefits, on top of carbon sequestration, are what many investors and credit buyers are looking for.</p><p> Ms Leah Wieczorek, business development lead - Asia, for South Pole, a leading global carbon offset project developer, says that there is a clear trend in the market for higher-impact carbon offsets.</p><p> \"While many companies were extremely price-driven in the past, today they are seeking more qualifications and co-benefits,\" she says, referring to credits eligible under the UN's aviation emissions reduction scheme as well as projects that support the health of women and children.</p><p> \"There is also a growing awareness that climate action and protecting ecosystems go hand in hand: We see a clear trend for nature-based solutions, especially when it comes to long-term offtake agreements,\" she says.</p><p> Looking ahead, Mr Procanik says that there is strong interest in selling Rimba Raya's future credits. \"Everyone in the market foresees there is going to be a robust liquid market. The market today is not yet liquid, I believe it will be soon, and definitely five years in the future. What I believe is that people are positioning themselves for the future.\"</p><p> By then, Mr Procanik and Mr Lemons expect their carbon credits to be worth US$20 to US$30 a tonne.</p><p> After a decade, both projects underscore that protecting nature is not easy and takes time. \"Protecting nature and addressing climate change have no quick fixes,\" says Katingan Mentaya's Mr Dharsono. \"We must create the right conditions for nature to do what it does best: grow, get wild and lock in carbon.\"</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["We've set it up as a local business that they own.

Last year, I spoke about the benefits that a sustainable agroforestry sector can bring to the region, and the roles that the government, civil society and the financial community play in encouraging the sustainable development of the sector. I am happy to see the progress made by the various stakeholders over the past year.</p><p>3. Sustainable development is often defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Extreme advocates of sustainability may come across as arguing against all forms of development - for example that every inch of forest must be saved in the same state as today. This extreme position is difficult to defend because it ignores the real and legitimate needs of the present generation. The palm oil sector, for example, brings important economic benefits to the region. Palm oil contributes an estimated 2-2.5% to the Gross National Product in Indonesia, and is the fourth largest contributor to Gross National Income in Malaysia. It also supports the transition of many communities out of poverty and significantly improves the lives of smallholder farmers. With demand for palm oil projected to grow by another 50% by 2020, there is tremendous potential for growth.</p><p>4. And yet, we are all acutely aware of the social and environmental costs that an expanding agro-forestry sector has brought. Social conflict between indigenous communities and corporates is common, due to discrepancies in land allocation. New areas for cultivation of palm oil often come at the expense of the rainforest, and all the resources it contains.</p><p>5. It is therefore critical that we continue to strike the right balance by actively shaping the agro-forestry sector into a more sustainable one. Let me elaborate on how various stakeholders can collectively work together to achieve sustainable supply chains for the agroforestry sector.</p><p>6. First, a credible, strong and vibrant civil society serves as a catalyst for change, to broaden and deepen environmental consciousness among the population. There have been promising domestic developments and ground-up efforts by civil society over the past year. Let me name a few.</p><p>7. WWF Singapore and founding members Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, have established the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO) in June last year. The Alliance sends an unequivocal signal to consumers that many major businesses are committed to the production, usage and trade of certified sustainable palm oil. I hope their numbers will grow quickly. These companies and organisations lend credibility to the alliance for sustainability. This is both because they walk the talk, but more importantly, they have a deep knowledge of sustainability issues in the real world and how to steer and shape them. Since the establishment of the Alliance, more Singapore based companies have been engaged on their sourcing and policies on palm oil. I encourage companies to make the transition to sustainable palm oil by joining like-minded companies to source responsibly through SASPO.</p><p>8. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) had in January this year announced a new and more holistic green label category for pulp and paper products which encompasses peatland management and fire prevention standards as part of its criteria. The new category maintains one of the most stringent environmental performance standards globally, and requires companies to have their entire supply chain audited against these criteria. The Government will support companies in this effort by only procuring printing paper with this label in future.</p><p>9. The SEC also launched a new certification category for palm oil-based products last year. When it has taken off, the new category for palm oil products under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) will lead to greater transparency in the palm oil supply chain and provide consumers greater assurance of sustainable sourcing.</p><p>10. Through its #GoHazeFree campaign, the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM. Haze) has been encouraging households and industry to switch to haze-free palm oil as part of its outreach programme. PM.Haze has also produced a \"Haze-Free Cooking Oil\" Guide.</p><p>11. The government strongly supports these ground-up initiatives that will allow for more informed purchasing decisions and influence consumers towards more environmentally sustainable attitudes and behaviours.But I hope that our NGOs will also deepen their expertise in the area they are championing. This is the best way the government and the civil society can work together so that as the government legislates for sustainability, NGOs have the credibility to help shape our society that supports sustainability.</p><p>12. Second, sustainability should no longer be an afterthought for companies, as it can directly impact the bottom line. With increasing global awareness of the impact of unsustainable farming practices, a lack of oversight over supply chains can result in serious reputational and financial risks for companies.</p><p>13. Hence, forward-looking companies are already taking steps to realize sustainability targets in their supply chain. Unilever is one such example. In 2015, Unilever only had 19% of its palm oil physically certified, but it has committed to increasing this figure to 100% by 2019. Others such as Mars, Mondelez, Nestle, Cargill and Olam have also taken steps in the same directions. They are sending a strong and right signal to the industry.</p><p>14. However, having a strong public showing of a company's sustainable commitment is not sufficient. In a landscape where the traceability of agroforestry commodities is often elusive, this has to be matched by the concrete actions a company takes to scrutinize its upstream suppliers. Recently, a report by the Rainforest Action Network uncovered illegal clearing activities at a UNESCO world heritage rainforest site in Sumatra. This prompted Nestle to raise concerns over unsustainably-produced palm oil that it could have acquired from its upstream supplier. Nestle's upstream supplier subsequently responded by putting on hold purchases from the alleged producer of unsustainable palm oil.</p><p>15. This episode shows that companies cannot let their guard down when it comes to upholding sustainability standards. It is only with continued vigilance - constantly making suppliers accountable, weeding out bad players, and so on - that we can move towards a truly sustainable and reputable agroforestry sector.</p><p>16. Third, governments in the region have moved individually and collectively to act on forest and land fires.</p><p>17. Our region has set its sights on achieving a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. Last year, ASEAN Member States developed and adopted a Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control.</p><p>18. Each ASEAN Member State is doing its part to turn this vision into reality. Indonesia has taken positive actions to contain the number of hotspots over the past year. In 2016, there were just over a hundred hotspots as compared to many thousands in 2015. After Riau and Jambi began experiencing land and forest fires from mid-Jan 2017 as a result of drier weather conditions, Indonesia acted expeditiously by declaring a state of emergency in Riau on 24 Jan 2017. This allowed for the timely deployment of resources and tighter coordination between the central and provincial authorities in containing the fires.</p><p>19. More importantly, there are longer-term measures being put in place to address forest and land fires at source. Just last year, the Indonesian Government announced a five-year moratorium on new licenses to establish palm oil concessions. The moratorium will halt the draining and clearing of new carbon-rich peatland. This decision extends to concession land previously licensed to plantation companies as well. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme Mr Erik Solheim recently praised this move by President Jokowi, calling it a positive and historic decision, both for Indonesia and for global efforts to tackle climate change[1].</p><p>20. While the central government actively tackles the haze problem, provincial governments also play a critical role. Under the leadership of Governor Alex Noerdin, the South Sumatra province is taking on an exemplary role by embarking on a Green Growth Development plan. As you have heard, the plan adopts a multi-stakeholder approach towards the sustainable management of forested lands. In June last year, more than 2,700 independent smallholders covering 5,500 ha in South Sumatra received the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. This is currently the world's largest individual group of independent smallholders to be RSPO-certified[2]. I was not in the room but was told that Governor Alex Noerdin made a pledge today that this year, there will be no haze coming from the South Sumatra region. Thank you Governor.</p><p>21. Since its establishment in 2016, Indonesia's Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) has also gone from strength to strength in its peatland mapping exercise despite the challenges it had faced with plantation companies. It has also achieved successes in working together with NGOs and local communities on peatland restoration projects.For instance, BRG recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Alliance of the Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago to drive peatland restoration efforts and empower indigenous communities economically. BRG's efforts bode well for the sustainable growth and development of the agriforestry sector.</p><p>22. Fourth, nascent sustainable financing efforts are gradually gaining a foothold in our domestic financial sector.</p><p>23. Following the launch of the Association of Banks of Singapore's (ABS) Responsible Financing Guidelines in 2015, ABS member banks are now expected to factor into their lending and investment policies sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, resource efficiency, labour standards, and corporate integrity. The local banks have since established internal taskforces on environment, social and governance issues, to help integrate the ABS Guidelines into their lending and business practices. Banks have also implemented environmental risk weightings as part of their loan assessment criteria. Loan decisions relating to companies which are assessed to have high environmental risks will be escalated to the banks' senior management. More recently, the ABS has also introduced specific guidelines for banks on dealing with haze-related risks, such as no open burning on plantations and building capacity on fire prevention with local communities.</p><p>24. Investment firms have also moved to anchor sustainability in their investment processes. Temasek recently established a new sustainability and stewardship group to lead the company's future initiatives around the themes of sustainability and stewardship. This is an important move that demonstrates the growing role that investment firms can play to drive sustainability, and bring about green transformation in the financial sector. I hope it will inspire and spur other financial institutions to do the same.</p><p>25. As the region develops, private sector financing will play an increasingly important role in infrastructure and project finance. If private capital can be directed to projects that take environmental factors into account, projects that engage in unsustainable business practices will be starved of credit. This will help to gradually shift the business landscape towards more sustainable practices. As a leading capital market in the Asia-Pacific, Singapore is well-poised to play an influential role in making this happen.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Each and every one of us has a part to play in realizing a sustainable agroforestry sector in the region. Governments need the political will to act quickly to curb forest and land fires, and will have to take on a larger custodial role in safeguarding the rainforest and high carbon-stock areas. Civil society will need to continue fostering the environmental consciousness of the people, while keeping businesses on their toes as it pushes for greater transparency.

Sustainable development is often defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

New areas for cultivation of palm oil often come at the expense of the rainforest, and all the resources it contains. 5. It is therefore critical that we continue to strike the right balance by actively shaping the agro-forestry sector into a more sustainable one. Let me elaborate on how various stakeholders can collectively work together to achieve sustainable supply chains for the agroforestry sector. 6.

However, having a strong public showing of a company's sustainable commitment is not sufficient. In a landscape where the traceability of agroforestry commodities is often elusive, this has to be matched by the concrete actions a company takes to scrutinize its upstream suppliers. Recently, a report by the Rainforest Action Network uncovered illegal clearing activities at a UNESCO world heritage rainforest site in Sumatra. This prompted Nestle to raise concerns over unsustainably-produced palm oil that it could have acquired from its upstream supplier.

Sustainable development is often defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Extreme advocates of sustainability may come across as arguing against all forms of development - for example that every inch of forest must be saved in the same state as today. This extreme position is difficult to defend because it ignores the real and legitimate needs of the present generation. The palm oil sector, for example, brings important economic benefits to the region. Palm oil contributes an estimated 2-2.5% to the Gross National Product in Indonesia, and is the fourth largest contributor to Gross National Income in Malaysia. It also supports the transition of many communities out of poverty and significantly improves the lives of smallholder farmers. With demand for palm oil projected to grow by another 50% by 2020, there is tremendous potential for growth.</p><p>4. And yet, we are all acutely aware of the social and environmental costs that an expanding agro-forestry sector has brought. Social conflict between indigenous communities and corporates is common, due to discrepancies in land allocation. New areas for cultivation of palm oil often come at the expense of the rainforest, and all the resources it contains.</p><p>5. It is therefore critical that we continue to strike the right balance by actively shaping the agro-forestry sector into a more sustainable one. Let me elaborate on how various stakeholders can collectively work together to achieve sustainable supply chains for the agroforestry sector.</p><p>6. First, a credible, strong and vibrant civil society serves as a catalyst for change, to broaden and deepen environmental consciousness among the population. There have been promising domestic developments and ground-up efforts by civil society over the past year. Let me name a few.</p><p>7. WWF Singapore and founding members Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, have established the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO) in June last year. The Alliance sends an unequivocal signal to consumers that many major businesses are committed to the production, usage and trade of certified sustainable palm oil. I hope their numbers will grow quickly. These companies and organisations lend credibility to the alliance for sustainability. This is both because they walk the talk, but more importantly, they have a deep knowledge of sustainability issues in the real world and how to steer and shape them. Since the establishment of the Alliance, more Singapore based companies have been engaged on their sourcing and policies on palm oil. I encourage companies to make the transition to sustainable palm oil by joining like-minded companies to source responsibly through SASPO.</p><p>8. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) had in January this year announced a new and more holistic green label category for pulp and paper products which encompasses peatland management and fire prevention standards as part of its criteria. The new category maintains one of the most stringent environmental performance standards globally, and requires companies to have their entire supply chain audited against these criteria. The Government will support companies in this effort by only procuring printing paper with this label in future.</p><p>9. The SEC also launched a new certification category for palm oil-based products last year. When it has taken off, the new category for palm oil products under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) will lead to greater transparency in the palm oil supply chain and provide consumers greater assurance of sustainable sourcing.</p><p>10. Through its #GoHazeFree campaign, the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM. Haze) has been encouraging households and industry to switch to haze-free palm oil as part of its outreach programme. PM.Haze has also produced a \"Haze-Free Cooking Oil\" Guide.</p><p>11. The government strongly supports these ground-up initiatives that will allow for more informed purchasing decisions and influence consumers towards more environmentally sustainable attitudes and behaviours.But I hope that our NGOs will also deepen their expertise in the area they are championing. This is the best way the government and the civil society can work together so that as the government legislates for sustainability, NGOs have the credibility to help shape our society that supports sustainability.</p><p>12. Second, sustainability should no longer be an afterthought for companies, as it can directly impact the bottom line. With increasing global awareness of the impact of unsustainable farming practices, a lack of oversight over supply chains can result in serious reputational and financial risks for companies.</p><p>13. Hence, forward-looking companies are already taking steps to realize sustainability targets in their supply chain. Unilever is one such example. In 2015, Unilever only had 19% of its palm oil physically certified, but it has committed to increasing this figure to 100% by 2019. Others such as Mars, Mondelez, Nestle, Cargill and Olam have also taken steps in the same directions. They are sending a strong and right signal to the industry.</p><p>14. However, having a strong public showing of a company's sustainable commitment is not sufficient. In a landscape where the traceability of agroforestry commodities is often elusive, this has to be matched by the concrete actions a company takes to scrutinize its upstream suppliers. Recently, a report by the Rainforest Action Network uncovered illegal clearing activities at a UNESCO world heritage rainforest site in Sumatra. This prompted Nestle to raise concerns over unsustainably-produced palm oil that it could have acquired from its upstream supplier. Nestle's upstream supplier subsequently responded by putting on hold purchases from the alleged producer of unsustainable palm oil.</p><p>15. This episode shows that companies cannot let their guard down when it comes to upholding sustainability standards. It is only with continued vigilance - constantly making suppliers accountable, weeding out bad players, and so on - that we can move towards a truly sustainable and reputable agroforestry sector.</p><p>16. Third, governments in the region have moved individually and collectively to act on forest and land fires.</p><p>17. Our region has set its sights on achieving a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. Last year, ASEAN Member States developed and adopted a Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control.</p><p>18. Each ASEAN Member State is doing its part to turn this vision into reality. Indonesia has taken positive actions to contain the number of hotspots over the past year. In 2016, there were just over a hundred hotspots as compared to many thousands in 2015. After Riau and Jambi began experiencing land and forest fires from mid-Jan 2017 as a result of drier weather conditions, Indonesia acted expeditiously by declaring a state of emergency in Riau on 24 Jan 2017. This allowed for the timely deployment of resources and tighter coordination between the central and provincial authorities in containing the fires.</p><p>19. More importantly, there are longer-term measures being put in place to address forest and land fires at source. Just last year, the Indonesian Government announced a five-year moratorium on new licenses to establish palm oil concessions. The moratorium will halt the draining and clearing of new carbon-rich peatland. This decision extends to concession land previously licensed to plantation companies as well. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme Mr Erik Solheim recently praised this move by President Jokowi, calling it a positive and historic decision, both for Indonesia and for global efforts to tackle climate change[1].</p><p>20. While the central government actively tackles the haze problem, provincial governments also play a critical role. Under the leadership of Governor Alex Noerdin, the South Sumatra province is taking on an exemplary role by embarking on a Green Growth Development plan. As you have heard, the plan adopts a multi-stakeholder approach towards the sustainable management of forested lands. In June last year, more than 2,700 independent smallholders covering 5,500 ha in South Sumatra received the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. This is currently the world's largest individual group of independent smallholders to be RSPO-certified[2]. I was not in the room but was told that Governor Alex Noerdin made a pledge today that this year, there will be no haze coming from the South Sumatra region. Thank you Governor.</p><p>21. Since its establishment in 2016, Indonesia's Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) has also gone from strength to strength in its peatland mapping exercise despite the challenges it had faced with plantation companies. It has also achieved successes in working together with NGOs and local communities on peatland restoration projects.For instance, BRG recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Alliance of the Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago to drive peatland restoration efforts and empower indigenous communities economically. BRG's efforts bode well for the sustainable growth and development of the agriforestry sector.</p><p>22. Fourth, nascent sustainable financing efforts are gradually gaining a foothold in our domestic financial sector.</p><p>23. Following the launch of the Association of Banks of Singapore's (ABS) Responsible Financing Guidelines in 2015, ABS member banks are now expected to factor into their lending and investment policies sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, resource efficiency, labour standards, and corporate integrity. The local banks have since established internal taskforces on environment, social and governance issues, to help integrate the ABS Guidelines into their lending and business practices. Banks have also implemented environmental risk weightings as part of their loan assessment criteria. Loan decisions relating to companies which are assessed to have high environmental risks will be escalated to the banks' senior management. More recently, the ABS has also introduced specific guidelines for banks on dealing with haze-related risks, such as no open burning on plantations and building capacity on fire prevention with local communities.</p><p>24. Investment firms have also moved to anchor sustainability in their investment processes. Temasek recently established a new sustainability and stewardship group to lead the company's future initiatives around the themes of sustainability and stewardship. This is an important move that demonstrates the growing role that investment firms can play to drive sustainability, and bring about green transformation in the financial sector. I hope it will inspire and spur other financial institutions to do the same.</p><p>25. As the region develops, private sector financing will play an increasingly important role in infrastructure and project finance. If private capital can be directed to projects that take environmental factors into account, projects that engage in unsustainable business practices will be starved of credit. This will help to gradually shift the business landscape towards more sustainable practices. As a leading capital market in the Asia-Pacific, Singapore is well-poised to play an influential role in making this happen.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Each and every one of us has a part to play in realizing a sustainable agroforestry sector in the region. Governments need the political will to act quickly to curb forest and land fires, and will have to take on a larger custodial role in safeguarding the rainforest and high carbon-stock areas.

The maximum penalty of S$2 million - to be imposed on companies guilty of causing haze for a continuous period of 20 days or more - may seem punitive, but it is, in fact, a paltry sum to agroforestry firms, which make hundreds of millions, if not billions, in profits every year. If we take the net profit of seven key agroforestry companies last year, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that S$2 million represents less than 1 per cent of their average earnings. </p><p>Still, even if the fine is not sufficiently high to hurt the bottom lines of bigger players, a conviction should be a strong-enough damper as companies would not want to put their reputations at risk.

It would be good if an additional provision can be introduced to allow third-party groups, such as a public hospital or non-governmental organisation, to act on their behalf. </p><p>Overlapping land concessions in Indonesia are another nagging problem. In Indonesia, which is home to around 70 per cent of the peatlands in South-east Asia, it is not uncommon for the central government, state government agencies or even community leaders to issue permits for the same plot of land to different parties. Worse, such information is not always consolidated and updated at the national level. </p><p>While the amended Bill has cast the judicial net wider to make sure all parties involved can be hauled to court, the Government should explore whether to make it explicit that overlapping concessions cannot be accepted as a defence. If such a provision is included in the revised Bill, it would strengthen the deterrence against slash-and-burn or, at least, nudge companies operating on the ground to start working on fire management plans collectively. </p><p>Also, Singapore's collection of fines should not be seen as self-serving. If the court-imposed fines can be partially channelled to the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Pollution Control Fund to help finance haze-fighting efforts in neighbouring countries, it will help boost regional leaders' receptivity towards the Bill, since their citizens living closest to the hot spots are most likely to benefit from the fund.</p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION IS KEY </p><p>Lastly, it is also imperative to secure the cooperation of all Association of South-east Asian Nations governments to operationalise the haze monitoring system (HMS). The system can then host information on hot spot locations and concession maps, so such data can be used as evidence in court. </p><p>Leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, in principle, endorsed the HMS last year, when all three countries experienced one of the worst episodes of haze in recent years, but concession maps have yet to be submitted. Without credible evidence on exactly who owns the land where the fires occurred, legal action specified in Singapore's Transboundary Haze Pollution Bill cannot be taken further. </p><p>It is a pity that Indonesia's outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono would probably be unable to see through the implementation of the HMS during the remaining months of his term. With the imminent swearing-in of a new administration, it is important for Singapore to start engaging the next batch of leaders and officials. </p><p>Although environmental concerns did not feature prominently in the just-concluded Indonesian presidential election, candidate Joko Widodo - a forestry graduate - had made clear his resolve to tackle overlapping land permits in his team's manifesto. Mr Prabowo Subianto, who had lived in Singapore when his economist father was forced into exile, also had frequent contact with leaders here during his days in the military. </p><p>Not a bad start, it seems, for our leaders and officials to register Singapore's concerns on Indonesia's agenda. </p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><p>Chua Chin Wei is deputy director and fellow for the environment and resources and Cheong Poh Kwan is a policy research analyst at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. </p>", "publisher": "Today (Singapore) - Online", "instances": ["The newly-proposed fine for haze crimes is a crystal-clear sign of the Government's determination to stop slash-and-burn tactics used by the agroforestry resource sector in land clearing.

Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) pointed out that the financial penalties, which are up to $100,000 a day and go up to a maximum of $2 million, may represent only a small sum to large agroforestry firms. Ms Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon GRC) said the fines should be doubled or even tripled. \"The fines in the Bill may not be sufficient deterrent against offenders who will weigh the cost of the fine if they are caught, against the profits they will gain. Monitoring and locating hot spots takes up government resources, while haze also incurs economic and personal health losses here, she added. In addition, the new law should contain a provision for whistleblowers, she said. Mr de Souza said errant companies' use of illegal slash-and-burn land clearing methods should be exposed, and urged consumers to pressure them economically."]}, {"relevance_score": 20, "title": "APP committed to stopping haze and zero deforestation", "published": "2016-04-27", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">We refer to the letter \"Tackling new mills a key way to stop the haze at source\" (April 23).

But sticking to this conviction was not easy, said Mr Hartono, who received plenty of criticism for his business premise.</p><p> It took more than 10 years and millions of dollars in investment before the company finally turned a profit last year, he said. \"We have finally proven that the forest is worth saving,\" he said.</p><p> Today, Katingan Mentaya is an example of a Redd+ project - a voluntary climate-change mitigation approach.</p><p>  The Katingan Mentaya project got its name from the two rivers that flow to the east and west of the site, which is apt, considering the importance of water to peatland ecosystems.</p><p> Mr Johannes Kieft, a peat expert at the UN Environment Programme in Jakarta, said peatlands are enriched with carbon in a gradual process that could take thousands of years. In Katingan Mentaya, the peat dome had been accumulating for more than 10,000 years, said Mr Kieft, who is also lead technical adviser for the Redd+ programme in Indonesia.</p><p> Peatlands are formed when tropical forest trees, such as those from the genus Shorea, grow in water-logged soil. The leaves of the trees take in carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis.</p><p> When leaves and other tree debris fall off, they decompose slowly because they are covered by water. So while carbon dioxide from this decomposition is being released in an intact peatland, more carbon is being stored in the soil, resulting in an overall net removal of carbon from the atmosphere, said Mr Lahiru of NUS.</p><p> Peatland ecosystems may be less well-known than other terrestrial habitats such as rainforests or mangroves. But more attention is being paid to them now, as nations strive to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, to prevent the worst impact on the climate.</p><p> Peat forests are worth saving for the next generation, said Mr Hartono, who has a nine-year-old son. \"Many people are sceptical about protecting and conserving peatlands, thinking it would be more profitable to open it for cultivation instead,\" he said.</p><p> \"But there are environmental losses we cannot quantify.

The idea of making peat forests pay for their own conservation is a novel business idea in Indonesia. There are large swathes of peatland in the country - it has an estimated 21 million ha of peatland, or 36 per cent of the world's tropical peatland, according to figures cited in a 2017 scientific paper.

Apart from these, there are plants that can grow in moderately drained peatlands, such as rice, bananas, beans, carrots, celery, corn, lettuce, mint, onions, potatoes, parsley, radish, pasture-sod, sugar cane chili, soya bean, tobacco and a few horticultural crops.</p><p>The challenge, however, is that there is limited information on which of these commodities meet the second and third conditions - of comparable profitability and time taken before investors start getting net positive returns on their investments. Among the limited studies available, one shows that if sago was chosen as an alternative crop to explore, it takes sago 10 to 15 years before it can start bearing fruit, and that the internal rate of return is up to 8.06 per cent - still low compared with 20 per cent of oil palm.</p><p>Alternatively, some crops, such as radish or celery, can be grown in less than a year, but it is not known if there will be sufficient demand for these. Additional preparations may be needed, such as reducing the acidity of the soil, preventing pests and diseases, or increasing the value-add of producers through additional processing.</p><p>There is need for more research and institutional support in improving the desirability of producing alternative commodities, in both the demand and supply side. These need to be considered in developing and implementing long-term rehabilitation plans.</p><p>Demand-side interventions include research on identifying which among the identified alternative commodities are in demand, who the buyers are, what qualities and traits they desire, and what prices they are sold at. </p><p>Buyers may include domestic buyers within Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as importers from higher-income countries abroad. In Japan, for instance, youth are leaving the agricultural sector, creating opportunities for countries such as Indonesia to provide selected crops.</p><p>Supply-side interventions require identifying technologies that can allow for meeting buyer requirements, while at the same time being cost effective to producers. Research into how to boost yields in producing the commodities, such as through resistance to submergence/flooding, pests and diseases will be needed.</p><p>For instance, if heavy research led to growth in the productivity of cassava production, from just six tonnes/ha to up to 30 tonnes/ha, can this not be done in the case of the crops identified by FAO? </p><p>Along with boosting yields, it will also be important to hasten the time before crops can be harvested.</p><p>Research at the National Institute of Education, Singapore, for instance, shows that certain planting systems and growing environments can shorten grow-out periods. </p><p>Agricultural transformation will have an important part to play in addressing haze, but this requires farmers, businesses, investors, academia and governments to play their part.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><p>Jose Montesclaros is Associate Research Fellow at the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies at the S.

It's one of the things that needs somewhat more details,' she told reporters.</p><p>And even while policymakers were dragging their feet on the scheme, other countries such as Bolivia and various indigenous groups have condemned it as a 'privatisation of natural resources', further polarising the international community.</p><p>Environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO) Friends of the Earth had issued a report prior to Cancun that stated: 'There are significant risks that REDD will lead to the privatisation of the world's forests, transferring them out of the hands of indigenous peoples and local communities and into the hands of bankers and carbon traders.'</p><p>This, however, has not prevented a global 'REDD rush' where biodiversity conservationists, governments and private sector firms alike have raced to ink deals to conserve swathes of forests in exchange for carbon credits that can potentially be cashed out in the world's carbon markets.</p><p>Indonesia and Norway, for example, have signed a US $1 billion (S $1.3 billion) deal to protect Indonesia's forests, which will see a two-year forest-clearing moratorium.</p><p>It is this rush, combined with the hazy outlook of REDD+, that has led a trio of academics to warn biodiversity conservationists that the REDD+ scheme may be short-lived, and it may be too risky to put all the eggs in this one basket.</p><p>The paper, published last month in Conservation Letters, a journal for the Society for Conservation Biology, was written by assistant professor Edward Webb and PhD student Jacob Phelps of the National University of Singapore's department of biological sciences, and research fellow Koh Lian Pin at Swiss institute ETH Zurich.</p><p>In an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Webb said that REDD has been somewhat overhyped as a secure financing source for biodiversity conservation.</p><p>While potentially a radical scheme that could halt massive deforestation, it also has unintended consequences, such as forest governance being re-centralised in the hands of national governments.</p><p>As it is now, decentralisation to the local authorities and native peoples has helped boost carbon storage through local management of the forests, said Mr Webb. There is also the sensitive issue of wider socio-economic opportunity costs of withholding development, he added.</p><p>'The working mechanisms of REDD are still a long way off from implementation... we don't want to see conservation projects over-leveraging on REDD-related finance only to be left high and dry a few years later,' he said.</p><p>The paper further highlights some risks: REDD+ is still not legally adopted by the UN and the absence of any global legally binding cuts to greenhouse gases also adds to the uncertainty about the longevity of the scheme.</p><p>At the same time, although private investments have been inked - such as the Ulu Massen initiative in Banda Aceh, Indonesia (government-led and partly-funded by Merrill Lynch) - such projects remain small.</p><p>Investors are wary of uncertain climate policies, volatile carbon prices and speculative interest in REDD+ projects.</p><p>The private sector's conservatism contrasts with the conservation sector's high expectations for REDD, the paper said.</p><p>There is also the risk of 'mismatched time horizons' where REDD+ projects, which typically have a 20-year horizon, will be a short-lived lifeline for cash-strapped conservation projects, which usually last beyond two decades.</p><p>Furthermore, the paper highlights that REDD+ is often proposed as a 'bridge strategy' to buy time for industrialised countries to develop low-carbon technologies and renewable energy sources.</p><p>The authors point out that once this is achieved, forest carbon markets could become obsolete, potentially within a couple of decades.

It is my pleasure to be here at the 3rd Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Since its inaugural session in 2014, the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources has grown in stature and scale, and played a significant role in bringing together relevant stakeholders to address key environmental and sustainability issues in our region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. I am happy to see that many of the participants and speakers are from around the region. All of us want to see our region thrive and do well, and no less Singapore, because a prosperous region benefits us all. One key contributor to economic wellbeing in South-east Asia is a viable and sustainable agro-forestry sector, and there are good prospects for this sector. However, to achieve true prosperity for the people in this region, we all have begun to realise that the agro-forestry sector needs to pursue its economic ambitions in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>4. Palm oil cultivation, for example, has enabled many local people to improve their lives. It plays a vital role in the global economy, and is used widely in our everyday products that many of us may not even realise.Surpassing other oil crops in terms of yield, it requires less land to produce the same amount of oil, and is a very efficient crop. However, unsustainable land clearing practices, such as the burning of forests and peatlands, risk giving the entire industry a bad reputation, and palm oil consequentially can also be affected. This can threaten the long-term viability of the sector, as consumers and investors increasingly feel compelled to distance themselves from the sector and its products.</p><p>5. To do well for the long term, agro-forestry companies need to pursue sustainable growth - growth that takes into account environmental and other important concerns. Let me highlight some practical measures that all agro-forestry companies should implement now, as part of their commitment to sustainable growth.</p><p>6. First, agro-forestry companies should take full responsibility for fire prevention and mitigation in their concessions. There must not be a repeat of last year's fires, because the prolonged season of dryness allowed fires to burn uncontrollably and in a very widespread way. Second, companies should invest in efforts to rehabilitate degraded and fire-prone peatlands. We laud the appointment of Pak Nazir Foead by the government of Indonesia to look at the rehabilitation of peatlands in Indonesia. We cannot afford to have massive releases of carbon that negate global efforts to combat climate change as what happened last year. Third, companies must ensure that sustainable policies and practices don't stop with them, but are implemented throughout their supply chain. Just last week, Unilever, Mars and Kellogg cancelled their contracts with a major palm oil producer following a suspension of the company's certification by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) over deforestation practices. The government lauds the efforts of these companies in taking proactive steps to incorporate environmental sustainability into their entire supply chains and operations.</p><p>7. What measures can we take to prevent the recurrence of last year's fires? I have highlighted in my Committee of Supply speech on Tuesday that it requires a multi-faceted approach from all stakeholders. Let me reiterate the key points of my speech.</p><p>8. First, we have to actively promote regional cooperation because haze is a multilateral issue. Second, we will continue to support Indonesia's efforts to tackle the haze. And therefore, Pak Jokowi's announcement yesterday to have a moratorium on new concessions for palm oil plantations and land for mining, is certainly laudable. Third, as consumers, each one of us can influence the agro-forestry industry through our purchasing decisions.</p><p>9. Fourth, I would like to emphasise that the government is sparing no efforts to address the commercial roots of transboundary haze by pursuing errant companies under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA). NEA recently served Notices under Sections 10 and 11 of the THPA on a foreign Director when he was in Singapore. These Notices require him to provide information relevant to the haze and attend an interview in relation to the ongoing investigations. In accordance with the law, we will take every necessary step to enforce the THPA, bearing in mind that outside of Singapore, there are limited possibilities. We will of course, hold any Singapore-linked persons or entities to account. At the same time, even if the errant company's officers are foreigners, they will have to comply with the laws of the country, including the notices under the THPA, should they come to Singapore.</p><p>10. The THPA has also given us the tools to be effective in getting companies to take notice and take actions. I note that some prominent agro-forestry companies have frantically taken out advertisements and gone on talk shows to show that they are doing something. This goes to show that companies like these have sat up and taken notice of our actions through the THPA. My message to all these companies is simply this - companies practising unsustainable production that affect us with haze must know that their actions will not lead to profitability and that they will have to face the consequences sooner or later.</p><p>11. Let me now touch on how civil society can play its role in promoting a sustainable agro-forestry sector.</p><p>12. First and foremost, civil society is a key enabler to foster an informed consumer movement and strengthen support for sustainably-sourced products. Second, civil society plays a critical role in enhancing the transparency and accountability of companies and their supply chains, thereby enabling consumers and investors to give greater support to sustainable businesses.</p><p>13. As consumers, we have choices, and we should make our choices count.When the haze hit Singapore last year, there was a noticeable ground-up movement, the likes of which we had not seen before. This effort was led by civic organisations and responsible businesses. As mentioned by its Chairman Isabella Loh, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) instituted a temporary restriction on the use of the Green Label by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) in October last year, and together with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), jointly led a movement to advocate against unsustainable practices. Consequently, large supermarket chains such as NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Prime Supermarket responded by removing all APP products from their shelves, while the Dairy Farm Group stopped the purchase of all APP products. Organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-Singapore, People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM.Haze) and the Singapore Institute of International Affairs also jointly organised the \"We Breathe What We Buy\" campaign to increase public awareness on the sustainability of agroforestry products.These actions demonstrate the significant power of a collective consumer voice, and an increasingly active and empowered consumer movement, led by civil society.</p><p>14. Recently, a report by an Indonesian activist group \"Eyes on the Forest\" highlighted that while companies have made commitments to stop deforestation, their supply chains remain tainted with palm oil grown on protected lands with fragile ecosystems, that are home to the endangered Sumatran tigers, elephants and Orang Utans. This demonstrates the crucial role that civil society plays in bringing malpractices to light, and enhancing the transparency of supply chains and accountability of companies in the palm oil and forestry sectors.</p><p>15. One such area relates to the transparency of information on concessions and hotspots. Where progress on ASEAN efforts such as the Regional Haze Monitoring System has been slow, NGOs have been quick to find a solution to this.</p><p>16. The Global Forest Watch, spearheaded by the World Resources Institute has helped to improve the transparency of forest management and commodity production through its tie-up with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) on maps of certified sustainable palm oil production sites. More recently, GreenpeaceIndonesia launched a public GIS portal - \"Peta Kepo Hutan\" which overlays concession information from various official sources, allowing tracking of fires on different concession types, from palm oil, to logging, wood fibre and mining concessions. A useful feature is that \"Peta Kepo Hutan\" now allows the identification of companies that own such concessions.</p><p>17. Another area relates to eco-certification, which enables consumers to readily identify sustainably-sourced products. Last year, the RSPO announced RSPO Next, a voluntary addendum to its existing principles and criteria for certification. It is an initiative to encourage RSPO member companies that have met the current requirements of the RSPO, to exceed these requirements. This is a good initiative and I hope companies will respond positively.</p><p>18. Nevertheless, I would not want to paint an overly optimistic picture. Currently, only 21% of global palm oil is currently certified by RSPO, and there is a lot more work required to increase demand for sustainable palm oil, as well as for the certification of supply chains.Hence, I am glad that the SEC has recently launched a new category under the Singapore Green Label Scheme for products containing palm oil that builds on the RSPO certification.</p><p>19. I am also happy to note the significant progress made in the area of pulp and paper products.In October last year, SEC and CASE stepped up their engagement efforts by getting leading supermarkets, pharmacies, furniture retailers with paper products certified under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) administered by the SEC to declare that they had not procured or used wood, paper or pulp materials from unsustainable sources.As part of its continuous efforts to help the public identify environmentally-friendly products and enhance eco-consumerism, SEC has just announced that it is now taking it further and working on a new category for products with pulp and paper which will include in its criteria the requirement for peatland management and fire prevention standards. When fully developed, I believe this standard will be the most holistic certification standard for pulp and paper in the world. It will be a tool that empowers consumers to make a very safe non-haze pro-conservation choice for sustainable paper products. This will not only be very good for Singapore but can also set the standard for global consumers. I commend SEC for taking this bold initiative.</p><p>20. I also strongly encourage companies which have not participated in the SGLS to be part of the certification. And as consumers, we should now start buying and using products from companies that have pledged to be socially responsible. The Singapore Government will also do its part as a major consumer.From the third quarter of 2016, the Government will only procure printing paper products that carry the Singapore Green Label. We will also spearhead efforts in fighting climate change by procuring electrical products that have been certified as being highly energy efficient, starting with four of the most commonly procured electrical items, air-conditioners, lighting, televisions and refrigerators. Through our efforts, we hope to spur individuals and businesses to likewise make a deliberate choice to support environmental sustainability.</p><p>21. My final point is on the pivotal role that the financial sector plays in advancing and raising the bar on sustainable financing and investment practices.</p><p>22. There is growing recognition that adopting environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) practices positively affect long-term, risk adjusted returns, and high ESG ratings, more often than not, correlates with a lower cost of capital. It is a sustainable way to run businesses, and a hedge against reputational and environmental risks.Banks and investment institutions will therefore be promoting their clients' interests by encouraging the wider adoption of ESG practices.</p><p>23. At the height of the haze episode last year, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) issued its Guidelines on Responsible Financing. Specifically, banks in Singapore are required to disclose their commitment to responsible financing, publish their policy framework, and implement governance systems by 2017. The three local banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - have issued commitments to responsible financing in their respective annual reports released recently. The ABS is also actively engaging the industry to raise awareness and build capacity on sustainable financing. Early this month, the ABS and WWF conducted capacity building workshops to prepare the industry for the implementation of the ABS' guidelines.</p><p>24. On the capital markets front, SGX will be introducing sustainability reporting on a \"comply or explain\" basis, and had in February this year concluded its public consultation on the proposed rules and guidelines.SGX expects the new rules and guide on sustainability reporting to apply to companies from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017, with reports published from 2018.</p><p>25. These are positive steps, and I encourage our financial sector to take even bolder measures to support sustainability, in line with international best practices.</p><p>26. Internationally, there are encouraging signs that major international investors are distancing themselves from unsustainable business practices. For example, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, recently dropped 11 companies because of connections to deforestation.</p><p>27. There are also efforts underway by international bodies. The United Nations Environment Programme launched its final report on its Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System last October. The report discussed how the full potential of the financial system can be harnessed, and policy options that could mobilize capital to sustainable development, and towards a green and inclusive economy. Second, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has announced the launch of an industry led Task Force on climate-related financial risk disclosures, chaired by Michael Bloomberg. The Task Force will develop voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies. Singapore Exchange's Yeo Lian Sim is the Vice Chair of this task force, which held its second meeting last month in Singapore. The task force is currently working on developing specific recommendations in consultation with key stakeholders and will deliver to the FSB its report by December 2016.</p><p>28. With China holding the G20 Presidency this year, it has made green financing a core part of its agenda. China has set up the Green Finance Study Group (\"GFSG\"), which countries like Singapore and Switzerland are part of. Germany has also agreed to carry the theme of green finance on the G20 agenda through to their Presidency in 2017.</p><p>29. Banks and central banking authorities in the region have also progressed. In November 2015, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), the central bank of Indonesia, released its Sustainable Finance Roadmap, covering areas such as micro-finance, capital markets, SME lending, pension funds and insurance. The sustainable finance roadmap comes with time frames and deliverables driven by market-based incentives. OJK had also announced its collaboration with the WWF to launch an 18-month project to help Indonesian banks integrate ESG criteria in its credit approval framework. Just last month, Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's largest bank, announced that it will tighten credit loans to oil palm plantations, and new loans to finance development of new oil palm plantations in peat lands will be ceased.</p><p>30. These efforts are testament to the commitment of international, regional bodies and our domestic financial institutions in promoting the cause of sustainability. Our financial institutions can and should continue to exercise influence over forestry and palm oil companies, and promote the adoption of sustainable practices by factoring sustainability issues into their lending and investment activities.</p><p>31. To bring about a more sustainable agro-forestry sector, we will need all stakeholders - consumers, investors and lenders and businesses themselves to move ahead together.We cannot expect transformational changes overnight. Together, the different actors within the ecosystem must collectively step up efforts, even as we know that challenges abound. The government has taken a stand, and we hope to have you along with us on this journey towards sustainability. Let us all work together towards clear skies and clean air for all, now and into the future.</p><p>32. In closing, I would like to congratulate SIIA for organising this event. SIIA has also been active on the haze front, through its diplomacy and networking efforts, and the regular commentaries on haze that it publishes.</p><p>33. Thank you all, and I wish you a lively, constructive discussion ahead.</p><p>Source: Ministry of the Environment &amp; Water Resources, Government of Singapore</p>", "publisher": "Singapore Government News", "instances": ["When the haze hit Singapore last year, there was a noticeable ground-up movement, the likes of which we had not seen before.

It is the quickest and probably the cheapest to bring into operation. The boost to the country's overall generating capacity will add at least 65 million tonnes to the 45 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that Indonesia's coal-fired stations already pump into the atmosphere each year.</p><p>But while Jakarta is adding more smokestacks, it is also trying to undo some of the damage caused by former president Suharto's ill-fated scheme in the 1990s to convert 1 million ha of Central Kalimantan peatland into productive rice fields.</p><p>The resulting ecological disaster helped push the country into third place among the world's biggest carbon emitters - a position it contests, but which was still a source of profound embarrassment to the hosts of the just-concluded Bali conference.</p><p>Kalimantan is only part of the problem. More damage has been done by loggers and oil palm planters in Riau - so much so that the Sumatran province contributes 70 per cent of the 516 million tonnes of carbon Indonesia's degraded peatlands emit each year.</p><p>In all, that adds up to 82 per cent of South-east Asian peat emissions, 58 per cent of global emissions and twice what Indonesia burns annually in fossil fuels - just some of the statistics trotted out to support the inclusion of reforestation and avoided deforestation in a new addendum to the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p>Overall, deforestation, degradation and land-use changes are responsible for 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet there is no incentive in the current protocol for Indonesia and 10 other developing countries to curb them or do more to slow the destruction of their forests.</p><p>Jakarta wants peatlands in the proposed Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (Redd) pact for a good reason. Simple re-flooding and other rehabilitation will bring far more short-term benefits than reforestation and reduced logging in any global carbon trading market.</p><p>'Peatlands are the low- hanging fruit, given their huge value of emissions and the fact that they bring few economic benefits,' said Mr Meine van Noordwijk, regional coordinator for the International Centre for Research and Agroforestry.</p><p>'If they are not included, about 50 per cent of Indonesia's emissions will not be within the domain.'</p><p>Carbon trading offers financial incentives for businesses not to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is already a $30US billion business, but Mr Anthony Moody, executive chairman of Sindicatum Carbon Capital, believes it could soar to $200US billion over the next three years.</p><p>The ultimate goal of climate change negotiators is to map out a two-year path aimed at forging a global system for imposing and enforcing emission reductions.</p><p>Some developed countries do not want to pay for actions that are not taken and worry about the difficulty of measuring avoided deforestation, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, where graft is rife and rules notoriously slippery.</p><p>Under Kyoto, so-called Annex 1 countries - all developed nations except the US - set a ceiling on the greenhouse gases they can can emit in a year. When Europe implemented its cap-and-trade system, which sets a benchline for emissions, it did not specifically give offset credits for avoided deforestation because it feared they would flood the system, though it did make some exceptions.</p><p>London is the financial centre for carbon trading because Britain and the European Union signed up early to Kyoto, and the financiers quickly got to work and figured out how to profit from it.</p><p>Indonesian businessmen say carbon credit trading will not work because it is just too difficult. But they said the same thing when the Jakarta Stock Exchange opened in 1988 with 24 listed companies and little else. </p><p>'It involved a process, and you had to go through the process and be transparent,' recalled Ms Agnes Safford, director of Singapore-based AsiaWorksAsia.</p><p>'You are dealing with the same thing in the carbon market - auditors, accountants and engineers are the only people who understand it.'</p><p>In the short term, a lot can still happen because power plants, industry, transportation, landfills - even lighting in city buildings - can all create carbon credits by making efficiency savings and shifting away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Mr Moody's Sindicatum recently hooked up with petroleum firm Odira Energy Persada in eight projects that will cut 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by converting flared gas to liquid petroleum gas for use in diesel and coal-fired power stations.</p><p>Swiss-owned Indocement, Indonesia's second-largest cement maker, has already introduced substitute fuels and efficiencies in power usage to generate emission credits that can be offset in Switzerland.</p><p>The Swiss should be cleaning up their own country, but it is cheaper to do it in Indonesia, which has only nine projects registered so far with the UN Convention for Climate Change.</p><p>Of course, for climate change activists, the idea of offsets is not as attractive as absolute cuts which, as the US has stubbornly shown, are tough to attain in an industrialised giant seeking to keep its extravagant living standards.</p><p>Indonesia can do it easier, but Ms Safford said the earliest actual credits for reforestation and avoided deforestation will probably not be paid until 2014, two years after Redd is enshrined under a new protocol and Jakarta decides on an emissions cap.</p><p>Until then, investors can trade in voluntary emission reduction (VER) credits - private deals in which carbon credits for maintaining a forest can be used - not traded - to offset carbon emissions.</p><p>In the first pilot project of its kind, the Borneo Tropical Rainforest Foundation has a deal with East Kalimantan's Malinau district to carry out a study of carbon stocks in 325,000ha of virgin forest. It aims to create a baseline for Indonesia's future voluntary carbon market. That means coming up with a comprehensive assessment of the amount of carbon dioxide a forest absorbs, given the fact that different trees do not suck up the same amount of carbon.</p><p>Ms Safford said a VER credit in Indonesia is worth $2US to $3US a tonne, against $20US or more for those traded in Europe. So far, the global VER market only amounts to about $50US million, largely because the bureaucracy is not involved and a lot of the deals are built on trust.</p><p>'But the minute it falls under a new protocol, you will start seeing forest deals done,' said Ms Safford. 'Why? Because all the big funds see the writing on the wall - they see the Western world will pay for this. In the end, I am sure it is going to be a conscience thing.'</p><p>But back to that huge increase in coal-fired power generation. What might happen if the price of carbon doubles and suddenly scrubbers and other clean technologies become a profitable part of the electricity business?</p><p>Ms Safford said: 'It will happen eventually, but we still have to go through this tedious process to get there. The framework has to be in place before the private sector can pile in.' </p><p>That is the good news. The bad news, she acknowledged, could be that polluters are able to buy credits to clean up their mess cheaper than it costs to actually clean up.</p><p>Many experts argue that to get over that, carbon should have a floor price of at least $50US a tonne.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:thane.cawdor@gmail.com\">thane.cawdor@gmail.com</email></p><p>SEEING THE LIGHT </p><p>Power plants, industry, transportation, landfills - even lighting in city buildings - can all create carbon credits by making efficiency savings and shifting away from fossil fuels.</p>", "publisher": "The Straits Times (Singapore)", "instances": ["More damage has been done by loggers and oil palm planters in Riau - so much so that the Sumatran province contributes 70 per cent of the 516 million tonnes of carbon Indonesia's degraded peatlands emit each year. In all, that adds up to 82 per cent of South-east Asian peat emissions, 58 per cent of global emissions and twice what Indonesia burns annually in fossil fuels - just some of the statistics trotted out to support the inclusion of reforestation and avoided deforestation in a new addendum to the Kyoto Protocol. Overall, deforestation, degradation and land-use changes are responsible for 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet there is no incentive in the current protocol for Indonesia and 10 other developing countries to curb them or do more to slow the destruction of their forests. Jakarta wants peatlands in the proposed Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (Redd) pact for a good reason. Simple re-flooding and other rehabilitation will bring far more short-term benefits than reforestation and reduced logging in any global carbon trading market. Peatlands are the low- hanging fruit, given their huge value of emissions and the fact that they bring few economic benefits,' said Mr Meine van Noordwijk, regional coordinator for the International Centre for Research and Agroforestry. If they are not included, about 50 per cent of Indonesia's emissions will not be within the domain. Carbon trading offers financial incentives for businesses not to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is already a $30US billion business, but Mr Anthony Moody, executive chairman of Sindicatum Carbon Capital, believes it could soar to $200US billion over the next three years. The ultimate goal of climate change negotiators is to map out a two-year path aimed at forging a global system for imposing and enforcing emission reductions. Some developed countries do not want to pay for actions that are not taken and worry about the difficulty of measuring avoided deforestation, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, where graft is rife and rules notoriously slippery."]}]
