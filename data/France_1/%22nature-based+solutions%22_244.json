Climate change and increased pesticide resistance mean native pests are having a greater impact than ever before, while new populations of invasive pests are finding their way into fields.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Juan Estupinan is the CEO and President of Vestron.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To add to the challenge, increasing insect resistance to existing products, bans on products that have been deemed unsafe - whether for humans or the environment - and ambitions to reduce pesticide use, mean farmers don't just have fewer crop protection products to work with; they need to use less of them, too.</p><p>While most European farmers would agree on the importance of reducing agriculture's environmental impacts, the reality is they need to do this whilst boosting crop production to meet growing food demands. Achieving this depends on growers having access to more pest control options, and urgently.</p><p>This is the time novel peptide-based products that have effectiveness against pests and low environmental impacts need to get into growers' hands, helping to shape a more sustainable future in Europe's fields and greenhouses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peptides making a mark</emphasis></p><p>The need for sustainability and efficacy in pest control drives our research at Vestaron. We produce biopesticides based on cystine-rich peptides, modified from the venom of spiders and other venomous animals that have evolved to kill insects.</p><p>The origins are novel, but the reality is practical, as these short amino acid chains can replace traditional chemical insecticides on a one-for-one basis. Replicated field trials have demonstrated that the products deliver comparable or better levels of effectiveness against targeted pests while having negligible impact on natural enemies and pollinators.</p><p>In the United States, our first commercially available insecticide, SPEAR\u00ae, was approved \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0through the Emerging Technology branch of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2018 and has now been used on nearly three-quarters of a million acres of crops. In March 2024, we received approval of a second bioinsectide, BASIN(TM), in the US and Mexico, with more products in the pipeline. This is a pace of commercializing innovations that's never been seen before, in any class of molecules used in pest control.</p><p>To get SPEAR approved in Europe, however, the situation is more complicated.</p><p>As it stands, there is no legal definition of biopesticides within EU legislation. In recent years, the Commission and Member State regulatory authorities have considered ways to shorten approval timelines for certain pesticides based on microorganisms, plant extracts, and other nature-derived products.</p><p>In contrast, more recent innovations such as peptide products, also derived from nature, are only starting to gain the attention of stakeholders. EU regulators and policy makers need to ensure their actions in support of biopesticides remain open to peptide-based products and to other future innovations.</p><p>Currently, despite peptide-based products being considered to be low-risk by other scientific and regulatory groups around the world, and with efficacy equivalent to traditional synthetic chemical pesticides, it is not yet clear if they will be afforded the same preferential treatment as other biologicals in the EU.</p><p>While the original intentions of this policy are good, the results are somewhat limited in practice. If you do not fall within the very limited definition of a biological control, you are by default, a chemical pesticide - the very category of products that the EU is seeking to limit. As such, peptide products remain in limbo, having all the qualities and characteristics of a low-risk biological control agent, but not yet clearly categorised as such.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Speeding up approvals for nature-based solutions</emphasis></p><p>Biocontrols can offer a variety of beneficial pest control options to augment or even replace chemical pesticides. Growers need more of these tools in their toolbox than just the traditional microbials and plant extracts that are covered by that initial narrow approach.</p><p>To help farmers in Europe, we need to see a restructuring of the categories defining pest control products, as well as a new process to speed up authorisations for nature-based solutions. This requires putting synthetic crop protection products to one side and considering biological products on their own terms.</p><p>In the United States, Vestaron's products are handled differently because the science behind them is novel and unique.\u00a0They have the option for an expedited path to approval alongside traditional biologicals, while still being held to rigorous\u00a0health and environmental\u00a0standards like synthetic pesticides.</p><p>A crucial part of a more streamlined regulatory system in the US has been getting people with relevant scientific experience of biological agents involved in the approval process of new crop protection products. Regulatory risk assessment for biologicals requires a different set of studies than typical toxicology testing, necessitating a specific technical capacity.\u00a0 Europe needs to catch up in that respect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Change is coming - if slowly </emphasis></p><p>The fact that regulatory approaches were changed to accommodate a limited subset of biological products indicates that the EU is willing to engage on this issue, and work towards much-needed changes for biological product classification and approvals. Indeed, in March the European Commission presented ideas to simplify the regulatory framework around biotechnology in the EU, streamlining approval processes and enabling products to get to market more quickly. Applying these objectives to biologicals and other nature-based pesticides could be hugely beneficial to Europe's farmers.</p><p>We know there is a strong need, as well as a strong desire, to get new biopesticides to European growers.\u00a0 To help accomplish this in the current environment, Vestaron's strategy is twofold: engage with policymakers in Europe to find a way to test and grant permanent approval for the use of peptide-based biopesticides, while supporting EU growers who seek to secure emergency use authorisation for our products in situations where the existing options aren't working.</p><p>Right now, that means supporting Mediterranean tomato growers in their fight to control the tomato leafminer (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tuta absoluta</emphasis>) with our product SPEAR\u00ae LEP, while working towards similar emergency use authorizations against other problem species. Ultimately, though, Europe's farmers need permanent solutions, and we're hoping that peptides can be the catalyst to open the door for them to receive access to other technological innovations more easily and quickly than they do now. Many of the continent's fruit and vegetable producers tell us that they can't wait much longer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodopinionwhyeuropeneedstorethinkitspesticideclassifications</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8N-DC51-JCMC-W4X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Activists are calling for the European Commission's proposed Nature Restoration Law to set strong biodiversity targets, just as the Green Deal set robust climate targets.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On 6th February the EU got a foretaste of EU climate policy debates to come when lawmakers in the European Parliament debated the European Commission's recommended <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/a-foretaste-of-eu-climate-policy-debates-to-come/\">climate target for 2040</url> - a 90% cut in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite representing just 2.9% of the EU's working-age population, much of the focus was on how to keep farmers on board with the targets - largely due to the rolling protests across the continent in the preceding weeks. Further back, European supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine reminded the public how essential our home-grown agricultural community is to food production.</p><p>But the agricultural climate debate is not just about mitigating emissions, it's also about adapting to the inevitable changes brought by a warming climate - and that includes biodiversity and protecting nature.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liege Declaration</emphasis></p><p>With memories still fresh of the deadly floods that killed 39 people in Wallonia in summer 2021, it's no surprise that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://scce24wallonie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ENG_LIEGE-DECLARATION_FINAL.pdf\">Li\u00e8ge Declaration</url> on Adaptation to Climate Change, signed in early February by European networks and organisations of non-state actors - including businesses, researchers, civil society and local government - highlighted adaptation to climate change through nature-based solutions (NbS) and resilience as the number one priority.</p><p>According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), 50% of all species in the EU rely upon agricultural habitats. It is therefore essential to have farmers' buy-in to implementing nature-based solutions.</p><p>Agriculture relies on biodiversity. Food and fibre production depend on various genetic or natural factors such as soil and water conservation, soil fertility, pest and disease resistance, and pollination.</p><p>According to the European Landowners Organisation (ELO), which has represented the interests of landowners, land managers and rural entrepreneurs including farmers since 1972: \"Ecosystems are the 'lungs' and backbone of our rural territories and landowners are custodians of this rich environment.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National restoration plans</emphasis></p><p>The ELO therefore supports the European Commission's proposed Nature Restoration Law that would require EU countries to develop national restoration plans. These plans should define the restoration measures to meet binding targets up to 2050.</p><p>\"The failures of the past should be a guide toward a better understanding of the governance framework, funding mechanisms, participatory approach and communication tools which are needed to cope with the current decline of biodiversity everywhere in the world,\" said the ELO.</p><p>Noor Yafai, Europe Director of Global Policy and Institutional Partnerships, at The Nature Conservancy, said it's high time to bust the myth that businesses are anti-green policies and green regulation. \"Actually, it's not all businesses that want to halt laws or limit targets. Many industry voices - including those investing in agriculture and rural industries have been backing the Commission's Green Deal policies,\" she said.</p><p>And it's not only in the EU. Nature and biodiversity have been increasingly on the agenda internationally -\u00a0at COP26, COP27, COP28 and most recently at DAVOS.</p><p>Yafai describes the Kunming-Montreal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbd.int/gbf\">Global Biodiversity Framework</url> as nature's \"Paris Agreement moment.\" Some 196 countries signed up to the agreement in December 2022 committing to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030.</p><p>She argues that where the Green Deal sets strong climate targets and implements measures, the next EU Commission needs to do this for nature and biodiversity. Yafai remarked that the next Commission should include a focus in its new work programme on introducing powerful policy signals which will help businesses transition investments faster in support of nature and maintaining healthy biodiversity.</p><p>Yafai added: \"This should include a focus on more innovative finance models, from incentives and blended finance models, through to addressing harmful public subsidies; including in reviewing and reforming key aspects of the EU CAP that aren't helping to defend farmers from the worst effects of climate change to come.\"</p><p>The business case for those incentives seems self-evident. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op335~79fbc42228.en.pdf\">European Central Bank</url> has said: \"The loss of biodiversity and the degradation of natural ecosystems pose a significant threat to the broader economy and financial stability.\" Its report found that \"nearly three-quarters of all bank loans in the euro area are to companies that are highly dependent on biodiversity.\"</p><p>\"Increasingly there are sectors - particularly renewables - that understand that the way to green and prosperous growth in the EU, is in getting these biodiversity policies implemented well and financed well.\"</p><p>\"In the context of climate change mitigation, there are huge win-wins as nature-based solutions can help mitigate climate change emissions in a cost-effective way.\"</p><p>\"Planting a tree, or restoring a riverbank is in many cases far cheaper than technological solutions. In short, nature is part of the toolkit to help protect agricultural communities, rural SMEs, farmers, etc. Businesses themselves understand this. Now politicians must get on board,\" concluded Yafai.</p><p>[By Jennifer Baker I Edited by Brian Maguire | <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionbiodiversitynewsnewbiodiversitypoliciesdemandedforeusgreenprosperousgrowth</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BBP-6V81-JCMC-W3SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

As a large rental housing provider, SATO has the opportunity to affect biodiversity and the company also wants to lead the way for others.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Biodiversity is an important theme for SATO. In spring 2023, SATO launched its project to prepare a Biodiversity Roadmap, and the roadmap was published in the Sustainability Report in early 2024. The roadmap sets out actions to make taking account of biodiversity part of everyday life at SATO. The roadmap is based on a review of the current state and a materiality analysis for which an extensive stakeholder survey was conducted. The survey showed that stakeholders regard SATO's biodiversity action as important.</p><p>\"Alongside climate, biodiversity is an important theme for us, as the built environment burdens the natural environment. Climate change and biodiversity are strongly interconnected, and biodiversity preservation can also reduce the adverse impacts of climate change,\" says SATO Sustainability Manager<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jenni Rantanen</emphasis>.</p><p>\"This issue is of global importance. It's no longer merely about nature conservation. Instead, biodiversity loss is also a threat to development and the economy,\" says SATO Project Development Manager<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kirsi Ojala</emphasis>.</p><p>As a large rental housing provider, SATO wants its Biodiversity Roadmap not only to contribute towards the preservation of biodiversity through SATO's own action but also to lead the way for other housing actors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biodiversity supported by choices such as native plants in landscape design</emphasis></p><p>At SATO, the work begins with an update to planning and design guidelines in line with the Biodiversity Programme. These guidelines determine the solutions and materials used in contexts such as landscape design.</p><p>\"Going forward, our aim is to take account of biodiversity in procurements and competitive tendering processes - when we know what we're aiming for it's also easier to make sustainable choices in our everyday work,\",<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ojala</emphasis>says.</p><p>In addition to the update of the planning and design guidelines, SATO will pilot nature-based solutions and biodiversity improvements at selected SATO-owned properties. The aim is also to ensure that SATO's own specialists as well as its partners have sufficient competences for their work with regard to biodiversity issues.</p><p>At SATO properties, nature-based solutions may include allowing natural stormwater retention in indentations, designing snow piling areas so that the melting snow will be absorbed in the ground, and selecting native plants that thrive in that part of the country for the grounds of SATO properties.</p><p>\"Native plants, meadows and, for example, dead trees left in place also provide natural habitats for a variety of species,\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ojala</emphasis>says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Residents included in biodiversity action</emphasis></p><p>SATO residents are also interested in biodiversity.</p><p>\"Residents hoped to see more areas in their natural state and more pollinator-friendly plants around their homes. Some of our residents are also interested in taking part in biodiversity action in their own residential environment,\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rantanen</emphasis>says.</p><p>Consequently, the best ways to involve residents are currently explored at SATO.</p><p>\"One way of participating could be building bird next boxes and insect hotels, as has been suggested by residents. We could also organise residents' communal work gatherings to remove harmful plant species such as lupines, Himalayan balsams or Japanese roses from building grounds,\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ojala</emphasis>says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For more information, please contact:</emphasis></p><p>Jenni Rantanen, Sustainability Manager, SATO Corporation, phone +358\u00a0201\u00a034\u00a04270Kirsi Ojala, Project Development Manager, SATO Corporation, phone +358\u00a0201\u00a034\u00a04011</p><p>Email address format: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:firstname.lastname@sato.fi\">firstname.lastname@sato.fi</email></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For media enquiries, please contact:</emphasis></p><p>Marjaana Kivioja, Communications Manager, SATO Corporation, phone +358\u00a0400\u00a0773\u00a0181</p><p>SATO Corporation is an expert in sustainable rental housing and one of Finland's largest rental housing providers.

Germany, France, UK, Netherlands, and Italy \"rank first in Europe for patenting water inventions\", an EPO press release stated.</p><p>The ministers stressed the need \"to ensure that water is an absolute priority on the European agenda over the coming years, and to make the EU's water management objectives a reality\".</p><p>The ministers also insisted on the \"participation of citizens and stakeholders\" and \"public engagement in all actions\".</p><h>Tensions in France</h><p>In south-west France, major demonstrations are set to take place on 19 and 20 July in Deux-S\u00e8vres against large water reservoirs - the so-called \"mega-basins\". These reservoirs for irrigation can cover an area of up to 18 hectares and store water in winter for use in irrigation in summer.</p><p>Between 6,000 and 8,000 people are expected to gather and protest against the construction of the reservoir and the authorities expect clashes with the police, as it has been the case in previous demonstrations.</p><p>Opponents accuse the system of devastating the environment, as the basin will be used to store rainwater in winter, but also to draw on deep groundwater in the event of a shortage. Over 450 farmers - mainly wheat growers - will have access to it.\u00a0</p><p>\"Access to water is a huge issue, but we are against privatising water with public money,\" the climate activist and now Member of the European Parliament (LFI, The Left) Emma Fourreau, told Euractiv. She will be travelling on Saturday to support the organisers. \u00a0</p><p>The French government announced the building of 100 new basins in France by the end of the year to guarantee continued access to water. The new agricultural policy law - currently being discussed in the French Parliament - will protect these infrastructures in the name of the \"major general interest\" of French agriculture.</p><p>In 2021, French Green MEPs submitted a petition to the European Parliament's PETI Committee, pointing out that the basins contravened European law, in particular the Water Framework Directive (WFD).\u00a0</p><p>The European <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/PETI-CM-696618_EN.pdf\">Commission said</url> it was going to take \"this complex case very seriously\", urging France to present the impact of the financial and environmental costs of the projects, while warning against any \"excessive abstraction\" of water from the aquifers.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/shutterstock_1982595209-800x562.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>French mega-basins project defended by agriculture minister 'worries' Commission</h><p>The European Commission is worried about a project that aims to build agricultural mega-basins in France's Poitou-Charentes region.

It's the first time we've had such a major summit devoted to adaptation\".</p><p>Indeed, the declaration calls on the European Commission to \"update and increase the ambition of its policies beyond its 2021 adaptation strategy, addressing the vulnerabilities and policy needs identified by the European Environment Agency (EEA), and linking climate adaptation considerations to the broader context of regional resilience\".</p><p>The aim is, therefore, to update the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en\">EU strategy for adaptation to climate change</url>, which was adopted in 2021.</p><p>In particular, the declaration calls for the implementation of the Green Deal to halt biodiversity loss and limit resource use; the integration of adaptation at all levels of governance, especially in the agriculture, industry, energy and transport sectors; and the allocation of some European Union funding and new resources to nature-based solutions.</p><p>\"We're now giving the European Parliament, the Commission, the member states and the players involved the guidelines, and we'll be watching to see how it all develops,\" Dantec adds.</p><p>For the 1000 or so summit participants, the only way to address adaptation issues is through a local and regional approach, as it would be the only way to take into account the diversity of vulnerabilities and their endemic nature.</p><p>The Li\u00e8ge Declaration also calls for the launch and implementation of new international climate negotiations in order to set what it calls a \"new collective goal for climate finance\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon, Paul Messad]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentnewsngoslocalgovernmentssigndeclarationcallingoneutoupclimateefforts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B96-0MC1-F03F-K40S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

It addresses the decarbonization challenges and economic constraints in industry, government, land, air, and sea mobility. It also contributes to regenerating the planet through the co-production of biochar, a natural carbon sink, and biogenic CO2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hexas is a nature-based solutions company that has developed a drought-resistant, regenerative giant perennial grass (XanoGrass<sup>(TM)</sup>) that can be easily made available as sustainable plant-based raw material (XanoFiber<sup>(TM)</sup>) once harvested. XanoFiber(TM) production utilizes marginal land that is unsuitable for agriculture, which can be used to power local biomass-to-energy modules, and for structural and non-structural applications, meets both Companies' shared objectives of regenerating the planet through innovation and sustainable energy production solutions.</p><p>The signing of this partnership will enable Hexas and Haffner Energy to offer a turnkey solution for the production of green energy, with guaranteed feedstock availability and cost. This non-exclusive agreement augurs well for the future of energy recovery from sustainable and abundant purposefully grown biomass with non-competing uses.</p><p>\"We are thrilled to have signed this partnership, which adds a new dimension to Haffner Energy's offering, and enables us to provide our customers with an integrated solution for the autonomous production of renewable energy,\" says Marcella Franchi, SVP North America of Haffner Energy.</p><p>\"At Hexas, we believe in the partnership of sustainable energy production and purposefully grown bioenergy crops. These two technologies together will accelerate the move to 100% renewable energy in all industries, capture significant amounts of carbon permanently, and revitalize rural communities,\" says Wendy Owens, CEO of Hexas.</p><p>The aggregated environmental virtues of this solution are formidable:</p><p>CO2captured by XanoGrass(TM) through photosynthesisCO2sequestered in the biochar and biogenic CO2produced by Haffner Energy's solutionsRegeneration of marginal land thanks to XanoGrass(TM) and soil amendment from biocharGreenhouse gas emissions avoided by substituting renewable fuels from biomass to fossil fuels</p><p>The two partners are already involved in a project in Morocco.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Haffner Energy</emphasis></p><p>Haffner Energy, a French family company co-founded and co-directed by Marc and Philippe Haffner, has been a player in the energy transition for 30 years, designing, manufacturing, suppling, and operating innovative decarbonation solutions for the mobility, industry and government sectors. Its clean fuels solutions, based on the thermolysis of biomass, a technology protected by 15 patent families, enable customers to produce locally renewable hydrogen and gas, as well as other green energies such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable methanol, while capturing carbon from the atmosphere through the co-production of biochar, a natural carbon sink, and biogenic CO2.

The fund</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">would be launched before year end and would</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">support equity investments in emerging leaders of the energy transition.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its strategic roadmap last September, Societe Generale announced a EUR 1 billion energy transition investment in emerging leaders, nature-based solutions and impact-driven opportunities to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This initial EUR 250 million commitment, which could be increased up to EUR\u00a0350\u00a0million, is part of the EUR\u00a0700\u00a0million equity envelope, and relates to emerging leaders. Considered investments would include hybrid infrastructure projects combining technology and industrial know-how in energy, water and waste.</p><p>Reed Management SAS is an investment management company that focuses on essential infrastructure with scalable and affordable sustainable solutions. The firm was founded by Julien Touati, a well-known alternative investment specialist with nearly 20 years of experience across infrastructure and energy transition, including 12 years at Meridiam where he successfully launched and managed Meridiam Transition Fund.In the context of the acquisition, Societe Generale would acquire 75% of the company which would be branded \"REED - Societe Generale Group\" and would be led by Julien Touati as Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>REED's ambition is to establish itself as a leading global investor in energy transition. Investments would be via direct equity participation in emerging leaders of the low-carbon transition - firms that could contribute to the emergence of European energy transition champions. Built on a conviction that supporting the energy transition requires an innovative investment approach, REED's\u00a0strategy for creating value would be anchored in its hybrid infrastructure playbook and ability to combine de-risking and scaling of portfolio companies and projects.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Slawomir Krupa, Chief Executive Officer of Societe Generale,</emphasis>commented:\"This acquisition is a new step in the execution of the Group strategic roadmap, as part of our ambition to bolster our ESG leadership. Societe Generale aims at boosting investments to support the specific financing needs of emerging leaders which require bespoke capital to deploy their innovative energy solutions. I\u00a0firmly believe in the development of this complementary investment capacity which would enrich Societe\u00a0Generale's expertise in energy, infrastructure and mobility sectors, and offer a continuum of equity and debt solutions. I am delighted that Julien Touati, a recognized professional in his field, would run REED.\"</p><p>The closing of the acquisition is expected in September 2024 and is subject to customary closing conditions.</p><p>Press contacts:Jean-Baptiste Froville_+33 1 58 98 68 00_<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wFu_1uImKEjgWgUzYygy2NIbRgjwn2lp3ypSgXCSM6LMZ1GG_oJkeicgHG_CkTvWUDTvq2Tzb3JFIpese9qTDsYk6bkjnrOPQwqddLy8uCsNjPM9GNqq4N33zDu0h79EmJZmoD5fEGDDTka1xlcrow==\">jean-baptiste.froville@socgen.com</url>Fanny Rouby_+33 1 57 29 11 12_<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=mqK51OnTq_bP7_GzEz_7uu8YYJmj50B9F1MecJwfcLmD9LngyurdgQLlbFJgqfLSDnVx6xip3WQrBv6VJcXqyBreNuvLm-HAJiP3Ti3sIfU=\">fanny.rouby@socgen.com</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Societe Generale</emphasis></p><p>Societe Generale is a top tier European Bank with more than 126,000 employees serving about 25 million clients in 65 countries across the world.

The company, dedicated to forging a sustainable future for generations, continues to champion green technologies and nature-based solutions in the race to Net Zero.\u00a0</p><p>In a significant stride towards achieving this goal, Mundo Verde Climate has entered into a strategic arrangement with Biotrend Enerji, the most prominent player in the Turkish integrated waste management, waste-to-energy and circular plastics market. This collaboration marks a milestone in the pursuit of mobilizing finance towards new climate change mitigation technologies.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Mundo Verde Climate took an instrumental role in developing the voluntary carbon units from Biotrend's waste to energy activities through a certification and verification process under VERRA. \u00a0The transaction, covering over 2.4 million tons of CO2 in total, refers to voluntary carbon credits for release on the international market. Companies can acquire the credits to offset their emissions from unrelated activities. \u00a0</p><p>The deal promises to impact the global voluntary carbon market substantially. Mundo Verde Climate, together with Biotrend, hopes that the initiative will provide much-needed carbon credits to satisfy demand in the voluntary offsetting market and inspire others to advance their projects and stimulate the market.\u00a0</p><p>Reflecting on the efforts of governments at COP 28 to invigorate the global trade in voluntary carbon credits, Ms Gediz Kaya, Managing Partner at Mundo Verde Climate, expressed enthusiasm about the Biotrend arrangement, stating:\u00a0\u00a0\"According to Climate Policy Initiative, the amount of financing needed to be mobilized towards climate mitigation technologies by 2030 is $4.3 trillion annually and 21% of that finance is mobilized right now. So we need to take action and we need to decarbonize as fast as possible. This collaboration exemplifies our dedication to fostering international cooperation and collaboration of key industries in pricing carbon so that we can mobilize finance in the fight against climate change. By joining forces with Biotrend, we aim to catalyse transformative change and encourage companies in the energy sector, and other industries, to adopt a sustainable approach to managing their emissions.\"\u00a0</p><p>The COP28 summit in the United Arab Emirates discussed a number of important factors related to standards and integrity around carbon crediting and recognized the important role of voluntary carbon markets in addressing climate change. Mundo Verde Climate underscores the urgency of global collaboration to address climate challenges and calls for renewed efforts, partnerships, and commitments to mobilize finance. This is vital for accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>Biotrend made a related public disclosure about certified carbon crediting on 8 November 2023, in its 9-month financial statement.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachments</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/cbdc9142-25b4-46b9-af30-c3fa11e00595\">Gediz Kaya</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/470d1418-7069-4226-a226-69f2a6314bea\">Mundo Verde Climate logo</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW9032182en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8G-CTJ1-F15W-N003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><timeReceived>04:20 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 6, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

(\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ARC</emphasis>\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of leading project developer Ponterra Ltd. (\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ponterra</emphasis>\"), for the ARC Restauro Azura project (the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Azuero Reforestation Project</emphasis>\" or the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Project</emphasis>\") located in Panama.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deal Highlights</emphasis></p><p>The Project is expected to generate 3.24 million carbon removal credits through 2052.Carbon Streaming, alongside Rubicon and Microsoft, will fund 100% of project costs over seven years.Carbon Streaming will receive 13.5% of the credits generated by the Project.Microsoft has entered into an offtake agreement to purchase 100% of Carbon Streaming's credits from the Project generated through 2040.Carbon Streaming will act as sole marketer of ARC's carbon credits not already committed to the co-investors under the Azuero Reforestation Stream.The expected IRR from the Project is consistent with Carbon Streaming's target IRR for other investments, and the addition of a long-term carbon credit offtake has significantly de-risked cash flows.Verra has selected the Project to participate in its new Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard (SD VISta) Nature Framework program.The Project has been designed to target six UN Sustainable Development Goals: 1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Life on Land), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).The Azuero Reforestation Stream and concurrent offtake agreement with Microsoft represents one of the largest nature-based carbon removal deals to date.</p><p>The Azuero Reforestation Project is expected to restore 10,000 hectares of degraded tropical forest on the Azuero Peninsula in Panama that has been converted to low-density cattle ranchland over the last century. Ponterra is actively restoring this degraded land with over 75 native tree species, using a vertically integrated reforestation strategy including nurseries, seedbanks, and deep community involvement. The Project will enable over 100 local landholders to participate in and earn an income from the reforestation activities through long-term annual payments and a share of carbon credit sales. Ponterra expects to plant over six million trees and create more than 300 permanent local jobs in the local community. The Project has been designed to target the following UN Sustainable Development Goals: 1 (No Poverty), 4 (Quality Education), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Life on Land), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Given these strong social and environmental co-benefits, Verra has selected the Project to participate in their new SD VISta Nature Framework.</p><p>The Azuero Reforestation Project is expected to remove 3.24 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">tCO2e</emphasis>\") and generate an equivalent number of carbon credits under Verra's newest Afforestation, Reforestation &amp; Revegetation (ARR) methodology, VM0047. The Project is being funded by an investor group composed of Carbon Streaming, Microsoft, and Rubicon. The Project has the potential to expand 5-10x, and the investor group has a right of first offer to fund Project expansions. Initial carbon credit issuance from the Project is expected in 2027.</p><p>\"Ponterra's mission to restore biodiversity and uplift local communities by designing and operating high-integrity nature projects comes to life today. We are thrilled to be working with Carbon Streaming, one of the most respected and experienced investors in nature-based carbon credits in the market, to reach the scale needed to meaningfully impact the twin biodiversity and climate crises,\" said Ponterra CEO Celia Francis.</p><p>In one of the largest nature-based carbon removal offtakes to date, Microsoft is expecting to receive approximately 1.6 million carbon credits from the Project, a portion of which will come from a long-term offtake agreement to purchase 100% of carbon credits that Carbon Streaming receives from the Project through 2040 -approximately 311,500 carbon credits. This is the second multi-year offtake that Carbon Streaming has signed with Microsoft in the last year.</p><p>Justin Cochrane, CEO of Carbon Streaming, expressed his enthusiasm about the deal, stating, \"This stream with Ponterra represents a transformative step for Carbon Streaming, illustrating our commitment to high-quality carbon removal projects. By joining forces with esteemed co-investors and securing pre-contracted cash flows, we're demonstrating a deal structure that promises significant environmental impact and predictable future cash flows.\"</p><p>Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy and Carbon Removal at Microsoft said, \"Microsoft is happy to support the Azuero Reforestation Project in collaboration with Ponterra, Rubicon Carbon, and Carbon Streaming. This project has been designed with a community-first approach building on the good work of long-time conservation leaders, Pro Eco Azuero, ensuring the project's positive impacts not only directly benefit local communities but endure.\"</p><p>Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, Carbon Streaming, alongside Rubicon and Microsoft, will fund 100% of project costs over seven years. Carbon Streaming will make an initial upfront deposit of US$0.315 million, with additional milestone payments of up to US$6.750 million as the Project achieves planting and sapling survival milestones. Carbon Streaming will receive 13.5% of total credits, which is expected to be approximately 438,000 carbon credits through 2052. \u00a0Closing of the Azuero Reforestation Stream is subject to customary conditions with closing expected to occur by the end of Q2 2024.The Project is the first streaming agreement where a majority of the carbon credits Carbon Streaming will receive are pre-contracted through an offtake agreement at closing, an investment model that the Company expects to replicate in the future. Carbon Streaming has also entered into a marketing agreement with ARC, pursuant to which Carbon Streaming has been appointed as sole marketer of ARC's carbon credits for the life of the Project, other than those already committed to the co-investors in the Azuero Reforestation Stream. The expected IRR from the Project is consistent with Carbon Streaming's target IRR for other investments, and the addition of a long-term carbon credit offtake partner in Microsoft has significantly de-risked cash flows.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Carbon Streaming</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-fy42yptXxnndm92ey878C_98G1gtM0Dzet3vj5Flun5LccwcCFGsU2te6M9FIyrVzIioTfAm3d6xMd7faT1rU3KIz0D-Uh2vTq-SbLKaAQ=\">Carbon Streaming</url>aims to accelerate a net-zero future.

On 10\u00a0May Vinod Khosla, Sun Microsystems co-founder turned venture capitalist, hosted a fundraiser for US president Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign. The same day, San Mateo County (California) Superior Court denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed against him in 2020 by the California State Lands Commission (SLC) and California Coastal Commission (CCC) over an access road from Highway 1, through land he owns, to Martins Beach (between San Francisco and Santa Cruz). The agencies argue (on historical as much as legal grounds) that Khosla can\u2019t close the road since a public right of way has been established for nearly a hundred years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khosla acquired 89 acres adjacent to Martins Beach for $32m in 2008; two years later, he locked the gate to the access road. Against CCC and San Mateo County advice, he had refused to apply for a permit to do so. The gate is easy enough to climb over, but there was strong opposition at local and federal level. This is the sixth suit Khosla has faced over the issue in 15 years.</p><p>Khosla has huge economic and social clout. He\u2019s reportedly close to former president Barack Obama and makes regular donations to the Democratic party. In 2015 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis> estimated his net worth at $1.6bn, and by 2023 it had topped $6bn, thanks to investments in green technology and AI. Cast as the villain, he has been intransigent in insisting on his right to deny others access to his private property.</p><p>But Martins Beach is more than just a test case for private ownership versus public right of way. It\u2019s familiar to anyone involved in coastal development because it challenges a policy the state has maintained for 50 years \u2013 ever since the protests that led to the California Coastal Act in 1976 (a whole decade before France\u2019s equivalent law).</p><p>Martins Beach is also symbolic of California\u2019s socioeconomic divides. In the last 20 years, the Golden State has seen several high-profile lawsuits over wealthy property owners grabbing beaches \u2013 which are supposed to be public land below the high tide line. Probably the best known involved record and film producer David Geffen \u2013 87th on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis> world\u2019s billionaires list in 2002 \u2013 who that year blocked access to Carbon Beach, breaking a promise made 20 years earlier to allow it in exchange for permits to build a luxury beachfront compound.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Malibu at odds with authorities</emphasis></p><p>Supported by Malibu city council (keen to protect the development, where one household in four had an annual income over $200,000), he sued a number of public agencies, including the CCC, and Access for All, a nonprofit seeking to ensure compliance with the legal requirement for an access point every 300\u00a0yards on a stretch of coast where there were none for three miles. After his suit was rejected three times, Geffen gave up the fight in 2005, and in 2017 sold the property for $85m, a record for the Los Angeles area.</p><p>Elsewhere, after a 40-year legal battle, Escondido Beach is once again accessible to all: in 2023 the SLC and CCC persuaded two landowners to reopen an access way that was closed off in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the city of Malibu is at odds with the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA) over nearby Lechuza Beach. In spring last year, the MRCA put up signs to this hard-to-find beach but in June the city took them down, claiming that they had not been safely installed and lacked a permit. The MRCA contends that the absence of signage makes the beach too socially exclusive. Malibu\u2019s mayor, who insists the city is keen to attract visitors, disputes this.</p><p>California\u2019s economy has been bigger than France\u2019s since 2016, and is approaching that of Germany. It is the richest state in the US (thanks especially to Silicon Valley and Hollywood), but also the most unequal, with more homeless people than any other\u00a0(1). Its world-famous beaches, so often seen in movies, have come to represent the California lifestyle. But behind this clich\u00e9, there are huge inequalities.</p><p>In 2016 a large-scale study on barriers to beach access in California found that frequency of beachgoing depended on where people live (those in coastal counties unsurprisingly go more often), household size (the cost deters large families) and age (the under 40s and families with children under 18 are the most frequent visitors)\u00a0(2). It also debunked the myth that beachgoing is an egalitarian leisure activity: the majority of visitors were white middle- or upper-class, as opposed to non-white working class.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Less well-off demand beach access</emphasis></p><p>Survey respondents earning less than $20,000 a year were the most likely to say that access to beaches was \u2018very important\u2019 to them (62% compared to an average of 57% across the population), but also visited them the least: only 67% said they went at least once a year, compared to 86% of those with an annual income of more than $100,000, and a general average of 77%. African Americans are also underrepresented among beachgoers: 33% visited less than once a year, compared with 23% on average for all groups.</p><p>Private landowners are estimated to be restricting access to more than 500,000 acres of public land in California\u00a0(3). So the fight against the privatisation of natural spaces for residential and commercial use is a priority. It\u2019s the same for equal access to beaches, which The City Project, founded by a civil rights attorney in Los Angeles, has been demanding since the mid-2000s in the name of environmental justice. Californians love the coast, and on 1\u00a0May 2020, despite the Covid pandemic, thousands marched to assert a fundamental right to visit it, chanting \u2018Open our beaches!\u2019</p><p>But social issues are trumped by the environmental crisis. California is a barometer not only of inequality but also of climate disruption, and one of the places in the world where \u2018coastal squeeze\u2019 (loss or deterioration of natural habitats caused by human activity) is best documented. Since the 1970s, the state has tried to show the way in both public access to beaches and environmental protection. Not without some tensions: the need for affordable housing and parking spaces near the sea (a must if policy is to ensure public access) is not really compatible with maintaining ecological balance, which would require abandoning such projects or even a \u2018strategic withdrawal\u2019.</p><p>Though Khosla is a \u2018green tech\u2019 billionaire, his lawyers have never played the environmental card. (The 2016 study, too, disregarded environmental challenges.) Unlike Florida and New Jersey, California is seen as a model of coastal management\u00a0(4). Yet Martins Beach has been listed as at risk by the US Geological Survey since the late 20th century.</p><p>The data is concerning. Recent modelling predicts that, without countermeasures, a sea level rise of one to three metres could completely erode 24-75% of California\u2019s beaches by 2100\u00a0(5). Another study suggests that for every foot the sea rises, around 100 beach access opportunities will vanish, mainly in the southern half of the state\u00a0(6). Scientific research and media reporting show this is no longer a theoretical or future problem: cliffs, railways, roads, houses and hotels are already collapsing.</p><p>Given the costly and repeated failure of sea defences (breakwaters, seawalls, other sand retention and replenishment measures), a new policy has been proposed, focusing on \u2018nature-based solutions\u2019 that seek to \u2018adapt\u2019 to coastal erosion rather than fight it. It highlights the ability of coastal ecosystems to absorb climate change impacts (storms, floods), provided the coastline is allowed to shift, sand dunes to change shape, and beaches to \u2018migrate\u2019.</p><p>But property owners, local politicians and civil society organisations condemn this policy as handing public money to the already wealthy. In 2021 California lawmakers proposed creating a state fund that would provide loans to affected municipalities, enabling them to buy vulnerable seaside properties and rent them back to their owners or tenants for as long as they remained habitable. Given the housing crisis, this plan to finance the moving of cities away from the rising waters was seen as unfairly favouring owners of luxury villas on the coast. The state legislature voted in the proposal but Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed it because of its cost, its potential impact on the property rental market and its political divisiveness.</p><p>Faced with this change in attitudes to coastal erosion, wealthy landowners are organising at local level, sometimes even appearing to adopt the views of the environmentalists they formerly opposed. At Broad Beach, in Malibu, they have a new strategy.

The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/the-letta-report-whats-in-the-box-for-europes-energy-sector/\">Letta Report</url> echoed these points, and the forthcoming <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/draghi-eu-must-enact-radical-change-as-us-and-china-refuse-to-play-by-the-rules/\">Draghi Report</url> is expected to do the same.</p><p>It's election time, so these interventions are largely political slogans. But even after five years, it's not clear that Europe has managed to translate political slogans into a coherent policy framework.\u00a0</p><p>A key element, the Net Zero Industry Act, which was passed by Parliament last week, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/europes-net-zero-industry-law-will-do-little-for-manufacturing-ambitions-experts-say/\">considered by many to be toothless</url>.\u00a0</p><p>At the time of the Act's conception, an accompanying 'Sovereignty Fund' was also planned, to back up the new rules with serious cash.\u00a0</p><p>However Europe's subsequent fumbling on funding shows the existential challenge that industrial policy poses to the EU.</p><p>No fresh money materialised, thanks to deep scepticism from several national governments.\u00a0</p><p>In the meantime the Commission relaxed State Aid rules. This move allowed individual countries to channel more cash to their green industries, in the face of Chinese and US competition.\u00a0</p><p>France and Germany have jumped at the opportunity, accounted for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/analysis-eu-subsidy-race-is-on-and-germany-is-winning-it/\">over 70% of approved State Aid</url>\u00a0in the first 18 months after the rules were loosened.</p><p>This concentration of support to industry in just two countries is not consistent with the EU's single-market, which promises free and fair competition between countries. To preserve the Single Market - the EU's crown jewel -\u00a0 any industrial strategy funding would need to be decided in Brussels.\u00a0</p><p>But this implies a bigger EU budget, more transfers between countries and - probably - common EU debt as a structural solution.\u00a0Delivering this would mean crossing one of Europe's deepest faultlines. It would represent a fundamental evolution of the EU.</p><p>Europe's green industrial strategy is far more developed and coherent when it sits within 'classic' EU competencies - a deeper Energy Union, more muscular trade policy and circularity of goods and raw materials, for example.</p><p>But to be more than a talking point, the Green Industrial Strategy needs serious funding. Either Europe can deliver this or it cannot. Either outcome will be a critical moment in the EU's journey.</p><p>\u00a0</p><h>Top stories</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/11901799-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>Ribera: Spain has 'enormous difficulties with France' on cross-border energy links</h><p>The Spanish energy minister, Teresa Ribera, says the French have been blocking projects to better connect the Iberian Peninsula to the European grid for years, calling it a disgrace.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/12181089-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>Macron at Sorbonne: Energy key to French president's 'new European paradigm'</h><p>French President Emmanuel Macron set out his vision for the future of Europe, placing energy, including nuclear, at the core of his approach, in a speech at Sorbonne University on Thursday (April 25).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/11990742-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>German Green's minister Robert Habeck under fire over 2022 nuclear shutdown</h><p>The Berlin economy and environment ministries, both held by the Greens, have been accused of mishandling the shutdown of the country's last three nuclear power plants during the 2022 energy crisis.</p><h>Must reads</h><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/austrias-farming-economy-ministers-urge-von-der-leyen-to-delay-eu-anti-deforestation-law/\">Austria's farming, economy ministers urge von der Leyen to delay EU anti-deforestation law</url> - by Sofia Sanchez Manzanaro</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/donagh-nuclear-e300-million-of-state-aids-for-french-nuward-smrs-project/\">Nuclear: (EURO)300 million state aid for French small modular reactors</url> - By Paul Messad</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-report-91-of-cities-look-to-nature-based-solutions-in-face-of-climate-change/\">EU report: 91% of cities look to nature-based solutions in face of climate change</url> - By Nikolaus J.

But costs can be lowered with better data and financing strategies.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A series of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/brief/economics-for-disaster-prevention-preparedness-europe\">reports</url> issued last week by the World Bank in partnership with the European Commission paint a troubling picture of Europe's readiness to handle the effects of climate change over the coming years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among the most alarming findings is this: the European Union could lose seven per cent of its GDP to dealing with the impacts of climate change by the 2030s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2023 was the hottest year in Europe on record, and weather events linked to climate change cost more than (EURO)77 billion, according to the report. And while European countries are taking major steps to prepare for these impacts, the reports conclude that more needs to be done - particularly in critical sectors such as those that provide emergency response services.</p><p>In half of EU member states, for instance, \u00a0there are fire stations located in areas that face more than one natural disaster hazard. Such lack of preparation for emergency services has already had impacts, says Zuzana Stanton-Geddes, a senior disaster response management specialist with the World Bank who was a team leader for the project.</p><p>During the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/experts-blame-poor-government-preparation-for-greek-fires-devastation/\">2023 wildfires in Greece</url> patients had to be evacuated from Alexandroupolis General Hospital because of where it was located, and during <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/climate-crisis-made-deadly-german-floods-up-to-nine-times-more-likely/\">Germany's 2021 floods</url> fire stations became inactive because they were in the flood zone.</p><p>\"The report shows that critical infrastructure like fire and police stations, hospitals, schools, roads, and power lines are often located in areas that are vulnerable to multiple hazards including floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and landslides,\" she said.</p><p>Stanton-Geddes added: \"Preparing for disasters and climate shocks is extremely important to Europe's policymakers and these reports provide tools, data, and evidence to boost both disaster preparedness and resilience to climate shocks for their people.\"</p><p>But this isn't to say that Europe's lawmakers aren't doing anything.</p><p>At the European level, there is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/opinion/the-eu-adaptation-strategy-is-everybodys-cup-of-coffee/\">EU Adaptation Strategy</url>, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/greece-under-scrutiny-for-failing-to-implement-eus-floods-directive/\">EU Floods Directive</url>, and various aspects of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/sections/climate-strategy-2050/\">European Green Deal</url> focusing on adaptation. The reports find several examples of best practices by national governments as well.</p><p>\"Portugal has invested a lot into comprehensive wildfire prevention and preparedness, such as with research and modern analytics, community-level actions, reforms towards integrated wildland fire management and fuel management,\" says Stanton-Geddes.</p><p>\"Portugal's efforts have inspired other countries to take similar actions. The Netherlands is a well-known example of flood risk management - with a mix of measures and investments - including nature-based solutions. Italy has been investing in and incentivizing multi-functional upgrading of public and private buildings and integrating seismic safety and energy efficiency.\"</p><p>\"Many European cities have also developed local climate adaptation plans and initiatives, such as green infrastructure, management of heatwaves, or improving flood risk management,\" she added, explaining: \"Cities like Vienna and Salzburg, in Austria, are tackling the urban heat island effect through a combination of actions ranging from greening and the use of reflective building materials to energy efficiency measures and investments in sustainable modes of transport.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Using data for adaptation financing</emphasis></p><p>One of the reports deals specifically with the issue of how to finance increased climate adaptation preparedness. It notes that early investment is much more cost-effective than later investment, and that prioritization is the best way to focus spending. This means that countries should focus financing on more risk-exposed areas or assets that may be vulnerable to disaster impacts and put people in danger or cause major disruptions, such as ageing infrastructure or critical networks.</p><p>The report notes that more research and data are needed on where those vulnerabilities are and what kinds of costs would be involved in remedying the situation. It suggests that countries develop climate \"adaptation pathways\" that set the direction of travel, combining current and future climate risk data.</p><p>Given current information, the report estimates that the cost of climate adaptation will vary between (EURO)34 to (EURO)110 per person per year, depending on where they live. Total adaptation costs in the European Union up to the 2030s could be between (EURO)15 billion to (EURO)64 billion annually - suggesting a necessary scale of adaptation finance between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent of EU GDP.</p><p>\"Adaptation pathways combine the needs and priorities across all economic and administrative sectors,\" explains Solene Dengler, a senior climate change adaptation specialist with the World Bank who worked on the report.</p><p>\"This means countries need to carry out more and better studies both at national and sectoral levels to identify adaptation gaps, costs, and benefits of adaptation measures and track adaptation expenditures and implementation,\" said Dengler.</p><p>The report concludes several specific case studies such as wildfires and extreme heat in Bulgaria, floods impact transport in Romania, and wildfire prevention in the forestry sector in Sweden.</p><p>But for costs to be correctly estimated so governments can steer financing in the right direction, better data is needed.</p><p>\"There is a lack of information on projected impacts of climate risks for the short to medium term from the 2030s to the 2050s), especially to inform sectoral or investment portfolio assessments,\" says Dengler.</p><p>She remarked: \"Strengthening a country's financial resilience will also require improved macroeconomic modelling that can better capture extreme impacts and take into account adjusted macroeconomic impacts when policymakers are considering a package of adaptation measures. At the EU level, the recent European Climate Risk Assessment and this report are important contributions to this evolving knowledge base.\"</p><p>In the end, neither climate change adaptation nor climate change mitigation strategies should distract from the other, she said, \"Climate change adaptation is complementary to climate change mitigation. Acting on both is economically beneficial, can reduce direct losses from disaster and climate impacts and have broader social and environmental benefits.\"</p><p>The report concludes that a major scale-up of public, private, and blended finance will be necessary and investment planning and financial strategies are not yet adequately informed by an understanding of the costs of climate change adaptation at national and EU levels.</p><p>One area of concern is that too much of the disaster and climate risk is managed through budgetary instruments at the EU level and by EU Member States, with gaps concerning pre-arranged funds and the use of risk transfer mechanisms, such as risk insurance.</p><p>Response operations to wildfires account for approximately one-third of total response costs in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/topics/civil-protection-mechanism/\">European Union Civil Protection Mechanism</url> budget. But if the EU experienced wildfires this year similar to the extremes of the 2017 season, there would need to be a 70 per cent increase in the annual budget. This, the report concludes, shows that not enough planning has gone into matching financing needs with disaster potential based on previous experience.</p><p>\"The major takeaway is that the EU's substantial climate risks require system-wide transformational adaptation, which includes reforming institutions, legal frameworks, and sectoral strategies,\" said Dengler, adding: \"A piecemeal approach is no longer enough. Adaptation measures must be mainstreamed and coordinated across sectors and ministries, including in planning, fiscal, and sectoral strategies.\"</p><p>[By Dave Keating\u00a0I Edited by Brian Maguire | <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/content_providers/euractivs-advocacy-lab/\">Euractiv's Advocacy Lab</url> ]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionclimateenvironmentnewseuropeunpreparedforclimatedisasterwarnsworldbank</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2X-RGV1-JCMC-W0HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

For winter wheat, the most important grain crop, yields remained around 3% below the multi-year average.</p><p>\"Where there was heavy rainfall at harvest time, quality suffered, especially for wheat,\" the report explained.</p><p>\u00d6zdemir called to draw lessons from this year's mixed harvest data. \"Anyone who believes that we can delay working on climate protection and climate

crops safely in 20, 30 or 50 years' time,\" he added.</p><p>The argument that this year's harvest offers a first glimpse into German farmers' future in the face of climate change was shared by farmers and green campaigners alike.</p><p>German farmers' association President Joachim Rukwied spoke of the \"clearly noticeable effects of climate change\" during the association's harvest projection presentation last week.</p><p>Likewise, the President of environmental NGO NABU, J\u00f6rg-Andreas Kr\u00fcger, said this year shows \"how the climate and nature crisis pose challenges to food

need to do everything we can to ensure yields and food security in the future.\" This includes \"breeding more resilient plant varieties, a wide range of active ingredients for crop protection, water-saving and conservation tillage, and targeted promotion of irrigation infrastructure.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the German section of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) pointed to a diverse agricultural landscape as a way to make agriculture more climate resilient, as it \"prevents erosion, provides habitat for natural counterparts to pathogens and pests, and keeps water where it is needed to produce valuable food for as long as possible.\"</p><p>The German harvest data also comes amid ongoing <url

Since then, hundreds of protesters from California and Texas to Atlanta and Boston have been arrested as they emulated the Columbia encampments.</p><p>Across the US, student protesters are demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, the divestment of university assets in companies involved with the Israeli military, and an end to US military assistance to Israel.</p><p>The May 1968 protests in France started with far-left student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism, and traditional institutions.</p><p>They triggered wildcat strikes of up to ten million workers, and for a few days, the movement looked like it was about to overthrow the government, which briefly ceased to function after President Charles de Gaulle secretly fled to West Germany on 29 May.</p><p>This time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/elections/news/gaza-student-protest-in-paris-sees-tense-standoff-with-israel-supporters/\">students in Paris</url> - obviously inspired by their colleagues in the US - blocked access to a campus building at a prestigious French university, Sciences Po, on Friday.</p><p>The move came two days after police broke up a separate pro-Palestine demonstration at the university's amphitheatre outside one of its Paris campuses.</p><p>Protesters gathered at the building's windows, chanted slogans, and hung placards reading \"We are all Palestinians,\" in defiance of administrators who students say called the police on their peers two days earlier.</p><p>France is home to the world's largest Jewish population after Israel and the US, as well as Europe's biggest Muslim community.</p><p>However, less than 24 hours after the start of the Sciences Po blockade, the students reportedly gave up after the institute managers said they would drop any disciplinary action against them in return for surrender.</p><p>In return, students were promised that the University would end partnerships with universities and organisations supporting the state of Israel.</p><p>The story may not be over, but it looks like today's French students did not find followers in society as did their colleagues two generations ago.</p><p>The difference with 1968, both in France and in the US, is that back then, several societal issues were at stake, while today, the controversy is focused on governmental support for Israel, be it on behalf of the US or France, at a time when images of the humanitarian disaster in Gaza raise eyebrows worldwide.</p><p>Also, the 2024 protests are fragilised by accusations of antisemitism launched by Israel and its supporters. Student leaders both in the US and France have acknowledged that isolated incidents of antisemitism and harassment have occurred but blamed them on outsiders who they say have sought to hijack their movement.</p><p>Are the pro-Palestine student protests going to impact the elections in the US in November and the European elections on 6-9 June?</p><p>In France, the leftist pro-Palestinian party <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">La France Insoumise</emphasis> of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon may benefit a bit, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer.</p><p>In the US, the protests may have an impact, but realistically only on the government's political and military support for Israel.</p><p>Without this support, Israel would seek other policies. Israel is a small country by territory and population that overplays its international outreach thanks to the US support, which it takes for granted.</p><p>It's thanks to US support in the UN Security Council and the US supply of weapons that Israel is flattening Gaza at the expense of, and with disregard for, so many 'collateral victims'.</p><p>But if the students' protests could contribute to forcing Benyamin Netanyahu's Israel to a truce, their effort would not have been in vain.</p><p>While 1968 didn't bring revolutions, there was clearly an evolution. The war in Vietnam stopped. The French society became more modern.</p><p>Perhaps a similar positive evolution could happen now.</p><h>The Roundup</h><p>Pedro <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/breaking-spanish-prime-minister-pedro-sanchez-will-not-resign/\">S\u00e1nchez announced on Monday he will stay on as Spain's prime ministe</url>r - after hinting last week that he would consider resigning as a Madrid judge opened an investigation against his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, for alleged corruption and influence peddling.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/scottish-first-minister-resigns-after-power-sharing-terminated/\">Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf announced on Monday that he will leave office</url> following his decision to dissolve the governing coalition between his Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) and the Scottish Greens last week.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement-neighbourhood/news/eu-needs-marshall-plan-for-moldova-and-ukraine-sandu-says/\">EU should develop an 'equivalent' version of the World War Two-era US Marshall Plan to fund development projects in Moldova and war-torn Ukrain</url>e, Moldovan President Maia Sandu said on Monday.</p><p>According to French government sources,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/paris-leads-coalition-of-eu-states-to-demand-actions-against-uk-ban-on-bottom-fishing/\"> nine EU countries will meet in Brussels at the start of the week to discuss the impact of the UK's decision to ban bottom fishing</url> in 13 marine protected areas, a measure London says applies equally to its own fishermen and those from the EU.</p><p>The European <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/donagh-nuclear-e300-million-of-state-aids-for-french-nuward-smrs-project/\">Commission has approved a (EURO)300 million state aid grant for Nuward, a French developer of small modular nuclear reactors</url> (SMR), to test its technology with more support expected before the project starts in 2030.</p><p>Noyb, the Austrian non-profit founded by activist Max Schrems, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/schrems-ngo-files-gdpr-complaint-against-openai-over-ai-hallucinations/\">has filed a complaint with the local privacy authority, alleging that OpenAI has violated the EU's General Data Protection Regulation</url> (GDPR) and has not\u00a0done enough to correct inaccurate personal information provided by ChatGPT.</p><p>A report by the European Environment Agency (EEA) released on Monday finds that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-report-91-of-cities-look-to-nature-based-solutions-in-face-of-climate-change/\">almost all European cities are turning to nature-based solutions to keep in check higher temperatures</url> and other climate change impacts.</p><p>As the European Commission prepares proposals for a further round of enlargement, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/enlargement-neighbourhood/news/eus-big-bang-enlargement-how-10-countries-transformed-the-eu/\">two decades since the 2004 'big bang' enlargement show\u00a0the ups and downs that could lie ahead</url>.</p><h>Look out for...</h><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>General Affairs Council on Monday-Tuesday.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>G7 Ministers' Meeting on Climate, Energy and Environment in Turin on Tuesday.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Commissioner Kadri Simson, Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra hold meetings with Japan's Economy and Trade Minister Ken Saito in Turin on Tuesday.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Commissioner Jutta Urpilainen receives IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Views are the author's</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic/Alice Taylor]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionglobaleuropeopinionthebrief19682024studentscontinuingthefight</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BX7-GSR1-JCMC-W2DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

But how can entrepreneurs channel their drive to innovate with and for nature?</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Victoria Blessing is Senior Project Manager at Steinbeis Europa Zentrum. Fernando Barrientos is Senior Project Consultant at Steinbeis Europa Zentrum.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature-based solutions</emphasis> (NBS) are expected to deliver a crucial contribution to the climate and biodiversity crisis while supporting more healthy environments and job creation. NBS are, in a nutshell, cost-effective solutions inspired and supported by nature which provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Some NBS are actually a revival of traditional methods, whereas many others are brand-new ideas. The project <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/\">NetworkNature</url> focused on maximising the impact and spread of NBS by creating opportunities for local, regional and international cooperation.</p><p>The public sector at the local, national and supranational level is pushing its own agenda to support NBS. The European Union, for instance, approved the <url normalizedValue=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030</url> which includes several actions such as enlarging protected areas on land and at sea, restoring degraded ecosystems, unlocking funding, etc. One crucial aspect to put these bundle of measures in place will be NBS.</p><p>Big corporations are following their own pathway to be part of the transition to a nature-positive economy as they increasingly see a chance in NBS to lower their costs, add value to commercial/private property and increase their compliance with the three sustainability aspects Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). In global forums such as the World Economic Forum, the business case for investing in NBS regularly discussed (see the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Future_Of_Nature_And_Business_2020.pdf\">New Nature Economy Report II - The Future of Nature and Business</url>).</p><p>However, what can smaller actors -entrepreneurs- do to, on the one hand, be part of the transition to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/product/25930\">nature positive economy</url> and, on the other hand, capture part of the benefits that they create with their entrepreneurial drive? Certainly there is a lot of potential and the lack of new approaches and innovative products, services and business models is not the main problem. However, embodying novel ideas into real teams and organisations as well as business models (adapted to the particularities of NBS), growing your network of stakeholders, understanding the regulatory environment applicable to your business model or accessing the necessary funds to start your venture are possibly much more daunting challenges.</p><p>Building on the results generated by research and innovation projects funded by the European Commission, we have condensed several sources of information and depicted them in a reader friendly and practical way in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/d52-business-information-packagenew.pdf\">Nature-based solutions Business information package</url>, as part of the work within the <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/\">NetworkNature</url> project. Regardless if you are just starting out, you are a professional already, or if you simply want to learn more, this publication has useful information for everyone. It was conceived to help individuals, advocacy/academic groups and local communities to help you bring your idea to the next level.</p><p>We have covered some basic background information as well as some of the most essential concepts that you need to make yourself familiar with in order to smoothen your arrival to this exciting field of business. We begin by introducing the concepts of NBS and nature-based enterprises (NBE). NBE are enterprises which contribute to the development and delivery of NBS and for whom nature is at the core of their business. NBE can be a relevant vehicle to deliver the NBS that are needed to speed up the transition towards a nature positive economy and seize the business opportunities that this market sector has to offer. Some examples of the previous are the already well established market of NBS for green buildings, but NBS also find application in the field of water management &amp; treatment, sustainable tourism, health &amp; wellbeing, etc. The publication also presents two success stories of existing NBE (one from Germany and one from Belgium) who are already doing their part to tackle the biodiversity and climate crises. In addition, you will get a first insight on what are the future prospects and business opportunities of this field. Moreover, you will get a better understanding of what a \"value proposition\" is, what is meant by \"creating, delivering and capturing value\", etc. We close the Business information package by providing practical guidance to start you NBS journey, including exploring policy and legislation, networking and funding opportunities. If you want to learn more about any of these aspects, the document contains a lot of hyperlinks where you can find additional resources.</p><p>If you want to learn more about NBS and NBE, don't hesitate to visit our <url normalizedValue=\"https://networknature.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/d52-business-information-packagenew.pdf\">website</url>.

Tree planting, a key part of several countries' COP26 pledges, is one such proposal\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but experts say that reforestation, while essential, is far from a silver bullet against climate crises.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two of the world's biggest fossil-fuel producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia, have promised in recent weeks to go carbon neutral by 2060. Both Moscow and Riyadh plan to offset much of their carbon emissions from fossil fuels by planting millions of trees.</p><p>And they are\u00a0not alone. COP26 host Boris Johnson wants to make tree planting a priority at the UN climate conference\u00a0along with additional action\u00a0on \"coal, cars and cash\".</p><p>\"To be net-zero for carbon you must be net-positive for trees, and by 2030 we want to be planting far more trees across the world than we are losing,\" the British prime minister said in August.</p><p>Tree-planting belongs to a wider set of environmental measures known as \"nature-based solutions\", which the UN and many scientists say are critical to averting catastrophic climate change\u00a0\u2013 and which COP26 organisers hope to propel into the mainstream.</p><p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which coined the term, defines nature-based solutions as \"actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural and modified ecosystems\". Protecting and expanding forests is central to this approach.</p><p>\"Forests, and in particular tropical forests, absorb about a third of the greenhouse gases emitted every year,\" explained Anne Larigauderie, executive secretary of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u00a0(IPBES), which works with the UN on protecting\u00a0biodiversity, in an interview with FRANCE 24. \"They could do much more if we stopped deforestation and invested more in forest management and the protection of these ecosystems.\"</p><p>Mangrove restoration is often cited as a key example, as these unique ecosystems act as natural barriers against coastal erosion and flooding.</p><p>Simply planting trees, though, does not cut it.</p><p>\"Nature-based solutions must have a double benefit,\" said\u00a0Freddy Rey, a specialist in ecological engineering at France's National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRAE). \"At least one must concern nature, and the other, society \u2013 for example, the fight against climate change, health, food security or protection from natural hazards.\"</p><p>In France, INRAE's researchers have added vegetation along the banks of some waterways to fight erosion\u00a0and therefore flooding. Rey said this offers a more lasting alternative to traditional dams.</p><p>\"Over time\u00a0the vegetation will spread, whereas artificial barriers will wear down,\" he told\u00a0FRANCE 24. According to the IUCN, nature-based solutions are often less costly in the long term than the construction and maintenance of technological infrastructure.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Normandy village takes a gamble on letting in the rising sea</p><p>'Buzz' around nature-based solutions</p><p>Of course, planting trees and expanding green spaces are not new ideas. But Rey said that, at least in France, the \"nature-based solutions\" label has succeeded in \"creating a buzz\" around ecological practices, especially among elected officials. Lawmakers are working with INRAE to develop solutions to local environmental issues. NGOs are also playing a role, like the group France Nature Environment, which last year published a guide for cities seeking to implement these kinds of solutions.</p><p>While practices like reforestation may be \"low tech\"\u00a0they still require highly specialised research and innovation.</p><p>\"Far from simply ornamental greening projects \u2013 whose maintenance often involves intensive use of water, energy\u00a0and fertilisers \u2013 nature-based solutions rest on scientific knowledge and technical know-how drawn largely from ecological engineering,\" said one recent study.</p><p>Larigauderie\u00a0of IPBES\u00a0laments that, at major international climate talks, \"people often talk about technical and technological solutions \u2026 and don't pay enough attention to nature as a source of solutions\".</p><p>&gt;&gt; Costa Rica: A climate success story</p><p>For all the promise they hold, nature-based solutions should not be seen as a miracle cure for the climate. The natural world constantly shifts and evolves, and researchers must adapt accordingly. Planting along shores and waterways, for example, has its limits.</p><p>\"While we've mastered the design methods for civil engineering\u00a0based on mechanical and physical properties, the same isn't true for plant engineering, which brings into play living materials whose properties are much harder to control,\" said INRAE researcher Andr\u00e9 Evette in a statement.</p><p>Mountainous regions, lakes and actively used waterways present particular challenges.</p><p>Disguising 'climate-trashing'</p><p>\"We shouldn't think we're going to change the world with plant stems. We're not going to stop tidal waves with branches,\" said Rey. \"You need a balance between these nature-based solutions and the know-how of civil engineering.\"</p><p>Some NGOs, such as Friends of the Earth, meanwhile fear that nature-based solutions can \"disguise climate-trashing business as usual\".</p><p>\"Under the guise of Nature Based Solutions, big business and governments continue to expand \u2026 industrial agriculture and fossil fuel extraction, while claiming to address their climate impacts through investment in activities such as mass tree planting,\" Friends of the Earth wrote in a recent statement.</p><p>Larigauderie likewise noted\u00a0that the concept can be slippery, and warns against putting too much stake in it.</p><p>\"Nature will not be able to absorb a frantic increase in our consumption,\" she cautioned. \"The number one message is that we must reduce our energy consumption, and rethink our lifestyles and agriculture. Nature can do a lot for us, but we must also correct ourselves.\"</p><p>The COP26 summit\u00a0will take stock of the actions taken by governments to meet the targets set by the 2015\u00a0Paris Agreement\u00a0and the stiff challenges that remain if they are to keep global warming below 1.5\u00b0 or even 2\u00b0\u00a0Celsius. Building on the recent COP15 talks on biodiversity, COP26 has nature-based solutions on the agenda, with one of its 10 working days devoted to the theme of nature.</p><p>Many hope it will be just the beginning for what the UN calls \"an essential part of the overall global effort to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement\".</p><p>This article was adapted from the original in French.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-256908724</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63YY-VMM1-F11P-X21B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

This is astounding, considering the costs of land degradation for sectors like food and agriculture - soil degradation is estimated to <url normalizedValue=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/soil-erosion-costs-european-farmers-eu125-billion-year-2018-02-27_en\">cost EU farmers an average of (EURO)1.25 billion a year</url>. While estimates vary, several prominent observers agree that we are currently falling short by hundreds of billions of dollars for biodiversity, nature-based solutions and reversing land degradation at the global level.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We need new financing models that share the load across societal sectors if we're going to achieve the multiple European targets that include climate and nature. Along with 19 international organizations including the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/\">World Resource Institute</url>,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goldstandard.org/\">Gold Standard</url>,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/\">The Nature Conservancy</url>, and EIT\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate-kic.org/\">Climate KIC</url>, we've put forward one such framework: <url normalizedValue=\"https://commonland.com/revitalising-europes-landscapes-new-report-on-financing-large-scale-nature-restoration/\">\"Landscape Finance\"</url>, a financing approach that supports holistic, systemic, and community-driven landscape restoration.\u00a0</p><p>Holistic landscape restoration is a model for restoring landscapes that enables local stakeholders to make their landscapes more climate-resilient, as well as more socially and economically prosperous. Holistic landscape restoration has more than just ecological benefits - by bringing people together to restore their landscape, it can build social cohesion and capital among and between communities, as well as serving as the backbone of thriving local and regional economies. By producing benefits for multiple sectors and stakeholder groups, holistic landscape restoration can contribute to a more resilient and sustainable future in line with the EU Green Deal's vision.</p><p>Through Landscape Finance, policymakers could catalyse transformative change via holistic landscape restoration, making lasting impact on Europe's landscapes.\u00a0Here are some recommendations for how EU policymakers can integrate a Landscape Finance approach into their work:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. LANDSCAPES AND LANDSCAPE PARTNERSHIPS NEED TO BE RECOGNISED IN POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE AND TO MEET MULTIPLE TARGETS\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should allocate resources to support landscape partnerships that drive holistic landscape restoration</emphasis>. Public funds in the form of unrestricted and flexible grant funding should be made available to support multi- stakeholder landscape partnership and governance processes to catalyse restoration. This is the most catalytic of all funding opportunities within holistic landscape restoration as the partnership develops the vision and plan for the landscape, providing governance and driving long- term restoration.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implement incentives that are aligned to nature</emphasis>. It is critical to redirect or eliminate environmentally harmful incentives, such as subsidies, on behalf of activities that restore ecosystems and enhance ecosystem services. Accelerating the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and applying the reform with integrity will be instrumental in aligning nature and agricultural biodiversity objectives and finance. By aligning policies to reward benefits appropriately and financially penalise harms, governments can encourage nature-positive actions and discourage harmful ones.\u00a0</p><p>Holistic landscape restoration can serve as an enabling platform to streamline implementation of national plans targeting the same landscape. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National and regional development plans (including National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans) of EU member states should recognise landscapes and landscape partnerships</emphasis>, facilitating vertical and horizontal policy coherence and integration of national spatial planning and budgeting across sectors. This should be done to best suit the policy and fiscal systems of each country. However, regardless of each country's level of decentralised decision-making, landscapes can be leveraged to implement adaptation, nature restoration and drought plans, among other policies.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop harmonised accounting and reporting frameworks for landscapes </emphasis>that enable the private sector (companies and investors) to report against emerging sustainable finance regulations such as the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. PUBLIC FINANCE CAN PLAY A CRUCIAL, CATALYTIC ROLE IN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All guidance documentation for the Nature Restoration Law developed by the European Commission should explicitly recognise the value of landscapes in tackling multiple goals and be translated in national restoration plans</emphasis>. By fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among government agencies, NGOs, businesses and local communities at landscape level, diverse interests can be aligned, and resources pooled, to implement strategies that tackle multiple challenges in a cost-efficient and effective way.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should produce a guidance document on how to incorporate landscape restoration into national restoration plans</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The commission should develop a mechanism with the mandate to provide earmarked funding for landscapes</emphasis>. Within the current multiannual financing framework (MFF), Directorates-General that will benefit from restoration (CLIMA, ENV, AGRI, EMPL, REGIO, SANTE, etc.) should earmark portions of their budgets for landscape restoration. These earmarked budget elements could be put under one governance system, a dedicated restoration fund. Equally, dedicated financial support should be considered in the new MFF (2028-2034). This could be done through a funding programme similar to the European Innovation Council Accelerator, targeted towards attracting private finance to holistic landscape restoration activities and processes - for example, by providing guarantees to de-risk investments, or by providing subordinated funding as part of a blended-finance approach. The European Investment Bank could provide advisory support to such a vehicle and/or provide co- investment.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. WITHIN HOLISTIC LANDSCAPE RESTORATION, INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS SHOULD ADOPT A LONG-TERM HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE, INCORPORATING RESTORATION OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENHANCE CLIMATE RESILIENCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU institutions and member states should provide public funding for landscape restoration initiatives to enable the integration of grey infrastructure projects with improvements in associated green infrastructure</emphasis>. Taking a holistic approach to these investments at landscape level will be more cost-effective, and it will improve the resilience of the total investment to the physical risks of climate change while generating multiple valuable public benefits. Large scale landscape restoration projects should get similar financial support and attention as large grey infrastructure projects.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We need Landscape Finance more than ever</emphasis></p><p>As farmers protests crank up a notch and EU officials threaten to dial back Green Deal measures, the question of how to achieve the EU Green Deal's vision has never been more pressing. More than ever, we need new financing frameworks like Landscape Finance to support nature restoration as well as help farmers to transition to more regenerative practices at landscape scale.

Since 2013, we've been on a mission to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land to ensure ecosystems, economies and communities thrive well into the future. Today, we work in over 20 countries to facilitate landscape restoration and drive change at a global scale. Our practical approach - the 4 Returns framework - is helping people worldwide to restore our home planet and keep it healthy for generations to come.\u00a0 In November 2023, Commonland co-authored a new report proposing the application of an investment concept called \"Landscape Finance\" as a financing approach for supporting holistic landscape restoration with a coalition of 19 environmental organisations, including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wri.org/\">World Resource Institute</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goldstandard.org/\">Gold Standard</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.org/en-us/\">The Nature Conservancy</url>, and EIT <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate-kic.org/\">Climate KIC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodopiniontoachievetheeugreendealweneedlandscapefinance</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8X-0DD1-JCMC-W534-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1363\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

Growth in revenues, combined with our disciplined costs and risks management, allows us to significantly improve our cost-to-income ratio and profitability. Our capital and liquidity ratios remain very strong. We continue to move forward in an orderly and efficient manner with the implementation of our strategic roadmap, as demonstrated in the sustained development of BoursoBank which is exceeding the 6.5 million clients threshold, and as shown by the launch of the first phase of our 1 billion euros investment dedicated to the energy transition.

Still penalised by the residual impact of short-term hedges booked until the beginning of 2022 (around EUR -150 million over the quarter), net interest income continued to recover in Q2 24 (+10% vs. Q2 23) despite an increasing share of interest-bearing deposits and a muted loan environment in a competitive market on the other hand.

Revenues were driven by a strong quarter for securitization, a rebound in investment banking activities and ongoing sustained commercial momentum for financing activities.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global Transaction &amp; Payment Services'</emphasis>activities posted a +13.5% increase in revenues vs. Q2 23, driven by favourable market environment and a sustained commercial development across the board.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mobility,</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International Retail Banking and Financial Services'</emphasis>revenues were down by -2.3% vs. Q2\u00a023.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">International Retail Banking's</emphasis>revenues stood at EUR 1.0 billion, which is stable vs. Q2 23, notably on the back of a favourable environment in Romania and Africa. Revenues for the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mobility and Financial Services'</emphasis>businesses contracted by -4.0% vs. Q2 23 owing to the high base effect of around EUR\u00a0200 million on Ayvens whose revenues notably benefited in Q2 23 from significant positive impacts associated with reduction in depreciation costs (around EUR +160 million in Q2 23), while they were negatively impacted by almost EUR 40 million in Q2 24 on the back of hyperinflation in Turkey.

One fifth! The situation for nature on our doorstep is worse than feared. Almost twice as many European species are endangered as expected. The reasons for this are of course complex, but one of the most important is the intensive use of land and seas, which is destroying ecosystems and leads to the loss of habitats.</p><p>Our meadows and fields are becoming quiet and intact ecosystems are slowly but inevitably disintegrating because we are dissecting them with highways or putting them under pressure from intensive agriculture. This is precisely the reason why the European Commission presented the Nature Restoration Law last year. After three years of the Green Deal, it thus took the necessary step to create a legal basis, as with the European Climate Law, to stop the extinction of species and give ecosystems room to breathe again.</p><h>One milestone reached, more ahead</h><p>The text, which was agreed in yesterday's negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council, comes rather late in view of the ecological calamity on our European doorstep, but at least it's there.</p><p>And it is something to be proud of. After the initial blockade by the conservative EPP group in the European Parliament was overcome, we have now created a strong legal basis after weeks of negotiations between Parliament and the Council and are thus fulfilling our international obligations.</p><p>At the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal last year, the European Union advocated an ambitious global agreement to save biodiversity. In other words, an agreement under which 30% of land and sea areas are to be protected and 30% of destroyed ecosystems are to be restored by 2030. For the EU, this means that we need more protected areas, the existing ones must be better shielded from environmentally damaging influences, improved with management measures and we need a legal basis for restoration.</p><p>Three aspects of the new law are fundamental to this:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The peatlands are back in the law. After the European Parliament had unceremoniously deleted the whole article, the world's best climate crisis fighters are finally back in. Member states must take measures to revitalise peatlands. This is not only important for biodiversity, but also to achieve our climate targets, as 10% of the necessary emission reductions until 2030 are to be achieved in the land sector.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Nature needs space - and it gets it. By 2030, renaturation measures must be introduced on 20 % of the land area of the EU. This is the only way nature can recover and ecosystem services can be secured.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Borders do not matter for nature. This is precisely why the restoration measures are not limited to Natura 2000 areas, but can also take place outside of protected areas.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>No question: it is a compromise and it remains to be seen whether the challenges will be mastered. But it is a start.</p><p>The road to get there was bumpy, but the road ahead will be too. Because the new compromise will now go back to the legislative bodies, the environmental council of ministers, and the environmental committee of the parliament, and in the latter, it will face a tough vote.</p><p>If it fails there, there is a risk of an enormous delay or even the complete end of the months-long negotiations. Europe's species extinction would therefore continue and climate action would be maimed. The next decisive milestone will therefore be the final committee vote at the end of November.</p><h>Without nature, everything is nothing</h><p>It must be clear to us: without nature, everything is nothing. It sounds trivial, but it is based on hard economic numbers.</p><p>With the ecosystem service pollination alone, insects provide 12% of the average annual profit of the EU agricultural sector. They are warrantors of our food security. On top of this, 30-50% of carbon-rich ecosystems need to be restored in order to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p><p>CO2 storage by healthy ecosystems would contribute to this and is already included in the EU climate target for 2030: 10% of the necessary emission reductions are to be achieved in the land sector.</p><p>That is precisely why this law is needed. It is the new foundation for nature's recovery. It can stop the extinction of species and finally secure new space, it can prioritise nature-based solutions such as revitalised peatlands, and it can create stable revenues for farmers who produce in a nature-friendly way.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionbiodiversityopinionnaturerestorationlawadoptedintrialoguebutstillalongwaytogo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69KS-9V81-F03F-K55P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

a 100% reduction in net GHG emissions - by 2040, and to cut emissions by 2030 by 65%,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wwf.eu/?10944466/ESABCC-report-2040-targets\">the conservation group said</url>.</p><p>Pascal Canfin, the chair of the European Parliament's environment committee, also supports a high target for 2040.</p><p>According to him, the pace of emission cuts set for 2020 and 2030 (-20% and -55% compared to 1990 levels) already puts the EU on a trajectory to achieve a 90% cut in emissions by 2040.</p><p>\"If we make the same effort between 2030 and 2040, we will reach -90%,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.fr/section/energie-climat/interview/pascal-canfin-wopke-hoekstra-a-besoin-du-soutien-de-quatre-groupes-politiques-au-parlement/\">he told Euractiv in a recent interview</url>.</p><p>Canfin also pointed to the Paris Agreement, which says emissions in rich countries must be reduced to net zero by 2050 \"at the latest\", suggesting a 2045 deadline would be preferable to keep in line with the EU's commitments.</p><p>\"According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Europe should reach net zero by 2045,\" the French MEP said.</p><h>Carbon removals</h><p>Another key issue in the 2040 target debate is the share of emission cuts that can be expected from carbon removals achieved from nature-based solutions like forests and nature conservation.</p><p>According to Carbon Market Watch, a clear distinction must be made, with separate targets for emissions reductions, carbon removals from land use and forestry (LULUCF), and those achieved by technological means like Direct Air Capture (DAC).</p><p>\"We strongly recommend separating emission reductions from technological carbon removals and LULUCF targets,\" Carbon Market Watch says in its <url normalizedValue=\"https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CMW-Position-paper-input-to-EC-2040-target-consultation.pdf\">contribution to the Commission's 2040 target plan</url>.</p><p>In this context, Van den Plas notes that the Commission will also present a communication on an \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13848-Industrial-carbon-management-carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage-deployment_en\">industrial carbon management plan</url>\" on 6 February, with the aim of developing carbon capture and storage technologies to abate emissions from heavy industries.</p><p>\"Carbon removal has a role to play, but if the policy focuses only on offsetting for heavy industries, there's a risk that we'll continue to produce greenhouse gas emissions,\" Van den Plas warns.</p><p>Crucially, activists say carbon removal credits must be excluded from trading under the EU's carbon market, the Emissions Trading Scheme, in order to maintain pressure on polluters to decarbonise.</p><p>\"Carbon markets are inherently unsuitable for carbon removals because quality is the key concern, not price,\" CMW argues.</p><p>Doing so would also risk undermining the EU's carbon market because it would \"send a signal to market participants that the EU ETS cap will not be binding in the future,\" it warns.</p><p>Rather, \"a\u00a0separate target for these removals should be established based on a robust assessment of the sustainability and potential impact of these activities,\" CMW argues.</p><h>Avoiding deindustrialisation</h><p>European industries, for their part, say they support the EU's climate objectives but warn that decarbonisation policies must also preserve their competitiveness relative to companies outside of Europe.</p><p>\"A 90% headline target for the entire EU society entails almost a full decarbonisation of energy intensive industries such as steel,\" says the European Steel Association, Eurofer.</p><p>\"This is possible only if there is the certainty of having access to competitive clean energy in unprecedented quantities, while levelling the playing field with other regions of the world that do not share the same climate ambition,\" Eurofer adds, noting that decarbonising the EU steel industry alone \"would require the equivalent of Germany's current electricity consumption.\"</p><p>The European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) agrees. In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://cefic.org/policy-matters/2040-eu-climate-target/\">contribution to the EU's 2040 climate target debate</url>, it says\u00a0\"solid funding solutions\" must be available to support low-carbon investments, alongside greater \"availability and accessibility to low-carbon and renewable energy\".</p><p>CEFIC's fear is that the combination of high energy prices, rising carbon costs and lack of financial support from governments will push chemical companies to locate new factories outside of the EU, where production costs are usually lower.</p><p>\"Europe's efforts to reduce industrial emissions should not lead to the delocalisation of parts of vital industrial value chains,\" CEFIC warns.</p><p>Eurofer argues along the same line, saying \"climate ambition must be achieved through innovation and investment in Europe rather than through deindustrialisation\".</p><h>Next steps</h><p>The EU's 27 environment ministers will have an opportunity to discuss the 2040 target plan when they gather on 16 January for the first informal Environment Council held under the Belgian Presidency of the EU.</p><p>After the Commission tables its proposal on 6 February, a formal exchange will then take place at the Environment Council on 25 March.</p><p>EU heads of state will then have an opportunity to weigh in on the debate at a summit on 27-28 June as part of the EU's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/strategic-agenda-2024-2029/\">Strategic Agenda for 2024-2029</url>, which will set the EU's priorities for the new institutional cycle after the June EU elections.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon/Nathalie Weatherald]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentnews2024lookaheadclimatetargetfor2040willbeeucommissionslegacyactivistssay</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B17-DYC1-JCMC-W41C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

It was not a new concept, or unknown to science, but it was new to policy makers. Today, in less than 10 years, the concept is well known, fairly well understood and broadly accepted globally.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Janez Potocnik is Co-chair International Resource Panel.</emphasis></p><p>This is not a surprise. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Circular bioeconomy is the oldest concept on planet Earth</emphasis>. All nature is based on the principles of a circular economy: nothing is lost, and everything has its purpose. We humans, as part of nature, should abide by the same principles. Unfortunately, what seems logical in theory isn't so clear in practice.\u00a0</p><p>According to the UNEP International Resource Panel, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.resourcepanel.org/sites/default/files/documents/document/media/making_climate_targets_achievable_improving_wellbeing_through_reduced_absolute_resource_use.pdf\">resource use is at the roots of our triple planetary crises</url> (climate, biodiversity loss, pollution), and the trends are alarming. Resource use generates deep inequalities: high-income countries have benefitted most, and have driven the planetary crisis, whilst emerging and developing economies hold least responsibility, and are facing the worst impacts. The central question we should ask is how to meet human needs and maximise our wellbeing in the most energy- and resource-efficient way. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For that, we would need to decouple economic growth and wellbeing from unsustainable natural resource use and environmental impacts.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Circular bioeconomy should be understood in general terms as an efficient instrument for delivering decoupling in practice, as well as a part of the bigger picture of economic, societal, and cultural transformation needed to deliver the European Green Deal and Sustainable Development Goals.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy recognition of circular economy solutions is encouraging, and some circular bioeconomy actors are already delivering decoupling in practice</emphasis>. But if Ellen MacArthur's famous butterfly would fly, it would be 'flying in circles' as we have done more on the butterfly's techno sphere wing of technical materials than on the biosphere wing of renewable materials!</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/image2.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Nature provides us with a wide range of services, like the food we eat, the water we drink, and the biomass we use for building houses, for producing chemicals, fuels, and clothing. But it also provides those less tangible benefits, linked to ecosystem services, such as climate adaptation and mitigation, flood prevention by forests and trees, or the pollination of crops by insects. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investment in nature-based solutions offers multiple opportunities to unlock new revenue streams and increase societal engagement.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Future demand for biomass will increase. To exploit the full potential that biomass offers, and since the environmental impacts of biomass use could be high, particularly on biodiversity, some basic principles need to be followed</emphasis>. Clear guidelines and agreed sustainability criteria are essential to establish the needed trust. Greenwashing should be avoided, as it risks to backfire and reduce the credibility and potential of biomass use. Access to carbon-rich natural systems must be subject to the condition of limiting biodiversity impacts. The bioeconomy's potential to address climate change should not be at the price of biodiversity loss. Certification of EU forests under Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) schemes, which provides a third-party verification of management quality on the ground, are important steps to provide the needed credibility.</p><p>Sustainably produced biomass is a scarce resource, thus a 'cascading use' approach should be the norm. Biomass sourcing should preferably focus on biomass waste. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Priority should be given to long-term uses, where carbon is stored, and in applications\u00a0where alternative materials with very large impacts can be substituted.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For example, plastic with paper in packaging, or\u00a0steel and concrete with wood in\u00a0construction.</emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>Most circular strategies still focus on cleaning supply chains, resource efficiency and better waste management. These are all needed but miss the major opportunities for improving resilience through reducing demand for energy and materials altogether. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What we really need are systemic interventions, which would encourage and limit the need for energy and resource use</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">in the first place. </emphasis>Policy attention should be given to most energy and resource intensive systems like mobility, housing, nutrition, daily functional needs, and of course energy production. We must reject the assumption that these systems need to be so resource intensive.\u00a0</p><p>Success is about speed and scale, and both are currently not on our side. But lessons learned from the pandemic are encouraging. When faced with great challenges, we are able and ready to act. Governments do act, although often too little too late and when all other options are exhausted. And private actors need and want to be part of the solution. As a society, we have proven ourselves ready and able to accept systemic behavioural changes - working from home has become widely accepted.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The circular bioeconomy has a major potential to provide answers to the challenges we are facing. It is an essential ingredient for living well and thriving within planetary boundaries, </emphasis>but only if it respects sustainability criteria and avoids the temptations of using shortcuts and prioritising short-term economic gains.\u00a0</p><p>Ultimately, as humans, changing our relationship with Nature that we are ourselves a part of, is not only an environmental, but also an economic, equity and security imperative to strengthen collective resilience. This relationship is not stable, nor balanced, and it will need to be resolved either with early action, collective wisdom and cooperation, or in a hard and painful way. More than an economic or a technological choice, this is a moral choice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future will be green, or there will be no future.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentopinioncircularbioeconomyforthefuturewewant</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69N7-YDJ1-JCMC-W1CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

It is of critical importance as climate change-induced disasters are increasing.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Staci McLennan, Director of Policy, Europe at International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).</emphasis></p><p>According to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undrr.org/gar/gar2022-our-world-risk-gar\">United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR),</url> by 2030, with current climate projections, the world will face some 560 disasters each year. A startling projection made all the more worrisome by the extreme disasters already occurring today. This past summer, stories of devastating disasters dominated the news-from fires scorching parts of southern Europe and even our national parks, to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifaw.org/international/news/earthquake-morocco-floods-libya-2023\">Storm Daniel</url> that hit the city of Derna on the northern coast of Libya, causing two dams to break and instantly flooding the city with a six-meter wall of water.</p><p>The resulting loss of life, damage to livelihoods and property, and wildlife left injured in degraded environments is heartbreaking. Human-caused climate change is one of the biggest threats our planet faces today and a driver of escalating frequency and scale of disasters. We must tackle the climate crisis in ways that deliver co-benefits for nature, climate, people and animals. As Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_3531\">June address to Parliament</url> \"we must green our cities and restore wetlands, rivers, forests, and marine ecosystems to make nature our best defence against disasters.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What can you do to prepare?</emphasis></p><p>The EU's <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_3531\">Disaster Resilience Goals</url> include preparedness and awareness raising of European citizens. What can you do as an individual? Become disaster ready. During this disaster awareness month, familiarize yourself with IFAW's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifaw.org/international/campaigns/disaster-awareness\">animal disaster preparedness resources</url>. In an emergency, your pets will depend on you more than ever to keep them safe and cared for. So, ensure their vaccinations are up to date, that they are chipped and pack a disaster kit with essentials such as a carrier, a leash and harness, and a pet passport. You can also help wildlife in your area by putting out bowls of water, planting native plants in your garden, and by contacting a local wildlife rescue center if you see a wild animal in distress. Being prepared saves lives-both human and animal.\u00a0</p><p>While citizens should prepare, governments are responsible for providing civil protection in the event of disasters. Cooperation and contingency planning of emergency services, veterinary services and animal rescue organisations can help make response more effective and efficient. By investing in emergency plans, trainings, and simulation exercises we can work as a disaster response community to maximise resources and help vulnerable people and animals.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">After the storm - time for recovery</emphasis></p><p>But our work doesn't end when the storm, fire, or earthquake subsides. Following the critical response phase, the focus must turn to recovery and the provision of resources to help communities, including impacted animals. This summer, wildfires charred swathes of land in Greece, including large parts of Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli Forest National Park, home to numerous wildlife species. Overwhelmed by the huge influx of animals in need, a local wildlife rescue centre asked for support and expertise to rescue, rehabilitate, and release injured tortoises. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifaw.org/international/news/ifaw-rushes-aid-wildfires-greece\">IFAW deployed to Greece</url> alongside a tortoise expert to assess and release 148 tortoises to the wild. This work is an essential part of ecosystem recovery, a critical step following a disaster.</p><p>The relentless wildfires during this hot and dry summer season underline the need for increased preventative measures and better coordination between government agencies, rescue services, and local organisations to help protect wildlife.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protecting our EU biodiversity</emphasis></p><p>A proactive safeguard from disasters is to restore the natural environment. In 2022, wildfires led to estimated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/06/16/firefighting-planes-and-helicopters-council-agrees-position-to-guarantee-financing/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%2020%20member%20states,included%20in%20Natura%202000%20sites.\">economic losses above EUR 2 billion</url> and approximately 35% of the burnt areas that year included Natura 2000 sites. This destruction caused considerable biodiversity loss. Wild animal populations suffer from loss of breeding sites and local food sources, loss of viable habitat patches, spread of disease after disturbances and local extirpation because of mass mortality.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A call for political action</emphasis></p><p>Tackling the growing disaster crisis requires a comprehensive policy approach. It is time politicians listen to the voice of Europeans (as documented in Eurobarometers and citizen petitions) demanding action on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euforanimals.eu/en\">animal welfare</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2194\">biodiversity</url>, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/detail/2954\">climate change</url>. IFAW urges the EU to include animal welfare as part of a societal response to emergencies and disasters to ensure animal well-being will be addressed during prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery activities.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Commitments to protect and restore biodiversity must be upheld. Adoption of the Nature Restoration Law is Europe's best defense against future disasters. The EU must commit to nature-based solutions as vessels for climate mitigation and adaptation. With the 28th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) around the corner, the EU must lead on energy transition and put people and biodiversity at the heart of climate action.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working together to amplify our defence to disasters</emphasis></p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-disaster-response-fund-limit-climate-crises-mount-2023-09-12/\">climate crisis is straining the EU's disaster response fund</url>. With requests for emergency assistance up by 400% in the last two years, Commissioner Lenarcic has warned the EU's current budget for disaster response is too small. It is necessary to mobilise resources and expertise from a variety of sectors to address this challenge of increasing disasters. There is ample knowledge across civil protection, humanitarian, veterinary and animal rescue sectors to bring cohesion and vital resources to disaster preparedness and response. This requires leaning on one another to help communities with the ever-growing threat of disasters.</p><p>Now more than ever the lives of people and animals literally depend on climate action and healthy ecosystems to defend against disasters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentopinionwhydisasterpreparednessmustincludeanimalsnaturerestorationandclimateaction</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69DN-66T1-JCMC-W162-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

And the main topic of discussion in town is who will take the lead role in the next European Commission that will be appointed after the June vote.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An increasingly serious candidate is the incumbent, Ursula von der Leyen, who clearly positioned herself for a second mandate during her annual State of the Union speech in the European Parliament last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even though she didn't officially declare her candidacy, she made it clear that she was ready to take on the challenge.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_23_4426\">In her speech</url>, the Commission chief immediately put the June EU election in her line of sight, saying it will be a moment for European voters to decide what kind of future they want - including for the \"millions of first-time voters\" who are preoccupied with climate change.</p><p>\"We need to finish this work,\" she told MEPs in reference to the European Green Deal that was launched in December 2019 and formed the centrepiece of the Commission's programme over the current mandate, which expires on 31 October next year.</p><p>And indeed, von der Leyen appears best positioned to finish the job.</p><p>When she came to power in 2019, the former German defence minister pitched the Green Deal as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/new-eu-chief-flags-climate-policy-as-europes-new-growth-strategy/\">Europe's new growth strategy</url>, putting forward a root-and-branch review of EU legislation to align it with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Now, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/von-der-leyen-outlines-next-phase-of-european-green-deal-with-heavy-industry-focus/\">the \"next phase of the European Green Deal\"</url> must focus on industrial policy, she said, outlining the Commission's work programme for the remainder of her mandate, including the launch of a European Wind Power package\u00a0and a series of Clean Transition Dialogues\u00a0with industry.</p><p>\"From wind to steel, from batteries to electric vehicles, our ambition is crystal clear: The future of our cleantech industry has to be made in Europe,\" she declared.</p><p>To be sure, a second von der Leyen term has its supporters. Chief among them are politicians from the centrist Renew Europe party of Emmanuel Macron, the French president who put forward her name in the first place after the last European elections in 2019.</p><p>\"Mrs von der Leyen and her Commission have a good track record,\" said Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, France's transport minister. \"On the major issues - the European approach, the responses to the COVID and Ukrainian crises - we had a geopolitical Commission that has risen to the challenge,\" he told reporters while on a visit to Brussels on Monday (18 September).</p><p>Simone Tagliapietra, senior fellow at the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels, is also a fan.</p><p>\"In our view, the climate and energy legacy of this Commission is a profoundly positive one,\" he told participants at Bruegel's annual event earlier this month.</p><p>\"We are convinced that under Ursula von der Leyen's leadership, this Commission managed to basically set Europe on a trajectory towards climate neutrality\" by 2050, Tagliapietra added, saying this was done by setting clear targets for 2030 and 2050 and \"unleashing a wave of legislation\" in order to get there.</p><p>As for environmentalists, a von der Leyen 2 Commission may be the best choice on offer.</p><p>Opinion polls all point to an expected surge of the conservative right in next year's European elections meaning the greener, left side of Parliament may have to overcome their reluctance and side with von der Leyen as their safest bet.</p><p>Environmental activists haven't been entirely thrilled with von der Leyen's term in office. Groups like Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth Europe, and Climate Action Network Europe protested outside the European Parliament in Strasbourg ahead of the State of the Union speech, calling out the EU's \"sluggish action on climate and nature protection\".</p><p>According to campaigners, the EU's climate target for 2030 - a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 55% below 1990 levels - is 10 percentage points below what they consider to be the EU's fair contribution to tackling the climate crisis.</p><p>But unlike a new right-wing candidate, von der Leyen is intrinsically tied to the Green Deal and is certain not to backtrack on her own commitments. Her Commission's current favourite phrases are \"stay the course\" and \"implementation\" and it is hard to imagine these would be any different under a second term.</p><p>Needless to say, a second von der Leyen mandate would not be smooth sailing.</p><p>Any politician who wants to continue championing the Green Deal will need to answer big questions like working out a plan for Europe's green reindustrialisation and mobilising finance to make the transition happen.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bruegel.org/policy-brief/new-governance-framework-safeguard-european-green-deal\">According to Bruegel's calculations</url>, there is an annual green investment gap of (EURO)180 billion to fill after 2026 when the EU's pandemic recovery fund comes to an end.</p><p>To plug this gap, whoever leads the next Commission will have to convince Europe's two paymasters, France and Germany, as well as the EU's \"frugal\" member states like the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria.</p><p>If von der Leyen can't pull it together, who will?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Kira Taylor and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today's edition is inspired by NetworkNature+, a Horizon Europe project furthering 2030 policy goals by scaling up nature-based solutions.</emphasis></p><p>Nature-based solutions are realistic and economically viable options for climate action, providing mitigation potential and offering scalable solutions to foster biodiversity and human well-being. <url normalizedValue=\"https://eurac.tv/9WAw\">Learn more</url>.</p><h>Top stories</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/1694610306928_20230913_EP-155109B_STP_EVD_077_DOWNLOAD_LARGE-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/divided-eu-parliament-adopts-weakened-stance-on-electricity-market-reform/\">Divided EU Parliament adopts weakened stance on electricity market reform</url></h><p>EU lawmakers backed the European Parliament's position on reforming the bloc's electricity market in a plenary vote on Thursday (14 September), despite objections from more than 180 of them that weaken the parliament's position vis-\u00e0-vis member states.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/11213983-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/air-pollution/news/parliament-votes-for-stricter-air-quality-standards-in-europe-by-2035/\">Parliament votes to delay EU compliance with WHO air quality standards until 2035</url></h><p>The European Parliament on Wednesday (13 September) adopted its position on a revised law to improve air quality in the EU, calling for stricter limits on several pollutants, but delaying compliance with WHO guidelines until 2035.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/shutterstock_2293185401-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/electricity/news/going-it-alone-berlins-attempt-to-reform-power-market-falters/\">Going it alone: Berlin's own attempt to reform power market flounders</url></h><p>As the EU's power market reform heads for the finishing line, Germany's simultaneous process is floundering amid government reluctance to move on politically sensitive topics.</p><h>The Capitals - editor's pick</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PARIS.

Current investment in solutions for preserving nature stands at around 0.10% of global GDP, amounting to around $133 billion.\u00a0</p><p>\"Biodiversity loss is already costing the global economy 10% of its output each year. If we do not sufficiently finance nature-based solutions, we will impact the capacities of countries to make progress on other vital areas such as education, health and employment. If we do not save nature now, we will not be able to achieve sustainable development,\" said UNEP Executive Director, Inger Andersen.</p><p>She continues: \"The report is a wake-up call for governments, financial institutions and businesses to invest in nature -- including reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and restoration of our Ocean.\"</p><p>Among the examples of investment required, the study mentions the management, conservation and restoration of forests.

This set a target for 310 million tonnes of CO2 to be stored in Europe's nature by 2030, requiring a major turnaround for EU sinks.</p><p>\"No nature restoration will make it almost impossible to reach our climate goals,\" Timmermans reiterated.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/EPP-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eus-nature-restoration-law-in-the-balance-ahead-of-decisive-july-vote/\">EU's Nature Restoration Law hangs in the balance ahead of decisive July vote</url></h><p>Europe's law to restore nature is in the balance, following a vote in the European Parliament's environment committee on Tuesday (27 June) that opened up the possibility for it to be definitively rejected by lawmakers during a whole Parliament vote in July.</p><h>Debate turned 'tribal'</h><p>Lamenting the fact that discussions around nature and climate laws have \"turned tribal\", Timmermans expressed fears over the future direction of the political centre and the consequences this will have on European decision making.</p><p>\"[Climate denial and scepticism] was something on the fringes of politics. Now, if the centre right moves in that direction, then I think we are going to be in trouble,\" he said.</p><p>He added that you always need support from the centre to get laws through, saying he hoped the centre \"will hold\" in future elections.</p><p>\"To get things done, you need a majority, and that majority will always be in the middle. So I really hope that the centre right understands that, if they look for majorities to the right of them, those majorities will be destructive, not constructive,\" he warned.</p><p>The need for strong climate policy is not just for Europe's nature, but is also required to maintain the ambitious stance the EU is setting on the international stage.</p><p>For instance, the EU signed up to an international agreement to protect 30% of its land and seas by 2030 at a global biodiversity conference last year and is seeking to drive further ambition at the COP 28 climate summit in Dubai.</p><p>The EU \"cannot afford\" to step back on the issue of climate change, said the Vice President, who has just returned from a trip to China. He also highlighted the importance of \"teaming up\" with the US and China on global climate goals.</p><p>\"We can only do that if we speak with one voice,\" he added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Kira Taylor / Gerardo Fortuna]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodnewstimmermanseuclimategoalshingeonsuccessofnaturerestorationlaw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NJ-78C1-F03F-K30M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

(Boskalis) completed a historically good third quarter. Boskalis is thereby on course for a very strong full year result on the back of a good first half of the year. Fleet utilization was high and there was an increase in revenue and results at all divisions, particularly at the Offshore Energy division.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several new projects were acquired during the past quarter, including the large Baltica 2 offshore wind cable project and the A2 infra project between Het Vonderen and Kerensheide in Limburg, the Netherlands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The order book stood at EUR 6 billion as per the end of September, comparable to the mid-2023 level. Underlying, the order book of the two major divisions was also virtually stable.</p><p>Peter Berdowski, CEO:</p><p>\"With the high utilization of our fleet and good project results, we are looking back at the best third quarter in our history.</p><p>At Dredging, major projects in Asia, the Middle East and our home markets in Europe made a significant contribution.</p><p>We saw the biggest increase at Offshore Energy. Our strategy focusing on both the traditional energy market and the offshore wind market is paying off. Our vessels at Heavy Marine Transport, Subsea Services, Marine Services and Survey have been extremely busy.</p><p>At Salvage, we successfully completed a number of high-profile assignments in recent months, including the FSO Safer in the Red Sea and the Fremantle Highway in the Wadden Sea.</p><p>All in all, we are on track to conclude one of our best years ever.\"</p><p>Boskalis' sustainable growth strategy pursues a balance between activities that add societal value and create sustainable growth. The past quarter saw several impressive projects in progress, a selection of which are highlighted below.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protection through Climate Adaptation</emphasis></p><p>As a marine contractor, Boskalis has a rich history of providing protection against the forces of nature. In light of the consequences of climate change, our expertise in the field of climate-adaptive solutions is becoming increasingly important. Boskalis plays a crucial role worldwide in coastal and shoreline protection to protect people and nature. Where possible, this includes so-called Nature-Based Solutions, which make use of nature and natural processes to limit the consequences of climate change.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the Netherlands</emphasis>, for example, we were involved in several climate adaptation projects last quarter. The multi-year project to reinforce the Markermeer dikes north of Amsterdam is progressing well and the first northern section of the reinforced dike has been completed. Work was also executed at various locations around the country to strengthen a large number of other dikes, and the coastline of North Holland (Bergen) and three Wadden Islands (Texel, Vlieland and Ameland) was also maintained and strengthened.</p><p>Recently, the coastal protection project for part of the coastline of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Togo and Benin</emphasis>in West Africa was completed. The coastline was reinforced by means of newly constructed and reinforced breakwaters. In addition, a sand engine with a volume of 6.4 million cubic meters was constructed in Benin using a trailing suction hopper dredger. In the coming years, the forces of nature by means of wind and currents will spread this sand naturally along the coastline, making this an effective way to maintain a strong coastline. A follow-up to this successful project is currently under discussion.</p><p>In the Maldives, the expansion and climate adaptive measures for the island of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gulhifalhu</emphasis>are in full swing. The development of Gulhifalhu is part of the government's strategic plan to improve the port infrastructure, relieve the overcrowded capital Mal\u00e9 and make this part of the Maldives resilient to coastal erosion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advancing the Energy Transition</emphasis></p><p>Boskalis is advancing the energy transition by developing infrastructure for renewable energy.</p><p>At the beginning of the third quarter the crane vessel Bokalift 1 successfully installed the last of 62 jackets for the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Changfang &amp; Xidao</emphasis>offshore wind farm in Taiwan, where Boskalis was also involved in the construction of the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yunlin</emphasis>wind farm.</p><p>In the United States of America (US), Boskalis was active on the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Southfork</emphasis>offshore wind project, where the Bokalift 2 crane vessel installed all the monopile foundations and a substation in one quarter. The wind farm will supply 70,000 households with green power. Preparations for the next US wind farm, Revolution, are now underway.</p><p>In Scotland, Boskalis is currently working on the construction of part of the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moray West</emphasis>offshore wind farm. For Boskalis, this project involves conducting geophysical surveys, transporting the foundations (monopiles), preparing the seabed and installing the foundations.</p><p>Seasonally, the third quarter is traditionally busy for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Survey</emphasis>. The past quarter saw a lot of geophysical and geotechnical work in the North Sea and the Middle East.</p><p>In terms of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">decommissioning</emphasis>, it was a busy third quarter. Subsea Services took on a sizable contract earlier this year to decommission old subsea infrastructure in the North Sea resulting in a busy quarter with the deployment of Diving Support Vessels.</p><p>In the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Caribbean</emphasis>, the Bokalift 1 was involved in salvaging part of a platform from the seabed following an incident.</p><p>Salvage successfully completed the salvage of the decaying oil tanker<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FSO Safer</emphasis>off the coast of Yemen, by transferring all 1.1 million barrels of oil to a replacement oil tanker, averting the risk of a massive environmental disaster with serious humanitarian, environmental and economic consequences.</p><p>Salvage was also involved in the salvage of the burning car carrier<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fremantle Highway</emphasis>in the Wadden Sea during the third quarter. Boskalis, together with its partner, managed to stabilize the vessel and extinguish the fire, thereby averting a major shipping disaster.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Distinguishing through Innovation</emphasis></p><p>Along with our craftsmanship and years of expertise, Boskalis' strength lies in its innovative ability to develop equipment and groundbreaking work methods.</p><p>Early this year, the transformation of the crane vessel<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bokalift 2</emphasis>was completed. Under our own management and direction, this vessel was converted in four years from a drilling vessel to a modern groundbreaking crane vessel that is extremely suitable for the offshore wind market. As the final part of this transformation, an advanced Motion Compensated Pile Gripper Frame was installed in Schiedam, the Netherlands early this year.</p><p>Boskalis recently ordered a new state-of-the-art<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">jumbo trailing suction hopper dredger</emphasis>from Royal IHC in the Netherlands. This decision was preceded by an extensive design phase with very active input from Boskalis. It will be the first trailing suction hopper dredger in the industry to be equipped with Azipods which allows for an energy efficient vessel design. The vessel will also be prepared for the use of (green) methanol as an alternative fuel. With its many technological innovations, the vessel will be highly efficient and will make a significant contribution to reducing CO2emissions from our fleet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook</emphasis></p><p>Given the results for the first nine months of the year and the projects in progress, 2023 is expected to be one of the best years in Boskalis' history financially with an EBITDA of more than EUR 800 million. This will significantly exceed last year's result. Based on market developments and the well-filled order book, Boskalis is also positive about the period thereafter.</p><p>Boskalis' financial position remains strong. Boskalis has a positive net cash position and is, on balance, debt-free. Guided by the opportunities currently presented by the market, Boskalis will continue to invest in sustainable growth in line with its strategic agenda.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION</emphasis></p><p>Martijn L.D.

The full updated announcement is set out below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p>The above change has been reflected in the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24) which is available on the Shell website and has been marked with a footnote in the ETS24 itself. An updated version of the ETS24 has also been filed with the NSM.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>---</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023, Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with 2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A].Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in the energy transition.</p><p>London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis></p><p>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending.</p><p>These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>ENDS</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell's 2024 AGM. Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from\u00a0our operations and energy products while becoming an\u00a0increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans\u00a0cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and\u00a0Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we\u00a0believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helping reduce emissions for our customers</emphasis></p><p>We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to\u00a0sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel.</p><p>To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].</p><p>Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\u00edzenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in\u00a02021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from\u00a0fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the\u00a0energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future.</p><p>Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for\u00a0many years with oil, gas and LNG.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to\u00a0build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technologies of the future</emphasis></p><p>We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis></p><p>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis></p><p>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis></p><p>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis></p><p>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis></p><p>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis></p><p>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis></p><p>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition.

This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production. The Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico also started production, with 80% less CO2emissions expected over its lifetime compared with the original design.The Hollandse Kust Noord wind park off the coast of the Netherlands became operational.Shell's management team hosted its first Capital Markets Day in New York and set out Shell's strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.Achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016.Reduced our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 31% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016, more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030 on a net basis.Won majority shareholder support (80% of votes) for our energy transition progress at our Annual General Meeting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis></p><p>Completed the acquisition of renewable power company Sprng Energy, and took a final investment decision on Holland Hydrogen 1 and LNG expansion projects in Qatar.Introduced three new metrics in the annual bonus scorecard to reflect Shell's role in the energy transition.

LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output.

The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis></p><p>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis></p><p>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency.

It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis></p><p>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis></p><p>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis></p><p>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to\u00a02030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments.</p><p>We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly.</p><p>In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for\u00a0cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives.</p><p>As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a\u00a0result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products.</p><p>Our strategy is to:</p><p>Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of the future.

As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced.</p><p>We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the\u00a0USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell\u00a0Pakistan.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Oil for lubricants and chemicals</p><p>Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry,\u00a0construction and road.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are upgrading our retail network, with\u00a0expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to\u00a0supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils\u00a0used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support\u00a0the development of electric vehicle car batteries.</p><p>Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we\u00a0meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both\u00a0conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in\u00a0low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Building for tomorrow (2025+)</emphasis></p><p>To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low-carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.</p><p>Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis></p><p>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry.

The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.</p><p>[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis></p><p>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis></p><p>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis></p><p>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year [A].</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>[A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis></p><p>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis></p><p>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis></p><p>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today. For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they emit.Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions.</p><p>The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors.</p><p>At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat.</p><p>Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and\u00a0reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The\u00a0storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate policy engagement</emphasis></p><p>Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial\u00a0part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and\u00a0regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions.</p><p>Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our\u00a0advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world.</p><p>In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and advocacy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy Themes:</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Achieving net-zero emissions</emphasis></p><p>Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B Supplying the secure energy the world needs</emphasis></p><p>Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C Driving changes in demand</emphasis></p><p>Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D Growing low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p><p>Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy in action</emphasis></p><p>Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators.</p><p>In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross-border CCS\u00a0hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region.</p><p>In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy transition in action</emphasis></p><p>Selection of portfolio developments [A]</p><p>These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets, ambitions and\u00a0performance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050</emphasis></p><p>It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell.

Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell.

These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl.

Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis></p><p>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis></p><p>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the\u00a0use of our oil products</emphasis></p><p>We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT</p><p>[B] Liquefied natural gas</p><p>[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.

At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Critical factors on the path to net zero</emphasis></p><p>The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this.</p><p>We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p>To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net\u00a0zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and\u00a0heat and power storage solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multi-energy business</emphasis></p><p>There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of\u00a0the\u00a0future energy system. As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities.

This\u00a0requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce.</p><p>We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a\u00a0focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation.</p><p>In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and\u00a0storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.</p><p>We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights\u00a0and labour rights.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Equal opportunities</emphasis></p><p>Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under-represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most\u00a0diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of\u00a0our business.

The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery.</p><p>In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the\u00a02023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for\u00a0senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both\u00a0vesting in 2026.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Carbon management framework (CMF)</p><p>We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes.</p><p>To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and\u00a0generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per\u00a0unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each\u00a0other.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our\u00a0journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:</p><p>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025\u00a0[A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and\u00a0achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030\u00a0and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material.</p><p>In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our\u00a0annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to\u00a0build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024.

Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report.</p><p>We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e( CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>LEI Number: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70</p><p>Published: March 20, 2024</p><p>Classification: Additional Regulated Information required to be disclosed under the laws of the United Kingdom</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000930352en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BKR-SWM1-F15W-N2JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"25725\"/><timeReceived>04:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 20, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By the end of 2023, Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with 2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in the energy transition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>\"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer.</p><p>\"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan.</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas.</p><p>We have made good progress against our climate targets:</p><p>By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter agreed at COP28.We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity - significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring. In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the third consecutive year we hit our target.</p><p>As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A]</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe.</p><p>In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%.</p><p>We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Driving towards a net-zero future</emphasis>We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending.</p><p>These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>ENDS</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and performance please read the full report, online here:\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at Shell's 2024 AGM. Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology. We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions). While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy, one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.

In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we\u00a0believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helping reduce emissions for our customers</emphasis>We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to\u00a0sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel.</p><p>To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].</p><p>Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\u00edzenCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from\u00a0fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the\u00a0energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future.</p><p>Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for\u00a0many years with oil, gas and LNG.</p><p>As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to\u00a0build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technologies of the future</emphasis>We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too.</p><p>I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to\u00a0produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value with less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to\u00a0our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transparency and shareholder support</emphasis>In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I\u00a0appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to\u00a0our\u00a0next engagement in April 2024.</p><p>The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update.</p><p>This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at\u00a0our\u00a0Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board\u00a0and Executive Committee.</p><p>We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sir Andrew Mackenzie</emphasis>Chair</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chief Executive Officer's introduction</emphasis></p><p>This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we\u00a0published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our\u00a0progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.</p><p>Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for\u00a0energy will only grow.</p><p>At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero.</p><p>I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in\u00a0the direction of our strategy.</p><p>Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the\u00a0world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to\u00a0use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to\u00a0provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Progress towards our targets</emphasis>Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with\u00a0renewable energy.</p><p>We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of\u00a0methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of\u00a0the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More value, less emissions</emphasis>At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our\u00a0Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In\u00a0this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the\u00a0same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In\u00a0Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as\u00a0biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future.</p><p>Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on\u00a0delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing emissions from production</emphasis>We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen.</p><p>We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It\u00a0continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as\u00a0wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by\u00a0replacing coal.</p><p>In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to\u00a0lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint\u00a0venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by\u00a0more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities.</p><p>The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around\u00a080% less carbon dioxide emissions over its</p><p>operating\u00a0life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting our customers as they decarbonise</emphasis>We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have\u00a0competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and\u00a0identify clear regulatory support from governments. The\u00a0transport sector is a good example.</p><p>We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to\u00a0help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in\u00a0biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to\u00a0focus on four regional energy\u00a0and chemicals parks, we are\u00a0creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future.</p><p>As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a\u00a0new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most\u00a0progressive in the world.</p><p>Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is\u00a0selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to\u00a0retail customers. As a result, we\u00a0expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our\u00a0net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Towards net zero</emphasis>In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices\u00a0for our customers.</p><p>Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in\u00a0reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into\u00a0a\u00a0net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are\u00a0the investment case and the partner of choice through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wael Sawan</emphasis>Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDCCustomer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions.</emphasis></p><p>1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies.</p><p>2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\".</p><p>4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%.</p><p>5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly.</p><p>6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year.</p><p>7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]</p><p>Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.</p><p>8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge.</p><p>9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously.</p><p>10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our journey towards net zero</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023</emphasis></p><p>Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy, started production. The Vito platform in the US Gulf of Mexico also started production, with 80% less CO2emissions expected over its lifetime compared with the original design.The Hollandse Kust Noord wind park off the coast of the Netherlands became operational.Shell's management team hosted its first Capital Markets Day in New York and set out Shell's strategy to deliver more value with less emissions.Achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016.Reduced our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 31% by the end of 2023 compared with 2016, more than halfway towards our target to reduce them by 50% by 2030 on a net basis.Won majority shareholder support (80% of votes) for our energy transition progress at our Annual General Meeting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022</emphasis></p><p>Completed the acquisition of renewable power company Sprng Energy, and took a final investment decision on Holland Hydrogen 1 and LNG expansion projects in Qatar.Introduced three new metrics in the annual bonus scorecard to reflect Shell's role in the energy transition.

This includes the well-to-tank emissions associated with the manufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. Emissions associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are excluded.2021 target 2-3%, 2022 target 3-4%, 2023 target 6-8%, all achieved. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity.Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by 2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category 11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The energy system: our beliefs</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in\u00a0many developing countries where security of\u00a0supply and stable prices are critical to their\u00a0development.</emphasis></p><p>The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250\u00a0mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil,\u00a080 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas.</p><p>As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be\u00a0linear, as different countries take different approaches and\u00a0move at different paces.</p><p>Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to\u00a0create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at\u00a0scale. This will\u00a0require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the\u00a0new\u00a0energy system.</p><p>Developing our beliefs</p><p>We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u00a0and several other external bodies.</p><p>We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs.</p><p>Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of\u00a0Technology. We will continue to challenge our own\u00a0beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increasing demand</emphasis>Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and\u00a0industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more\u00a0than a quarter of the world's population\u00a0still lack basic\u00a0energy provisions.</p><p>Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the\u00a0Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the\u00a0second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in\u00a0electric vehicles.</p><p>Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances 2023).</p><p>Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the\u00a0last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per\u00a0annum (mtpa) in\u00a01983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023.</p><p>Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a\u00a0figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and\u00a0can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe.</p><p>The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping.</p><p>Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by\u00a0strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this10-year period, due to\u00a0rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output.

Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.</p><p>[A] Includes emissions from industrial processes, 18% of total.[B] Includes rail, 3.5% of total.[C] Emissions for operation of buildings - not construction (which is in industry sectors).[D] 70% methane, from agriculture and fossil production and use; 23% nitrous oxide; 7% others.[E] land use, land-use change emissions and forestry (LULUCF).Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industry</emphasis></p><p>Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil,\u00a0gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand.</p><p>Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heavy industry</emphasis>Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of\u00a0steel\u00a0and cement, which use high-temperature processes that\u00a0can\u00a0be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of\u00a0coal,\u00a0gas\u00a0and electricity.</p><p>Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A].</p><p>Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in\u00a0energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. Innon-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement.</p><p>The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the\u00a0industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two\u00a0decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue.</p><p>We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations.</p><p>More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Light industry</emphasis>Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy\u00a0equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities.</p><p>The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of\u00a0light\u00a0industry have already switched to electrification. We\u00a0see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also\u00a0needed to decarbonise the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-energy use</emphasis>Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10%of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We\u00a0believe bio-feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this\u00a0sector.</p><p>Source: International Energy Agency.

Global CO2emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a\u00a0year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions.</p><p>Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio-alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.</p><p>[A] Noth-west European retail prices.[B] Beyond production costs, taxes significantly increase the price customers pay for biodiesel, diesel and gasoline.[C] Electric costs (0.2-0.6$kWh) adjusted for 2.4x higher efficiency of electric versus international combustion engine vehicles.

Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40\u00a0million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by\u00a02030. The availability of charging points will be\u00a0critical for\u00a0the growth in electric vehicles.</p><p>The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is\u00a0in China, the world's largest car market, followed by\u00a0Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport</emphasis>Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or\u00a0hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and\u00a0customer preferences.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation</emphasis>Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a\u00a0credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than\u00a00.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to\u00a0grow with support from governments.</p><p>Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it\u00a0costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shipping</emphasis>Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of\u00a0shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with\u00a0conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25%\u00a0of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We\u00a0believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the\u00a0long term, but we see challenges with both of them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Buildings</emphasis></p><p>Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be\u00a0key to continuing this trend.</p><p>Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to\u00a02026.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power</emphasis></p><p>Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023.</p><p>Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040.</p><p>We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their\u00a0scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of\u00a0national electricity grids.</p><p>We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon abatement</emphasis></p><p>We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and\u00a0standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could\u00a0emerge.</p><p>Carbon credits\u00a0may be used to compensate for emissions in\u00a0line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO2includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation.</p><p>The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to\u00a0limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a\u00a0year carbon removals, which will need to\u00a0be financed by\u00a0emitters purchasing carbon credits.</p><p>Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO2emissions. While there are\u00a0only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.</p><p>Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023.

Between now and 2030, we are\u00a0focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis></p><p>We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000\u00a0today.</p><p>We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis></p><p>We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen-based fuels at scale in the future.</p><p>Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own\u00a0production and sales of biofuels in the coming years.</p><p>We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These\u00a0fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road\u00a0transport. To\u00a0support our production of biofuels, we\u00a0are\u00a0investing in new feedstocks through investments and\u00a0partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to\u00a0expand sales beyond our production volumes.</p><p>Through our Ra\u00edzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and\u00a0sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on\u00a0the\u00a0environment and food supplies.</p><p>Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the\u00a0largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power</emphasis></p><p>We will continue to grow our integrated power business with\u00a0selective investments in renewable power generation. We\u00a0will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our\u00a0ventures programme and investments in research and\u00a0development.</p><p>We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our\u00a0strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to\u00a0decarbonise our own operations.</p><p>Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at\u00a0around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.</p><p>[A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation.Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Preparing for the future (2030+)</emphasis></p><p>This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon\u00a0capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030.</p><p>We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to\u00a0deliver affordable low-cost solutions to\u00a0our customers.</p><p>We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO2) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low-carbon gas can be\u00a0directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and removal</emphasis></p><p>We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations.</p><p>We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable\u00a0CCS projects.</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in\u00a0the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO2from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground.</p><p>In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning\u00a0global carbon market will be a critical enabler of\u00a0an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a\u00a0diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers\u00a0decarbonise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our transitions plans cover all our businesses</emphasis></p><p>Leading Integrated Gas</p><p>Advantaged Upstream</p><p>Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focused decarbonisation pathways</emphasis>We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Passenger road transport:</emphasis>Between now and 2030: Oil products, Biofuel solutions and electric charging</p><p>Between 2030 &amp; 2040: Electric charging, biofuel solutions and oil products</p><p>From 2040 onwards: Electric charging and oil products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commercial road transport:</emphasis>Between now and the mid 2030's: Oil products, Biofuel solutions, liquified natural gas and electric charging</p><p>From the mid 2030's onwards: Biofuel solutions, electric charging, oil products and green hydrogen</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aviation:</emphasis>Between now and the end of the 2030's: Oil products, biofuels solutions and synthetic fuels</p><p>From the end of the 2030's onwards: Biofuel solutions, synthetic fuels and oil products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marine:</emphasis>Between now and the mid 2030's: Oil products, liquified natural gas and biofuel solutions</p><p>From the mid 2030's onwards: Oil products, biofuel solutions, liquified natural gas and hydrogen and derivatives</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Industry and Services:</emphasis>Pathway 1: Between now and the mid 2030's: Liquified natural gas with carbon capture and storage and renewable natural gas.

Our strategy is based\u00a0on\u00a0the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the\u00a0energy transition.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity</emphasis>As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by\u00a02030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensityof our operations.</p><p>Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%,non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to\u00a0reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it\u00a0starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in\u00a02024 and will continue into 2025.</p><p>In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects.</p><p>By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this\u00a0decade.</p><p>Shell is working with shipping companies to\u00a0help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim\u00a0of\u00a0switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen-based fuel, in\u00a0the longer term.</p><p>Artificial intelligence for LNG</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by\u00a0around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing methane emissions</emphasis></p><p>We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment.</p><p>Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a\u00a0founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non-operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or\u00a0reporting beyond our operations.</p><p>We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future.</p><p>We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor\u00a0the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at\u00a0our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800\u00a0tonnes since\u00a02017.</p><p>[A] Aggregated average performance of Oil and Gas Climate initiative companies.[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in\u00a0our Upstream business</emphasis></p><p>In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects.</p><p>Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf\u00a0of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by around 80%\u00a0over its operating life, compared with its original design. In\u00a0addition to\u00a0the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of\u00a0creating more value with less emissions.</p><p>Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta.</p><p>We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the\u00a0emissions needed to develop the project.</p><p>Reducing routine flaring</p><p>We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target\u00a0is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us\u00a0to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO2e in 2022.</p><p>Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field\u00a0(Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas\u00a0recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be\u00a0powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity.</p><p>Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in\u00a0the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions</emphasis></p><p>We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by\u00a0transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany.</p><p>In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol,jet fuel and diesel by 2025.</p><p>When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane\u00a0liquefaction plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biofuels</emphasis>We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our\u00a0customers decarbonise without having to change their cars,\u00a0trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of\u00a0the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of\u00a0the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\u00edzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others.</p><p>Ra\u00edzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in\u00a02022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to\u00a0build in Brazil.</p><p>In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns\u00a0and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant\u00a0in the Netherlands.</p><p>The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8\u00a0million tonnes of carbon emissions a year.</p><p>Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than\u00a0half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of\u00a0global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions.</p><p>To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in\u00a0Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels.</p><p>Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia Ferrari</p><p>Shell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to\u00a0meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electric vehicle charging</emphasis>Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our\u00a0public charging network, currently operates in around 33\u00a0countries.</p><p>We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in\u00a0the\u00a0world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000\u00a0kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year.</p><p>The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has\u00a0a\u00a0utilisation rate of two-and-a-half-times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business.</p><p>In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in\u00a0the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000\u00a0charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400\u00a0additional charge points in development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated power positions</emphasis>Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA.</p><p>At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to-hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia.</p><p>In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power.</p><p>We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also\u00a0developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and\u00a0Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands.</p><p>In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust\u00a0West.</p><p>We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in\u00a0select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in\u00a0late 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydrogen</emphasis>We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it\u00a0becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for\u00a0the future.</p><p>To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We\u00a0see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport.</p><p>At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in\u00a0the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of\u00a0our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and\u00a0industry.</p><p>In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up\u00a0to\u00a025 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by\u00a0the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity.</p><p>As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The\u00a0consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon capture and storage (CCS)</emphasis>Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives.</p><p>CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals\u00a0of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS\u00a0lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects.</p><p>By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of\u00a0increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000\u00a0tonnes a year.</p><p>Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO2a year. The CO2will be shipped from two of \u00d8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea.</p><p>In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9\u00a0million tonnes of CO2equivalent by the end of 2023. In\u00a0addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the\u00a0world.</p><p>Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin\u00a0at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO2a year. The\u00a0captured CO2will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast.\u00a0This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO2emissions\u00a0by around 2% for 15 years from 2026.</p><p>In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in\u00a0the UK's first-ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO2captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK.</p><p>Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2a year.</p><p>Direct air capture</p><p>Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the\u00a0decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in\u00a0Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrated energy hubs</emphasis></p><p>As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and\u00a0Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into\u00a0our existing facilities.</p><p>We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help\u00a0to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and\u00a0chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will\u00a0be\u00a0powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust\u00a0(noord) offshore wind farm.</p><p>Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and\u00a0stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest\u00a0customer, and Aramis, a joint venture.</p><p>As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holland Hydrogen 1</emphasis>Power: Hollandse Kusst (noord) wind farm - 759MW to Data centres and Shell Holland Hydrogen 1 - 200MW</p><p>C02:Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam to Aramis CCS- 5 mpta store and Porthos CCS- 2.5 mpta store</p><p>Hydrogen: From Shell holland Hydrogen 1 200MW to Shell</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon credits</emphasis>Carbon credits can make an important contribution to our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business. They\u00a0may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate.</p><p>We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon\u00a0benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a\u00a0high quality.</p><p>We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.</p><p>We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the\u00a0market.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by\u00a0Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units.</p><p>Tracking SAF with blockchain</p><p>We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and\u00a0molecules.</p><p>Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with\u00a0Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to\u00a0delivery into aviation fuelling networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology and innovation</emphasis>Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our\u00a0company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49%\u00a0of our total expenditure on research and development, up\u00a0from around 41% in 2022.</p><p>[A] Shell analysis of data published by peer companies (TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron) in annual reports with the note that definitions of R&amp;D vary between companies.</p><p>Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:</p><p>Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today. For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they emit.Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our CANSOLV\u00ae carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions.</p><p>The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors.</p><p>At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and\u00a0CO2emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers.</p><p>We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in\u00a0the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus\u00a0on\u00a0electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and\u00a0materials.</p><p>Powering industry through investments</p><p>Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions.</p><p>In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to\u00a0help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat.</p><p>Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and\u00a0reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The\u00a0storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate policy engagement</emphasis></p><p>Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial\u00a0part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and\u00a0regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions.</p><p>Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.</p><p>Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our\u00a0advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world.</p><p>In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Policy and advocacy</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy Themes:</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A Achieving net-zero emissions</emphasis>Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">B Supplying the secure energy the world needs</emphasis>Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C Driving changes in demand</emphasis>Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D Growing low-carbon solutions</emphasis>Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p><p>Read more about our policy positions on Shell.com/advocacy-and-political-activity</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Advocacy in action</emphasis></p><p>Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low-carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators.</p><p>In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects.</p><p>We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions.</p><p>In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions.</p><p>We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal.</p><p>In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross-border CCS\u00a0hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region.</p><p>In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy transition in action</emphasis></p><p>Selection of portfolio developments [A]</p><p>These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Targets, ambitions and\u00a0performance</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050</emphasis></p><p>It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell.

We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and reducing our\u00a0production through the natural decline of existing oil and\u00a0gas fields;improving the energy efficiency of our operations;transforming our remaining integrated refineries intolow-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning plants;using more renewable electricity to power our operations; anddeveloping carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities.</p><p>If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.</p><p>The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our\u00a0Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we\u00a0expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in\u00a0producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions</emphasis>Scope 1 and 2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A], [B]</p><p>The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Operational control boundary.Including nature-based solutions.</p><p>Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO2e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria\u00a0Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our\u00a0Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production.</p><p>Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions</emphasis>Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell-operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in\u00a0reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methane emissions intensity [A], [D]</emphasis></p><p>Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near zero methane emissions by 2030Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm3. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected) defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Routine flaring</emphasis>We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.</p><p>Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016.</p><p>Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of\u00a0five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reducing net carbon intensity</emphasis>We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of\u00a0the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050.</p><p>The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a\u00a02016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity.</p><p>Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.</p><p>Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a\u00a0strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our\u00a0integrated power business, including renewable power, in\u00a0places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie.</p><p>In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a\u00a015-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the\u00a0energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our\u00a0previous target of a 20% reduction.</p><p>Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a\u00a045% reduction in net carbon intensity.</p><p>The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The\u00a0chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030.</p><p>The change in our sales\u00a0of these products and services will also\u00a0reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the\u00a0adoption of public policies designed\u00a0to\u00a0encourage the energy transition.</p><p>In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in\u00a0grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working to reduce our net carbon intensity (NCI)</emphasis>NCI in gCO2e/MJ [A]</p><p>Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than those of oil products. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and increasing sales of renewable power. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen, which are low- and zero-carbon products. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and industries including cement and\u00a0steel.</p><p>We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the\u00a0use of our oil products</emphasis></p><p>We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world.</p><p>Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as\u00a0they move to electric mobility and lower-carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels.</p><p>[A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..</p><p>[A] Including blending GLT[B] Liquefied natural gas[C] Liquefied petroleum</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris alignment</emphasis></p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\".</p><p>Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\u00b0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\u00b0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report\u00a0(AR6).</p><p>We start with the complete set of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios [A] and\u00a0then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We\u00a0then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\u00b0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.</p><p>These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning warming to 1.5\u00b0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much the global temperature in a\u00a0scenario exceeds 1.5\u00b0C before returning.</p><p>We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\u00b0C goal of the Paris Agreement.

As a result, we are developing a\u00a0multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions.</p><p>By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for\u00a0aviation, that will be created through new technologies.</p><p>At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and\u00a0storage to further reduce emissions.</p><p>In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen.</p><p>While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities.

Over\u00a0the\u00a0next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a\u00a0community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will\u00a0use as the community sees\u00a0best.</p><p>In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the\u00a0country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Human rights, governments and industry</emphasis>Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set\u00a0out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.</p><p>Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate governance</emphasis></p><p>Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on\u00a0the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery.</p><p>In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.</p><p>Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the\u00a02023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for\u00a0senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both\u00a0vesting in 2026.</p><p>Carbon management framework (CMF)</p><p>We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes.</p><p>To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and\u00a0generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per\u00a0unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each\u00a0other.</p><p>For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our\u00a0journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:</p><p>Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net basis (2016 baseline); Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025\u00a0[A]; andMaintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and\u00a0achieving near-zero methane emissions by 2030.</p><p>It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030\u00a0and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p>Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.</p><p>We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil\u00a0products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material.</p><p>In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our\u00a0annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to\u00a0build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:</p><p>LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission by 2030, on a net basis; andSupporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-out. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were\u00a0517\u00a0million tonnes CO2e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.</p><p>For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023.</p><p>Energy transition and advisory votes</p><p>Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself.</p><p>As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate litigation</emphasis></p><p>Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world.</p><p>In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that\u00a0reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a\u00a0\"significant best efforts basis\".</p><p>We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change.</p><p>It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which\u00a0has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world.</p><p>Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate standards and benchmarks</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition.</emphasis></p><p>They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties\u00a0and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria.</p><p>Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations.</p><p>Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as\u00a0our\u00a0efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over\u00a0the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as\u00a0evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate\u00a0disclosures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG rating agencies [B]</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ISS</emphasis>The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in\u00a0the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.</p><p>Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are\u00a0rated on a 12-point scale from A+ (best) to D-(worst).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Initiatives</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Transition Pathway Initiative</emphasis>The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark.</p><p>TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a\u00a0company's targets and plans are aligned in the short-term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050).</p><p>In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the\u00a0highest score of four (strategic assessment) for\u00a0the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks\u00a0and\u00a0opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This\u00a0exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90)</p><p>In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\u00b0C benchmark. This is the\u00a0result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate Action 100+</emphasis>Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with\u00a0assets of around $68 trillion.</p><p>Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three\u202fhigh-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>The\u00a0disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May\u00a029, 2023.</p><p>We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that\u00a0our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome\u00a0in their assessment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures</emphasis>Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.</p><p>Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in\u00a0the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cautionary note</emphasis></p><p>The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our' are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking statements</emphasis>This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.

There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of\u00a0its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net carbon intensity</emphasis>Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or\u00a0its subsidiaries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shell's net-zero emissions target</emphasis>Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forward-looking non-GAAP measures</emphasis>This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report.</p><p>We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additional information</emphasis>As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO2e( CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.</p><p>LEI Number: 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70Published: March 14, 2024Classification: Additional Regulated Information required to be disclosed under the laws of the United Kingdom</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000929115en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJD-MKK1-JDPT-Y530-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"25557\"/><timeReceived>08:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 14, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

experts warned Wednesday, taking aim at a draft treaty tasked with rescuing Earth's animal and plant life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Setting aside at least 30 percent of both land and oceans as protected zones is the cornerstone target of the so-called global biodiversity framework to be finalised in May at UN negotiations in Kunming, China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But a report by more than 50 top experts said the draft plan still falls far short of what is needed.</p><p>\"We're in the middle of a biodiversity crisis, with a million species at risk of extinction,\" lead author Paul Leadley, a professor at Paris-Saclay University, told AFP.</p><p>\"There's good evidence that we will fail again to meet ambitious international biodiversity objectives if there's too much focus on protected areas at the expense of other urgent actions.\"</p><p>The plan, under negotiation by nearly 200 nations, sets a score of targets for 2030 -- and aims by 2050 to reverse biodiversity loss and be \"living in harmony with nature.\"</p><p>The world failed almost entirely to reach a similar set of 10-year objectives set a decade ago at UN talks in Aichi, Japan.</p><p>\"We keep trying to treat a critically ill patient with plasters -- that has to stop,\" said Leadley.</p><p>Echoing a similar warning issued by the UN's science advisory panel for climate change, Leadley and his colleagues said reversing the damage done to nature will require \"transformative change\" in society, starting with the way we produce and consume food.</p><p>- Multiple drivers -</p><p>Policymakers must also realise that all the drivers of extinction -- habitat loss and fragmentation, over-hunting for food and profit, pollution, the spread of invasive species -- must be tackled at once.</p><p>\"Biodiversity loss is caused by multiple direct drivers in nearly all cases, meaning that actions on only one or a few will be insufficient to halt continued loss,\" the report said.</p><p>Climate change is also rapidly emerging as a major threat to many animal and plant species on land and in the oceans, outpacing their ability to adapt.</p><p>Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels -- \"essential\" for protecting nature -- is not adequately reflected in the draft targets, the authors say.</p><p>Earth's surface has already warmed 1.1C, enough to unleash a crescendo of climate-enhanced storms, heatwaves, droughts and flooding.</p><p>And it works both ways, the report warns: \"Protecting and restoring biodiversity are key to achieving the climate mitigation and adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement.\"</p><p>- Nature-based solutions -</p><p>As with climate, there's no time to lose.</p><p>\"The sooner we act the better,\" said co-author Maria Cecilia Londono Murcia, a researcher at Humboldt Institute in Colombia.</p><p>\"Time lags between action and positive outcomes for biodiversity can take decades.\"</p><p>The report also takes the draft treaty to task for not spelling out how goals will be achieved and enforced.</p><p>Targets are all well and good, it suggests, \"but it is how these targets are implemented ... that will determine success.\"</p><p>Other targets set for 2030 include:</p><p>- reducing by 50 percent the rate at which alien species are spreading across the globe;</p><p>- reducing nutrients such as fertiliser leaching into the environment by at least half, and pesticides by at least two-thirds;</p><p>- eliminating the discharge of plastic waste;</p><p>- using nature-based solutions to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 billion tons of CO2 or its equivalent;</p><p>- reducing subsidies that harm biodiversity by at least $500 billion (440 billion euros) per year.</p><p>\"For every euro we spend globally to help biodiversity, we spend at least five on things that destroy it,\" said co-author Aleksandar Rankovic, a researcher at the Paris Institute of Political Studies.</p><p>Nations will gather in Geneva in March for technical meetings ahead of the crunch talks in April and May.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It is likely to show that we are falling short of what science requires, write Razan Al Mubarak and Mahmoud Mohieldin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Razan Al Mubarak is UN climate change high-level champion from the COP28 Presidency. Dr Mahmoud Mohieldin is UN climate change high-level champion from the COP27 Presidency.</emphasis></p><p>This year the world's first stocktake of efforts to curtail the climate crisis can provide a critical lever to engage all stakeholders in a just transition to a 1.5C, resilient and inclusive world.</p><p>But the GST will likely show that we are not on the right path. To course-correct, we need transformative collaboration between all the actors within our economies, including women, young people, Indigenous Peoples, businesses, investors, national and subnational governments, civil society and academia.</p><p>The global consensus to strive for net zero emissions by 2050 was reached over two years ago. 92% of global GDP and 89% of the world's population are now represented by the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zerotracker.net/\">net-zero targets</url> that the bulk of national governments have adopted. These commitments provide the scaffolding for systems transformation, but governments cannot do it alone.</p><p>We need non-State actors to mobilise the means to implement emissions reductions, address the adaptation gap and avert, minimise and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. By raising both the ambition and integrity of commitments, non-State actors can set down the guardrails for these actions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-State Leaders are assembled at the starting line</emphasis></p><p>The key actors of our economies, the civil society groups, companies, cities, states and regions, can together form a groundswell for change, and they are taking up the challenge in their thousands. For example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://racetozero.unfccc.int/system/race-to-zero/\">11,000 Race to Zero members</url> have committed to halving their emissions by 2030. To support this, the 2<url normalizedValue=\"https://racetozero.unfccc.int/system/breakthroughs/\">030 Breakthroughs</url> are driving the transformation of 28 sectors - from human settlements to transport, from water to land use.</p><p>Work to adapt to the now-unpreventable climate impacts by increasing resilience are key to ensuring that communities survive and thrive in the face of floods, droughts, cyclones and other impacts. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SeS-Adaptation-Agenda_Complete-Report-COP27_FINAL-1.pdf\">Sharm El-Sheikh Adaptation Agenda</url> launched at COP27 has outlined 30 measurable adaptation goals to mobilise partners in delivering enhanced resilience for four billion people across water, ocean, human settlements, and infrastructure impact systems by 2030. Commitments made through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://racetozero.unfccc.int/system/racetoresilience/\">Race to Resilience</url> so far aim to make three billion people in vulnerable urban, rural and coastal communities more resilient to climate risk by 2030.</p><p>As well as providing a view in the rear-view mirror of where we are against where we need to be, the GST is expected to act as a 'satnav', showing the fastest and most efficient routes to a 1.5C resilient world in 2050. In this way, the GST can mobilise the means for action - to raise public and private finance at scale, diffuse technology, and provide capacity building where needed most.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The stage is set for systems transformation </emphasis></p><p>To support the shift, the economics are also tilting inexorably towards systems change, spiralling outwards from energy to transport, food, etc. For example, renewable electricity has passed a series of tipping points in recent years - accelerated by geopolitical tensions and the ensuing gas shortage.</p><p>Global power sector emissions <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230414-climate-change-why-2023-is-a-clean-energy-milestone\">are expected to fall for the first time this year</url>, plus <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/news/clean-energy-investment-is-extending-its-lead-over-fossil-fuels-boosted-by-energy-security-strengths\">according to the IEA</url>, for every dollar invested in fossil fuels, around $1.7 is now going into clean energy. The stage is set for other sectors to transform much faster, driving down emissions while stabilising economies with new jobs.</p><p>Climate mitigation and biodiversity loss are two sides of the same coin. To successfully transform our systems, there is an urgent need to put nature at the heart of the transition. Nature-based solutions cannot replace or delay other decarbonisation efforts, however, up to 30% of the mitigation necessary to achieve our 2030 emissions reduction goals can be provided by nature.</p><p>We must put nature at the heart of climate action to accelerate investment in solutions that deliver mitigation and adaptation while contributing to reversing biodiversity loss and enhancing livelihood opportunities for local communities.</p><p>Half of the world's annual economic value generation depends on nature and its services. By encompassing nature and climate, the GST should help mobilise public and private finance where they are urgently needed - to respond to local resilience needs and contribute to recovering from loss and damage, and ultimately deliver a nature positive, net zero world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Empowering an inclusive transition</emphasis></p><p>As UN climate change high-level champions, we are working to foster a cooperative race between national governments and non-state actors to deliver economic transformation, a just transition, and achieve Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>The transparency brought by the GST can be a key lever to ratchet up the support from the international community to address the climate crisis, which is both a symptom and a cause of inequality. Those marginalised by inequality often bear the brunt of its consequences, from vulnerable communities enduring extreme weather events, such as the devastating droughts in the Horn of Africa, to Indigenous Peoples losing their ancestral lands to expanding industries. We can also expect the conclusion of the GST to highlight the intertwined challenges of social justice, economic empowerment, poverty eradication and environmental stewardship. With this knowledge, we can forge a powerful alliance capable of delivering accurate and practical solutions to the climate crisis.</p><p>Amidst the unprecedented challenge to transform our core systems lies an extraordinary opportunity-the power to reshape our world through an inclusive transition. By centring equity at the core of our response to the climate crisis, we can ignite a transformative movement that engages communities, empowers individuals, and paves the way for a sustainable future. When we uplift the voices of those most impacted, we unlock their incredible potential as change agents.</p><p>At the Bonn UN Climate Summit this week, we invite non-state actors, from corporates to civil society, to investors and cities, to support the GST process, to share their progress, help to identify key gaps and challenges and co-create actionable solutions. Through its far-reaching, holistic scope, the GST can help to turn the challenges of the transition from a paralysing ultimatum into a galvanising force for change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionclimateenvironmentopiniontheglobalstocktakechartingacoursetoclimateandnaturerecovery</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FR-GMM1-F03F-K1M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1125\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

pooling public and private money is underway which proponents claim provides a model for climate change mitigation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deploying a tank-like vehicle, helicopter, digger and a dozen-strong team building dams and other defences, the \"Ridge Graham\" project will return the site to its original waterlogged state, locking in carbon dioxide (CO2).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Currently, the 450 hectares (1,112 acres) of peatland by draining -- the size of 840 football fields -- and others like it in Britain and beyond are releasing greenhouse gases (GHGs), hindering efforts to go net-zero within decades.</p><p>The venture will use nascent carbon markets but is groundbreaking in England because it is the first time a company, rather than an NGO or charity, has also received public funds to restore privately-owned peatland.\u00a0</p><p>\"Peatland restoration is incredibly expensive and so... you need to find something that makes it economically viable,\" explained Betsy Glasgow-Vasey of Ridge Carbon Capture (RCC).</p><p>The Oxfordshire-based \"nature-based solutions\" developer is delivering the scheme -- with the help of an \u00a3813,000 ($975,000) grant from government agency Natural England -- and has a dozen other peatland projects in the pipeline.</p><p>The UK has \"woken up to what something like this can do,\" she added.</p><p>- 'Icing a cake' -</p><p>Trampling up the hillside in Cumbria, 28-year-old Glasgow-Vasey -- branded \"bog woman\" by friends due to her frequent peatland visits -- points out works completed since September.</p><p>As well as creating hundreds of small brick dams and, on higher ground, barriers made from rolls of coir coconut fibre to saturate the land, contractors have been covering exposed soil.</p><p>\"When peatland is exposed to the air, that's when it starts to release all the emissions from the decomposing vegetation,\" she explained.</p><p>Using transplanted heather, workers undertake the gruelling task wherever gaps exist on the vast terrain.</p><p>\"(It's) like when you're icing a cake... if there's not enough icing, you've got to pull icing from elsewhere\u00a0to cover the side of the cake -- and it's a big cake!\" she added.</p><p>The site and neighbouring land have been owned for centuries by the Graham family, which hopes it will prove a \"shining example\" of peatland restoration.</p><p>The landowners will have a stake in eventual \"carbon units\" created, \"turning something that could be a liability into an asset,\" Glasgow-Vasey noted.</p><p>- 'Crucial' -</p><p>Peatland moors and bogs are wetland ecosystems\u00a0formed from partly decomposed carbon-rich organic matter.\u00a0</p><p>They cover about\u00a0three percent of the earth's surface\u00a0and create its largest natural carbon store, holding more than any other type of vegetation.</p><p>But when sites deteriorate, typically after being drained by humans for purposes such as rearing livestock, they become sources of GHGs -- responsible for 10 percent of annual global emissions, according to the International Peatland Society.</p><p>The UK is home to seven million acres, around 10 percent of its surface, but four-fifths are in a poor state and emit 10 million tonnes of CO2 annually, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) says.</p><p>\"We need to restore our peatlands and we need to restore them now!\" Renee Kerkvliet-Hermans, the IUCN's UK Peatland Code coordinator, told AFP.</p><p>A certification standard for projects like Ridge Graham, the code is helping overcome their \"significant\" financial barriers by generating and certifying carbon units.\u00a0</p><p>The government, which wants to restore 35,000 hectares of English peatlands by 2025, backs the market while also providing grants.</p><p>Chris Kaighin, Natural England's Cumbria manager, called peatland restoration \"crucial\" to help meet climate targets.</p><p>Ridge Graham will hold \"vast quantities of CO2, providing vital habitats for wildlife, purifying drinking water, and storing water to reduce flood risk,\" he added.</p><p>- Vineyard analogy -</p><p>RCC and the grant covers the project's costs, which will eventually be recouped through the carbon market.</p><p>Credits will be created based on emissions abated and bought by businesses as part of their offsetting efforts.</p><p>Under the Peatland Code, one credit equates to one tonne of so-called carbon equivalent abated.</p><p>Glasgow-Vasey noted government support is still crucial because the market price of that credit \"currently just isn't high enough to make these projects make sense\".\u00a0</p><p>\"As the carbon price goes up -- which everyone says they think it will -- more landowners will come on board,\" she added.</p><p>She compares the enterprise to a vineyard, with the credits issued\u00a0in vintages corresponding to the project's early years and eventually\u00a0sold and retired -- akin to a bottle of wine bought and later drunk.\u00a0</p><p>It is uncertain exactly how long it will take the site to become a so-called carbon sink absorbing CO2, instead of emitting it.\u00a0</p><p>Auditors from the government and IUCN will visit to assess progress over the coming years.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Stuart Evans, an experienced specialist contractor working on the project, heralded the \"amazing\" growing recognition of peatlands' importance.\u00a0</p><p>Surveying the stunning views from atop the hillside, he added: \"They're more important than rainforests and they're so degraded.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

taken the unusual step of removing its protective seawalls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, they have let nature take its course.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Vieux-Salins d'Hyeres salt marshes sit just below sea level with a stretch of vital but shifting sand beach that separates them from the open sea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The coastline was receding with each winter storm,\" said wetlands expert Guirec Queffeulou, who helps manage the site located in the heart of the Cote d'Azur, the tourist-clogged French Mediterranean coast.</p><p>Conservationists acquired the site through legal wrangling in the late 1990s after the former owner, a salt company that built the protective dykes, wanted to sell it do developers.</p><p>But the dykes didn't really work -- even with two kilometres (just over one mile) of seawalls, the sea still crept inland more than 30 metres (around 100 feet).</p><p>The beach along its outer edge disappeared, and it seemed inevitable that the rest of the wetland would one day be submerged.</p><p>Then after years of studies, work began in 2019 to extract thousands of tons of fake boulders.</p><p>- Biodiversity benefits -</p><p>\"We had to do it gently to avoid damaging the natural barrier of Neptune grass a few metres from the coast,\" says Richard Barety of the coastal conservation organisation that has owned the site for the last 20 years.</p><p>Astonishingly, once the dykes were gone it only took a few months for a new landscape to emerge, including a wide beach with a small dune.</p><p>Small Mediterranean dunes and leaves of dead Neptune grass -- an underwater plant vital to the ecosystem -- soon formed banks that serve as natural barriers against erosion.</p><p>With its vast area separating the land from the sea, the salt marsh plays a crucial role in regulating the local climate and provides a habitat for a rich variety of animal species.</p><p>\"The interaction between the wetlands and the beach mean that biodiversity here has increased tenfold,\" says Barety.</p><p>Norbert Chardon, who heads up the regional chapter of the Bird Protection League, says more than 300 bird species have been documented in the area, drawn by fish and insects prey that thrive in the salty water.</p><p>- Nature-based solutions -</p><p>At the world's biggest biodiversity summit this week, so-called \"nature-based solutions\" are at the forefront of ideas for adapting to unprecedented environmental change.</p><p>Radhika Murti, who heads up global ecosystem management for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), says the scale of the climate crisis means we can't rely on technological solutions alone.</p><p>\"Engineering will never be enough because the disasters are going to get bigger and bigger,\" she says.</p><p>Instead, we need to learn from the ways that nature has of changing and self-regulating.</p><p>\"Look at solutions that already exist in nature,\" she adds, \"so we can work with it to meet our need rather than against it.\"</p><p>The concept has been around for over a decade and last year the IUCN adopted eight criteria that define solutions as \"nature-based\" -- though so far no project has received the label.</p><p>Its proponents emphasise that such solutions are often less expensive and more flexible than using infrastructure or technology.</p><p>In Hyeres, residents hope the newly-formed beach will keep the Vieux-Salins from being submerged over the long term.</p><p>The old Aleppo pines have died and in their place Tamarisk trees, more adapted to salt water, are taking their places, suggesting that the changes are taking root.</p><p>The sea could also eventually seep into the basins, altering the site's unique water mixture -- a possibility long feared but today seen as potentially positive for biodiversity.</p><p>Chardon says that whatever happens to the Vieux-Salins could serve as a teaching tool to illustrate the effects of climate change \"gently, without frightening people\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Scientists say leaders face a crucial challenge: agreeing on a common way forward to safeguard biodiversity by 2030 in order to preserve plant and animal life and help combat climate imbalance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildlife populations have fallen by 69 percent globally in the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said in an October 2022 report. At the same time, land degradation \u2013 including deforestation, soil erosion and loss of natural areas \u2013 now affects up to 40 percent of the Earth's land and half of humanity, according to the UN. These alarming figures are the backdrop for the COP15 conference on biodiversity that began on December 7 in Montreal with an ambitious objective: to agree a new global framework for safeguarding the natural world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The stakes are crucially high: we are currently living through a biodiversity crisis,\" says Philippe Grandcolas, entomologist and research director at France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). \"Biodiversity is essential to human survival. It ensures that we can feed ourselves, have access to drinking water, and it plays a major role in our health. But, above all, biodiversity plays an indispensable role in the stability of the planet.\"</p><p>At present, 70 percent of ecosystems around the world are in a state of degradation, largely due to human activity \u2013 a rate of decline described as \"unprecedented and dangerous\" by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).</p><p>In addition, more than 1 million species are threatened with extinction. Vertebrates, which include mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians and make up five percent of all animal species, are especially under threat. \"Our previous report found that there had been a 68 percent fall among the total [vertebrate] population [over 50 years],\" says Pierre Cannet, director of advocacy and campaigns at WWFFrance. In 2022 that figure has risen to 69 percent. \"Losing one percent in two years is massive. For species that already have small populations, it could mean extinction.\"</p><p>Climate imbalance: A growing threat </p><p>According to the IPBES, the most significant driving factor of the \"biodiversity crisis\" is change in how land is used and fragmentation of natural space, most often due to agriculture. This is followed by overfishing, hunting and poaching. There is a tie for third place between climate imbalance, pollution and invasive species.</p><p>\"In the majority of cases there are multiple factors at play,\" says Grandcolas. \"But climate imbalance is becoming the most significant threat. The more it escalates, the more it disturbs ecosystems and has an impact on flora and fauna.\"</p><p>There are plenty of examples of this impact. In the past 30 years elephant populations in African forests have fallen by 86 percent. The main causes are poaching and black market trade, causing the death of 20,000 to 30,000 elephants per year, according to the WWF. But repeated cycles of drought and flood are also having an impact on access to fresh water \u2013 a vital resource for the species as each animal consumes around 150 to 200 litres per day. Without it their survival is at risk.</p><p>Similarly, leatherback sea turtles in Suriname have seen their populations fall by 95 percent in 20 years. This is due in part to destruction of their habitat caused by human intervention and illegal fishing. But climate instability is also disrupting their reproduction rates as sea level rise has destroyed and disrupted turtle nesting beaches.</p><p>Mass deaths </p><p>\"Currently there are a few species that are classed having climate change as the reason for their extinction,\" says Camille Parmesan, research director at CNRS and author of the first report of its kind on the links between climate change and biodiversity, produced by IPBES and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021. Yet this is the reason for the demise of the Bramble Cay melomys: \"a species of little rodent that lived on the small islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Scientists proved that their disappearance was due to their habitat being submerged [by the sea],\" Parmesan says.</p><p>\"We have also noted the disappearance of 92 amphibian species, killed by the growth of a type of fungus. We have proof that it developed due to climate instability which modified ecosystems and created the right conditions for it to thrive.\"</p><p>The number of species that are officially classed as having died out due to climate instability may be low, but increasing extreme weather events are causing mass deaths among mammals, birds, fish and trees. \"In Australia, we counted 45,000 flying fox deaths [a type of bat] in a single day during a heatwave\", Parmesan says. In France, record summer heat in 2022 caused temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea to rise to levels that killed thousands of fish and shellfish.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Biodiversity: Ocean 'dead zones' are proliferating due to global warming</p><p>Yet, disappearing species is not the only consequence of climate change. \"We can also add behaviour changes, notably migrations induced by climate modifications,\" Parmesan adds. \"Certain species try to move to [new] habitats that are more favourable but this can cause even more disruption in ecosystems.\"</p><p>Biodiverse carbon storage </p><p>Shrinking biodiversity also has multiple consequences on human life. In some parts of the world it can disrupt economies reliant on fishing or hunting and negatively impact the tourism industry.</p><p>\"It's a vicious circle. Biodiversity is a victim of global warming, but it is also one of the major tools to fight against it\", says S\u00e9bastien Barot, researcher at French public research institution Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD).</p><p>From plant life to animal species, individual elements of the natural world all contribute to regulating and supporting the environment as a whole. Bardot says, \"water and earth play a role in filtering pollution, and bumblebees are essential for plant reproduction\".</p><p>But when one element is compromised the rest can suffer too. \"The survival of the planet depends on a fine balance,\" says Grandcolas. \"Imagine a group of frogs suddenly die in a habitat. As insignificant as that may seem, it will have an impact: by disappearing they modify the conditions of the environment. This could allow other species to develop, damage plant life and lead to progressive destruction of the ecosystem, which will then no longer be able to play its role as a climate regulator.\"</p><p>Nowhere is this more evident that with carbon storage. Scientists estimate that the earth and sea currently absorb almost 50 percent of C02 created by human activity. \"Forests, wetlands, mangrove swamps and even deep water are real C02 sinks. When they disappear, emissions are released into the atmosphere,\" Barot says.</p><p>Consequently, \"when we see a forest burn, we are watching a carbon sink disappear\", says Grandcolas. In this way, \"[the presence of] plant life has an obvious impact on the climate.\"</p><p>Two crises, one solution? </p><p>Experts agree on the need to tackle both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis at the same time. \"We tend to treat them as separate entities, but they go hand in hand,\" says Grandcolas. \"They should be seen as a joint struggle with equal importance. For this to happen, we need to give nature the space it deserves.\"</p><p>Scientists and the WWF have called for more nature-based solutions for both issues. One of the most prominent is increasing protected habitats, which currently make up 17 percent of land and eight percent of ocean globally. \"We need to increase that to 30-50 percent of the planet,\" says Grandcolas. A significant step towards this goal, he adds, would be better global policies for fighting deforestation as preserving forests has the potential to both protect biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"There are also many things to consider in terms of agriculture,\" says Barot. \"We need agriculture systems that are more durable such as developing agroecology and agroforestry. We can improve how cultivated land is managed and limit use of fertilizer \u2026 which would help both biodiversity and the climate.\"</p><p>\"Protection alone is no longer enough; 70 percent of land is now in a degraded state,\" Parmesan adds. \"It is essential to put stronger policies in place for restoring ecosystems. That would enable us to recreate habitats for animals and plants, and the climate benefits would follow.\" For this to be successful a holistic approach is needed. \"There's no point planting trees purely to compensate for carbon emissions,\" Parmesan says. \"It needs to be done with respect for balance in the ecosystem. Big plantations filled with monocultures are not good for biodiversity or for the climate because they are more vulnerable to climate risks.\"</p><p>The three scientists estimate that nature-based solutions could provide around a third of necessary climate mitigation measures even if other steps, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, must come from changes in human behaviour.</p><p>Many such solutions are up for discussion at the COP15 biodiversity conference. Even so, other issues \u2013 namely money \u2013 may dominate. Supported by 22 other countries, Brazil has requested that rich nations provide \"at least $100 billion per year until 2030\" to developing countries in order to finance nature protection initiatives. The request is yet to receive a response.</p><p>This article was adapted from the original in French.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-100231990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:672K-9T61-JDJN-60HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

High temperatures during summer 2022 in particular were a striking example of extreme events that, according to climate projections, will become more frequent no matter which emissions pathway we follow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the sixth edition of the European State of the Climate (ESOTC) report, released on 20 April by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), summer 2022 was the warmest ever recorded in Europe since at least 1950 by a large margin of 1.4\u00b0C above the 1991 - 2020 average and 0.4\u00b0C over the previous warmest summer, in 2021.\u00a0</p><p>The ESOTC, which provides key data and analyses about the climate conditions during the previous year, also confirms a clear warming trend for Europe. The year 2022 was the second warmest since the beginning of the 20th century, only behind 2020. The five warmest years have all been recorded since 2014.\u00a0</p><p>In addition to providing a detailed review of key climate information about Europe and the world, every year the ESOTC, part of C3S' Climate Intelligence activities, focuses on several thematic highlights. For 2022, extreme heat and significant droughts in Europe were in the spotlight.\u00a0</p><p>While everyone involved in the report experienced first-hand the extreme heat in Europe in 2022, the C3S team explained that it was striking to see the amplitude of the anomalies reflected in the data, with records broken by such large margins that it justified a dedicated section in the report.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Record heat stress in southern Europe</emphasis></p><p>While the year as a whole was the second warmest on record for Europe, some regions went through gruelling weeks with hazardous conditions for human health. Southern Europe in particular broke the record for the number of days with 'very strong heat stress', according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/indicators/thermal-comfort-indices-universal-thermal-climate-index-1979-2019#:~:text=The%20universal%20thermal%20climate%20index%20(UTCI)%20describes%20the%20synergistic%20heat,response%20to%20actual%20environmental%20temperature.\">Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI)</url>, which represents the effect of environmental conditions on the human body.\u00a0</p><p>Based on the UTCI, which considers temperature, other environmental factors, and how the human body responds*, the vast majority of western Europe experienced at least some days with a UTCI between 38 and 46 \u00b0C, considered 'very strong heat stress', at some point in June, July or August. Parts of Italy, France and above all the southern Iberian Peninsula went through more than 50 days of these scorching UTCI levels.\u00a0</p><p>Practically all of western Europe, except for the northernmost areas, experienced more than 20 days of 'strong heat stress' (a UTCI between 32 and 38\u00b0C) during the same period. Across Europe, the analysis reveals a growing trend in the number of days with 'strong' or 'very strong heat stress', alongside a decrease in the number of days with no heat stress. In northern Europe, from the 1950s to 1990s, a third of the summer season saw 'no heat stress' on average. In 2022, the number of days fell to just 24%, the second lowest percentage on record.\u00a0</p><p>This only accounts for the summer, but 2022 also saw several episodes of unusually warm temperatures in March, May, October and December, also covered in the ESOTC report.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Life- and health-threatening conditions\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Being exposed to such heat stress levels can have immediate impacts on human health. Heat stroke is the most prominent of a wide range of physiological impacts of excessive heat, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health\">World Health Organization.</url> Heat-related deaths are sporadically reported across Europe but estimates attribute between <url normalizedValue=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/2022-disasters-numbers\">16,305</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/over-20000-died-in-western-europes-summer-heatwaves-figures-show/\">20,000</url> deaths to the European heatwaves in 2022.</p><p>With roughly <url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS?locations=EU\">three quarters of the European population</url> -and half of global citizens- living in urban areas, monitoring temperatures and heat stress has become a public health priority, as the urban heat island effect tends to aggravate the situation. In its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/chapter/chapter-6/\">sixth assessment report</url> the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that cities could be \"subject to twice the levels of heat stress compared to their rural surroundings under all RCP scenarios by 2050.\" The report goes on to say that: \"Depending on the RCP, between half (RCP2.6) to three-quarters (RCP8.5) of the human population could be exposed to periods of life-threatening climatic conditions arising from coupled impacts of extreme heat and humidity by 2100.\" The report pinpoints how inequality and unplanned or informal urban development favours vulnerability to heat stress.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tackling heat stress relief\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">According to C3S scientists, even if they are not a surprise, as the observed data are almost exactly in line with the climate projections, the extreme heat levels observed in Europe last year were concerning and need to trigger quick and effective adaptation and mitigation actions in parallel with a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>C3S closely monitors urban heat stress through its 'global ERA5 UTCI dataset<url normalizedValue=\"http://xn--evg/\">'</url> and its urban climate dataset, a comprehensive dataset that includes air temperature, humidity and wind speed data for 100 cities in Europe. The dataset has been used in partnership with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/the-average-summer-season-intensity\">European Environmental Agency EEA</url> to, for example, understand the predicted intensity of the urban heat island effect during summer and the predicted number of extreme heatwaves in the coming years, based on the IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario.\u00a0</p><p>C3S provides several indicators for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/knowledge/c-a-indicators\">EEA's Climate ADAPT platform</url>, which shows climate projections for indicators such as sea level tropical nights or the climate suitability for tiger mosquitoes.\u00a0</p><p>Projections indicate clearly that Europe and in particular the Mediterranean Basin must learn to live with prolonged periods of strong heat stress.\u00a0</p><p>A lot has been done since the lethal 2003 heatwave, through improved climate information, early warnings and international cooperation. This has stabilised and, in some cases, even reduced the fatality rate despite the heat-hazard increase, but more needs to be done to keep this risk under control.\u00a0</p><p>In addition to a call to increase efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf\">IPCC's latest report</url> issued specific recommendations regarding heat stress, such as rethinking urban environments, improving social and physical infrastructure or through nature-based solutions such as urban greening.</p><p>Lives depend on it.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is operated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) on behalf of the European Commission.

Healing degraded forests, restoring mangroves, industrial-scale tree planting, boosting carbon uptake in rocks or the ocean -- all fall under the hotly debated category of \"nature-based solutions\".</p><p>The second way -- called direct air capture -- uses chemical processes to strip out CO2, then recycles it for industrial use or locks it away in porous rock formations, unused coal beds or saline aquifers. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>A variation known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, combines elements from both approaches.\u00a0</p><p>Wood pellets or other biomass is converted into biofuels or burned to drive turbines that generate electricity. The CO2 emitted is roughly cancelled out by the CO2 absorbed during plant growth.</p><p>But when carbon dioxide in the power plant's exhaust is syphoned off and stored underground, the process becomes a net-negative technology.</p><p>- Do we really need it? -</p><p>Yes, for a couple of reasons.</p><p>Even if the world begins drawing down carbon pollution by three, four or five percent each year -- and that is a significant \"if\" -- some sectors like cement and steel production, long-haul aviation and agriculture are expected to maintain significant emission levels for decades.\u00a0</p><p>The first-ever State of Carbon Dioxide report concluded that CDR must extract between 450 billion and 1.1 trillion tonnes of CO2 over the remainder of the 21st century -- the equivalent of 10 to 30 times annual CO2 emissions today.\u00a0</p><p>And there is another reason.\u00a0</p><p>The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it alarmingly clear that the 1.5C threshold will be breached in the coming decades no matter how aggressively greenhouse gases are drawn down.\u00a0</p><p>CO2 lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, which means that the only way to bring Earth's average surface temperature back under the wire by 2100 is to suck some of it out of the air. \u00a0</p><p>- What's hot, what's not? -</p><p>BECCS was pencilled into IPCC climate models more than a decade ago as the theoretically cheapest form of negative emissions, but has barely developed since.</p><p>A peer-reviewed proposal in 2019 to draw down excess CO2 by planting a trillion trees sparked huge excitement in the media and among gas and oil companies that have made afforestation offsets a central to their efforts to align with Paris treaty goals.</p><p>But the idea was sharply criticised by experts, who pointed out that it would require converting twice the area of India into mono-culture tree farms. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't see a BECCS boom,\" said Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and an expert on CDR.\u00a0</p><p>Also, planting trees to soak up CO2 is fine -- until the forests burn down in climate-enhanced wildfires.</p><p>Among all the carbon dioxide removal methods, direct air capture is among the least developed but the most talked about.\u00a0</p><p>- How fast can we scale up? -</p><p>Direct air capture (DAC) is a large-scale industrial process that requires huge amounts of energy to run.</p><p>Existing technology is also a long way from making a dent in the problem.</p><p>The amount, for example, of CO2 potentially extracted from what will be the world's largest direct air capture plant (36,000 tonnes) -- being built in Iceland by Swiss company Climeworks -- is equivalent to 30 seconds' worth of current global emissions (about 40 billion tonnes).</p><p>But the trajectory of earlier technologies such as solar panels suggests that scaling the industry up to remove billions of tonnes per year is not out of reach.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's at the upper end of what we've seen before,\" University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison professor Gregory Nemet. \"It's a huge challenge, but it's not unprecedented.\"</p><p>Climeworks announced last week the world's first certified CO2 removal and storage on behalf of paying clients, including Microsoft and software service company Stripe.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67CH-8KV1-F19C-X47M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

Yet the climate actions that we choose every day, individually and in our communities, are the ones that have the most direct impact on our daily lives.</p><p>Such choices are also supported by the New European Bauhaus - a movement that is reinvigorating the early 20th century German cultural school. The movement promotes the principles of sustainability, beauty and inclusiveness that underpin the societal and economic changes necessary to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p>Not so long ago, climate change was mainly felt in the Arctic or on low-lying islands. Today, we are seeing the impacts everywhere. This summer's floods and their tragic consequences in Belgium and Germany brought the stark reality of climate change home to Europe too.</p><p>I am proud that the European Union has, for a long time, provided global leadership on climate action, and that our environmental legislation and policies are the most advanced in the world. Our emphasis on evidence-based policymaking meant that from early on, we heeded the warnings from scientists. This is reflected in our existing robust environmental laws and the increasing number of new legislative proposals in the field of biodiversity, zero pollution and circularity.</p><p>Many citizens, local governments, civil society organisations, entrepreneurs and others also saw the danger signs. Supported in part by funding from European Union programmes such as LIFE and Horizon 2020, they began finding ways of making the transition to a low-carbon and sustainable world.</p><p>We know that as well as being effective, sustainable projects that embrace the principles of circularity, preserve ecosystems and promote nature-based solutions, offer great value for money, punching harder than their weight in terms of budget. This is because they are endowed with the flexibility and capacity to develop partnerships with multiple stakeholders for effective and efficient project implementation. Some of the bigger projects can use additional EU and national funds, giving them the chance to multiply resources to make a meaningful difference on the ground.</p><p>Many LIFE and Horizon 2020 projects have a lot in common with the interdisciplinary New European Bauhaus initiative. Some projects are helping to green our cities and reduce urban heat islands. Others promote cooperation between stakeholders and raise awareness to change behaviour. And several projects are looking to nature to help make our planet more resilient. And just like LIFE, New European Bauhaus calls for a collective effort to imagine and build a better, greener future.</p><p>This week's <url normalizedValue=\"https://bauhaus-life-event.b2match.io/home\">LIFE in the European Bauhaus</url> conference will showcase the kinds of projects from all corners of the EU that are helping to make the transformation to a carbon-neutral 2050. I'm confident that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://bauhaus-life-event.b2match.io/agenda\">three-day event</url> will also come up with a lot of new ideas for future projects that follow the New European Bauhaus approach.</p><p>To bring these ideas to life, I'm delighted to announce that we have earmarked <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=LIFE-2021-SAP-ENV;freeTextSearchKeyword=;matchWholeText=true;typeCodes=1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502,31094503;programmePeriod=null;programCcm2Id=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;destination=null;mission=null;geographicalZonesCode=null;programmeDivisionProspect=null;startDateLte=null;startDateGte=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;cpvCode=null;performanceOfDelivery=null;sortQuery=sortStatus;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false;topicListKey=callTopicSearchTableState\">(EURO)13 million in LIFE funding</url> for upcoming New European Bauhaus projects.</p><p>I hope that this week's <url normalizedValue=\"https://bauhaus-life-event.b2match.io/\">Beautiful, sustainable, together: LIFE in the New European Bauhaus</url> conference will see scientists, designers, architects, engineers, and students exchange ideas, join forces and forge a shared vision of the future. There has been a lot of enthusiasm around the New European Bauhaus, and I am sure that those active in the fields of behavioural change, urban transformation, nature-based solutions, as well as in the wider fields of environment and climate action, will thoroughly embrace it.</p><p>For 29 years, the LIFE programme has acted as a frontrunner for new initiatives. I'm proud to see that LIFE is once again taking the lead by becoming active in the New European Bauhaus and bringing the European Green Deal into our living spaces for a sustainable, inclusive and beautiful future.</p><p>You can follow the conference online <url normalizedValue=\"https://bauhaus-life-event.b2match.io/\">here</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1674818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:643B-S8W1-DYXB-V0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 16, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Bauhaus</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N541310MM</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRNP</classCode><className>GREEN DEALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQIC</classCode><className>CIRCULAR ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp;

(NYSE: STZ and STZ.B), a leading beverage alcohol company, announced today a two-year commitment of $700,000 in total contributions to The Nature Conservancy (TNC), which describes itself as \"one of the most effective and efficient environmental organizations in the world\" with a mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends. This contribution is partly intended to benefit watersheds in California communities where Constellation Brands operates, contributing to the company's water replenishment targets first announced in April 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">$200,000 of the total amount was donated in February 2022 and will be used to support TNC's broader Global Resilient Watersheds program, which is focused on making watershed health a priority by investing in nature-based solutions - such as forest protection, regenerative agricultural practices, wetland restoration, and natural vegetation corridors along waterways - and aims to restore watershed health and revitalize degraded freshwater systems around the world.</p><p>The remaining $500,000 donation will be leveraged over two years in support of TNC's innovative dynamic water management programs in California. Drawing on two nature-based opportunities, the dynamic water management programs in California target the San Joaquin Valley and the Stockton/Sacramento watersheds - both located in communities where a number of Constellation's winery facilities and operations reside. These programs are designed to bring to life important proof of concept strategies for rebalancing water demand for people and nature that in turn may be implemented on a broader scale to seek to address water challenges across the State of California and elsewhere.</p><p>In addition to helping improve watershed health for the broader community, nature-based solutions implemented through the dynamic water management programs are expected to provide volumetric benefits toward Constellation's water replenishment goals. Between Fiscal Year 2023 and Fiscal Year 2025, Constellation is targeting to restore approximately 1.1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from watersheds, while improving accessibility and quality of water for communities where the company operates. To achieve this target, Constellation developed a strategy focused on water efficiency, watershed restoration, and water accessibility and quality.

The British consulting firm estimates that Auckland is the major city most able to effectively absorb torrential rainfall today, thanks to its numerous parks and water bodies.</p><p>One of the major threats of climate change is the increase in intense rainfall. But are large cities prepared for this? To answer this question, Arup set out to analyze the soil quality and terrain of seven major cities around the world: Auckland (New Zealand), London (England), Mumbai (India), Nairobi (Kenya), New York (USA), Shanghai (China) and Singapore.</p><p>As things stand, the New Zealand city appears to be the most capable of absorbing such heavy rainfall. Conversely, London is the least prepared in this line-up. Beyond this study, Arup hopes to make cities aware of the means that can be used to fight against these natural phenomena, which are more and more recurrent.</p><p>In each of these cities, a sample of 150 square km of terrain was studied in order to judge each one's capacity to adequately absorb heavy rainfall. In Auckland, half of the area studied was made up of green space (parks, gardens, etc.) and blue space (waterways, ponds, etc.), which allowed it to obtain the highest \"sponginess\" score. Note that Nairobi has even more green-blue areas, but the city's soil is less permeable than in Auckland. In comparison, Shanghai and London are much more \"concrete\" cities, especially in their centers. New York comes just ahead with the most permeable soil type of the cities studied, and also with many green spaces (other than Central Park). Overall, Auckland's urban center is rated as 35% \"spongy,\" ahead of Nairobi (34%), Singapore, Mumbai and New York (30%). Next are Shanghai (28%) and London (22%).</p><p>In the future, large cities will have to learn to deploy nature-based solutions rather than continue to focus on concrete urban centers. Even the most \"spongy\" cities must seek to improve and work with nature to provide maximum resilience.</p><p>Note that the term \"sponge city\" was coined in 2013 by Peking University professor, Kongjian Yu, to describe cities that work with nature to properly absorb rainwater, instead of using concrete to channel it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:652Y-15C1-F19C-X44C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;
