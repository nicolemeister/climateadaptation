It was specifically intended to build soil health with a permanent cover of native perennial grasses and other plants, and to introduce animals into the vineyard. The aim is to withstand and combat climate change by sequestering carbon and minimizing water usage, and to increase the population of mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with the vine roots, all while producing the material to make exceptional wine.       </p><p>Other vineyards are farmed with regenerative agriculture, which builds a thriving population of microorganisms in the soil and a diverse ecosystem. An increasing number of grape growers have stopped tilling their vineyards, which exposes bare earth, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Many even bring animals into the vineyard after the grapes have been harvested and before the new season starts, using them to control grasses and weeds and as a natural source of fertilizer.       </p><p>Yet few have taken the approach of Paicines Ranch (pronounced pie-SEEN-ess), which allows sheep into the vineyard even during the growing season, a practice that is generally shunned because sheep can eat precious leaves, buds and grapes.       </p><p>A few others have developed workarounds to discourage sheep from going after the vines, but the Paicines vineyards may be the first in modern times to have been designed with the idea of having animals among the vines.       </p><p>Instead of the usual method of training vines on trellises rather low to the ground, in easy reach of hungry grazers, the Paicines vines are set much higher, beyond the reach of even the most determined sheep. This goes against conventional modern thinking, in which vines are kept low both to absorb heat from the earth and to minimize the energy the plant uses pushing sap upward.       </p><p>\"What is the evolutionary aspect of a grapevine?\" said Kelly Mulville, the vineyard manager. \"They go up a tree.\"       </p><p>Mr. Mulville has been working for years with the notion of integrating animals and organic farming, ever since noticing how much better the crops did when planted in areas that had recently been grazed by cattle while working at an organic farm in the San Luis Valley in Colorado.       </p><p>He kept that in mind as his focus transitioned to wine, which led him to Spain, Australia, New Zealand and California, where he worked at Rhys Vineyards in the Santa Cruz Mountains and Medlock Ames in the Alexander Valley. Finally, he was able to experiment with keeping sheep in a small vineyard in the Alexander Valley during the growing season and was astonished at the results.       </p><p>\"It was a big surprise,\" he said. \"We had a 98.6 percent reduction in irrigation use, and yield was way up.\"       </p><p>An increasing number of growers now believe that healthier soil creates the potential for better grapes and wine. But few have added animals to the equation during the growing season.       </p><p>\"Things happen when an animal grazes a plant,\" Mr. Mulville said. \"It stimulates the plant and imparts some kind of resistance to disease and pests.\"       </p><p>It happened that Sallie Calhoun, who owns Paicines Ranch with her husband, Matt Christiano, had been intrigued with the idea of incorporating a vineyard into the ranch's polyculture.       </p><p>Ms. Calhoun was a software engineer with an interest in organic gardening who sold her company in 2001 and purchased the ranch that same year. What constitutes the ranch today had once been part of the territory of the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band before Spanish missionaries in the late 17th century took the land. It later became part of a vast Mexican land grant before California was absorbed into the United States.       </p><p>The land was eventually sold to developers in 1989, and then to Ms. Calhoun and Mr. Christiano, Ms. Calhoun said, after San Benito County decided it didn't want a development in this sparsely populated area.       </p><p>Wine grapes have a history in the region. Almaden, the big wine company, long had a 2,000-acre vineyard in Paicines, which may be why Paicines is an official appellation. The 25-acre Paicines vineyard site, Ms. Calhoun said, was a conventionally farmed vineyard from 1965 to 1995, though it had been grazed by cattle from then until planning began for the new vineyard in 2014.       </p><p>The first half of the vineyard was planted in 2017 and the rest in 2020. Altogether now, it comprises seven acres of grenache and a wide variety of other grapes, including assyrtiko, verdejo, picpoul blanc, carignan, menc\u00eda, cinsault, counoise and cabernet sauvignon.       </p><p>If all goes according to plan, the sheep - 1,700 live on the ranch, primarily Dorper and Katahdin breeds - will graze in the vineyard three or four times over the course of the year, eating the grasses and weeds that many growers try to eradicate because they see them as competing with the vines for resources. Mr. Mulville scoffs at the idea that other plants threaten vines.       </p><p>\"That's not how ecosystems work,\" Mr. Mulville said. What we call weeds have an important role to play, he said, adding to the ecological diversity while drawing in animals who feed on them and improve the life in the soil and health of the vines with their presence.       </p><p>\"Much of what we base our thinking on is that we're working on a declining level of productivity because so many conventional practices reduce biodiversity,\" he said. \"Each plant will probably encourage a different collection of soil biology and increase the productivity of an ecosystem.       </p><p>\"I wanted to prove to myself we could restore ecosystems with agriculture instead of reducing them.\"       </p><p>The first commercial harvest was in 2021. It was sold to Margins Wine, which uses organically grown grapes chosen from what the winemaker, Megan Bell, considers underrepresented regions. She made three wines from Paicines grapes, a grenache, a verdejo and an assyrtiko.       </p><p>The early results are encouraging. I tasted an assyrtiko and a verdejo during a visit to Paicines earlier this year and found both to be fresh, energetic and deeply textured. The assyrtiko in particular was striking, reminiscent of the stony citrus and herbal flavors of a wine from Santorini but kissed by a little California sun.       </p><p>\"The quality of the fruit was stunning,\" Ms. Bell said by email. \"I was incredibly impressed by the complexity the finished wines achieved from vines that were only four years old.\"       </p><p>Wine quality is crucial if only to draw attention to Mr. Mulville's farming methods. People who might not be moved by moral arguments for regenerative farming may be swayed by demonstrably excellent wines.       </p><p>\"Ideally, the wines are extraordinary, the proof that this works,\" said Mimi Casteel, a farmer and winemaker in the Willamette Valley of Oregon who has been a leading advocate for regenerative agriculture, and who has been closely following the work at Paicines.       </p><p>Because wine is so often a product that heightens people's awareness of agriculture, it can stimulate interest in the possibilities of regenerative agriculture as a tool to fight climate change and build more diverse ecosystems.       </p><p>In that sense, wine is simply a tool to reach the greater goal of Ms. Calhoun and Mr. Mulville, which, as Ms. Calhoun said, is to demonstrate the benefits of soil health in hopes that their methods will be adopted widely.       </p><p>\"It's not as if the first try is going to succeed,\" she said. \"We have to figure it out.\"       </p><p>Mr. Mulville added: \"It was established in part to demonstrate what is possible. We're just scratching the surface.\"       </p><p>Education is an important part of the Paicines program. Four paid interns are working the growing season this year, some with no previous vineyard experience.       </p><p>\"I really love the dedication to bringing people along and really trying to thoughtfully inoculate a generation of people who are going out to work,\" Ms. Casteel said. \"They are getting such a gift, working there and really, deeply thinking about that system and about how they want to work in the future.\"       </p><p>The Paicines model may not be for every vineyard. While Ms. Casteel admires Mr. Mulville's work with the vineyard, and Ms. Calhoun's vision for the entire Paicines project, she cautioned that what works in one vineyard is not necessarily transferable to another. Methods for regenerative agriculture, she believes, must be applied individually to the particular conditions of every site and region.       </p><p>\"I don't want people to rip out vineyards to adapt to something trendy,\" Ms. Casteel said. \"There's an inspiration there for adapting creatively rather than completely starting over. If people are inspired to have a little more habitat or do something better with the grapes, that's a great outcome.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">,\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TikTok</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00a0and\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.\u00a0</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008339899</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65GM-V5G1-JC85-N0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1672\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 20, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

The Zone saw market share gains in soluble coffee, confectionery, and pet food, with losses for Wyeth infant nutrition products.</p><p>By product category, confectionery was the largest growth contributor, led by Hsu Fu Chi and Shark Wafer. Nestl\u00e9 Professional achieved double-digit growth, fueled by innovation and customer acquisition. Coffee delivered mid-single digit growth, driven by Nescaf\u00e9 ready-to-drink offerings. Sales for Purina PetCare grew at a double-digit rate, based on new product launches and strong e-commerce momentum, particularly for Pro Plan and Fancy Feast. Infant Nutrition saw positive growth, with continued strong demand for NAN, which more than offset a sales decline for Wyeth products. Culinary posted slightly negative growth, as positive sales trends in out-of-home channels were more than offset by a decrease in retail sales.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science</p><p>-1.8% organic growth: -3.6% RIG; 1.9% pricing.</p><p>Organic growth was -1.8%, with pricing of 1.9%.

Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 5.6%. Reported sales in Nestl\u00e9 Health Science decreased by 6.6% to CHF 1.5 billion. By geography, Europe reported mid single-digit growth, while other regions combined posted negative growth.</p><p>Vitamins, minerals and supplements posted negative growth, reflecting the continued impact of supply constraints encountered in the second half of 2023. The integration plan is on track, and the constraints are expected to be resolved by the end of the first half of 2024. Pure Encapsulations, which was not affected by the supply issue, continued to deliver strong double-digit growth. Active Nutrition posted negative growth. Medical Nutrition delivered mid single-digit growth and continued to gain market share. Growth was driven by strong sales momentum for adult medical care products and Vitaflo.

Innovation continued to resonate with consumers, based on new limited editions, particularly Pierre Herm\u00e9 and Maple Pecan.</p><p>Business as a force for good: Nespresso's integrated approach to sustainability</p><p>Nespresso stands for truly outstanding coffee, brewed with matchless convenience. Since the beginning, the business has understood that delivering exceptional taste to consumers should go hand-in-hand with a true commitment to sustainability: from coffee growing all the way to delivering a superb brew. Nespresso uses just the right amount of coffee, water and energy for each cup, while also helping to improve the livelihoods of coffee farmers and protect the environment. Today, Nespresso is recognized as one of the top 100 brands in the world by Interbrand, a global brand consultancy. The business embeds its sustainable production and consumption initiatives in its communication and engagement with its consumers.</p><p>Having achieved B Corp certification in 2022, Nespresso is part of a global community of businesses that meet high standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency.</p><p>The business's sustainability work focuses on two key aspects: its supply chain and end-of-life management of used materials.</p><p>The Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program supports coffee farmers in implementing best agriculture practices, improving their productivity, and producing higher-quality coffee. Co-created with the Rainforest Alliance, the program celebrated its 20th anniversary last year and is building on its experience and helping farmers transition to regenerative agriculture.</p><p>With over 95% of its green coffee being priced above the Fairtrade International minimum, Nespresso is helping provide AAA coffee farmers with a stable income. It is also scaling up a crop insurance program to give farmers a safety net when impacted by weather events. The business additionally works with partners to revive coffee production in origins that have suffered from natural disasters or conflicts, including in Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Puerto Rico and Uganda.</p><p>Nespresso has also taken great strides in reducing waste. It uses at least 80% recycled aluminum content in its Original and Vertuo capsules and is expanding its RELOVE refurbished machine program to more countries. Since 2014, Nespresso has invested significantly in its recycling programs globally to make recycling easier and more convenient. Today, more than 90% of Nespresso aluminum capsules are purchased by consumers with access to a convenient recycling option. The business has worked with various partners to showcase creations using recycled coffee capsules, for instance,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CEhhMUiiMwL-8dCVYOHVi9_KVebIBLWa1zlmYoc-SYWMHq1Ag-a0AWQ0l3jFJ1Bm80R3yBBXgtLRqCdLad2g8mwv-1pFvnXFGK8oUrpgWDY=\">Hublot watches</url>,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fW0hAQ8cohz13KiAxkYI-1BW3x19qbfdnFtfD3vp-E2basAf7jz7-XOL0TNDQGb3ZR63W_PrxiSiBcxV0rNrlsBuUDXmrMI7yQOgBJJKUWLXVUiYnynkkwwxReRpNRvEym4lfA3mNIoRHHRH27Oy84TKT6ZsJhwOL50x0H7QX7tnzTHAJtI2QsVhkSXLI8iN\">Caran d'Ache ball pens</url>, or<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Zawhtqdaa-1T_hoRaJbmql1Xw1jrRyZGhsVhWHLNw4NFc1A8J13sT1V-Qjt9dIqbcC2mh7qX_VJ3CedL8vRQeSlvm1FJ6EZuK51QmwhvIxALhitA2-VSfGcU3pk3JMci31RvJa9rgmToxOhkNsN8Ug==\">e-bikes from start-up Miloo</url>.

Syngenta's Alexandra Brand sees a golden opportunity for the agricultural sector and policy makers to urgently step-up and innovate for the future.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alexandra Brand is Regional Director (EAME) at Syngenta Crop Protection.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lower yields, higher food prices, unviable incomes for farmers, and fewer opportunities to export produce are all hard to swallow, but that is what a recent impact assessment from Wageningen University concluded.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We cannot ignore this data, and we certainly cannot trade-off good outcome intentions with such problematic consequences.</p><p>This is a call for action. I see this as a huge opportunity for all of us in agriculture to step up and innovate. This is a unique chance to accelerate the introduction of new approaches in how farmers will grow our food.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farmers are environmentalist </emphasis></p><p>Everyone has a responsibility to address climate change, including the agricultural sector. Farmers have a vested interest as they are impacted greatly by climate change and low fertile, low carbon soils. They face increasing pressures from soil erosion and biodiversity loss, and the natural world that farming works with, plant pests and diseases, continue to pose challenges.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture, which is sometimes called nature-positive agriculture, is one possible approach to deliver on the right balance between the need to supply sufficient food and to take care of our environment. It's not a specific technology or agricultural system but a combination of farming practices that help to achieve the outcomes that we want.</p><p>These outcomes include improved land-use efficiency to protect non-agricultural land, but also to protect the soils we grow crops on for future generations.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture also looks to protect and enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services, ensuring surface and artesian water supplies are safe for nature and human use.</p><p>But changing a farm's management is a high economic risk farmers cannot take on their own. Regenerative agriculture requires new technologies, investments, piloting, and scientific agronomic support. Farmers need an alliance of the scientific community, industry, consumers, and policy makers to support them to drive this change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A call for innovation</emphasis></p><p>Science-based innovation can support farmers in making better choices in how to operate farms more sustainably. The agricultural sector is ready to step-up innovation and invest to help farmers in their quest for more environmentally friendly and economically viable operations.</p><p>Many new technologies are getting more mainstream use by farmers, including digital agriculture, precision technologies, new breeding technologies and biologicals such as biocontrols and biostimulants.</p><p>Digital agriculture can enable a better risk sharing between farmers and innovators. Through these technologies farmers can measure not only yield and economic outcomes but also biodiversity improvements and soil carbon content.</p><p>Biocontrols\u00a0are products based on naturally\u00a0occurring materials that are used for\u00a0biotic stress management in controlling\u00a0fungal and bacterial diseases, pests,\u00a0nematodes, and weeds.</p><p>Biostimulants\u00a0are products that are used with the\u00a0intention to stimulate natural processes\u00a0of plants, requiring less fertilizer, improving crop quality, building soil carbon and tolerance\u00a0to climate stress.</p><p>We believe we are on the right pathway to designing a better mix of science-based tools for more sustainable farming.</p><p>But to accelerate shifts towards more sustainable farming and adoption of new practices we need a policy and regulatory environment that recognises, rewards, and drives innovation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stepping up to the plate </emphasis></p><p>Farmers and growers are best placed to talk about the specific support they need from policy makers.</p><p>For us as innovators, speed to market is critical. It currently takes up to 11 years for any crop protection substance to arrive on the market, and pests and diseases are not waiting. We need to see a broad choice of biological products available for farmers with a modern fast-track, risk-based regulatory system.</p><p>Regulatory policy and implementation need to account for the outcomes digital tools and new technologies can bring. These technologies also need public support and a well-trained agricultural advisory network. Recognition and reward of responsible use and risk management of crop protection techniques should also be considered.</p><p>We are focused on innovating to help overcome the trade-offs identified in the recent impact assessment on the Farm to Fork strategy. We remain fully committed to leading advancements in agriculture technology and delivering options for farmers that mitigate impacts of climate change, protect the planet, and help feed populations.</p><p>We are ready to step up to the plate and work with policy makers, growers and indeed consumers to accelerate the pace of change and deliver a Farm to Fork strategy that works for everyone and the environment. \u00a0It is in all our interests to safeguard the integrity of Europe's agricultural sector and ensure it remains economically robust and competitive for future generations.</p><p>We have a great opportunity here. Let's seize it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1701421</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64M2-S401-DYXB-V4BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 24, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0008AHH</classCode><className>SYNGENTA CROP PROTECTION INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F8K</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL INCOME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A0</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097WX</classCode><className>FOOD PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSDM</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Turning a profit has gotten harder, and none of your children want to take it over. You don't want to sell the land; you love the open space, the flora and fauna it hosts. But offers from developers who would turn it into subdivisions or strip malls seem increasingly tempting.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One day, a land broker mentions an idea. How about granting a long-term lease to a company that values your property for the same reasons you do: long walks through tall grass, the calls of migrating birds, the way it keeps the air and water clean.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It sounds like a scam. Or charity. In fact, it's an approach backed by hardheaded investors who think nature has an intrinsic value that can provide them with a return down the road - and in the meantime, they would be happy to hold shares of the new company on their balance sheets.       </p><p>Such a company doesn't yet exist. But the idea has gained traction among environmentalists, money managers and philanthropists who believe that nature won't be adequately protected unless it is assigned a value in the market - whether or not that asset generates dividends through a monetizable use.       </p><p>The concept almost hit the big time when the Securities and Exchange Commission was considering a proposal from the New York Stock Exchange to list these \"natural asset companies\" for public trading. But after a wave of fierce opposition from right-wing groups and Republican politicians, and even conservationists wary of Wall Street, in mid-January the exchange pulled the plug.       </p><p>That doesn't mean natural asset companies are going away; their proponents are working on prototypes in the private markets to build out the model. And even if this concept doesn't take off, it's part of a larger movement motivated by the belief that if natural riches are to be preserved, they must have a price.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beyond Philanthropy</emphasis></p><p>For decades, economists and scientists have worked to quantify the contributions of nature - a kind of production known as ecosystem services.       </p><p>By traditional accounting methods, a forest has monetary value only when it has been cut into two-by-fours. If a forest not destined for the sawmill burns down, economic activity actually increases, because of the relief efforts required in the aftermath.       </p><p>When you pull back the camera, though, forests help us in many more ways. Beyond sucking carbon out of the air, they hold the soil in place during heavy rains, and in dry times help it retain moisture by shading the ground and protecting winter snowpack, which helps keep reservoirs full for humans. Without the tree-covered Catskills, for example, New York City would have to invest much more in infrastructure to filter its water.       </p><p>Natural capital accounting, which U.S. statistical agencies are developing as a sidebar to their measurements of gross domestic product, puts numbers on those services. To move those calculations beyond an academic exercise, they need to be factored into incentives.       </p><p>The most common way to do that is the social cost of carbon: a price per ton of emissions that represents climate change's burdens on humanity, such as natural disasters, disease and reduced labor productivity. That number is used to evaluate the costs and benefits of regulations. In some countries - notably not the United States, at least on the federal level - it is used to set taxes on emissions. Efforts to remove carbon can then generate credits, which trade on open markets and fluctuate with supply and demand.       </p><p>But carbon is just the simplest way of putting a price on nature. For the other benefits - wildlife, ecotourism, protection from hurricanes and so on - the revenue model is less obvious.       </p><p>That's what Douglas Eger set out to address. He wanted to work for an environmental group after college, but on his conservative father's advice he instead made a career in business, running companies in pharmaceuticals, tech and finance. With some of his newly built wealth, he bought a 7,000-acre tract northwest of New York City to preserve as open space.       </p><p>He didn't think philanthropy would be enough to stem the loss of nature - a seminal 2020 report found that more than $700 billion was needed annually to avert a collapse in biodiversity. Government wasn't solving the problem. Socially responsible investing, while making progress, wasn't reversing damage to critical habitats.       </p><p>So in 2017, Mr. Eger founded the Intrinsic Exchange Group with the goal of incubating natural asset companies, NACs for short. Here's how it works: A landowner, whether a farmer or a government entity, works with investors to create a NAC that licenses the rights to the ecosystem services the land produces. If the company is listed on an exchange, the proceeds from the public offering of shares would provide the landowner with a revenue stream and pay for enhancing natural benefits, like havens for threatened species or a revitalized farming operation that heals the land rather than leaching it dry.       </p><p>If all goes according to plan, investments in the company will appreciate as environmental quality improves or demand for natural assets increases, yielding a return years down the road - not unlike art, or gold or even cryptocurrency.       </p><p>\"All of these things, if you think about it, are social agreements to a degree,\" Mr. Eger said. \"And the beauty of a financial system is between a willing buyer and seller, the underlying becomes true.\"       </p><p>In discussions with like-minded investors, he found an encouraging openness to the idea. The Rockefeller Foundation kicked in about $1.7 million to fund the effort, including a 45-page document on how to devise an \"ecological performance report\" for the land enrolled in a NAC. In 2021, Intrinsic announced its plan to list such companies on the New York Stock Exchange, along with a pilot project involving land in Costa Rica as well as support from the Inter-American Development Bank and major environmental groups. By the time they filed an application with the S.E.C. in late September, Mr. Eger was feeling confident.       </p><p>That's when the firestorm began.       </p><p>The American Stewards of Liberty, a Texas-based group that campaigns against conservation measures and seeks to roll back federal protections for endangered species, picked up on the plan. Through both grass-roots organizing and high-level lobbying, it argued that natural asset companies were a Trojan horse for foreign governments and \"global elites\" to lock up large swaths of rural America, particularly public lands. The rule-making docket started to fill up with comments from critics charging that the concept was nothing but a Wall Street land grab.       </p><p>A collection of 25 Republican attorneys general called it illegal and part of a \"radical climate agenda.\" On Jan. 11, in what may have been the final straw, the Republican chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee sent a letter demanding a slew of documents relating to the proposal. Less than a week later, the proposal was scratched.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unexpected Headwinds</emphasis></p><p>Mr. Eger was dismayed. The most powerful forces arrayed against natural asset companies were people who wanted land to remain available for uses like coal mining and oil drilling, a fundamental disagreement about what's good for the world. But opponents also made spurious arguments about the risks of his plan, Mr. Eger said. Landowners would decide whether and how to set up a NAC, and existing laws still applied. What's more, foreign governments can and do buy up large tracts of land directly; a license to the land's ecological performance rights would create no new dangers.       </p><p>There is also pushback, however, from people who strongly believe in protecting natural resources, and worry that monetizing the benefits would further enrich the wealthy without reliably delivering the promised environmental upside.       </p><p>\"If investors want to pay a landowner to improve their soil or protect a wetland, that's great,\" said Ben Cushing, the director of the Sierra Club's Fossil-Free Finance campaign. \"I think we've seen that when that is turned into a financial asset that has a whole secondary market attached to it, it creates a lot of distortions.\"       </p><p>Another environmental group, Save the World's Rivers, filed a comment opposing the plan partly because, it said, the valuation framework centered on nature's use to humans, rather than other living things.       </p><p>To Debbie Dekleva, who lives in Ogallala, Neb., the prospect that a natural asset company could enroll large tracts of land seems like a very real threat. For 36 years, her family has worked to commercialize milkweed, a wild plant that produces a strong fiber and is the only thing that the caterpillars of imperiled monarch butterflies will eat. Ms. Dekleva pays local residents to collect the pods from milkweed stands with permission from friendly landowners, and then processes them into insulation, cloth and other products.       </p><p>That sounds like a type of business that might contribute to a NAC's value. But Ms. Dekleva suspects that she wouldn't be part of it - faraway investors and big companies might lock up the rights to milkweed on surrounding land, making it harder for her to operate.       </p><p>\"I think that whoever writes the rules wins,\" Ms. Dekleva said. \"So let's say Bayer is doing regenerative agriculture, and they're going to say, 'And now we get these biodiversity credits, and we get this, and we get this, and we get this.' How does someone like me compete with something like that?\"       </p><p>Such opposition - the kind that stems from deep skepticism about financial products that are marketed as solving problems through capitalism, and questions about who is entitled to nature's gifts - may be hard to dislodge.       </p><p>Mr. Eger said he built safeguards into the proposed rule to guard against concerns like Ms. Dekleva's. For example, each company's charter is supposed to include an \"equitable benefit sharing policy\" that provides for the well-being of local residents and businesses.       </p><p>For now, Intrinsic will seek to prove the concept in the private markets. The company declined to disclose the parties involved before the deals are closed, but identified a few projects that are close. One is attached to 1.6 million acres owned by a North American tribal entity. Another plans to enroll soybean farms and shift them to more sustainable practices, with investment from a consumer packaged goods company that will buy the crop. (The pilot project in Costa Rica, which Intrinsic envisioned as covering a national park in need of funding to prevent incursions from arsonists and poachers, stalled when a new political party came to power.)       </p><p>And the concept remains attractive to some landowners who've managed to wrap their heads around it. Take Keith Nantz, a cattle rancher who has been trying to build a vertically integrated, sustainable beef operation across the Pacific Northwest. He and a few partners would like to move to less chemically intensive grazing practices, but banks are hesitant to lend on a project that could reduce yields or jeopardize crop insurance coverage.       </p><p>A natural asset company could be a piece of his financing puzzle. And to Mr. Nantz, the opposition comes mostly from a place of fear.       </p><p>\"There's nothing being forced by a government or state or organization to be a part of this or not,\" he said. \"We can choose to be a part of this, and hopefully it's a great opportunity to bring some capital.\"       </p><p>Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Catrin Einhorn contributed reporting. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000009307337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BG9-X531-JC85-N1S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1973\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 5, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

Pricing was 7.5%, reflecting significant cost inflation. RIG was resilient at 1.0% following a high base of comparison in 2021 and continued supply chain constraints, with limited demand elasticity.</p><p>Organic growth was 7.4% in developed markets, mostly driven by pricing with slightly positive RIG. Organic growth in emerging markets was 10.2%, supported by both pricing and RIG.</p><p>By product category, Purina PetCare was the largest contributor to organic growth, with continued momentum for science-based and premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Purina ONE and Fancy Feast as well as veterinary products. Sales in coffee grew at a high single-digit rate, with positive sales developments for Nescaf\u00e9, Starbucks and Nespresso. Growth in Infant Nutrition reached a double-digit rate, with broad-based contributions across geographies. Confectionery reported double-digit growth, reflecting particular strength for KitKat and seasonal products. Water posted double-digit growth, despite supply chain constraints, led by premium brands, S. Pellegrino, Acqua Panna and Perrier. Dairy reported mid single-digit growth, with continued momentum for coffee creamers and a recovery for home-baking products. Cocoa and malt beverages saw high single-digit growth, with particular strength for Milo as well as Nesquik ready-to-drink formats. Prepared dishes and cooking aids posted low single-digit growth, following a high base of comparison in 2021, with continued strong demand for Maggi. Sales in vegetarian and plant-based food continued to grow at a double-digit rate, led by Garden Gourmet. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science recorded mid single-digit growth, driven by Medical Nutrition and healthy-aging products.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales remained robust at 7.3%. Within retail, e-commerce sales grew by 8.4%, building on growth of 17.2% in the first nine months of 2021. Organic growth in out-of-home channels reached 26.1%, with sales exceeding 2019 levels.</p><p>Net acquisitions increased sales by 1.2%, largely related to the acquisitions of the core brands of The Bountiful Company and Orgain. The impact on sales from foreign exchange was negative at 0.6%. Total reported sales increased by 9.2% to CHF\u00a069.1\u00a0billion.</p><p>Portfolio Management</p><p>On April 1, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Orgain, a leader in plant-based nutrition. Orgain complements Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's existing portfolio of nutrition products that support healthier lives. The deal is expected to be slightly accretive to Nestl\u00e9's organic growth, while slightly dilutive to the Group's underlying trading operating profit margin in 2022. The agreement includes the option for Nestl\u00e9 Health Science to fully acquire Orgain in 2024.</p><p>On September 1, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 Health Science completed the acquisition of Puravida, a premium Brazilian nutrition and health lifestyle brand.

It builds on Nescaf\u00e9's decade-long sustainability work. The brand will invest over one billion Swiss francs into the Plan by 2030 - an investment that is supported by Nestl\u00e9's regenerative agriculture financing.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will work with coffee farmers to make the transition to regenerative agriculture by providing them with training, financial support and high-yielding coffee plantlets. Some of the regenerative practices that will be encouraged include:</p><p>planting cover cropsoptimizing fertilization, including the use of organic fertilizersincreasing the use of agroforestry and intercropping andpruning or replacing existing trees with disease and climate-change resistant varieties.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will test, learn and assess the effectiveness of multiple regenerative agriculture practices, prioritizing the seven countries from which it sources 90% of its coffee: Brazil, Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Indonesia and Honduras. Its goal, in line with the Nestl\u00e9 Group's ambition for all key agricultural ingredients, is to source 20% of its coffee from regenerative agricultural methods by 2025 and 50% by 2030.</p><p>Regenerative farming will improve soil health and fertility. Healthier soil holds more water and captures more carbon from the atmosphere. This will help Nescaf\u00e9 reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, in line with the Nestl\u00e9 Group commitment.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will simultaneously help boost the income of farmers who make the transition to regenerative agriculture. It will pilot a financial support program in selected countries to test the best approach according to local conditions. Some of the measures that may be used include: conditional cash incentives for the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, income protection through weather insurance and greater access to credit lines for farmers.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will track the progress and assess the results of its field programs through its Monitoring and Evaluation partnership with the Rainforest Alliance.

It requires a combination of regenerative agriculture, increased biodiversity and what he calls renewable farming, which is no longer dependent on the fossil fuel industry, but instead relies on renewable sources of energy.       </p><p>Mr. Mondavi, a farmer and winemaker - on the Sonoma Coast, not, like his grandfather and father, in Napa - is far from the only person in wine who has tried to encourage the industry to consider agriculture as a tool for combating climate change. Plenty of farmers recognize the importance of maintaining diverse ecosystems and avoiding the use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides.       </p><p>But Mr. Mondavi, with whom I spent a day in Northern California in early May, has taken a concrete step toward helping more farmers achieve these goals by spearheading the development of the Monarch tractor. This smart electric vehicle can work autonomously while serving as a sort of farm research hub that will provide growers with data about crop health that they need to better understand their operations and make them more efficient.       </p><p>\"I think we can get to a place of climate stability,\" he said, speaking with the elder Mondavi's characteristic optimism and evangelical fervor, his words flowing in torrents of facts and statistics. \"We can have a huge reduction in carbons and fossil fuels, but we are at the worst place now in the planet's history.\"       </p><p>Tractors may seem rather prosaic elements on which to build a revolution. But they are essential agricultural tools, selling several million annually worldwide with a market expected to hit almost $70 billion by 2027.       </p><p>The problem: Most tractors are powered by diesel. They are expensive to operate and spew pollutants, especially older diesel models.       </p><p>\"Tractors are far worse than ordinary cars,\" Mr. Mondavi said.       </p><p>Enter the Monarch, a compact tractor specifically aimed at small fruit and vegetable farms, including vineyards. It relies on electric vehicle technology, robotics and artificial intelligence that Mr. Mondavi sees as a solution to the obstacles that many conventional farmers say prevent them from transitioning to organic or other more sustainable methods.       </p><p>\"This is technology that helps our planet,\" Mr. Mondavi said. \"It changes the economic dynamic, helping to make it cheaper to farm organically or regeneratively than to farm conventionally.\"       </p><p>Steve Matthiasson, a farmer, winemaker and vineyard consultant in Napa Valley, has two Monarchs on order and is an enthusiastic proponent.       </p><p>\"The argument against organic farming, from a climate perspective, was the use of diesel to do more tractor operations rather than using synthetic chemicals to get work done,\" he said. \"This negates that argument. Now we can farm organically without diesel, using renewable energy.\"       </p><p>The tractor has the capacity to drive itself, though, as with self-driving cars, the notion can make people nervous. Still, driving a tractor is a dangerous job, particularly with vineyards on slopes. Around the world, farmers die every year in tractor accidents. Self-driving offers an additional bonus.       </p><p>\"It allows us to provide more opportunity for vineyard workers to be able to manage multiple tractors and more complexity, rather than one person, one tractor, which is how we currently do things,\" Mr. Matthiasson said. \"More responsibility, more pay, more opportunity.\"       </p><p>In addition, the tractor comes with a full array of cameras and sensors, controlled by proprietary software, which not only enables autonomous driving but also the gathering of a vast array of data about a vineyard, like crop health, yield estimation, insect life and moisture.       </p><p>\"By being able to have a better sense of exactly what is happening in different parts of the vineyard we can be more targeted with our agricultural inputs, allowing us to save considerably, which helps the bottom line but also the environment,\" Mr. Matthiasson said.       </p><p>Not everybody sees the Monarch as offering revolutionary potential. Mimi Casteel, a farmer and grape grower in the Willamette Valley of Oregon and a proponent of local, regenerative agriculture, acknowledges the impact a vehicle like the Monarch can have. But she said a green tractor does little to address underlying issues in our food system, like global supply chains and farms that are vast industrialized monocultures rather than diverse ecosystems.       </p><p>\"I love that he's focusing on making change, and I think that what he's doing can certainly be part of a future that's more regional and sustainable,\" she said. \"But when I think of General Mills pouring millions of dollars into regenerative monoculture to continue making Cheerios, we're avoiding the root causes.       </p><p>\"Even under clean energy, it will still be prohibitively extractive - solar panels, batteries, all these things take huge amounts of energy to build, and the materials have to come from somewhere. The effort involved in getting people to come around to regional food systems, that would be progress in my mind.\"       </p><p>If wine was not exactly his destiny, Mr. Mondavi was certain early in life that was what he would do.       </p><p>\"I always knew, from age 7, that I wanted to do whatever my grandfather did,\" he recalled. \"It was his passion, and my father's.\"       </p><p>When Robert Mondavi Winery was sold to Constellation Brands in 2004, after years  overreaching ambition and family conflict, Carlo's father, Tim Mondavi, Robert Mondavi's younger son who had long played a leading role there, founded his own Napa Valley winery, Continuum. It was small and focused specifically on one wine, a cabernet sauvignon-based blend.       </p><p>Carlo attended college in Aix-en-Provence, France, wanting to learn the language and the culture, but left before graduating to become, for a time, a professional snowboarder. He then worked in wineries in France and Italy. In the process, he fell in love with pinot noir.       </p><p>\"To join my family business was not automatic,\" Mr. Mondavi said. \"Continuum was a start-up and too small. I had to work outside the family. It was the opposite of being told, 'You're going to do this.'\"       </p><p>He teamed up with his younger brother, Dante, to make pinot noir, but it took them 10 years, he said, to get the blessing of his father. Finally, in 2013, they established RAEN, Research in Agriculture and Enology Naturally, which makes small lots of pinot noir on the Sonoma Coast.       </p><p>\"Dad didn't want us to overextend,\" he said. \"He had to be convinced. Now he is supersupportive.\"       </p><p>The RAEN wines, from several coastal sites, are exquisite, delicate in texture, subtle in aroma and flavor, and wonderful with food, all attributes long touted by the Mondavi family.       </p><p>Mr. Mondavi had long been alarmed by the changing climate, but it was the decline of the Monarch butterfly that he said galvanized him to activism. Populations of the butterflies, important cogs in the food chain and crucial pollinators, have declined drastically over the last 50 years because of habitat loss and widespread use of herbicides like glyphosate. They are now classified as endangered.       </p><p>He saw this happening with other pollinators, like honeybees, and became a fierce supporter of the Xerces Society, which is dedicated to conserving invertebrates. He also initiated the Monarch Challenge, a movement that encourages organic farming in Northern California by raising awareness of the dangers of chemical agriculture.       </p><p>\"I have friends who farm conventionally,\" he said. \"No one wants to harm Mother Earth.\"       </p><p>But he found education was not enough. The primary objections, he said, were that organic farming cost more and required far more tractor use, which caused a different set of environmental problems.       </p><p>While the challenge failed, he said, it was the genesis of a new idea.       </p><p>He wondered whether an electric tractor could overcome the objections. He began talking to people in the tech industry and teamed up with three like-minded veterans of the electric car and artificial intelligence industries to found Monarch in 2019.       </p><p>Mr. Mondavi's role in the development was to offer the farmer's point of view, assessing each design idea for its practical appeal. With headquarters in Livermore, Calif., and a manufacturing arrangement with Foxconn in Lordstown, Ohio, the first tractor was delivered in late 2022 to Constellation Brands, the corporation that now owns Robert Mondavi. This year, Monarch hopes to build 1,000 tractors and to scale up to 25,000 by 2026.       </p><p>With the design phase complete, Mr. Mondavi now acts as a sort of roving ambassador for Monarch, trumpeting its virtues to all who will listen, while continuing with his brother at RAEN, and spending time in Italy at Sor\u00ec della Sorba, a project with his wife, Giovanna Bagnasco, whose family produces Brandini Barolo.       </p><p>\"This is the hardest work I've ever done - seven days a week, day and night,\" he said.       </p><p>He described the frequent air travel as both \"one of my greatest pleasures and greatest guilts.\"       </p><p>Yet he is driven. Like his grandfather, whose mission was to advance Napa Valley into the forefront of wine regions, Mr. Mondavi has found his own urgent calling.       </p><p>\"When you look at all the data, it's terrifying,\" he said of climate change. \"But I believe we can rebound. I'm more optimistic now than ever when you see what can be done.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">TikTok</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008947535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68K7-0RB1-JC85-N1WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 30, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00059LB</classCode><className>WINE.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00028KN</classCode><className>ROBERT MONDAVI CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS445320 BEER, WINE, AND LIQUOR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS424820 WINE &amp;

Our revenue is increasing at constant exchange rates and our profitability is being maintained by the ongoing improvement in our competitiveness. At the end of this 2023-2024 1<sup>st</sup>first half year, the group's revenue growth and profitability are in line with targets communicated in October 2023.</p><p>Our mission is more than ever aligned with consumer expectations, which place plant-rich food at the heart of consumer trends. The turnaround in profitability is an essential catalyst in our strategy of positive impact with sustainable growth and in support of this mission.</p><p>The Bonduelle Group is committed to sustainable and local agriculture based on the principles of regenerative agriculture to which 46% of our growers are already committed. As a family business, we have been working hand-in-hand for decades with our farming partners, with whom we've forged strong ties.</p><p>Our relationship is based on trust, exchange of know-how and goes far beyond a contractual relationship. These ties are a strength in meeting the sector's environmental challenges, while offering our consumers healthy and quality products.</p><p>With the commitment and agility of all the group's employees, we will pursue our transformation and efficiency efforts in the second half year, to enable us to achieve the targets set for 2023-2024.</p><p>*******</p><p>The 2023-2024 half year financial statements were approved by the General Partner, then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of February 29, 2024 and by the Statutory Auditors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key figures</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Revenue</emphasis></p><p>The Bonduelle Group's revenue for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of fiscal year 2023-2024 amounted 1,213.1 million euros compared with 1,243.4 million euros for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of previous fiscal year, up +4.5% on a like-for-like basis<sup>(1)</sup>and down -2.4% on reported figures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activity by Geographical Region</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activity by Operating Segments</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe Zone</emphasis></p><p>The Europe Zone representing 64.8% of the business activity over the period, posted overall growth of +6.4% on reported figures and +5.9% on a like-for-like basis<sup>(1)</sup>over the 1<sup>st</sup>half year, with all technologies showing growth over the period.</p><p>The downturn in volumes remains limited in the region despite a significant weakness in food consumption. In canned and frozen retail activity, the private label category grew in both volume and value, while branded products (Bonduelle and Cassegrain) increased in value but fell back in volume.</p><p>The food service activity continued to grow, in both volume and value.</p><p>The fresh processed segment (bagged salads) was virtually stable in volume, but grew in value in retail. However, the situation varied from one region to another, with France affected by bad weather leading to a lower service rate. Germany is operating in a difficult market context while Italy is recording solid growth.</p><p>Fresh prepared segment posted growth over the period, fuelled by range renovations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-Europe Zone</emphasis></p><p>The Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 35.2% of the business activity over the period, posted an overall decline of -15.4% on reported figures and +2.5% on a like-for-like basis<sup>(1)</sup>.</p><p>The activity was clearly penalized by the translation effects of the Russian ruble, which lost an average of 40% of its value between the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the 2023-2024 fiscal year and the same half of the previous fiscal year.</p><p>In the Eurasia region, the canned activity remained sustained in terms of volume and value, for both branded products (which are largely predominant in the region) and private label category. The frozen activity recovered significantly over the last quarter and now shows sustained growth in volume and value over the period as a whole.</p><p>In North America, the decline in fresh processed products (bagged salads and meal solutions) remained more limited than in the same period last year, due to negative market trends. In this context, branded complete meal solutions based on salads as well as salad kits (salad bags with ingredients) posted significant market share gains.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating Income</emphasis></p><p>The Bonduelle Group's recurring operating income for 2023-2024 1<sup>st</sup>half year stands at 38.5 million euros at current exchange rate and at 50.5 million euros at constant exchange rates against 43.1 million euros the previous year. This corresponds to a +17.1% increase in current operating income, i.e. a current operating margin of 3.9% on a like-for-like basis<sup>(</sup><sup>1)</sup>and 3.2% on reported figures.</p><p>The Europe Zone succeeded in maintaining an operating margin of 5.6% on a like-for-like basis<sup>(1)</sup>, close to that of the 1<sup>st</sup>half year of the previous year, thanks to price upgrades and productivity efforts which helped to partially absorb increases in production costs, in particular for agricultural materials.</p><p>Profitability of the Non-Europe Zone, although still lower than Europe, is improving under the effect of the industrial competitiveness measures initiated in spring 2023 in North America and continued buoyant activity in Eurasia despite a very unfavorable exchange rate equation.</p><p>After taking into account non-recurring items of -5 million euros over the period, mainly reflecting a decision by the French Competition Authority, the Bonduelle Group operating income stands at 33.4 million euros on reported figures, compared with 41.5 million euros for the same period last year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net Result</emphasis></p><p>Financial result came to -17.4 million euros, compared with -17.5 million euros at the end of the previous half year. Interest expense for the half year rose from -11.5 million euros to -15.6 million euros, mainly due to the increase of interest rates (partially offset by interest-rate hedges) and an increase in indebtedness linked to the rise in inventories both in volume and value (inflation). The group's average financing rate increased over the period.</p><p>The foreign exchange result for the half year was balanced (-0.2 million euros), compared with a loss of -4.5 million euros for the same period last year.</p><p>The tax charge stands at 12.5 million euros against 13.1 million euros in the 1<sup>st</sup>half of previous fiscal year, with the effective tax rate (78.3%) still distorted by the non-activation of losses from the North American fresh activities on the one hand and the non-deductibility of the penalty imposed by the French Competition Authority on the other.</p><p>Result from associates amounts to 1.1 million euros, mainly corresponding to the group's share in the net result of Nortera Foods, which is accounted for under the equity method.</p><p>After taking into account financial result, tax charge and result of equity method, the Bonduelle Group's consolidated net result for 2023-2024 1<sup>st</sup>half year amounted to 4.5 million euros, compared with 20.0 million euros the previous fiscal year, representing 0.4% of revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Situation</emphasis></p><p>Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16) stood on December 31, 2023 at 649 million euros against 556.7 million euros at December 31 of the previous fiscal year.

From young, regenerative farmers to those soon facing retirement, in this EURACTIV Special CAPitals edition of the Agrifood Brief, our network spoke to farmers on the ground across nine different member states.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What are their concerns for the agriculture sector, both now and in the future, in their country? What messages do they have for policymakers in Brussels? Read on to find out more.</p><h>FRANCE\u00a0</h><h>'I might be out of business next year - I don't know'. Philippe Joubert, an organic farmer for 30 years, wants to bring back forgotten, ancient cereals. Millet and sorghum are among the crops that are gradually making a comeback thanks to their resistance to drought and their low water consumption.</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You can make a delicious dessert with hulled millet. But people don't know this cereal, so they don't buy it,\" says the 61-year-old farmer, who is both hopeful and resentful.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Joubert's organic farm, 100 kilometres south of the Loire, between Tours and Poitier, buckwheat and millet are grown alongside lentils and hulled weight.\u00a0</p><p>He works with companies specialising in 'gluten-free' products and sells his products directly to the consumer and supplies specialist shops, as well as supplying the central kitchen of Tours with 9,000 meals a day.</p><p>The early death of his farmer father at the age of 57 in the 1990s spurred him on to pursue organic farming.</p><p>But, when asked about the situation of the organic sector, he looks downcast. As president of a local group of organic farmers, he struggles with what he sees as the lack of recognition of the players in the sector.</p><p>\"We do more for the planet than others and we are not recognised. What's worse, we're being hindered. We are fed up!\" he said, pointing to rules that are ill-adapted to organic production.\u00a0</p><p>For Joubert, the development of competing, less restrictive labels, which 'sow confusion', combined with insufficient aid, 'infernal' administrative burdens and incomprehensible controls are plunging farmers into a situation of distress.</p><p>While he admits that some of his colleagues are thinking of stopping or even returning to conventional farming, he knows he will hang on for as long as he can.</p><p>For the moment, his customers remain loyal, but the future is uncertain. \"I might be out of business next year, I don't know,\" he admits.\u00a0</p><p>According to him,\u00a0global warming may be an opportunity to diversify crops and create new organic markets. It is up to governments, especially the EU, to encourage people to discover new products. (Hugo Struna | EURACTIV.fr)</p><h>GERMANY\u00a0</h><h>'The future is uncertain for our farm.' After running his farm for 44 years, Alfred Begon is preparing to retire and hand the reins to his 33-year-old son. Located in the Western German Eifel region, which is characterised by small-scale agriculture on parcelled-out land, the farm focuses on both arable farming and livestock.</h><p>Unlike many other farms, which often struggle with generational renewal, finding a successor to take over was not an issue for Begon. \"The decision already fell when my son decided to become a farmer and started his vocational training 15 years ago,\" he says.</p><p>Over the past years, his son has been taking over more and more responsibility on the farm and is well-prepared to take over.</p><p>But there is a key problem: Currently, with father and son working on the farm, there are only two full workers. </p><p>After the handover, son Peter will be the only family member left to do the work and will need extra staff. </p><p>But those willing to work in agriculture are hard to come by, Begon explains. \"This means that whether he will be able to make it remains uncertain,\" he stressed.</p><p>In the farmer's view, jobs in agriculture are not attractive enough for young people. \"They have to work practically day and night, and the appreciation from society is not there - something that is also reinforced by politics,\" he says.</p><p>Asked if he has a message to Brussels policymakers, Begon's answer is clear: \"Your policy loses sight of food security.\"</p><p>For the farmer, the grain shortages in many countries caused or exacerbated by Russia's war on Ukraine have shown the importance of not relying on imports when it comes to food.</p><p>\"We have such prime locations in Germany, France, and other countries - we can easily feed ourselves.\" (Julia Dahm | EURACTIV.de)</p><h>AUSTRIA</h><h>'People don't seem to want conventional farms anymore'. Agritourism is crucial for Austria's agriculture sector, with one-third of farms depending on hosting overnight guests for income, according to a December 2021 study commissioned by the Agriculture and tourism ministry.</h><p>Farmer Barbara Gartner, who specialises with her husband in growing Styrian oil pumpkins, wheat, soy and corn while combining it with a tourism offer, is building on the trust of holiday guests in their homemade products.\u00a0</p><p>For this reason, she is critical of the ban on a growing number of pesticides within the EU, since it would not only make harvesting more difficult but also jeopardise food security.\u00a0</p><p>\"On the one hand, we want to produce good, healthy food and also manage our soils optimally, but as farmers, we are becoming more and more restricted,\" Gartner told EURACTIV, adding that \"people don't seem to want conventional farms anymore\".\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, she emphasised that Austrian farmers often feel like supplicants, when in fact they make a significant contribution to society by contributing to the well-kept management of the landscape.</p><p>Explaining that most small farms are active on the alpine pastures due to climate and geographical conditions, being those who actually ensure biodiversity and species richness, Gartner called for policymakers to provide greater incentives in order to prevent small farmers from stopping their operations.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the lifting of trade restrictions on Ukrainian grain also causes great difficulty since the import of cheap Ukrainian grain affects domestic prices, Gartner explained.\u00a0</p><p>\"We produce according to strict regulations, and then products come to the European Union that are not obliged to have these regulations,\" she criticised, adding that this is \"simply injustice in competition\".\u00a0</p><p>For the same reason, Gartner does not support the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/eu-agri-ministers-push-back-against-mercosur-deal/\">much-criticised</url> free trade agreement between the European Union and the four Mercosur countries Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. (Chiara Swaton | EURACTIV.com)</p><h>SPAIN</h><h>'Less physical work than previous generations, but much more stress'.\u00a0\u00d3scar Moret manages a family farm in Arag\u00f3n, one of the most depopulated regions in Spain. He lives in Osso de Cinca, in the northeast of Spain, close to Catalonia, where he has a 32-hectare farm where he grows stone fruit and apples, as well as a pork farm with more than 540 pigs.</h><p>He is 48 years old and follows in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, who were both farmers.</p><p>For Moret, local secretary of the Spanish farmers' organisation UAGA-COAG in Huesca, ageing is one of the main problems for Spanish agriculture.\u00a0</p><p>Family and small farms are disappearing, while investment funds and large investors move in to take over Spanish food production, he underlines.</p><p>The work on his farm, he explains, \"has nothing to do\" with what his father did, now there is less physical work but much more stress.</p><p>In addition, when he was a child all those who worked on the farm were from the family, while now there is temporary labour there, foreign labourers, from Africa or Bulgaria, just like in the whole region.\u00a0</p><p>He believes that the CAP should increase the support to family and professional farming and to people living in rural areas. </p><p>He points out that, with the current design of CAP, a large amount of aid goes to companies that are not actually in the field. </p><p>He also advocates increasing support for young entrants into agriculture, because \"it is very difficult, nowadays\".\u00a0</p><p>For instance, he quotes that in Arag\u00f3n, with two past years of frost and the current year of drought, as many as three out of every five farmers will be lost. (EFE Agro)</p><h>ITALY</h><h>EU should act as a 'bridge' between farmers. From the enveloping, thick taste of oil to the beginning of a successful experiment to extract it in a circular and sustainable way. This is the journey of Adriana Angarano, a 33-year-old native of Bari, Puglia, in southern Italy. </h><p>Since 2017, she has been running a twenty-hectare farm called Tenuta Cesano and producing oil and natural cosmetic products in a circular economy production system. </p><p>Six years ago Angarano was still in the early days of her entrepreneurial activity. \"I took the reverse path, instead of the traditional one,\" she said.</p><p> After attending several product tasting sessions and connecting with farmers at events, she was convinced to turn some of the properties her family had since the 1990s into the starting point for Tenuta Cesano.</p><p>At some point, the young woman decided to devote herself to it almost full-time, in parallel with her work as a digital entrepreneur. After enrolling in agricultural classes and investing in more land, the 33-year-old's farm now has 20 hectares planted, organically, with olive trees, almonds and cherries.</p><p>For the first year, the company entered the market 'very well' thanks to innovative packaging and a good marketing operation. Then, thanks to a research project with the University of Bari on the study of polyphenols, molecules also contained in olives, and their para-pharmaceutical effects, her cosmetics line was born.</p><p>\"I have activated a circular economy process: with residues from oil processing, and leftovers from the previous year, when there are any, I make products for skin wellness\", Angarano says. Meanwhile, the waste water is used to irrigate the fields and other waste products are used as mulch for the soil.</p><p>Now Angarano's goal is to spread her sustainable approach in her community as well.\u00a0 Conversing with local farmers, however, is not always easy.</p><p> \"The biggest difficulty is its cost and the fact that the equipment is not readily available,\" she explained, adding that if farms and communities got together the expenses could be softened\" and the environmental impact of farming activities could be greatly reduced.</p><p>By encouraging collaboration between different companies, which already exists in some regions of northern Italy, one could, for example, access technologies to reduce water waste, \"such as sensors that indicate how much water is needed at a given point\", or put in place training courses on the most innovative practices.</p><p>Angarano took a lot of value from her travels around Europe and the US, where she learned about sustainable practices that other farmers are implementing - but she notes that not everyone has the opportunity to do this.\u00a0</p><p>The role of the EU, according to Angarano, should be that of a 'bridge' rather than a financier, bringing different agricultural realities closer together, locally and internationally, and enabling them to imagine an environmentally sustainable future together. (EURACTIV.it)\u00a0</p><h>POLAND</h><h>Imports from the East worry Polish apple growers. Poland is most known for its apple production, with the third largest production in the world.</h><p>One 53-year-old female orchardist, who spoke to EURACTIV.pl but preferred to remain anonymous, lives in one of the country's biggest orchard areas in Poland, 60 kilometres south-east of Warsaw, where she farms 10 hectares of apple orchards.</p><p>The European Green Deal is a source of concern for Polish small orchardists, she says, expressing concerns over potential restrictions on some chemicals that prove effective in fruit production.</p><p>For the farmer, the future of the sector will largely depend on the shape of the prices of products and productive factors, she adds.</p><p>Another concern relates to the increasing costs of production resulting from rising prices of fertilisers, chemical plant protection products, but also farm machinery necessary in food production and rising wages the labour force gets more expensive.</p><p>\"While the prices of fertilisers, among other things, may rise or not rise, the growth in salaries is stable, which makes labour more and more costly. At the same time, the prices for fruit are not increasing or they are even dropping.\"</p><p>To make things worse, the trade area for fruit is shrinking with Poland having lost its key markets for apples in recent years, mostly due to the embargo from Russia, which used to be a large importer of Polish apples. The war in Ukraine and cold political relations with Belarus do not help, either.</p><p>New markets are opening for Polish apples, including the Asia Pacific region and North Africa, but these are often unstable, she noted.\u00a0</p><p>What also worries Polish orchardists, including the one speaking to EURACTIV.pl, is the trend of rising import of fresh fruit and fruit concentrate to Poland, mainly from the East. Ukraine keeps setting new records in the export of apple concentrate, with Poland being its largest importer.</p><p>\"The prices are dictated by processing plants, which, having access to cheaper apple concentrate from Ukraine, are lowering prices for apples for industrial processing,\" the orchardist explains.</p><p>\"We, as the farmers, have no impact on price negotiations. We cannot withhold the sale of our products,\" pointing out that these imports do not have to comply with the EU's strict requirements.</p><p>The orchardist already knows she is the last generation in her family that is involved in farming, as she has no one to pass the farm to, as her children live in the city and are not involved in the agriculture business.</p><p>\"The young generation tends to back out of agriculture, which is no longer profitable. Also, it is very much based on physical labour and that does not attract young people either,\" she said. (EURACTIV.pl)</p><h>ROMANIA</h><h>Pioneer in regenerative agriculture in Romania. Alex Tudose, 34 years old, belongs to a new generation of farmers with great ambitions and, in the long term, aims to develop a network of regenerative farms that share an ethical system of food production and distribution with a positive impact on the environment and the economy.</h><p>He discovered his path, and his connection with nature, at 23 years old, when he discovered permaculture thanks to his travels around Europe and \"learned what it means to be a farmer\".\u00a0</p><p>\"I tried to be a farmer on my own in Romania, to sell vegetables. I succeeded to some extent. Then I have worked with the Permaculture Institute and things have evolved,\" Tudose told EURACTIV Romania.\u00a0</p><p>After meeting Ionut Badica, and - with the help of the Permaculture Research Institute of Romania - they created 'Soil and Soul', an innovation project in regenerative agriculture.\u00a0</p><p>'Soil and Soul' is a medium-scale, 6-hectare regenerative farm in the county of Dambovita, south of Romania, which is holistically designed and based on principles of regenerative agriculture and permaculture, which includes economic, ecological and socio-cultural ethics and design principles.\u00a0</p><p>The farm has a flexible number of seasonal workers and volunteers, and there is an educational module within the farm, for those who want to learn how to do regenerative farming.</p><p>\"Currently we sell everything that we're producing, but we need help,\" says Alex, noting that \"there's a lot of interest in organic farming\".</p><p>\"For me, agriculture - and especially regenerative agriculture - is a way of being free, some sort of ethical entrepreneurship. It's about being master of your time, doing things that are in line with some principles, without having to put your head down, being master of your own life\", Tudose explained.\u00a0</p><p>He says that asking for money only from the state is a very outdated view.</p><p>\"It's a bet and a risk for us as well. Personal life depends on the success of this farm. I suffered and I gained. But this farm is still our magnum opus,\" he said.</p><p>As for the European funds, he complained that there are no specific financing lines for small farmers who grow a wide variety of vegetables.\u00a0</p><p>\"Subsidies are given per hectare of tomatoes, but I may not have a hectare of tomatoes and I'm basically out of the scheme. We produce in one season almost all the varieties of vegetables that a vegetable shop can sell\", he explained, calling for more flexibility in funding options.</p><p>His message to Brussels: \"Farmers are not seen at the European level.\" The rules are made by non-farmers, he said, which creates 'conflict' between those who take the decisions and those who are supposed to enforce them. (Catalina Mihai/Iulian Ghervas | EURACTIV.ro)</p><h>BULGARIA</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'We have not inherited the land from our parents; we are borrowing it from our children'. \"</emphasis>My father was a farmer, and my son is a fifth-generation farmer. For us, farming is a tradition, not just a business,\" Aleksander Dimitrov from Brashlen, a small Bulgarian village in the northern part of the country near the Danube River, told EURACTIV.</p><p>Fifth-generation farmer is not a common phenomenon in Bulgaria, as the nationalisation of land during the totalitarian regime severed the connection to agriculture for multiple generations of Bulgarians.</p><p>Dimitrov, 50 years old, has been in agriculture for the past 27 years. He cultivates 13,000 acres of cereals and oilseed crops.</p><p>Additionally, he manages the cooperative in the village, taking charge of organising production, including machinery, agronomy, and technology.</p><p>However, he stands out as a non-traditional Bulgarian farmer due to his enthusiasm for new developments in agriculture. He speaks passionately about advancements such<br/>as innovative land cultivation techniques, the latest machinery, and precision farming.</p><p>Dimitrov heavily relies on precision planting, full sowing control, and the precise use of fertilisers. He uses selective plant spraying on his farm. Using camera technology, the sprayer can detect weeds among crops and spray only where needed.</p><p>\"Farmers cannot work with outdated machinery and outdated vision,\" he concluded.</p><p>Soon, the farmer will start testing precise spraying by drones on his fields. \"This is the future of agriculture,\" states Dimitrov, offering support for soil-friendly innovations in agriculture. His guiding principle: \"We have not inherited the land from our parents; we are borrowing it from our children.\"</p><p>The new machinery is highly efficient, enabling multiple operations to be carried out simultaneously. This not only reduces fuel consumption but also minimises harmful carbon dioxide emissions. The market launch of the autonomous tractor is not far away either, says Dimitrov.</p><p>When asked about his message to Brussels policymakers, Dimitrov emphasises the importance of tailoring rules to suit farmers and ensuring practical application.</p><p>He highlights the existence of conflicting rules that should complement each other and believes that certain rules are impractical and should not be universally applied.</p><p>\"Europe is not small, and the climate and soils vary across the continent. Farmers in Europe need rules that account for these specifics,\" Dimitrov said, urging policymakers to listen to farmers and adding he would be\"happy to have one on our farm\".</p><h>GREECE\u00a0</h><h>Young farmers discouraged by Greek state mechanism shortcomings. Ilias Moschotos, a 25-year-old farmer that cultivates table grapes in a village nearby Kavala, in the northern part of Greece, spoke to EURACTIV Greece about his concerns regarding the country's agricultural sector.</h><h>Moschotos obtained a diploma in plant production, specialised in viticulture, as an assistant agronomist and he has attended several state-funded seminars/courses. \"Otherwise, you can't do your job properly or you don't have access to several resources which are necessary,\" he explains.</h><p>Moschotos said he is 'very disappointed' with the current state of the agricultural sector, voicing frustrations that the existing payments system does not adequately support young farmers.</p><p>\"The state mechanism forces the farmer to pay compulsory crop insurance to the so-called fund ELGA, but it does not compensate you properly in case of damage to the crop. It also delays significantly issuing the announced aid programmes and finalise the payments to farmers,\" he stressed.</p><p>Another thorn in the Greek agricultural sector's side is the significant shortage of workers in combination with the massive exit of young farmers.</p><p>\"The state mechanism discourages young people from farming by the way it works,\" he observes, adding he is \"often discouraged when I see there is not substantial state support for the agricultural sector of my country\".</p><p>On top of that, Greek farmers, regardless of their age, must keep up with the new European regulations and the evolution of the primary sector globally; More than often new EU guidelines \"do not respond to the Greek reality at all\", Moschotos said.</p><p>EU restrictions over pesticides and table grapes export standards present increasing challenges and, as a result, producers often end up \"throwing away their crops each year\" the 25-year-old cultivator states.\u00a0</p><p>\"There are more and more plant diseases year after year, and we cannot face them with the EU-approved pesticides; they are either not strong enough, or they do not cover all diseases. We need more freedom in our job so we can make our income\", he says as a message to Brussels policymakers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Natasha Foote/Gerardo Fortuna/Nathalie Weatherald]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodnewsagrifoodspecialcapitalsbrieffacesoffarmers</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689Y-J3X1-JCMC-W11J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

At Nestl\u00e9, we firmly believe that an ESG strategy shouldn't stand apart but must essentially be intertwined with the company's overall business strategy. In fact, in our view, sustainability or ESG - we use the terms interchangeably - will be the only path to conducting business for the foreseeable future. We began embracing these concepts as early as the 90s, integrating them into a philosophy that transcends maximizing shareholder returns. We adopted a shared value approach, balancing profitability with positive community impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><excerpt><bodyText><p>At Nestl\u00e9, we firmly believe that an ESG strategy shouldn't stand apart but essentially be intertwined with the company's overall business strategy.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Could you elucidate how Nestl\u00e9 manages its financing and investment strategies to actively foster ESG objectives?</emphasis></p><p>In the shift from a linear to a circular economy, companies must invest, despite the costs. Passing on these costs to the consumer may not be viable or fair. Companies should take a lead in financing this transition, using innovative strategies and leveraging various mechanisms that are available to us.</p><p>In fact, in the current market, there are an array of tools that can be utilized to derive funds for such ventures, like green bonds and the voluntary carbon market, which can channel funds to projects aimed at reducing carbon footprints. In our case, we are focusing on long-term procurement strategies that can collaboratively improve the sustainability impact of our value chain and create a demand for sustainable materials, including recycled materials. What's clear is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It takes a multi-faceted approach that demands creativity and commitment from companies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the specific financial instruments or partnerships that the company is currently exploring or has already implemented?</emphasis></p><p>At this point, our approach to financing our sustainability initiatives is somewhat fluid and tailored to the unique demands of each project. As of now, we aren't leaning towards large-scale green financing to fuel our journey towards sustainability. Rather, our approach is more nuanced and individualized, with decisions being made on a case-by-case basis in consideration of the specific needs of our supply chain.</p><p>Our flexibility enables us to consider different strategies, including internal financing. We regard our sustainability initiatives as crucial investments, not costs. We prioritize directing resources to sustainable practices to protect and build resilience in the sourcing of our key ingredients. The best way to do this is promoting a regenerative way to farm and process them.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>At Nestl\u00e9, we firmly believe that an ESG strategy shouldn't stand apart but essentially be intertwined with the company's overall business strategy.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What recent transactions and investments reflect these commitments, especially in sustainable operations?</emphasis></p><p>Our focus on regenerative agriculture is not just a strategy, it's at the core of our vision and promise: to establish a regenerative food system at scale. We are at a crucial juncture in the wholescale transition towards a regenerative food system, in response to the rising global population\u00a0and the unsustainable methods used in conventional farming. It's crucial that we lead a collaborative shift in farming practices, uniting business partners, farmers, and even competitors. Our goal is to create a global, systematic change in agriculture, accounting for regional and commodity specific differences. By building strong relationships with our suppliers and setting new standards through individualized agreements, we aim to change the way that food ingredients are made, considering various geographical and commodity nuances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How does Nestl\u00e9 assess the return-on-investment potential of such sustainability initiatives?</emphasis></p><p>In the face of numerous competing initiatives and limited resources, selecting which projects to back financially is critical. Nestl\u00e9 sets aside a substantial budget every year to support this endeavor.</p><p>Our internal methodology enables us to support projects offering the most comprehensive benefits, not only in terms of carbon-emissions reduction but also positive social impact, including improved living conditions for communities involved. Our sustainability approach is multifaceted, incorporating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) elements. On this last element of governance, we put a special emphasis on crafting and leveraging appropriate regulatory frameworks for a lawful and effective transition. This is overseen diligently by our legal department to ensure success and adherence to the law.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>At Nestl\u00e9, we firmly believe that an ESG strategy shouldn't stand apart but essentially be intertwined with the company's overall business strategy.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How is the current emphasis on sustainability influencing investor relations?</emphasis></p><p>The corporate emphasis on sustainability has ignited a substantial transformation in operational processes. Investors are actively comparing the sustainability credentials of different companies before making investment decisions. This requires us to not only adopt sustainable practices but also to effectively communicate and report these efforts, showcasing our commitment to embracing a more sustainable and responsible business approach. It's a profound change, signaling a transformation in the way business processes are evolving due to the growing focus on sustainability</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What emerging issues in ESG finance do you anticipate affecting Nestl\u00e9's operations in the coming years?</emphasis></p><p>One clear trend is centered on reporting.\u00a0Regulations kicked off with an emphasis on reporting, forcing companies to gather and process non-financial information. This data, and its substantiation, is fast becoming as significant as financial reporting.</p><p>This shift has brought about a heightened level of transparency. In the past, while we were aware of our internal sustainability impact and risks, we now have an obligation to present them to the outside world in a serious and formal manner. Before stakeholders evaluate our performance, there's an essential need to elucidate that performance, which is where we are at the moment.</p><p>The next phase involves actively demonstrating our progress towards the ambitious goals we've set, like becoming GHG net zero by 2050, with the intermediate goal of cutting our carbon emissions by half by 2030.</p><p>These reductions will be made despite company growth, which makes these targets more challenging. Our holistic sustainability strategy ensures carbon reduction is a natural outcome as we move toward our ambition of a regenerative food system at scale.</p><p><excerpt><bodyText><p>At Nestl\u00e9, we firmly believe that an ESG strategy shouldn't stand apart but essentially be intertwined with the company's overall business strategy.</p></bodyText></excerpt></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What steps is Nestl\u00e9's legal team taking to adapt to the recent challenges and transformations?</emphasis></p><p>Our legal team is focusing on adapting to the evolving challenges by fostering a learning environment that enhances sustainability competencies across all our lawyers. Recognizing that sustainability expertise is crucial for offering sound legal advice, we are prioritizing education in this area to avoid future pitfalls. Furthermore, we are aiding the business in adopting a nuanced approach to sustainability, considering it a necessity given the increasing mandates and potential repercussions of non-compliance. Beyond mitigating risks, it's also about seizing opportunities. The contemporary consumer and investor landscape is gravitating towards more sustainable offerings. Hence, it's critical for the business to have a full understanding of these dynamics.</p><p>This strategy is geared towards ensuring long-term business resilience and compliance with emerging norms.</p><p>Interviewed by Aude Ghespi\u00e8re.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LLOENG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LLOENG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69B2-NFM1-JC8F-N17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442999</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Leaders League All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Leaders League Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28199\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 4, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001925</classCode><className>BUSINESS OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

Others, including from the EPP, have courageously spoken out in favour. Next week's vote looks to be on a knife edge.</p><p>We shouldn't be surprised that this proposal triggers strong feelings. It aims to cover at least 20% of the EU's land and sea by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. The 2030 target is actually less than was agreed at global talks in Montreal last year, where world leaders committed to putting nearly a third of the planet under protection in the same period.</p><p>Nevertheless, Europe's plan will touch the lives of millions, including the farming, fishing and forestry communities on the front line. It will require bold partnerships between growers, traders and retailers, all working with governments to transform Europe's food and agriculture industries. All at a time when the EU is trying to decarbonise its energy supply and lead the world to net zero. For some industries and communities, the pace of policy change emanating from Brussels feels overwhelming.</p><p>But challenging as it is, this is the reality we face. Nature and climate cannot be decoupled and we have to move swiftly on each, or fail on both. Nature is a tremendous ally in fighting global warming: in the last decade the world's oceans, plants, animals and soils absorbed <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?6811966/climate-nature-secret-ally\">over half</url> of man-made greenhouse gases. But we're trashing this ally and our twin nature and climate crises are now exponential, and fast outpacing our patchy and incremental solutions.</p><p>In June, the UK experienced yet another hottest month on record. At the same time, unprecedented numbers of dead fish floated down our rivers. How many more extreme weather events or biblical warnings will it take before we see the urgency of our situation? If we keep stalling the regulatory changes our world desperately needs because they are too ambitious, imperfect, or politically difficult, bluntly - we're all toast.</p><p>The Nature Restoration Law is not a perfect law: alone it won't catapult us to a new economic model which restores and replenishes Europe's ecosystems. But as any seasoned lawmaker or CEO will tell you, there is no such thing as a perfect proposal, and we should not let this become an excuse to give up. A vote to \"pause\" the law next week, as some are campaigning for, will be tantamount to killing it and putting Europe-wide progress on restoring nature far out of reach.</p><p>Delay is the new denial and we cannot keep endlessly destroying our environment, driving up emissions and kicking the policy can down the road. Far better that Europe's politicians keep us moving forward and use the current proposal as a launching pad for urgent reform.</p><p>Crucially farmers, fishers and foresters must be at the heart of this to ensure a just transition. We should understand why some want greater clarity over who will pay for the shift. They are the diligent stewards of our environment. They put food on our shelves and tables, increasingly in a global economy rocked by floods, droughts, war and inflation. They deserve a clear and firm commitment that improving their livelihoods will be of unwavering importance as we move ahead.</p><p>More broadly a clear European framework that gives governments and CEOs certainty over the rules and direction of travel will, in turn, help secure and stimulate the future investment that is needed from both sides. As the costs of nature loss and climate change become ever more real for our governments, we can expect growing political willingness to finance the transition.</p><p>In the private sector, the more responsible multinationals are already actively pushing regenerative agriculture in their value chains, including investing billions of euros to finance the transition for farmers and others. As these companies reap the benefits, the business case for such investment will become even clearer.</p><p>The immediate challenge is breaking the stalemate in a spirit of pragmatism and collaboration. The proposal on the table is workable and already commands a broad coalition of support among national governments.</p><p>Thousands of scientists, <url normalizedValue=\"https://gceurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youth-Position-on-EU-Nature-Restoration-Law-11-March-3.pdf\">organisations</url> representing millions of young people, <url normalizedValue=\"https://forumforag.com/article/madrid-call-to-action/\">farming</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://lifeplatform.eu/nature-in-the-balance-eus-nature-restoration-bill-hangs-by-a-thread/\">angling</url> groups, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://windeurope.org/newsroom/press-releases/nature-restoration-and-wind-energy-go-hand-in-hand/\">renewable energy sector</url> and business leaders and investors <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessfornature.org/messageeuleaders\">from over 70 major companies</url> have all come forward to back it.</p><p>Next week we have a historic opportunity, for Europe, for humanity and for our shared future on this wonderful planet.

It brought on a sudden sharp craving for a nice chunk of Cheddar, the fruit and the cheese together being a favorite after-school snack when I was growing up in Connecticut. This was an appropriate prompt, too, since I was on my way to a very privileged lesson in British farmhouse cheeses at the beginning of an eight-day, cheese-themed trip to London and Somerset run by the specialty tour company Cheese Journeys.       </p><p>My destination was the empyrean address for anyone who really loves best-quality British cheeses: the aging cellars of the Neal's Yard Dairy. Not normally open to the public, they occupy a set of soaring, neatly vaulted spaces created from four arches of a sturdy red brick Victorian railway viaduct. Here, along with the rest of my group of 18, I'd be getting a fascinating tutorial in both British cheeses and the cheese-mongering company that saved many of them from extinction. This trip was also a sort of homage to my paternal grandmother, since she'd been the one who'd first pricked my curiosity about cheese with her love of crumbly black-waxed extra-sharp New York cheddar.       </p><p>On this trip, I'd learn how these cheeses, especially Cheddar, are made and aged from the cheesemakers who produce mighty rounds on their farms in Somerset in the West Country.       </p><p>The hosts were also steeped in cheese: Anna Juhl, the founder of Cheese Journeys, and Laura Downey and Chris Palumbo from Fairfield &amp; Greenwich Cheese Company, a pair of cheese shops in those Connecticut towns. They were great company and a deep source of information about everything cheese during our days together.       </p><p>The journey had started earlier that day with a fascinating morning tour of Borough Market, one of the largest and oldest food halls in London, by the American-in-London guide and cookbook writer Cecilia Brooks. That had been followed by a superb picnic lunch of gigantic sausage roll sandwiches from the Ginger Pig, a stall in the market that specializes in free-range British meat and poultry and is well-known for its delicious sausages.       </p><p>Neal's Yard Dairy was founded by Randolph Hodgson in a ramshackle corner of London's Covent Garden in 1979, and it launched the renaissance in British farmhouse cheeses not only by creating a retail showcase for them, but also by building an efficient international distribution network, aging cellars and partnerships that have helped many British cheesemakers stay in business and thrive.       </p><p>Donning protective plastic bonnets, shoe caps and jackets, we began our tour of the aging cellars with Yvonne Yeoh, a charming Singaporean woman who lives between New York and London and is the sales director for Neal's Yard. The regular rumbling of trains overhead didn't distract us because what she had to say was so interesting.       </p><p>\"The human diet as we know it today began with fermented foods, notably cheese, bread, wine and beer. Fermented foods were the beginning of the gastronomic complexity we now rather feebly describe as 'delicious,'\" she said. \"Does anyone know how milk was preserved as a food before there was refrigeration?\" Ms. Yeoh scanned the crowd of shaking heads and blank faces. \"You made cheese!\" she said.       </p><p>We entered the first of the four aging cold rooms, and Ms. Yeoh explained that each has a different microbiome to favor the ripening of different types of cheese. \"Aging cheese is an art that involves both instinct and science,\" she said. \"So many factors come into play when you're aiming for optimum age, and this is why there are regular tastings.\"       </p><p>The last area of the tour was a towering larder of spruce shelves where imposing wheels of cheese were being flooded by a draft of cold air from a giant hood to help them achieve perfect flavor.       </p><p>At the end of the tour we sat down for a tasting of seven Neal's Yard cheeses, including a couple of surprisingly complex soft cheeses - Wigmore, a washed-curd ewe's-milk cheese made in Berkshire, and Elrick Log, a raw-goat's-milk cheese from Lanarkshire in Scotland. It was the long, thin, sunny triangle of Montgomery's Cheddar that stopped me in my tracks, though.       </p><p>Its pleasantly earthy barnyard flavor, with notes of mushrooms and broth and a long lingering finish, was the ringing apotheosis of Cheddar cheese, and its taste immediately became one I'd not only never forget but crave forever.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A manor fit for cheese</emphasis></p><p>The following morning, we left London by bus to go to North Cadbury in Somerset, in the West Country of England, where cheesemaker Jamie Montgomery makes this spectacular and very rare cheese with milk from his herd of some 200 mostly Friesian cows at Manor Farm.       </p><p>On the way out of London, Ms. Juhl, an Iowa native, explained the genesis of her travel business. She'd originally trained to be a nurse, but discovered her love of cheese after hiring a Swiss au pair in 1994. \"Katja introduced us to the wonders of fondue, raclette and other Swiss dishes, which changed our lives forever,\" Ms. Juhl said. When her husband, a bank auditor, was transferred to Salt Lake City in 1997, Ms. Juhl bought a cheese and specialty foods shop there.       </p><p>After moving to New York City in 2007, she missed having a hands-on relationship with cheese, so in 2013, she and her husband teamed up with Mr. George, Neal's Yard's veteran cheesemonger, and launched Cheese Journeys. Today, they run cheese-themed trips to Belgium, England, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland, with six trips planned for 2024.       </p><p>If a sudden and thrilling glimpse of Stonehenge first roused many of the drowsing travelers on our bus an hour and a half west of London, the crowd cooed in unison 30 minutes later when we arrived at North Cadbury Court, the magnificent country house that's been the seat of the Montgomery family for more than a century and which would be our home for the next six days.       </p><p>The sweeping lawn in front of the house had been mowed in a pattern of green stripes, which flattered its orange lichen-speckled Elizabethan facade. Parts of the house date back to the 1300s; the south side has an elegant Georgian facade and sweeping views of rolling countryside. Mr. Montgomery no longer lives in the house but has converted it into a rental property with 21 bedrooms, an indoor pool and Jacuzzi, a gym, a snooker room and other amenities. My room, the Oak Room, came with a four-poster bed, a soaking tub in a large windowed alcove and original Tudor moldings on the ceiling, but my favorite room was the library, with its original edition of \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" by Rudyard Kipling, volumes of poetry by Keats and Shelley and a shelf full of Anthony Trollope.       </p><p>\"Owning the castle, which is what I call staying at a house like this one, creates an easygoing house-party experience guests enjoy,\" Ms. Juhl said that night while we were having drinks before dinner in the baronial oak-paneled North Hall. The arrangement also allowed Ms. Juhl to put her preferred private chef, the exceptionally talented Frenchman Sylvain Jamois, in the estate's kitchen. These meals were a highlight of our trip, too, since Mr. Jamois has a superb mastery of British country-house cooking, food you rarely find in restaurants, including handmade pies, potted prawns and gorgeous roasts, including a whole roasted suckling pig.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biology, chemistry, craft</emphasis></p><p>When he came to fetch half of us for a personal tour of his farm and dairy the next morning, Mr. Montgomery had straw on his sweater that established his credentials as a farmer, and his easy smile and slightly bashful manner immediately put us at ease. As we walked by his farm, he gestured at his cow-dotted pastures and said, \"Our job is to try and get the taste of all of this into our cheese.\"       </p><p>He added: \"The French call it terroir, the whole idea that something can only come from one place, but I call it common sense and respecting nature.\"       </p><p>While we donned protective gear - hairnets, shoe caps and white-fabric jackets in his messy office, Mr. Montgomery told us the history of his family's 112-year-old dairy. Then he showed us how Cheddar is made.       </p><p>Standing around the oblong stainless-steel-lined vat - where the morning's pale yellow milk was being stirred by two mechanical arms to begin forming curds - was like some sort of communion. Next, the curds were separated from the whey and churned by hand by the cheesemakers, before being cheddared, or allowed to coagulate. The curds were then cut into rectangular sheets that were shredded, salted and fitted into Cheddar molds to be pressed overnight. The new cheeses were then wrapped in cotton muslin, which is why they're called clothbound, and smeared with lard (to encourage the growth of healthy mold and help the cheese to retain moisture) before being brought to aging cellars.       </p><p>After a morning of following the cheese-making process, a triptych of biology, chemistry and craft, we returned to the manor house in silence, humbled by the beauty of such vital and physically exhausting work.       </p><p>In addition to hands-on visits with cheesemakers, the trip included a session on painting still-lifes, with Mike Geno, an artist whose main subject is cheese; a food-themed tour of the nearby city of Bath; classes in savory-pie-making and cheese-board building; a guided whisky tasting; a cheese-and-cider pairing session; and a gala dinner, including cheese tasting, with some of the most famous artisanal cheesemakers in Britain. (Who knew that the best blue cheese in the U.K. is called Stitchelton and is made by an American guy named Joe Schneider?)       </p><p>Ultimately, I liked the farm visits best, because it was so interesting to see how every farmer and cheesemaker had his or her own style. At Westcombe Dairy, the father-and-son team Richard and Tom Calver have converted their farm to regenerative agriculture, a term that describes farming and grazing practices which are meant to actually improve the land.       </p><p>The Calvers also favor leaving nature pretty much to its own devices in their pastures, \"because the more diverse the plants the cows graze on, the richer the flavor palate of the cheese,\" explained Tom Calver, who trained as a chef and worked in London before coming home and becoming a cheesemaker.       </p><p>\"But we're not against innovation either,\" he said with a grin when he led us into the dairy's maturing cellars, where a Cheddar-turning robot, nicknamed Tina the Turner, has taken over the backbreaking work of shifting the heavy rounds of cheese as they age.       </p><p>We tasted the cheese over a picnic lunch of salads and charcuterie with deliciously hoppy suds from a local craft beer brewer called the Wild Beer Company. \"Alec, how would you describe the Westcombe Cheddar?\" one of the cheesemongers from Connecticut asked me. I replied that it had a somewhat less formal flavor than Montgomery Cheddar, with an occasional whiff of herbaceousness and notes of hazelnut, caramel and citrus.       </p><p>\"Nice!\" she replied. A memory of my paternal grandmother moved in my head, of the day her elaborate description of the taste of a piece of Cheddar from upstate New York sent my brother and I into a gale of giggles. \"Someday after you've learned how to express taste, you'll find there are few subjects more worthy than a good piece of Cheddar,\" she said with a raised eyebrow.       </p><p>Fifty years later, I learned that she was right.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If You Go</emphasis></p><p>Cheese journeys has six trips scheduled for 2024, including a British Cheese Odyssey: London, Somerset and Bath, which runs from Oct. 6 to Oct. 13, 2024.

The farm has managed to reduce plant protection inputs by as much as a third, while fertilisation has dropped by 20% and tractor interventions by 30%.</p><p>The approach has the added bonus of a slightly reduced workload, exemplifying the 'work smarter, not harder' concept.</p><p>And yet, the approach remains pragmatic. The farm grows crops both organically and conventionally side by side and is low-till rather than no-till.</p><p>In this way, they get the best of both worlds, Christophe explains. \"You can be a bad organic farmer or a good conventional farmer,\" he points out, envisioning a future where the two systems 'merge' - or at least are able to be inspired one by the other.</p><p>In doing so, the farm is the living embodiment of the idea of 'breaking silos', so often bandied around in Brussels, but so rarely acted upon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the farm thinks in generations, rather than harvest cycles.</p><p>\"My dad planted it, I'm looking after it but probably my children will be the ones to harvest it,\" Christophe said of the agroforestry plantation.</p><p>It begs the question; what would happen if politicians thought in generations rather than election cycles?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Natasha Foote\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/subscribe-to-the-agrifood-brief/\">Subscribe to EURACTIV's Agrifood Brief</url>, where you'll find the latest roundup of news covering agriculture and food from across Europe.

She reads Tarot cards and energies and offered to assess me, hovering her hands over my body, starting with my head.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Wow, you have a lot going on there,\" she said. Her hands then hovered over my heart. \"Here is a strong center of energy also - your love for your family and friends.\" After moving her hands lower, she said, \"From the waist downward I'm detecting no sign of energy. Nothing.\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was 45, stable professionally and personally, married with two children. But my husband, Colin, a writer and professor of English literature, was 34 years older than me. I had fallen for him so utterly when he was my landlord almost two decades before that I had given up the sunshine and wildlife of Africa to settle with him in London.       </p><p>Now he was turning 80, and our age gap was showing. However fit and healthy he was, no one can evade biological aging. Our love was strong, but our sexual relationship had ended.       </p><p>My friend's assessment saddened me, like something in me was dead. But you can't have everything. Colin and I had a rare intellectual compatibility that we always called, from Shakespeare, a \"marriage of true minds.\" I valued our life together so much that I believed I had come to accept the absence of a physical relationship.       </p><p>Until I went to a class called \"How to Have Better Conversations\" one night, a week before Christmas, and a tall, attractive stranger asked if he could sit next to me. I noticed there were rows of empty seats all around. I said yes.       </p><p>During the class, the presenter emphasized how boring it was when people meet someone new and say, \"What do you do?\" He ended the class with a thought-provoking question: \"What conversation are you <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> having, and with whom?\"       </p><p>After the class, the attractive stranger - Richard - invited me for a drink. He suggested we implement something from the class and not ask, or tell, each other what we do.       </p><p>That seemed to me a fun experiment. He was not based in London. We exchanged email addresses.       </p><p>Richard and I started emailing each other daily. He was a bit younger than me, and a full 40 years younger than Colin. He had never married or had children. He said we could be friends.       </p><p>But when we met again, we kissed. A long dormant energy stirred. I realized I could no longer ignore this side of life. I had to talk to Colin. This was the difficult, painful conversation I had not been having.       </p><p>What happens in wildlife, when the male primate or elephant or lion ages? A younger rival contests him for his place with the female, and they fight, even to the death. Or the elder is ousted from the group and wanders off alone. The difference with humans is that we can have conversations about these things. We can make unique decisions.       </p><p>Colin and I agreed our main values were to continue sharing our lives and to keep our family intact, both wanting to maintain daily co-parenting of our children. But we agreed that I could, discreetly, cease being sexually faithful to the sexless marriage.       </p><p>Richard and I became lovers. A thrilling, midlife, erotic reawakening unfolded. We would meet up late at night in my office, after everyone else in the building had gone, and make love until dawn. We still did not tell each other our careers (although my office offered clues).       </p><p>One day Richard proposed to me hypothetically: If I were free to marry him, would I?       </p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"I would.\"       </p><p>Eventually, we arranged for Richard to come to our house to meet Colin and the children, as a friend. Two weeks later, Richard had a conference to attend in London.       </p><p>\"Now that Richard has met the family,\" I said to Colin, \"could he stay in our guest room while in London?\"       </p><p>The next day I was out in the garden with friends when we decided to order a late-lunch pizza delivery. I went into the house to call Colin to join us. To my shock, I found him in a darkened room, still in bed, at 2 p.m. I had never seen him like this before. Suffering.       </p><p>\"This is all going so fast,\" he said. \"I've only just met Richard and now you're asking if he can stay as a guest in the house.\"       </p><p>\"Do you need me to stop seeing him?\"       </p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"I am the past, Richard is the future. Promise me that if you're thinking of leaving him, you will first discuss it with me?\"       </p><p>Colin was thinking ahead, to a time when our family would be without him. It's like he was making a succession plan. Through tears, I nodded.       </p><p>Richard and I agreed the time had come - eight months since we had met - to finally tell each other what we do.       </p><p>\"Rather than tell you,\" he said, \"I want to show you.\"       </p><p>Early one morning he picked me up and drove to the countryside. He stopped the car by a field. \"This is what I do,\" he said.       </p><p>I was baffled.       </p><p>\"I'm an agronomist,\" he said, explaining that he advises farmers on how to use their land, what crops to grow and how to care for them.       </p><p>More than that, he specializes in regenerative agriculture. When establishing a new crop, instead of using toxic chemicals to destroy all that went before, he grows different crops simultaneously, sharing the same field, acting as companions, providing benefit to each other rather than threat. It's a systemic approach that goes against tradition, and people may greet it with prejudice and challenge, not understanding, and taking a long time to accept it.       </p><p>When I started telling family and friends about me and Richard, I also met with prejudices and challenges. Some were devastated, warning that this could harm our children, and that I was risking everything for a stranger.       </p><p>\"You don't know him at all,\" one friend said. \"There's a saying in Italy that you don't know someone until you've eaten a kilo of salt with them. Which takes a very long time. A whole kilo of salt!\"       </p><p>After I told Richard about this, he bought me a kilo of salt and said, \"Let's start sharing this, and once we have finished it, no one will be able to say we don't know each other.\"       </p><p>One night in our favorite restaurant, he seemed preoccupied. I said, \"What's the conversation you're not having?\" He told me how painful it was for him to always feel on the outside of my family life with Colin and the children. They came first for me, and he had no secure place for himself.       </p><p>I knew it was time for me to have another difficult conversation with Colin.       </p><p>I explained Richard's perspective and insecurity. Colin had a legal bond with me (our marriage) and a biological one (our children). Richard had neither. What could we offer Richard to prove to him - and the people in his life, like his parents - that he was not being kept on the outside?       </p><p>Colin and I acknowledged we would always have our children and our \"marriage of true minds,\" regardless of whether we were legally married. Richard's place would be secured if he could marry me. Everything could stay as it was, but we agreed that Colin and I would legally divorce. Divorce was only a piece of paper.       </p><p>In the UK then, no-fault divorce did not yet exist. One party had to petition for divorce against the other; it couldn't be a joint application reflecting a mutual decision. And Colin couldn't cite my adultery as grounds for divorce, because if you continued living with your spouse beyond six months after the adultery was known, you were legally taken as having accepted it.       </p><p>\"Accuse me of unreasonable behavior then,\" Colin said. \"I've certainly done something incredibly unreasonable - I've gotten old!\"       </p><p>But there was another hitch. By law, every permissible reason for divorce was based on the same condition - that the two spouses \"can no longer tolerate living together.\"       </p><p>Colin and I were still living together, although in separate bedrooms, and we wanted that to continue. The lawyers I consulted said that would not be possible. I decided to represent myself in the case instead and succeeded; our request was granted.       </p><p>Richard moved in, and three years after we met, he and I began planning our wedding. All five of us were living together companionably, giving benefit to each other, not threat. Friends and family gradually accepted our unusual situation.       </p><p>And that year at our Christmas Eve party, hosted by Colin and Richard and me, we gathered around the turkey and scattered on it the last few grains of our kilo of salt.       </p><p>Sonja Falck is a psychotherapist and university lecturer in London and the author of three books.       </p><p>Modern Love can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:modernlove@nytimes.com\">modernlove@nytimes.com</email></p><p>To find previous Modern Love essays, Tiny Love Stories and podcast episodes, visit our archive.       </p><p>Want more from Modern Love?

And while there's still debate over environmental and health impacts, the herbicide has certainly proven itself a toxic topic for yet another German government.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the Commission's appeal committee on Thursday (16 November), EU member states' representatives re-voted on the EU executive's proposal to allow glyphosate on the European market beyond the expiry of the current authorisation in December.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just as in the first round of voting in October, there was neither a so-called qualified majority in favour of re-authorisation nor against it, leaving the final decision up to the Commission -\u00a0 which immediately declared its intention to proceed with the approval.</p><p>\"The Commission - based on comprehensive safety assessments carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), together with EU Member States - will now proceed with the renewal of the approval of glyphosate for a period of 10 years,\" the EU executive said in a statement.</p><p>Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in the EU. While the two EU authorities EFSA and ECHA did not find any \"critical\" concerns about the authorisation of the active ingredient in their reports, critics warn of risks to nature and health, and point to data gaps in EFSA's assessment.</p><p>The passionate division between defenders and opponents of glyphosate also runs right through the German government: Even though Green agriculture minister Cem \u00d6zdemir sharply criticised the re-approval, his ministry was forced to abstain on the vote due to the opposition of his liberal coalition partner, the FDP.</p><p>In a statement, \u00d6zdemir admitted that he would have liked to vote \"no,\" and called the Commission's decision to go ahead with the re-approval \"eye-rubbing\".</p><p>On the opposing side, FDP MP Carina Konrad welcomed the Commission's push and told Euractiv that glyphosate is important as \"part of the building blocks of sustainable agriculture\", as long as \"there is no better alternative on the market\".</p><p>It is not the first time that glyphosate has harmful side effects for a German coalition.</p><p>Back in 2017, conservative then-agriculture minister Christian Schmidt committed a major affront against his coalition partners at the time, the Social Democrats (SPD), when he voted for the re-approval of glyphosate despite the SPD being against it.</p><p>This was a blatant breach of the government's rules of procedure, which state that Berlin will abstain on EU decisions in case of disagreement in the coalition.</p><p>While it did not come that far this time round, and \u00d6zdemir played by the rules, the coalition's failure to find an agreement comes at a cost.</p><p>First, it is only the latest in a series of issues on the EU level on which Germany is paralysed by internal discord (think, for instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/berlin-split-on-gene-editing-ahead-of-commission-proposal/\">of new genomic techniques</url>) - not a good look for the bloc's most populous member state.</p><p>And secondly, the extension of the authorisation also raises questions about the legal situation within Germany.</p><p>In the coalition agreement, the coalition parties had agreed to take glyphosate \"off the market\" from the end of 2023. However, the legal scope for a national ban is very limited as long as the active ingredient is authorised at the EU level.</p><p>According to \u00d6zdemir, the ministry will now examine what options remain at the national level - but even if he finds a way, managing to 'round-up' the dispersed voices within the coalition will not be an easy task.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Julia Dahm</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/subscribe-to-the-agrifood-brief/\">Subscribe to EURACTIV's Agrifood Brief</url>, where you'll find the latest roundup of news covering agriculture and food from across Europe.

In the event that the committee responsible \"fails to respect\" the exclusive competence of the associated committee, that associated committee may table amendments directly in plenary.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, the groups are also getting in on the amendment action, with Renew, EPP and Socialists all busy adding their flavours to the proposal - with one source saying that the Spanish Presidency is also playing a key role behind the scenes pushing the Parliament's proposal towards the Council's via Spanish MEP Clara Aguilera.\u00a0</p><p>The key amendments to watch are: the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">timeline</emphasis> of the proposal (2030 or 2035); the use of pesticides in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">sensitive areas</emphasis>; and the length permitted for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">derogations</emphasis> (which may change from 60 days to 120 days).\u00a0</p><p>There's also a risk that there are <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">too many amendments</emphasis> - meaning there's a slim chance that the proposal could be <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">sent back to the committee stage</emphasis> for a reshape. According to the Parliament's agriculture press officer, the threshold for this is <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">50 amendments</emphasis> - but the number has already surpassed 200, with space for more as the deadline for split amendments is Monday.\u00a0 While the source thought the move unlikely, they warned it is \"possible\".\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, on the Council side, the Spanish Presidency put a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">new proposal</emphasis> on the table at a working group meeting at the end of last week in hopes of finding some common ground.</p><p>The draft text, seen by Euractiv, weakens the proposed limitation on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">use of pesticides in sensitive areas</emphasis>, and also proposes to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">scrap a reference to national targets</emphasis> following calls from some member states earlier this month.\u00a0</p><p>But the attempt was <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">unsuccessful</emphasis>, according to sources inside the closed meeting, who told Euractiv that the new text \"did not bring member states closer together\".

The scale of the risk to businesses from climate change, water insecurity and deforestation can no longer be ignored, and we know the opportunities of action far outweigh the risks of inaction. Leadership from the private sector is essential for securing global ambitions for a net-zero, nature positive and equitable world.

As of the end of 2023, 91.9% of the electricity in its global manufacturing sites was from renewable sources. The goal is to reach 100%.</p><p>The company is additionally continuing to reduce its value chain emissions (Scope 3).

European Carbon Farmers is an organisation promoting carbon farming practices in Poland and developing agricultural carbon payment mechanisms.</p><p>\"Appropriate use of regenerative farming methods - and in particular understanding of how nature's cycles work, including the carbon cycle - means that at some point the system becomes organic, meaning not using artificial methods for production,\" Ciasnocha told EURACTIV Poland.</p><p>He added that not enough farmers are aware that their farm is a part of the whole ecosystem. \"Every farmer is a carbon farmer, whether he realises it or not.\"</p><p>\"The best example is that our agriculture still relies heavily on tillage, which is a practice that has a very negative impact on the carbon cycle,\" he stressed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is carbon farming likely to develop in Poland?</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Jerzy Plewa, former head of DG AGRI at the European Commission and Team Europe expert, told EURACTIV Poland the support for carbon farming will grow, among other reasons, because 40% of the new Common Agricultural Policy's (CAP) budget should be allocated to pro-climate measures.</p><p>According to Plewa, carbon farming marks a return to the good practices of the past, but with a scientific approach that reinforces the positive impact of these practices on the soil.</p><p>\"In the long run, farmers will benefit from improved soil quality, improved production performance and greater resilience,\" he noted.</p><p>The implementation of carbon farming practices may imply the need for new investments. Plewa stressed that the additional costs for farmers are compensated under the CAP.</p><p>But farmers are not rewarded depending on the amount of carbon stored.</p><p>Plewa explained that pilot programmes have so far been launched in Europe which aim to reward farmers for tons of carbon sequestered in the soil. According to him, farmers will soon be additionally rewarded for practices based on regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"A necessary step for carbon farming in the EU will be the establishment of a legal framework for certification of sustainable carbon removal from natural ecosystems. The Commission is currently working on a draft regulation on carbon farming, and the certification mechanism is to be proposed by 2023,\" he noted.</p><p>Plewa also said Poland's CAP Strategic Plan draft provides eco-schemes typical of carbon farming, such as \"simplified farming systems, diversification of crop structures and compliance with fertilisation plans\".</p><p>The Polish expert also insisted on the need to properly inform farmers about this opportunity. \"The implementation of ambitious environmental-climate programs requires constant improvement of farmers' knowledge, as well as wide support from professional advisory services, which is insufficient in our country\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CAP holds the carbon farming key</emphasis></p><p>Plewa said Poland could make use of the CAP, which includes many possibilities to support pro-ecological and pro-climate measures, especially under the second pillar, in rural areas.</p><p>\"These funds support organic farming and agri-environmental programmes, which are not commonly referred to as carbon farming, but contribute to absorbing CO2 from the air and storing it in the soil\".</p><p>However, Plewa criticised the fact that despite having the biggest budget in the EU for the rural development pillar, Poland does not fully exploit the opportunities provided in the CAP.</p><p>\"It allocates fewer funds for organic farming and ambitious agri-environmental programmes and spends large sums on other objectives,\" he concluded.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic,

Two Swiss courts had dismissed the lawsuit.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Late last month, as the European court took up the case, a crowd of silver-haired women, who call themselves the Association of Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection, gathered outside the courthouse in Strasbourg, France, waving flowers, blowing bubbles and ringing cowbells. When I saw a picture of them, I smiled in recognition. That is the typical way we grandmothers act to protect our ecosystem, with joy, pizazz and kindness. By grandmothers, I mean all those older women who care about others.        </p><p>I am in a group called Guardians of the Aquifer. We formed 13 years ago to stop the Keystone XL pipeline from coming through Nebraska, our home, and much to our surprise, the company canceled the project in 2021. Since then, we have undertaken various projects including trying, though failing, to stop the construction of a huge chicken processing plant because of its risks for disease and pollution. We've worked for clean energy, better environmental legislation and the election of candidates who will govern in ways that ameliorate climate change. Most of our members are older women.       </p><p>Action can come from love or anger. Older women know that leading with love is the most effective approach. For example, our group organized a \"thank you in advance\" campaign to encourage our governor at the time, Dave Heineman, to stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Every Monday for weeks, we took the governor wildflower bouquets, artworks and homemade muffins, all with accompanying letters. We have called news conferences to present cheddar-crust apple pies, warm from the oven, to legislators who made good decisions regarding our state's resources. These actions seem soft, but they were surprisingly effective in encouraging lawmakers to work for our causes.       </p><p>Of course, in the environmental movement, there are many fine men, including my friend Bill McKibben, a founder of the climate group 350.org., but women have led the way. Consider Rachel Carson, the author of \"Silent Spring,\" which led to tighter control of pesticides; Jane Goodall, the chimpanzee researcher and conservationist; Winona LaDuke, the Native American economist and activist; Wangari Maathai, winner of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize for her environmental work in Africa; and Berta C\u00e1ceres, who was assassinated in Honduras for her efforts to protect Indigenous land.       </p><p>The environmental activist Joanna Macy has worked much of her long life on what she calls \"the work that reconnects.\" That work involves despair and empowerment workshops for groups all over the world. Her model of training is the best I know for transforming grief, anger and helplessness into action and empowerment. Of our current crisis, Ms. Macy has said, \"The darker the circumstance, the more brilliant the invitation.\"       </p><p>Many women in my community are working on environmental causes. After her son was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal illness that led to her becoming more aware of contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, Susan Seacrest created the Groundwater Foundation. Janece Mollhoff, a retired Army colonel and nurse, serves on a public power board making sure that we close our coal plants and move toward clean energy. Others campaign to reduce plastics, to educate Nebraskans about the Omaha Nation's ways of caring for the land and to develop a climate action plan for Lincoln, the city where I live. This is just a sampling. Many more women work on regulations for industrialized livestock operations and industrial agriculture and on promoting regenerative agriculture, community crops gardens and protecting our few remaining unplowed prairies.       </p><p>The same nature that leads us to rock the babies and volunteer for Meals on Wheels leads us to care for the earth. We are empathic in the broadest sense. We care for all who suffer, whether that is a child, an aquifer, a polar bear or a forest.       </p><p>We are joyful but serious, and by our 60s, we have accumulated decades of life skills. We are patient, persistent, connected and fierce in our defense of the vulnerable. Like grandmothers for hundreds of thousands of years, we know our job is to love and protect all children now and for generations to come.       </p><p>Old women are not threatening, but we are powerful. Female leaders multitask and make connections to other groups and causes. Indigenous people's rights, social justice, local control of food and energy, and democracy are all part of one great cause - the respect for and preservation of all life. We are the mother trees in the forest, nurturing all our surroundings.       </p><p>We are informed about climate change. We know that it makes no sense to put money into college funds or save family heirlooms if our grandchildren will live on a planet with polluted air, land and water, and face unbearable temperatures and constant catastrophic storms. To secure our grandchildren's future, we must stop the burning of fossil fuels, plant trees, clean up our planet and protect biodiversity.       </p><p>The antidote to our despair about our grandchildren's future is action. It gives us hope and solidarity. Saving Mother Earth and savoring her bounties are not polarities but deeply related. It is our joy and wonder that gives us the strength to do the hard work.       </p><p>Our planet's environmental crisis calls for us to transform our fundamental relationships between self and others. As we work on keeping the earth viable, we learn that there is no us and no them. We are interconnected in every possible way.       </p><p>I hope the Swiss women will inspire all of us to unite to save not only our grandchildren but all the grandchildren of the world, as well as the grandchildren of the fox and the frog, the narwhal and the bluebird.       </p><p>Mary Pipher is a clinical psychologist and the author, most recently, of \"A Life in Light: Meditations on Impermanence.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Because these committed chefs use cooking not as an art form, but rather as a means to change society, whether on an environmental or social level.\u00a0</p><p>Take the 2022 winner. Originally from Sierra Leone, Fatmata Binta was born into the Fulani, the largest nomadic tribe in Africa. After a career in international relations, the young woman decided to devote herself fully to the recognition of her culture. She created Fulani Kitchen, a concept of pop-up restaurants that invite customers to take off their shoes and eat with their fingers to discover the customs of the Fulani people. On the menu are West African ingredients such as millet, dawadawa, egusi, okra and baobab. Fatmata Binta has also launched a foundation in Ghana that gives women the opportunity to own land. They can also grow and sell fonio, a herbaceous plant common in West Africa.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rethinking tomorrow's world through cooking</emphasis></p><p>The Basque Culinary Center, which launched this \u20ac100,000 prize, explains that it is envisioning cooking as a means to advance society in areas ranging from social innovation to food education. This is the underlying premise of this international award that has earned the nickname of the \"Nobel Prize of Gastronomy,\" since its launch in 2016, supported by world-renowned chefs such as Spain's Joan Roca and the Peruvian chef Gaston Acurio.</p><p>A major concern in public health issues, food education is one of the themes widely reflected by the Basque Culinary World Prize winners. Last year, the organization shone the spotlight on the foundation of the Spanish chef Xanty Elias, whose objective is to teach new generations how to compose healthy menus. An initiative that is particularly important in a country where childhood obesity is a serious problem, with more than 23% of children aged six to nine years overweight and 17.3% obese, according to a 2019\u00a0study.</p><p>The Basque World Culinary Prize also highlights the urgent need to reduce the carbon footprint our food consumption leaves on the planet. In this sense, the 2019 award saluted the work of the Californian chef Anthony Myint, who is behind the \"ZeroFoodPrint\" initiative. This involves collecting 1% from diners' checks in restaurants adhering to the system. The funds are donated to farmers to help them implement environmentally friendly practices -- the goal is to encourage the deployment of regenerative agriculture, an agricultural concept echoing permaculture that encourages producers to prefer farming and grazing practices that allow the carbon dioxide contained in the atmosphere to be stored in the soil.</p><p>With each edition of the award, winners are chosen by a panel of chefs whose high-profile careers have become a reference for all generations. This year, for example, Dominique Crenn, Michel Bras, Mauro Colagreco, Enrique Olvera, are all judges</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65RP-8PN1-F19C-X1H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>TOURISM</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 21, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

Going forward, the Bregal Sphere platform will look to deploy targeted capital to help address key societal and environmental challenges in a responsible and sustainable way.</p><p>About PUR Projet</p><p>PUR Projet (\"PUR\") is a leading international developer of high-quality nature-based solutions (\"NbS\") projects, with a 14-year track record of field-based project development.

Current investment in solutions for preserving nature stands at around 0.10% of global GDP, amounting to around $133 billion.\u00a0</p><p>\"Biodiversity loss is already costing the global economy 10% of its output each year. If we do not sufficiently finance nature-based solutions, we will impact the capacities of countries to make progress on other vital areas such as education, health and employment. If we do not save nature now, we will not be able to achieve sustainable development,\" said UNEP Executive Director, Inger Andersen.</p><p>She continues: \"The report is a wake-up call for governments, financial institutions and businesses to invest in nature -- including reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and restoration of our Ocean.\"</p><p>Among the examples of investment required, the study mentions the management, conservation and restoration of forests.

Currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of +4.2% on the group's growth this year, with a significant appreciation of the US dollar and more notably the Russian ruble.</p><p>Current operating profitability increased by +24.8% on a reported basis and +26.9% on a like for like basis<sup>(</sup><sup>1)</sup>, with the current operating margin of 2.7%, higher than the communicated guidance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key figures</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Message from Xavier</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unkovic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- Chief Executive Officer:</emphasis></p><p>\"In an environment of a widespread inflation and where strong geopolitical tensions remain in certain regions where the group operates, the diversity of our activities (long-life, fresh and processed), our production and sales regions, distribution channels (retail, food service) and our products either branded or private label enabled the Bonduelle Group to post a growth in both revenue and current operating income.Financial year 2023-2024 starts in a climate of significant deconsumption, fuelled by still important inflation. More than ever, our ability to innovate and offer product differentiation through strong and accessible brands will be key elements in the necessary recovery of the group's profitability. \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activity by Geographic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Region</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activity by Operating Segments</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe Zone</emphasis></p><p>The Europe Zone, representing 62.7% of the business activity in FY 2022-2023, recorded a very strong revenue growth of +11.1% on reported figures and +11.6% on like for like basis<sup>(</sup><sup>1)</sup>.</p><p>All technologies reported growth in value over the year, despite Quarter 4 marked by a downturn in retail.</p><p>For the long life segment, canned-brand activities posted a drop in volume, but maintained their market share in declining markets, while the group private labels activities experienced a more limited decline, enabling them to meet the expectations of the various market segments. Driven by the year's innovations, the frozen activity posted a growth in volume. Price increases, made necessary by the rise in various cost items, supported growth in value. The food service activity, mainly frozen, confirmed its dynamism over the whole year, with a growth in volume, reinforced in value by price increases.</p><p>More sensitive to the consumer environment, the fresh processed segment in retail also contributed to overall growth in value, with sales sustained by a good performance in fresh prepared activity, with growth in volume thanks to the success of innovations and favorable weather conditions, on the other hand, the fresh cut salads showed a sharper decline.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-Europe Zone</emphasis></p><p>The revenue of the Non-Europe Zone, representing 37.3% of the business activity over FY, recorded a growth of +6.3% on reported figures and -5.8% on a like for like basis<sup>(</sup><sup>1)</sup>.</p><p>In North America, the downturn in the fresh processed segment remained marked in retail, due to an unfavorable market trend returning to pre-Covid levels, an agronomic crisis linked to a plant disease that affected the entire sector, and the residual impact of the previous year's loss of references; the price rises made necessary by cost increases did not offset the volume declines recorded. As in the Europe Zone, the dynamic remains encouraging in the food service activity, with growing markets and the conquest of new customers.The reorganization of our sales teams, the overhaul of our commercial policy, the outcome of recent negotiations, the relaunch of our innovation policy and the stabilization of markets should enable us to achieve a recovery in sales volumes in the future.</p><p>In the Eurasia zone, the canned activity, which is predominant in this area and impacted by the geopolitical context, posted an overall decline in volume, with the Globus brand preserving the brand's significant market share in this region. The frozen activity, which is more marginal, posted for its part a significant decline. For safety reasons, the Russian frozen plant in Belgorod has been shut down for the 2023 harvest, with the processing activity being outsourced during this period.</p><p>The export activity of the group also suffered the consequences of the inflationary and geopolitical environment, with heightened competition in certain regions with limited purchasing power and major delivery constraints, while continuing to expand with the introduction of Bonduelle's range of frozen products in Israel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">profitability</emphasis></p><p>For fiscal year 2022-2023, the Bonduelle Group's current operating profitability stands at (EURO) 65.9 million at constant exchange rates compared to (EURO) 52.8 million for the previous fiscal year, i.e., a current operating margin of 2.7% on reported figures.</p><p>The Europe Zone posted a like for like<sup>(</sup><sup>1)</sup>current operating margin of 4.7% with price increases making it possible to absorb the considerable increases in production costs.</p><p>The Non-Europe Zone saw its profitability recover over the fiscal year. The Eurasia region benefited from favorable exchange rates for the competitiveness of the products sold, with the fresh processed segment in North America seeing its negative profitability narrow under the effect of the competitiveness initiatives put in place and set to strengthen in 2023-2024.</p><p>After taking into account non-recurring items of (EURO) -11.7 million for the fiscal year, mainly related to the industrial reorganization costs for the fresh processed segment in North America, Bonduelle Group's operating income stood at (EURO) 54.1 million as reported compared to a loss of (EURO) -65.2 million for the previous fiscal year, where impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets was recorded as a non-recurring item.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net Result</emphasis></p><p>Financial result amounted to (EURO) -31.3 million, compared to (EURO) -14.5 million at the end of the previous fiscal year. This rise is mainly due to the higher cost of debt as a result of the increase in interest rates in the currencies in which the Bonduelle Group finances its activity along with the nature of the instruments used, with the average financing rate rising from 1.61% to 4.01% and, lastly, an increase in working capital requirement on a like for like basis due to the impact of inflation on inventories.</p><p>Foreign exchange hedging transactions generated a loss of (EURO) -4.6 million, mainly due to changes in the Russian ruble, which is now ineligible for foreign exchange hedges and which is offset by the competitiveness gains mentioned above. Net income from associates was (EURO) 4.4 million corresponding to the share of income from Nortera Foods holding, now accounted for under the equity method, less impairments recorded on non-controlling interests in start-ups intended to reflect their market value.</p><p>The income tax expense amounted to (EURO) 18.5 million, compared to (EURO) 40.0 million the previous year, the effective tax rate (80.9%) being distorted by the non-capitalization of losses on fresh processed activities in North America.</p><p>After taking into account income from associates, financial result, tax expense and an earn-out of (EURO)\u00a05.7 million related to the disposal of the long-life activity in North America the previous fiscal year, Bonduelle Group's net income for fiscal year 2022-2023 came to (EURO) 14.5 million, compared with (EURO) 35.4 million for the previous fiscal year, or 0.6% of revenue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial situation</emphasis></p><p>Net debt (excluding IFRS 16) at June 30, 2023 was (EURO) 356.7 million, compared with (EURO) 267.9 million at June 30 of the previous fiscal year. The ratio of debt to the group's shareholders' equity (gearing) remains limited to 0.45. The leverage ratio (net debt/REBITDA) amounted to 2.84 compared to 2.28 the previous fiscal year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other significant information</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adaptation of the American industrial set up</emphasis></p><p>In February 2023, the Bonduelle Group announced the adaptation of the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States in order to improve its competitiveness in the fresh processed market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segment. Thus, the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) are currently being transferred to the Swedesboro site (New Jersey). This operation aims at optimizing the production of all products for customers nationally, while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.</p><p>At the closing date, the project was underway, with completion scheduled for the first half of the fiscal year 2023-2024.</p><p>The net impact of this reorganization has been recorded in the fiscal year 2022-2023 under non-recurring items ((EURO) 10.1 million).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amendment of the green syndicated loan of (EURO) 400 million</emphasis></p><p>On February 6, 2023, the Bonduelle Group signed an amendment to its (EURO) 400 million syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with its banking partners, thereby securing an essential source of financing, which is particularly well suited to the seasonal nature of the group's financing needs, and on very competitive terms, despite the current unstable economic environment. This arrangement provides for a two-year extension, bringing the maturity from 2026 to 2028, with two one-year extension options, bringing the final maturity of the loan to February 2030.</p><p>The financial terms of this credit line include Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators in line with the group's mission and purpose, both in terms of B Corp certification and in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and contributing, with its agricultural partners, to a regenerative agriculture.</p><p>This operation demonstrates once again the confidence shown by the banking partners in supporting the Bonduelle Group's development over the long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First B</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corp</emphasis><sup>TM</sup><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">certifications</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">awarded</emphasis></p><p>In 2018, the Bonduelle Group announced its ambition to become a certified B Corp company by 2025. This ambition involves each of its entities obtaining their certification one by one. FY 2022-2023 marks a major milestone with the certification of Bonduelle in Italy and Bonduelle Fresh Americas in the United States, together accounting for a third of group revenue. The two Bonduelle Group entities are the first to meet B Lab's demanding social and environmental impact standards. They join the growing community of B Corp-certified companies, working collectively to make the global economy more respectful of the planet, inclusive and equitable every day.</p><p>These two certifications illustrate the Bonduelle Group's determination to place a positive impact at the heart of its business model, formalized from 2020 through a roadmap called the B!Pact and built around 3 pillars: food, planet and people. The B Corp certification process accelerates the commitment and mobilization of all the company's activities around the group's positive impact programs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Governance evolution</emphasis></p><p>Following the announcement of Guillaume Debrosse' departure in May 2023, the group announced the appointment of Xavier Unkovic as Chief Executive Officer. The appointment took effect on June 1, 2023.</p><p>Xavier Unkovic held positions in finance, sales, marketing and executive management in the United-States for 23 years, within the Mars Group and then with Amy's Kitchen, a B Corp-certified californian company that markets a range of organic prepared meals, which he turned around and developed. Since 2021, Xavier Unkovic has been the CEO of the french company NAOS, a major player in skin care and health under the brands Bioderma, Institut Esthederm and Etat Pur.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook</emphasis></p><p>Given a difficult consumer environment, the Bonduelle Group is targeting revenue growth of around 5% - i.e. estimated revenue for 2023-2024 of (EURO) 2,530 million - and an operating margin exceeding 3% - i.e. current operating profitability of around (EURO) 75 to 80 million - both at constant exchange rates, fueled by the confirmed recovery in business in North America, and strict management of overheads, despite still significant inflation and a change in currencies adversely impacting production costs.</p><p><sup>(1)</sup>at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period.

In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America, the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data, the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year, revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.</p><p><sup>(2)</sup>net financial debt / equity<sup>(3)</sup>net financial debt / recurring EBITDA</p><p>Alternative performance indicators: the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

How to deliver more food, more sustainably, under increasingly testing circumstances?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Robert Renwick is the Head of Business Sustainability, Europe, Africa and Middle East at Syngenta Crop Protection. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jerome Barbaron is the Head of Africa and Middle East at Syngenta Crop Protection.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agricultural industry has always adapted and thrived by mixing a blend of old and new techniques to optimize yield. Modern advances allow growers to work smarter, with more precise crop protection, minimizing waste and impact on the environment.\u00a0</p><p>However, new technologies are beyond the reach of many farmers and growers. Greater accessibility and the acceleration of the take up of improved technology and practices must be a priority for all involved in the food chain, including policy makers and the agriculture sector.\u00a0</p><p>In the case of Africa, this means boosting a key sector for food security and economic growth. Increasing access to technology and know-how empowers communities and helps to unlock sustainable growth.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spotlight on Africa</emphasis></p><p>In 2020, one in five people in Africa faced starvation. The situation has deteriorated since then with COVID-19, combined with war-induced disruptions to the global cereals trade and increased prices of fertilizers and other inputs.\u00a0</p><p>On top of this, there have been climate change-induced droughts, floods with consequential impacts on pests and diseases in a continent where most farmers don\u2019t have irrigation and rely on rainfall, which is ever more erratic.\u00a0</p><p>By 2050, it is expected that a quarter of the world\u2019s population will be living in Africa, compared with less than 10% in 1950. To put this into context, the equivalent of the population of France, or Thailand, is being added to the continent every two years.</p><p>Debates around the future of food systems tend to focus on inputs rather than outcomes. This has led to limits on use of certain inputs in Europe and mirrored approaches imposed on other parts of the world. Such limits are not based on local impact assessments conducted in Africa or other parts of the world and therefore their local impact is not known nor accounted for.\u00a0</p><p>It is not a level playing field. For example, mirrored approaches do not factor resources available to EU farmers in the form of subsidies, so it is not a matter of one policy should fit all. Policy needs to be tailored to reflect the differences in circumstances and available resources.</p><p>Due consideration is needed on how highly destructive pests can be managed sustainably, like the Fall Armyworm, which pose a risk to the livelihood and food security of over 300 million people.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green Africa</emphasis></p><p>Africa is undergoing a unique agricultural revolution. What this environmentally sustainable transformation will look like is currently being shaped, but it has great potential.\u00a0</p><p>A uniquely African green transition will need to account for Africa\u2019s current starting base of technology use, food security needs, smallholder realities, rainforests, tropical climates, subsidy regimes, and pest pressures to name a few.\u00a0</p><p>For a key staple crop in Africa for food security and livelihoods such as maize, farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa produce under four times less per hectare than farmers in Europe.\u00a0</p><p>Sustainable technology innovators have a role to play as partners in this journey towards a greener future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trade rather than aid</emphasis></p><p>Trading rules that enable access to the necessary yield boosting technologies and subsequent access to markets, where farmers can sell their produce with ease are crucial. Improved access drives opportunities to turn subsistence farming into businesses that empower communities.\u00a0</p><p>The average farm in Africa performs at 40% of its potential. The result is that annually, according to the FAO, Sub-Saharan Africa alone spends more than $40 billion a year on importing food, with a resulting hefty carbon-footprint.</p><p>Boosting food production can mean that some of the billions of dollars spent on food imports can instead be used to boost the incomes of local communities as well as improved environmental outcomes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A message for policymakers</emphasis></p><p>The world needs an outcomes-based policy approach to sustainable and regenerative agriculture to unlock the power of new technologies that have the potential to deliver greater food security in a more climate-friendly way.\u00a0</p><p>Policymakers should also keep in mind the positive role trade plays. By enabling trade, parts of the world, especially Africa, can become less dependent on aid.\u00a0</p><p>We stand ready to provide the necessary sustainable outcome-boosting technologies and support with know-how, but barriers to their take up must be eliminated to help accelerate the transition towards more sustainable practices.\u00a0</p><p>Green ambitions and plans should be proportionate, appropriate, and practical and go hand in hand with economic and social development of successful rural communities.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionagriculturefoodopinionunlockingagtechspotentialforsustainablegrowth</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CH-8811-JCMC-W25J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

I am concerned as a person but also the continent is concerned. Currently, we are witnessing the largest cost of living crisis of this 21st century to date, and the people's capacity to cope is actually decreasing. The clock is ticking and we do not have enough time to really wait.</p><p>But there's still some bit of period where we can actually begin to see the cost of living addressed and all the human suffering that it is bringing. In fact, FAO is estimating that almost up to 83% of the poor household income is spent on food. So that means if there are changes in prices, if there are increases in the cost of living, this is potentially likely to morph into social unrest and that creates some political challenges as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Africanews:</emphasis> African governments, Boaz aren't exactly just sitting back. What are they doing now to bring down the rising cost of food? What interventions are they undertaking?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keizire:</emphasis> So they are putting in place some policy incentives to create efficiency in the supply chains, for example. They are also trying to put in place subsidies for agriculture, seed, and fertilizer to make sure that production increases. Those are some of the efforts.</p><p>They are also deliberately working on protecting the consumers by establishing stimulus packages and also strengthening social safety nets to make sure that the governments are able to respond and cope with the shock.</p><p>And, one of the other key things that we are witnessing on the continent and what some of the leaders are doing is strengthening their strategic food reserves. Ideally to stabilize supplies as well as prices and support domestic approaches.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Africanews</emphasis>: The world is excited about, for example, the grain export deal between Russia and Ukraine, but this is only short-term. How would you address the deep-seated, structural issues that are to blame for food crises in many developing countries?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keizire:</emphasis> The recent UN food systems summit has taught us that leaders need to do more and to scale up investments in areas such as climate adaptation, conservation farming or regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Ideally to enhance productivity without disrupting the environment. The crisis in Ukraine is just not the first crisis. Before it, we had the climate change crisis and the locust invasion in Africa. Then there were oil and gas price increases even before the Ukraine crisis. All these have exacerbated the challenge on the continent.</p><p>This year's African Green Revolution Forum which is going to take place in Kigali, Rwanda, is a huge opportunity for governments and business leaders to discuss and agree on some of the solutions. They need to accelerate trade across the region, especially the implementation of intra-African trade. Because only then will we be able to see where you can get food from deficit areas to surplus areas.</p><p>We are seeing fertilizer being produced in Nigeria by Dangote, but getting into markets in Europe and the rest of the world, rather than reaching the poorer households in Africa simply because of structural constraints. Leaders must act on some of those challenges to be able to strengthen trade within the region.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Africanews:</emphasis> Boaz, you have worked at the African Union and in fact, this year is the year of nutrition in Africa. What, according to the A.U., are the biggest threats to African food and nutrition security, and what are they doing about it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keizire</emphasis>: I would summarize the challenges that are rooted in the continent as the inability to have a strong capacity to respond. Africa's biggest challenge is not money. The biggest challenge is a lack of coordination. It is a lack of the right investments to deliver on the programs that we already have. There is a lot of money within the ecosystem. The food systems are challenged simply because of a lack of stronger commitments.</p><p>And I think leaders need to do more than what they are doing today because business as usual is not going to get us where we need to be.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Africanews:</emphasis> Boaz Keizire, thank you very much for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keizire:</emphasis> Welcome. Thank you for having me.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20220811interviewwhatafricanleaderscandotoendrecurrentfoodcrisesutmsourcelexisnexisutmcaignfeedsnewsutmmediumreferral</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRICN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664R-MBD1-JCMC-W4JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">478671</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euronews SA  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Africanews (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 11, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Philippines, Rwanda, Russia, Nigeria &amp;

The highway would encroach on an area that, in Maori tradition, was governed by a water-dwelling creature, a taniwha.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The authorities took those concerns into account and rerouted the road to circumvent the area in question. As a result, a year later, when the area was hit by a major flood, the road was unharmed.       </p><p>\"I'm still waiting for the headline, 'Mythical Creature Saves the Taxpayer Millions,'\" said Dan Hikuroa, a senior lecturer in Maori studies at the University of Auckland and member of the Ngati Maniapoto tribe. He has often wondered if, once the flood hit, the technical team later said, \"Why didn't you just say it's a flood risk area?\"       </p><p>Like many Indigenous peoples around the world, the Maori have developed their understanding of their environment through close observation of the landscape and its behaviors over the course of many generations. Now the New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency regularly looks for ways to integrate traditional Maori knowledge, or matauranga, into its decision-making. Mr. Hikuroa has been appointed the culture commissioner for UNESCO New Zealand, a role he said is centered on integrating Maori knowledge into UNESCO's work.       </p><p>Western-trained researchers and governments are increasingly recognizing the wealth of knowledge that Indigenous communities have amassed to coexist with and protect their environments over hundreds or even thousands of years. Peer-reviewed scientific journals have published studies demonstrating that around the world, Indigenous-managed lands have far more biodiversity intact than other lands, even those set aside for conservation.       </p><p>Embracing Indigenous knowledge, as New Zealand is trying to do, can improve how federal governments manage ecosystems and natural resources. It can also deepen Western scientists' understanding of their own research, potentially, by providing alternative perspectives and approaches to understanding their field of work. This is ever more urgent, particularly as the climate crisis unfolds. \"It is Indigenous resilience and worldview that every government, country and community can learn from, so that we manage our lands, waters and resources not just across budget years, but across generations,\" U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico and America's first Native American cabinet secretary, said in remarks to the United Nations.       </p><p>Indigenous scholars warn, though, that while traditional knowledge can be used to benefit the world, it can also be mishandled or exploited. Dominique David Chavez, a descendant of the Arawak Ta\u00edno in the Caribbean, and a research fellow at the Native Nations Institute at the University of Arizona and the National Science Foundation, says that, as Western scientists, \"we are trained to go into communities, get that knowledge and go back to our institutions and disseminate it in academic journals.\" That can be disruptive to traditional knowledge sharing, from one generation to another, she says, which should be the priority - ensuring that Indigenous knowledge systems are preserved in and supportive of the communities that developed them. In Puerto Rico, known by its Indigenous people as Borik\u00e9n, Ms. Chavez is studying ways to restore the connections and traditional knowledge transmission patterns between elders and youth.       </p><p>Bridging Indigenous and Western science also means respecting the ecosystem of values in which the knowledge systems are embedded. For instance, the practice of planting a diversity of crops and building healthy soil for water retention - today known as \"regenerative agriculture\" - has existed in Indigenous communities around the world throughout history. Yet the growing push to adopt regenerative agriculture practices elsewhere is often selective, using industrial pesticides, for example, or leaving out the well-being of people who farm the land.       </p><p>\"In Indigenous sciences, it's not possible to separate the knowledge from the ethics of the responsibility for that knowledge - whereas in Western science, we do that all the time,\" said Robin Wall Kimmerer, the director of the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment at the State University of New York in Syracuse and an enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. The scientific method is designed to be indifferent to morals or values, she adds. \"Indigenous knowledge puts them back in.\"       </p><p>Ideally, the shared use of Indigenous knowledge can help mend broken relationships between Indigenous and Western communities.       </p><p>In upstate New York, Ms. Kimmerer points to sweetgrass, a native plant used for traditional basketry. She was approached by a tribe concerned about the decline of the plant and looking for a solution.       </p><p>Government regulations had already restricted its harvest. \"One thing people often think about is, is it being overharvested?\" Ms. Kimmerer said. She helped to conduct studies that ultimately showed that harvesting sweetgrass, following Indigenous protocols, is the very thing that will help it to thrive. \"If you just leave it alone, it starts to decline.\"       </p><p>For her, that speaks to a core flaw in Western approaches to land management: the belief that human interaction is necessarily harmful to ecosystems. \"That's one of the reasons Native people were systematically removed from what are today's national parks, because of this idea that people and nature can't coexist in a good way.\" But Indigenous knowledge, Ms. Kimmerer said, is really all about, 'Oh yes we can, and we cultivate practices for how that is possible,'\" she said.       </p><p>While combating wildfires last year, Australian authorities turned to Aboriginal practices. While researchers have connected the severity of the fires to climate change, Ms. Kimmerer added that how Australia's land has been managed in the modern era may have also played a role. Aboriginal people had \"been managing that land in a fire landscape for millenniums, \" she said. \"The fact that Indigenous science has been ignored is a contributing factor to the fires there.\"       </p><p>As the world increasingly recognizes the accomplishments of many Indigenous communities that successfully coexist with ecosystems, there is much for Western society to learn.       </p><p>\"We have this notion that Western science is the pathway to truth. We don't really even entertain the possibility that it could come from somewhere else,\" said Ms. Kimmerer. \"Resource managers, land managers need to understand that there are multiple ways of knowing.\"       </p><p>Rachel Cernansky is a freelance journalist and the sustainability editor at Vogue Business.

The white, window-lined dining room will not be mistaken, as many steakhouses could be, for the man cave of a wealthy lawyer with a thing for cowboy-rancher iconography. In fact, by the time you order, it's possible the kitchen will have run out of some steaks - rib-eye, New York strip, filet - that most diners consider prerequisites for a steakhouse.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Renee Erickson, the influential Seattle chef and Bateau's co-owner, concedes that the restaurant bewilders some first-time customers. \"It's definitely not a steakhouse for everyone,\" she said. \"I wish it were.\"       </p><p>Bateau's iconoclasm flows from its ambition to celebrate beef without supporting the industrial system that makes beef production so harmful to the environment. Ms. Erickson set out six years ago to open a steakhouse whose focus on local, sustainable ingredients aligned with the values at restaurants operated by her company, Sea Creatures, including the popular oyster bar Walrus and the Carpenter.       </p><p>The environmentally conscious practices that Bateau follows - including whole-animal butchering - are hardly novel. But they're nearly impossible to adhere to while still delivering what steakhouses have conditioned the nation's diners to expect: a narrow lineup of steaks that are tender and marbled with fat. Both of those selling points are often products of an inhumane feedlot system that is complicit in the climate crisis.       </p><p>All of this makes the restaurant nearly a genre of its own: a steakhouse that is also a critique of steakhouses, and a model of a better way forward.       </p><p>This is a tough time to be promoting beef. The ethics of meat consumption are so widely questioned that plant-based meat substitutes have become commonplace. The website Epicurious announced in April that it would produce no new beef recipes. And veganism has found a foothold at both fast-food chains and Michelin-starred restaurants.       </p><p>Yet Bateau pushes back at the notion that eliminating beef is the most thoughtful remedy for an ailing food system. Instead, it favors embracing beef from cattle raised entirely on pasture vegetation, a pillar of the regenerative-agriculture movement that sees cattle as essential to healthy ecosystems and, by extension, fighting climate change. This beef is the only animal protein Bateau serves, besides raw oysters.       </p><p>Taylor Thornhill, the restaurant's chef de cuisine since it opened, views its rancher-suppliers - Pure Country Farm, Carman Ranch and Gleason Ranch, all in the Northwest - as collaborators. All believe that the welfare of animals impacts the health of the land.       </p><p>\"They care as much about the animal from the moment it's born to the moment it's killed - and beyond - as I do about it coming through these doors and getting it to the plate,\" Mr. Thornhill said.       </p><p>Those claims of affection aren't likely to sway animal-rights advocates. Many scientists are skeptical that regenerative techniques can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of raising cattle. In the United States, livestock are among the largest sources of methane; cattle that feed on vegetation their entire lives emit more of this planet-warming greenhouse gas because they live longer.        </p><p>Regenerative-agriculture proponents contend that such criticisms don't give enough weight to other benefits of their practices, like eliminating the need to grow and ship feed.       </p><p>For her part, Ms. Erickson doesn't claim to have all the answers. \"There is a very big system in place that doesn't work very well,\" she said, adding that many of Bateau's diners \"are inspired to make a better choice. And I think that's what our job is.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">***</emphasis></p><p>Each week Bateau buys a whole carcass, and one to three supplemental slabs of beef, all cut into steaks by Scott Johnson, the staff butcher. The selections, handwritten daily on chalkboard menus, are limited to what's been dry-aged for at least 21 days and to the finite supply of what's in the cooler. Particular cuts are crossed off the menu throughout the night as that supply dwindles.       </p><p>Mr. Thornhill, 37, and his colleagues - notably the restaurant's original butcher, Tom Coss - have made it a mission to make steaks out of cuts long considered too tough, small or unsightly for the assignment. This accounts for the long list of steaks that most diners will never have seen on a steakhouse menu, if at all.       </p><p>They include, depending on the night, obscure cuts (like gracilis and coulotte) and others presumed to be palatable only if slow-cooked or ground into hamburger (ball tip, brisket deckle).       </p><p>Through trial and error, Mr. Thornhill and Mr. Coss developed methods for butchering and aging tougher, leaner cuts that deepen the flavor and help tenderize the meat, at least to a point. (Mr. Coss was laid off, along with the rest of the staff, at the start of the pandemic; he now is head butcher at the Shambles, a Seattle bar and butcher. Mr. Johnson joined Bateau after it resumed regular service in April.)       </p><p>For diners, part of the Bateau experience is learning that meat from free-roaming, grass-fed cows will always require a sharp knife. \"As consumers, we've been told that the best-quality meat is tender meat, fork tender,\" Mr. Thornhill said. \"Our metric for quality is flavor.\"       </p><p>All of the steaks, including the traditional steakhouse varieties, are cooked the same: seared in cast-iron pans and basted with brown butter. The meat is priced by weight, with some cuts available in four- or five-ounce portions. This reduces waste and encourages diners to sample.       </p><p>In one meal, a small party can appreciate the fatty intensity of belly or short rib, the loose-grained succulence of the coulotte and the fungal tang of a 49-day-aged sirloin tip, potentially each from a different ranch. The spectrum of texture and flavor makes what's available at a traditional steakhouse seem monochromatic by comparison.       </p><p>\"Beef should have a terroir, like wine,\" Mr. Thornhill said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">***</emphasis></p><p>The idea for Bateau first came to Ms. Erickson, 49, years before it opened, during meals at Le Severo, the butcher-restaurateur William Bernet's steak-oriented bistro in Paris, and at Hawksmoor, in London. She noticed how much the character varied among cuts and producers of steaks from locally bred cows. It made her realize how years of buying pre-cut rib-eyes and strips had detached her from the ingredient's source.       </p><p>\"It was like a light bulb went off,\" Ms. Erickson recalled. \"This is an animal. It doesn't come from a box.\"       </p><p>It's a measure of how difficult it is to achieve Bateau's goals that the restaurant hasn't spawned a cohort of similar steakhouses-with-a-conscience, even as it racks up accolades (The Seattle Times gave it four stars, its highest rating, in 2016) and prominent chefs and restaurateurs continue to tinker with the steakhouse genre. One factor could be economic: Bateau's labor-intensive methods are not cheap. Its prices are as high as, if not higher than, traditional steakhouses.       </p><p>Bateau was even more ambitious in its early days, when Sea Creatures raised its own French heritage-breed cattle on Whidbey Island for the restaurant. That proved to be overwhelming, and ended after about a year. \"We're not ranchers,\" Ms. Erickson said.       </p><p>A fourth-generation cattle rancher in northeastern Oregon, Cory Carman, didn't seriously question the feedlot system until the 1990s, when she was a student at Stanford. She started converting her family's Carman Ranch to a grass-fed herd in the early 2000s.       </p><p>It's not uncommon for cattle to feed on grass even within the industrial system. What distinguishes Carman Ranch and Bateau's other suppliers is that they continue to feed the animals on foraged vegetation in the months before slaughter, when most cattle are sold to feedlots to fatten on grains.       </p><p>The considerable financial risk is among the reasons more cattle ranchers don't follow suit, Ms. Carman said during a July tour of her herds in Wallowa County.       </p><p>\"We could have sold this cattle and pocketed the money a year ago,\" she said of animals grazing on timbered range, at the edge of a mountain valley. Cattle \"finished\" on grass take longer to reach market weight. \"We find ways to feed them, keep them gaining, and take all of the risk for an additional year.\"       </p><p>Ms. Carman, 41, said she persists because the environmental damage caused by the feedlot system is so grave, and the potential benefits of regenerative agriculture are so enticing.       </p><p>Her cows move to different pastures and crop land, long enough to replenish the soil with their hooves and manure, but not enough to deplete it of nutrients. This planned grazing reduces stress on the animals; eliminates the need to buy feed and till the land; and leaves behind soil that's more fertile and better able to sequester carbon and hold water - a particular boon in the drought-stricken West. \"You put animals in a feedlot and you create a pollution problem,\" Ms. Carman said. \"Where if we keep them in a pasture system, that manure is doing really good things for the land.\"       </p><p>Ms. Carman started Carman Ranch Provisions a decade ago to sell grass-fed beef from her ranch and other local farms in an effort to, as she put it, \"create our own supply chain.\"       </p><p>Mark Butterfield is among the farmers in the program. Eighty cows in his 150-head herd rotate on land planted with cover crops. Meat from those cows is sold through Ms. Carman's company.       </p><p>Mr. Butterfield, 52, has already seen results: healthier soil and higher yields from the cash crops he later plants on the land where cattle grazed. Asked what's keeping him from converting his entire operation to grass-fed, he said: \"My mind. Change is hard, and it's expensive.\" He added that farming is different than ranching, and that raising cattle doesn't come easy to people trained to raise crops.       </p><p>\"Most farmers don't want to mess with cows,\" he said.       </p><p>Mr. Thornhill, Bateau's chef de cuisine, said he hopes the restaurant can help encourage others to change their ways. \"I'm just trying to squeeze every ounce of care and love out of the animal, to respect the animal and help the land.\"       </p><p>Beef is a component in nearly everything the kitchen prepares, from the salami cotto in the house salad and fermented beef garum served with the onion-soup croquettes to the beef tallow in the restaurant's twist on olive-oil cake. And the waste-minimizing nose-to-tail ethic informs all of its cooking. Fermented kale stems take the place of cornichons and capers in the steak tartare.       </p><p>\"Other than eggshells, we try not to put anything into the compost,\" Mr. Thornhill said.       </p><p>Both Mr. Thornhill, who trained as a butcher, and Ms. Erickson, the granddaughter of farmers, have witnessed the slaughtering of cows. \"If you can't come to grips that something died, you shouldn't eat meat,\" Mr. Thornhill said.       </p><p>Mr. Thornhill sat in Bateau's dining room beneath one of the restaurant's two signature images: a chalk drawing of a calf and a cow gazing wide-eyed over the tables. The other image, an arm's length away, is a window into the cooler where carcasses hang.       </p><p>Mr. Thornhill said he isn't bothered that some diners might find the juxtaposition disturbing. \"If people believe in what we're doing and want a better food system, we welcome them,\" he said. \"If they don't like it, they don't have to eat here.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Food on Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008021170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:640M-X6Y1-DYR7-C52V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 4, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The fertile region of Lobaye, at the gates of the Central African capital Bangui, looks like a garden of Eden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The civil wars and exactions of numerous armed groups over the past 20 years have relatively spared this forest area. It is here that a handful of private investors have decided to capitalize on the immense but still largely untapped agricultural potential of this country, the second least developed in the world according to the UN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is rare to see a truck passing on the road from Mbaiki, the capital of Lobaye, to Bangui, the only paved road in the region, and even rarer to see a plantation. The asphalt serves as a cassava dryer for the villagers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- Food emergency -</emphasis></p><p>Despite abundant water resources and millions of hectares of arable land, the Central African Republic is hungry. Nearly half of the population is in a state of food emergency, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p><p>This is a situation inherited from decades of armed conflict and poor governance, in a country where mineral extraction is the focus of political ambitions and offers more immediate income to unskilled youth. Even food agriculture is barely developed: cassava, the staple of meals, is two-thirds imported.</p><p>The millions poured in by international organizations in food aid are perceived by many Central Africans as emergency responses at the expense of development.</p><p>\"You can't come and distribute free food and ask someone to go to work. It's instilling in him a welfare mentality,\" says Raed Harriri, general manager of the Palme d'or company, the only large-scale representative of the agri-food sector. A speech regularly heard among small farmers.</p><p>Lebanese by birth, born and educated in the Central African Republic, Raed Harriri is a well-known figure there. He defends a pragmatic development model guided by private investment that does not deny profit but offers outlets to local farmers by developing product processing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- \"Proximity policy\" -</emphasis></p><p>\"We advocate a proximity policy. We have to go to the small producers, train them, bring them together in cooperatives and put means at their disposal, then we buy their production. And if they have trouble managing their budget between two harvest cycles, we guarantee them loans from microfinance organizations,\" he explains.</p><p>It doesn't matter that the business climate is notoriously difficult and that the armed actors are not very friendly. \"You just have to know the networks and habits,\" he says in his office where portraits of Thomas Sankara, a pan-African hero, stand next to those of the current Central African President Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra, whom he meets regularly.</p><p>Palme d'or's parent company, Al Sahely, was accused by NGOs of paying militias to protect its operations at the start of the civil war in 2013. But today it remains one of the only providers of jobs in the agribusiness.</p><p>With its humming machines, its fumaroles rising in shafts of light between silos swaddled with cables and sheaths, the Palme d'or factory in Bangui offers an unusual picture in a country with a virtually non-existent industrial fabric.</p><p>Inherited from the French colonial period, the agricultural sector, based on the export of unprocessed products, has not withstood the fluctuations in world prices since independence in 1960.</p><p>\"Producing to export raw products is not the right method,\" pleads Jean-Luc T\u00e9t\u00e9, a French-Central African who has taken the gamble of developing so-called \"regenerative\" agriculture in Lobaye. This technique allows the soil to rest after being tired from the incessant bush fires that hunters set to hunt small game.</p><p>\"We combine crops, we avoid deep plowing, and we industrialize traditional agricultural knowledge, which means that we use practically no fertilizer. This allows us to have extremely low production costs,\" explains this entrepreneur who aims to create a model that can be exported to Africa.</p><p>More and more individuals from the diaspora are trying to return to the land.</p><p>\"But you have to be accepted,\" says T\u00e9t\u00e9, whose daily life involves long discussions with traditional authorities. \"It is the village chiefs who determine where we can settle, and 20% of the profits are invested in education, health and infrastructure,\" he says.</p><p>\"It's a partnership,\" said Jean Claude Silakamako, a village chief, after the meeting. \"We offer our land, our intelligence too, now it's up to them to come with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRICN-httpswwwafricanewscom20220314sustainableagriculturemakinginroadsinthecentralafricanrepublic</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRICN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:650R-GVM1-F03F-K245-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">478671</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><timeReceived>8:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euronews SA  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Africanews (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 14, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Central African Republic &amp;

This involves developing new practices, using new materials, and switching to manufacturing processes that consume less water and energy. Various initiatives keep springing up to drive fashion in a direction that's more sustainable and respectful of the planet, as well as human beings. Here's a look at some of the most innovative approaches underway as the world celebrates Earth Day, April 22.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If upcycling, clothing repair and buying second-hand currently stand out as essential alternatives for making fashion more responsible, many in the sector are working on new solutions to considerably reduce the carbon footprint of our wardrobes. Some of these often surprising solutions could contribute to revolutionizing the textile industry as we know it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3D printing to limit waste</emphasis></p><p>From small French company 3D-Tex to the renowned American designer Heron Preston to the Portland-based sustainable shoe brand Hilos, more and more fashion firms and designers are embracing 3D printing as a means to offer greener pieces, focusing on zero waste and circularity. The idea is to shift to a more ecological manufacturing process, while limiting waste and offering more resistant creations, some of which can be infinitely recyclable.</p><p>That's the challenge taken up by the Saint-Malo-based start-up 3D-Tex, which defines itself as the \"first fully 3D knitting workshop in France,\" on its official <url normalizedValue=\"http://3d-tex.fr/\">website</url>. The company manufactures sweaters -- but also hats -- in 3D and without seams thanks to a technology that seriously cuts down on waste. It's an initiative that has already won over many brands, starting with TBS and Le Slip Fran\u00e7ais, and which could serve as an example in many other sectors.</p><p>While 3D printing is on a mission to revolutionize the knitwear sector in France, it seems to have already conquered the footwear sector in the United States. This is evidenced by various projects from the likes of Heron Preston and Hilos. The former presented the first 3D-printed sneakers that can be infinitely recycled in the fall of 2021, while the latter is currently producing four models of shoes made on demand using this technology, thus addressing a number of issues such as overproduction, stock shortages and energy savings. These three initiatives demonstrate the industry's enthusiasm for 3D printing as one of the most innovative solutions for a more sustainable future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Turning waste into clothing</emphasis></p><p>While upcycling allows many brands to give a second life to their fabric scraps and surplus or used clothes, some in the industry have gone even further by transforming waste -- sometimes even components whose concentration in the atmosphere is one of the factors behind global warming. Incredible, but true. The objective is to depollute the environment while proposing new creations that do not require any new raw material.</p><p>The TchaoMegot company takes an unusual approach by recycling... cigarette butts. These are collected, then cleaned through an ecological process, before being transformed into eco-designed insulation used in the padding of certain puffer jackets. It's upcycling taken to a whole new level, while also raising awareness about the pollution generated by this common waste item, which still has a disastrous impact on the oceans.</p><p>In a different vein, the California-based start-up Newlight Technologies has developed AirCarbon, a carbon-negative biomaterial made from greenhouse gases. It took more than a decade to develop this innovation, which is of great interest to fashion giants such as Nike, which has partnered with the company to explore the use of AirCarbon in various applications. While we wait to learn more about the products resulting from this collaboration, shoppers can already discover Covalent, Newlight Technologies' own brand, which offers bags and sunglasses designed made using the biomaterial.</p><p>And because every such initiative contributes to improving the health of the planet, ready-to-wear brands are also mobilizing for Earth Day. Projects include UGG's new carbon-neutral Icon-Impact collection, which includes the Fluff Yeah Terry, Fuzz Sugar Terry Slide and Fuzz Sugar Terry Cross Slide, and the new Classic Mini Regenerat shoe, which uses sheepskin from regenerative agriculture farms, not to mention Vans' Eco Positivity collection, which focuses on more sustainable materials such as organic cotton, hemp and organic foam made from vegetable oils.</p><p>Canada Goose is presenting its new Kind Fleece made from recycled wool and biobased fibers. In advance of Earth Day, the brand also published its 2021 environmental, social and governance report, demonstrating its progress in terms of sustainable impacts. It states that it has converted more than 20% of its materials to preferred fibers and materials, and nearly 60% of its packaging to more sustainable solutions. Often singled out, the fashion industry seems to be on the road to transformation, striving to help make the contents of our closets less harmful for the environment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:658W-4F41-JDVB-61NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

Human beings are displacing the planet's other species at an unprecedented rate, a disaster that the landmark U.N. Biodiversity Conference known as COP15 is focused on this week in Montreal. We're a unique menace, but we at least have a unique ability to recognize it and do something about it.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first step toward recovery, of course, is admitting your problem, and the conference's draft plan warns up front that a million species will face extinction if we don't clean up our act. But while the delegates in Montreal are pointing fingers at everything from plastics to pesticides to invasive species, biodiversity loss is not that complicated a mystery.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The basic problem is that we've converted half of Earth's habitable land into agricultural land. We're destroying and degrading the habitats of other species to grow food for our own.       </p><p>This means the fate of the world's bugs, bunnies and other creatures and critters - and what's left of the forests, wetlands and other habitats they call home - depends more than anything else on what we put in our mouths and how it gets made. Unfortunately, telling people what to eat and farmers how to farm are politically unpalatable tasks, which helps explain why yakfests like COP15 tend to obscure the problem with word salad.       </p><p>Environmentalists hope to leave Montreal with commitments from governments to preserve 30 percent of the earth by 2030 and to meet 21 other targets. But governments have already failed to achieve less ambitious conservation goals set for 2010 and 2020. There's also buzz around nailing down corporate commitments to greener supply chains, but COP15 is mostly dancing around the crux of the biodiversity crisis.       </p><p>The crux is that if current eating and farming trends continue, the world will clear land equal to at least one and a quarter Indias by 2050. That would be a disaster for the climate and wildlife, dooming carbon-rich and biodiverse ecosystems like the Amazon and Congo rainforests.       </p><p>So those eating and farming trends better not continue. Humanity needs to start shrinking our agricultural footprint and expanding our natural footprint, after thousands of years of doing the reverse.       </p><p>This will be an extraordinary challenge, because we'll also need to produce more than 7.4 quadrillion additional calories every year to feed our growing population, in an era when climate-fueled droughts, heat waves, floods and blights could make it harder to grow food.       </p><p>You can see why word salad can seem more appetizing.       </p><p>You can also see why promises to conserve land or promote deforestation-free products can ring hollow. Governments can pledge to ban land clearing, but when their people get hungry, land will get cleared. Some companies might sign agreements to avoid soy or beef from newly deforested land, but it won't do much if other companies keep buying soy or beef from newly deforested land.       </p><p>If we are serious about cleaning up the mess we're making for less influential species, there are four things individuals as well as nations and corporations can do.       </p><p>The first is to eat less meat, which would be a lot easier if meat weren't so beloved and delicious. Limiting access to cheeseburgers can turn politicians into ex-politicians, so it's no coincidence that the Montreal draft mentions changing diets only in passing in its 16th target. But the inconvenient truth is that when we eat cows, chickens and other livestock, we might as well be eating macaws, jaguars and other endangered species.       </p><p>That's because livestock chew up far more land per calorie than crops. Producing beef is 100 times as land-intensive as cultivating potatoes and 55 times as land-intensive as peas or nuts. Livestock now use nearly 80 percent of agricultural land while producing less than 20 percent of calories. Cattle are the leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon, followed by soybeans, another commodity, which get fed to pigs and chickens.       </p><p>Meat consumption is expected to increase dramatically as billions of the global poor escape poverty. If Americans continue to average three burgers a week while the developing world starts to follow our path, it's hard to see how the Amazon survives.       </p><p>But it's at least possible that we could shrink agricultural footprints by shifting our diets toward meat made without livestock, like the plant-based substitutes offered by companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat or maybe someday cultured meat grown from animal cells.       </p><p>The next thing we need to do is waste less food<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">. </emphasis>About a third of the food grown on Earth is lost or tossed before it reaches our mouths, which means a third of the land (as well as the water, fertilizer and other resources) used to grow that food is also wasted. But the Montreal text includes only a single mention of the need to \"halve per capita global food waste,\" with no suggestions of what technological, behavioral and policy changes could help to meet such an ambitious goal.       </p><p>Every acre of land on Earth matters, because we desperately need to grow more food, provide habitats for more native flora and fauna and store more carbon to limit climate change. And that's why it's particularly crazy to use the Earth's limited land to grow fuel. The third way to ease the global land squeeze would be to stop using productive farmland for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel - and to stop burning trees for power - but the Montreal plan doesn't even address the topic.       </p><p>In fact, there's global momentum to expand bioenergy's dominion over the land. A new paper in the journal Nature estimates that new European Union policies could wipe out half the continent's most biodiverse grasslands and divert a fifth of its cropland to energy crops, which would lead to land clearing overseas to replace the lost food. The E.U. is also promoting wood-burning power plants, a recipe for massive forest cutting around the world.       </p><p>Farm and forest interests have so much political power that government efforts to increase demand for crops and wood are often considered untouchable. But if biodiversity is a real priority, they can't be.       </p><p>Finally, if we're going to shrink our agricultural footprint enough to stop deforestation and hopefully restore some degraded ecosystems so they can once again serve as wildlife habitats and carbon sinks, farmers will have to supersize their yields enough to make a lot more food with a lot less land. And while the 20th century's Green Revolution raised yields by using fossil-fuel-derived fertilizers, toxic pesticides and other environmentally damaging innovations, the 21st century will require some greener ones that can ramp up productivity without messing up the planet.       </p><p>Once again, this doesn't seem like a priority in Montreal. There's been much more focus on regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and other gentler, lower-yield alternatives to intensive industrial farming that can improve biodiversity on farmland. The problem is that they can require more farmland to produce the same amount of food, accelerating the destruction of the natural lands that provide far more biodiversity than farmland ever can - and suck far more heat-trapping carbon from our overloaded atmosphere.       </p><p>Earth now has more than 12 billion acres of agricultural land, an area twice the size of North America. Adding more is the surest way to wipe out more species - and maybe, someday, our own.       </p><p>Michael Grunwald, a host of the \"Climavores\" podcast, is working on a book about how to feed the world without frying it.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

This performance resulted from the teamwork of our employees and the strength of our iconic brands, which offer healthy servings of dairy, fruit and plant-based foods everywhere in the world. The solid volume results, coupled with our product offering and price adjustments, generated organic sales growth of 11.1%, a performance further fuelled by accelerated expansion in our priority territories and categories, namely North America and Asia, and fruit and plant-based foods. These results confirm the relevance of our strategy. During the period, we reaffirmed our commitment to forging a path to a healthier and more sustainable food business model. We did this notably through key initiatives, such as strengthening our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint across Bel's entire value chain by 2035, in line with the trajectory of the Paris Accords, expanding our regenerative agriculture pilot-program to include the United States and announcing an innovative and strategic partnership with startup Superbrewed to develop and introduce cheeses made from alternative proteins. The rollout of our CSR roadmap will not be slowed by the tough inflationary environment created by rising raw material prices and increases in all our production line expenses, including packaging, energy and transport costs. Our margin was severely impacted in the first half of the year due to the inherent lag in passing on higher prices to our customers. However, I remain confident in our ability to grow Bel and to restore our margins, while remaining cautious about volume growth in an environment of extreme market volatility.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Resilient H1 financial performance co</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">nfirms relevance of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">strategic development</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">choices</emphasis></p><p>Sales</p><p>In H1 2022, Bel generated consolidated sales totaling (EURO)1,683 million, versus (EURO)1,691 million in H1 2021, a relatively steady performance despite the uncertain environment and a negative (EURO)245-million impact on changes in the scope of consolidation arising from the sale of the Leerdammer brand and the Bel Shostka Ukraine subsidiary to Lactalis. Excluding the negative impact from the change in the scope of consolidation and the positive 5.2% (+(EURO)75.2 million) foreign-exchange impact, which stemmed notably from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro, sales grew organically 11.1%. The robust organic sales performance, which attests to strong consumer appeal of Bel's core brands, was fuelled by continued growth in the fruit-based foods business<sup>2</sup>in all company territories, the strong sales momentum in North America and China, and the positive impact from the price-mix effect.</p><p>Babybel<sup>\u00ae</sup>and Boursin<sup>\u00ae</sup>posted strong growth in North America and the United Kingdom. Kiri\u00ae confirmed its solid growth momentum in China. The Laughing Cow\u00ae had a mixed performance depending on the territory, with very positive sales momentum in North America. Bel's first international, 100% plant-based food brand, Nurishh<sup>\u00ae</sup>, as well as Boursin<sup>\u00ae</sup>Plant-Based and the recently launched Babybel<sup>\u00ae</sup>Plant-Based achieved encouraging results during the period, confirming Bel's strategy to develop its plant-based food offering alongside its dairy and fruit-based food products. Lastly, the e-commerce and Out of Home (OOH) distribution channels continued to develop at a strong clip.</p><p>The sales breakdown by market segment is as follows.</p><p>* New Territories encompass the business activities of MOM, as well as markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and China.** Excluding the impact of the hyperinflationary environment in Iran and Turkey.</p><p>Global Markets</p><p>In North America, sales trended up significantly with excellent performances reported by the Babybel<sup>\u00ae</sup>, The Laughing Cow<sup>\u00ae</sup>and Boursin<sup>\u00ae</sup>brands, in step with Bel's aim to accelerate growth in this geographical region. The situation in the Near and Middle East and North Africa stabilized in H1 2022, compared to the prior year period.Sales volumes remained resilient in Europe. The region posted organic sales growth, with stable volumes overall during the period.</p><p>New Territories*</p><p>The New Territories* segment continued its solid growth path, buoyed once again by sales in the fruit-based food business<sup>3</sup>, which reported particularly robust momentum in all markets. Further, sales in China accelerated very strongly on the back of Kiri<sup>\u00ae</sup>, confirming the brand's growth potential for the years ahead.</p><p>* New Territories encompass the business activities of MOM, as well as markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and China.</p><p>Sales by geographic region</p><p>* Excluding the impact of the hyperinflationary environment in Iran and Turkey.</p><p>Results</p><p>In the first half of 2022, consolidated operating income totaled (EURO)69 million, down 36.9% versus the first half of 2021.</p><p>Operating income by segment is as follows.</p><p>* New Territories encompass the business activities of MOM, as well as markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and China.</p><p>Operating margin declined 235 basis points as a result of strong inflationary pressure on all Bel's purchasing line items. In H1 2022, Bel was unable to fully offset the unprecedented inflation impact by accelerating productivity efforts or raising selling prices, the effects of which will continue to be felt in the coming months. The company remains steadfast in its efforts to continuously adapt its product offering and, in this environment, strike the best possible balance between the value of its products and their accessibility to most consumers.After taking into account net financial result and income tax expense, consolidated net profit, Group share, totaled (EURO)34 million, compared with (EURO)67 million at June 30, 2021.</p><p>Financial position</p><p>The Group's balance sheet remained strong at June 30, 2022, with net financial debt amounting to (EURO)813.5 million, versus (EURO)645 million at December 31, 2021. The increase reflects the purchase of outstanding ordinary shares not already owned in the MOM Group. The 17.44% interest was acquired for (EURO)208 million on April 29, 2022. Following the completion of that transaction, Bel now owns 100% of MOM's ordinary shares. At June 30, 2022, the Bel Group's equity stood at (EURO)1,555.6 million, compared with (EURO)1,681.6 million at December 31, 2021.</p><p>Bel continues to enjoy strong liquidity both in terms of cash and untapped credit lines. At June 30, 2022, Bel had (EURO)456 million in surplus cash and cash equivalents and (EURO)520 million in untapped credit lines maturing in 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon-cutting goal and commitment for more sustainable dairy production strengthened</emphasis></p><p>Reducing its carbon footprint lies at the heart of Bel's responsible and sustainable growth model. Bel is pursuing this ambition by beefing up its carbon-cutting goal to help keep global warming below the 1.5\u00b0C target ceiling, in line with the Paris Accords. Its goal has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and represents a real challenge for a company whose main business today is dairy based. Bel is committed to strengthening its carbon-cutting goal by slashing greenhouse gas emissions by one quarter across its entire value chain by 2035, and the company now includes carbon as an indicator to measure the performance of its activities.</p><p>In an environment of unprecedented economic crisis, with sharp increases in raw material costs, Bel remains faithful to its commitment to build tomorrow's food business model. In France, Bel in April revised its price agreement with dairy producer partners in the Bel West Producers Association (APBO - Association des Producteurs de lait Bel de l'Ouest) for 100% of milk collection at a higher price. In this way, the company is working to transition to more sustainable dairy farming, with support from across its entire value chain. In the United States, Bel Brands USA, as part of its partnership with Land O'Lakes Inc.<sup>\u00ae</sup>, continued and extended its regenerative agriculture pilot-program, which will be key to developing a sustainable dairy industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook for 2022</emphasis></p><p>Confronted with persistent and increasing macro-economic uncertainties, the Bel Group demonstrated its resilience in the first half of 2022, confirming the relevance of its strategic development choices and underscoring the appeal of its brands through the continued loyalty of its consumers and retail partners. Bel remains vigilant in the face of inflation, which remains very high and will severely impact the second half of the year, requiring the company to continue efforts to restore margins. Bel is endeavoring to minimize the market's environmental impact, while continuing to strengthen its position in the global healthy snack market.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Co</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">rporate</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">announcements during the period</emphasis></p><p>On July 13, Bel and Polmlek signed an agreement to sell Bel's stake in the Morocco-based company, Safilait.On July 7, Bel and Superbrewed Food entered into a collaborative strategic agreement to develop a range of cheese products that incorporate Superbrewed proteins derived from biomass fermentation.On May 2, the Bel Group acquired the outstanding interest it did not already own in MOM to accelerate its development in the healthy snack market.On April 14, with unprecedented increases in dairy producer costs, the Bel West Producers Association (APBO) and the Bel Group upwardly revised the benchmark MonBBLait<sup>\u00ae</sup>milk price for 2022.On February 10, Bel pinpointed carbon reduction as a driver of its performance, embracing ambitious aims to help limit global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>Bel's financial performance indicators and additional annotations</p><p>The Group uses non-IFRS financial performance indicators internally and for its external communication. These non-IFRS indicators are defined below:</p><p>Organic growth corresponds to reported sales growth, excluding impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations and changes in the scope of consolidation, i.e. on a constant structure and exchange rate basis and excluding inflation in Iran and in Turkey. Since 2020, Iran's economy is deemed to be a hyperinflation economy, so as Turkey since 2022. Accordingly, inflation impacts, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), were excluded when determining organic growth. The organic growth rate is calculated by applying the exchange rate for the prior year period to the current year period.</p><p>Operating margin corresponds to operating income.</p><p>Net financial debt is described in note 5.6 to the summary consolidated financial statements. It consists of long- and short-term borrowings (which include the impact of interest-rate hedging instruments), long- and short-term right-of-use liabilities, and current used banking facilities, less cash and cash equivalents.</p><p>Given the process under way to dispose of the Moroccan company, Safilait, and given the probable assumption that the transaction will be completed within the next 12 months, Bel has applied IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, leading to the presentation of a separate line on both the asset side and liability side of the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the income statement has not be restated.</p><p>This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

NFTs</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hype surrounding non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, is spreading like wildfire. After the art world, these certificates of authenticity linked to a virtual object are attracting the interest of luxury brands. Guerlain is the latest to embrace this trendy acronym.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Guerlain waited until the International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris (FIAC) to dive into the world of NFTs, these unique digital tokens that are impossible to reproduce. For the 14th consecutive year, the brand is presenting a contemporary art exhibition as part of FIAC's Parcours Priv\u00e9.</p><p>\"Quand la mati\u00e8re devient art\" (When Matter Becomes Art) brings together sculptural works, paintings, photographs and installations, chosen by curator Caroline Messensee to explore the question of materiality in art. They were created by 21 artists, including Jean-Charles Blais, Nacho Carbonell, C\u00e9line Cl\u00e9ron and Nadja El Zein.</p><p>The exhibition also looks at the emergence of digital matter and the impact of these new kinds of creations on the art world. Guerlain decided to go even further by inviting several artists to produce original NFT-certified digital works on the theme of art and matter.</p><p>Liu Bolin, Lauren Moffatt, Sabrina Ratt\u00e9 and Constance Valero rose to the challenge, and their creations are offered for sale until November 15 on the Drouot auction house website. According to Guerlain, all proceeds from the sale will be donated to the GoodPlanet Foundation to finance the creation of a laboratory garden for regenerative agriculture.<br/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NFTs and charity initiatives</emphasis></p><p>Guerlain isn't the only luxury brand using NFTs to bring a new dimension to charity initiatives. In May, Havaianas auctioned off five flip-flop-themed digital art pieces created by the Brazilian artist, Adhemas Batista. A portion of the proceeds from these digital objects benefitted Favela Galeria, an open-air museum located in an underprivileged neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo. This was a foray into the world of NFTs for a good cause, according to Fernanda Romano, chief marketing officer at Alpargatas, the Havaianas parent company. \"Our intention was to enter the [NFT] conversation in an authentic way, and art is part of the history of this brand,\" she said in a statement.</p><p>Similarly, DKNY teamed up with art collective Obvious in January to create and auction an NFT of its new logo. As well as being a marketing initiative, this was also a charity initiative, with proceeds from the sale benefitting the American Nurses Foundation, which helps nurses in need.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future of digital fashion</emphasis></p><p>But the fashion and luxury industries aren't just using non-fungible tokens as a means of supporting causes. Above all, they see them as a way to push the limits of virtual fashion, a sector that has been booming since the beginning of the pandemic. Dolce &amp; Gabbana has clearly understood this, and recently offered nine digital garments and jewelry pieces for sale as NFTs in a unique collection entitled\u00a0Collezione Genesi.\u00a0</p><p>This was designed with and auctioned by UNXD, a platform specialized in luxury and digital culture. And clearly it was a great success: the pieces reportedly reached a total of 1,885,719 Ether (about $8 million). Some of them even appear to have been acquired by major NFT collectors like Pranksy and Seedphrase, according to the New York Times.</p><p>And that's just the beginning. Dolce &amp; Gabbana plans to launch DG Family, a crypto-community with four levels of membership, coming soon.

But because Ukraine and Russia are both major food exporters, the human toll will grow much larger, far from Ukraine's borders.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Ukraine's farms have turned into battlefields, uncertainty around the country's agricultural exports, as well as Russia's, has created a global food emergency by driving up the prices of wheat, corn, soybeans, fertilizers and sunflower oil.       </p><p>The prices of commodities like wheat and corn are global, but their shocks are inequitable. Wealthier countries and people can absorb sharp price increases. Meanwhile, people in poorer countries, like Sudan and Afghanistan, are finding it far more expensive to eat. In Sudan, rising wheat prices have caused the price of bread to roughly double. Because Ukraine and Russia exported livestock feed and fertilizer before the war, the cost and difficulty of producing food will increase in the months and years ahead.       </p><p>By tracking price increases of the foods that each nation imports, along with modeling countries' import needs, we can estimate which countries are most likely to struggle to fill the gap left by domestic shortfalls and feed their people over the coming months. In addition to Sudan and Afghanistan, Egypt is in for a difficult year. The country is the world's largest importer of wheat, which is 33 percent more expensive than it was at the end of last year.       </p><p>Unfortunately, many of these countries are facing other crises. Social safety nets have been worn thin by Covid-19. Oil prices remain high. And over half of low-income countries are in or at high risk of debt distress as interest rates rise, limiting their ability to borrow money to pay for food.       </p><p>Before the war, roughly 811 million people around the world did not have enough to eat. That number could increase tremendously this hunger season, the time between spring planting and fall harvest when food often runs out.       </p><p>Climate change will compound these risks. In key agricultural regions, drought conditions are worse today than they've been in decades.       </p><p>The war's many implications are distressing. Food crises often lead to social unrest, conflict, failed governments and mass migrations. For example, some researchers point to rising food prices as a driver of the Arab Spring upheavals in 2011.       </p><p>But history, especially food price crises around 2008 and 2010, reminds us that by using the latest data and science, the world can mount a comprehensive response to hunger.       </p><p>First, nations and institutions must move quickly to save lives. That starts with fully funding the World Food Program and leveraging existing food reserves to help countries in distress. The United Nations, the World Trade Organization and others must also work with countries to prevent food export bans, which are already undermining the global food supply.       </p><p>Second, the Group of 7 and China must lead a new round of emergency relief from official debt to enable vulnerable countries to respond to hunger. Debt relief was a boon to development in the early 2000s and could free up resources today. Multilateral financing institutions must also take aggressive action, using emergency instruments like a reallocation of International Monetary Fund special drawing rights, which can augment countries' official currency reserves.       </p><p>Third, over the long term, the world must help make vulnerable economies more food secure. The U.S. government's Feed the Future initiative, established in 2010 with bipartisan support, has helped transform agriculture in Africa and elsewhere. New investments in similar food systems' transformation, especially in regenerative agriculture, could make nations more resilient to energy, climate, health and geopolitical shocks.       </p><p>With a comprehensive strategy, the world can limit the scope of the war's hunger emergency. At a time of conflict and climate change, it will also begin the long-overdue process of making a more stable, sustainable global food system that can nourish everyone in a crisis-laden era.       </p><p>Graphics by Sara Chodosh.       </p><p>Sara Menker is the founder of Gro Intelligence, an artificial-intelligence company that forecasts global agricultural markets and the impacts of climate change.

As David Jensen, coordinator of the UN Environment Programme\u2019s (UNEP) Digital Transformation Task Force, said <url normalizedValue=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/brussels/\">at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Summit in Brussels</url>, \u201cTechnologies play an accelerating role; we must ensure they are accelerating solutions that tackle climate goals, and not inadvertently accelerating past or existing initiatives that hinder our progress in sustainability and make it harder to wean ourselves off entrenched approaches.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Christopher Wellise is the Director of Sustainability and Carbon of Amazon Web Services.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data is at the centre of this challenge and opportunity</emphasis></p><p>Like many business challenges, data is often important to understanding environmental problems. As a global community, we must use data in ways that benefit society. One great example is how artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to tackle deforestation. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/over-deloitte/articles/cognitive-deforestation-prevention.html\">Forest Foresight project was developed</url> by WWF using AWS technology to predict potential areas of illegal deforestation. </p><p>The process anticipates how illegal loggers will act based on past behavioural patterns. For instance, raw data concerning road locations was one of many input factors that informed forecasts, as roads provide easy logging transportation.\u00a0 Machine learning (ML) transforms raw data into predictive insights, empowering The WWF teams by predicating where the cutting will likely occur next.</p><p>Data is the fuel that feeds AI and ML which, in turn, ensure deeper insights can be drawn from the data and that better informed decisions can be made. The cloud enables the processing and integration of multiple data layers in real-time; cloud computing is crucial to ensuring that masses of unstructured data is usable, actionable, and can create large-scale human benefit.\u00a0</p><p>AWS recognises how costly and time-consuming it can be for researchers to acquire and analyse large sustainability datasets. Thus, in 2019, AWS launched the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI). Along with scientific organisations like NOAA, NASA, the UK Met Office, Meteo in France, and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/\">Finnish Meteorological Institute</url> , key datasets are identified, hosted and deployed on AWS Cloud and made publicly available. </p><p>This includes weather observations, weather forecasts, climate projection data, satellite imagery, hydrological data, air quality data, and ocean forecast data. ASDI enriches the public body of knowledge available to researchers, members of civil society as well and businesses that use this data to draw important insights, and innovation sustainable solutions.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Design sustainability is from the bottom up</emphasis></p><p>Business operations don\u2019t have to revolve around wildlife conservation to contribute to environmental sustainability; there are many tools and methods to building digital businesses sustainably. Firstly, AWS cloud computing is 80% more energy efficient than on-premises data centres*. </p><p>Secondly, AWS\u2019 Well-Architected Pillar of Sustainability gives organisations tools to minimise the environmental impact of running cloud workloads. This can involve simple choices like the using the right file format, kind of storage for your needs, or reducing compute needs by understanding times of peak demand.\u00a0</p><p>By encouraging our internal teams and customers to follow <url normalizedValue=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sustainability-pillar-well-architected-framework/\">these best practices</url>, a workload\u2019s\u00a0 resource consumption decreases. As teams can do more with less, we start to decouple business growth from resource usage \u2013 vital in ensuring that technologists operate sustainably.\u00a0</p><p>AWS continues to implement team- and company-wide initiatives that range from compression algorithms that reduce file storage size, to ensuring hardware and equipment are designed for maximal power efficiency, to employee incentives that galvanise collective behavioural shifts towards ongoing environmental reduction targets.\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-customer-carbon-footprint-tool/\">AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool</url> was developed to enable our customers to track the emissions of their AWS workloads, to forecast how numbers will change over time, and to achieve more sustainable outcomes. It takes into account the percentage of AWS\u2019 energy usage that comes from renewable sources as well as where customer workloads are hosted. </p><p>Thus, calculations will change as Amazon\u2019s various renewable energy projects come online (AWS is on track to power all operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025; Amazon is now the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in Europe and globally).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Together towards greener pastures</emphasis></p><p>Europe\u2019s transition to becoming a climate and digital leader is pushing the boundaries of technology and research. Governments and customers are demanding sustainable solutions. Europe is well placed to take advantage of the next wave of digital technologies.\u00a0 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>According to new report by independent consultancy Public First, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://awsdigitaldecade.publicfirst.co.uk/\">Digital Decade</url> could unlock over 2.8 trillion euros in gross value added (GVA), the measure of the value of goods and services produced in the region\u2019s economy, which is equivalent to nearly 21% of the European Union\u2019s (EU) current economy. </p><p>The study highlights that 55% of the estimated GVA gain depends on cloud computing. The challenge is that only 26% of European companies are using cloud computing today so there is a long way to go.\u00a0 Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of information technology (IT) resources on the internet.</p><p>Of the 2.8 Trillion in GVA, the EU is on track to unlock just \u20ac1.3 trillion in economic value by 2030. If the EU can accelerate progress, up to \u20ac1.5 trillion in additional economic value could be unlocked by 2030.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By doing so, the EU can dramatically boost skills, expand digital infrastructure, transform business, and modernize public services.</p><p>Evidence also shows that technology such as cloud, AI, ML have a net positive effect on businesses in addressing their own sustainability commitments. When this technology is supplemented with unprecedented levels of collaboration, it brings to the table previously unimaginable solutions to cross-continental challenges ranging from deforestation to regenerative agriculture to revolutionising sustainable mobility.\u00a0</p><p>Existential challenges for our environment and climate will not disappear any time soon; but with the breadth of technological solutions, the potential of cloud computing, and the passion that underpins individual dreams for a brighter future, we are all in a better placed to tackle them than ever before.</p><p>*Based on 451 research</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectiondigitalopinionacceleratingsustainableoutcomesforeuropesfuturewithcloudandmachinelearning</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CH-8811-JCMC-W2T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1093\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

One county scheduled 19 nights of meetings to debate one wind farm.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MONTICELLO, Ill. - Depressed property values. Flickering shadows. Falling ice. One by one, a real estate appraiser rattled off what he said were the deleterious effects of wind farms as a crowd in an agricultural community in central Illinois hung on his every word.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the tenth night of hearings by the Piatt County zoning board, as a tiny town debated the merits of a proposed industrial wind farm that would see dozens of enormous turbines rise from the nearby soybean and corn fields. There were nine more hearings scheduled.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's painful,\" said Kayla Gallagher, a cattle farmer who lives nearby and is opposed to the project. \"Nobody wants to be here.\"       </p><p>In the fight against global warming, the federal government is pumping a record $370 billion into clean energy, President Biden wants the nation's electricity to be 100 percent carbon-free by 2035, and many states and utilities plan to ramp up wind and solar power.       </p><p>But while policymakers may set lofty goals, the future of the American power grid is in fact being determined in town halls, county courthouses and community buildings across the country.       </p><p>The only way Mr. Biden's ambitious goals will be met is if rural communities, which have large tracts of land necessary for commercial wind and solar farms, can be persuaded to embrace renewable energy projects. Lots of them.       </p><p>According to an analysis by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the United States would need to construct more than 6,000 projects like the Monticello one in order to run the economy on solar, wind, nuclear or other forms of nonpolluting energy.       </p><p>In Piatt County, population 16,000, the project at issue is Goose Creek Wind, which has been proposed by Apex Clean Energy, a developer of wind and solar farms based in Virginia. Apex spent years negotiating leases with 151 local landowners and trying to win over the community, donating to the 4-H Club and a mental health center.       </p><p>Now, it was making its case to the zoning board, which will send a recommendation to the county board that will make a final call on whether Apex can proceed. If completed, the turbines, each of them 610 feet tall, would march across 34,000 acres of farmland.       </p><p>The $500 million project is expected to generate 300 megawatts, enough to power about 100,000 homes. The renewable, carbon-free electricity would help power a grid that currently is fed by a mix of nuclear, natural gas, coal, and some existing wind turbines.       </p><p>But with more and more renewable energy projects under construction around the country, resistance is growing, especially in rural communities in the Great Plains and Midwest.       </p><p>\"To meet any kind of clean energy goals which brings consumer benefits and energy independence, you're going to see an increase in projects,\" said JC Sandberg, interim chief executive of the American Clean Power Association. \"And with those increases in projects, we are facing more of these challenges.\"       </p><p>On Election Day last month, Apex saw its development efforts for a wind farm in Ohio die when voters in Crawford County overwhelmingly voted to uphold a ban on such projects. On the same day, voters in Michigan rejected ordinances that would have allowed construction of another Apex wind project. Earlier this month, local officials in Monroe County, Mich., extended a temporary moratorium on industrial solar projects, delaying plans by Apex to develop a solar farm in the area.       </p><p>\"Projects have been getting more contentious,\" said Sarah Banas Mills, a lecturer at the school for environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan who has studied renewable development in the Midwest. \"The low hanging fruit places have been taken.\"       </p><p>In Piatt County, the zoning board decided to conduct a mock trial of sorts. During the first nine hearings, Apex and its witnesses made the case that property values would not decline and that other concerns about wind farms - that they are ugly, that they kill birds, or that the low frequency noise they emit can adversely affect human health - were not major issues.       </p><p>They won some converts. Meg Miner, 61, a resident who was on the fence about the project, decided to support Apex after considering how the project would help fight climate change.       </p><p>But others were worried about all the issues that the real estate appraiser mentioned, and more. \"I moved here for nature, for trees, for crops,\" said Sandy Coyle, who lives nearby and opposed the project. \"I'm not interested in living near an industrial wind farm.\"       </p><p>Much of that skepticism appeared to be earnest concern from community members who weren't sold on the project's overall merits. On the fringe of the debate, however, was a digital misinformation campaign designed to distort the facts about wind energy.       </p><p>The website of a group called Save Piatt County!, which opposes the project, is rife with fallacies about renewable energy and inaccuracies about climate science. On Facebook pages, residents opposed to the project shared negative stories about wind power, following a playbook that has been honed in recent years by anti-wind activists, some of whom have ties to the fossil fuel industry. The organizers of the website and Facebook groups did not reply to requests for comment.       </p><p>As part of the Goose Creek Wind project, Apex has secured a commitment from Rivian, the upstart electric truck company, to buy power from the project, a development that drew skeptical replies in one Facebook group. \"Scam artists in it together to fleece middle class taxpayers,\" wrote one local resident in response to a news story about the deal. \"Wake up.\"       </p><p>That milieu of misinformation appeared to sway some residents.       </p><p>\"These things are intrusive,\" said Kelly Vetter, a retiree who opposed the project and disputed the overwhelming scientific consensus that carbon dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels is dangerously warming the planet. \"The company's never going to have the community's interest at heart.\"       </p><p>Apex declined to comment.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Economics takes precedence'</emphasis></p><p>Smack in the middle of the area where Apex wants to erect its turbines sits the Bragg family's farm, a roughly 1,500-acre plot that on a cold December afternoon was little more than an expanse of mud following the fall harvest and a week of rain.       </p><p>Braxton Bragg, 40, who grew up on the land and returned following stints in the Peace Corps that took him to Mali and Mongolia, supports the project. He is concerned about climate change, and said he already sees its effects. The rain is harder when it comes, the cold sets in later than it used to, and overall, the growing season is less predictable than it was when his grandfather worked the same land.       </p><p>But his support for wind comes down to economics. Mr. Bragg has agreed to let Apex site one of its turbines on his property, and expects to earn about $50,000 a year if it is built.       </p><p>\"It's not going to save the farm or allow me to retire,\" he said. \"But just having that steady income every year, you know what you're going to get.\"       </p><p>A few miles down the road is Gallagher Farms, another multigenerational operation. Like Mr. Bragg, Ms. Gallagher, 34, believes in climate change. She has invested in cover crops, which absorb carbon and lock it away in the soil, and other regenerative agriculture practices.       </p><p>But Ms. Gallagher is opposed to the project. The aerial seeding of cover crops will cost more with wind turbines nearby and make it harder for her to sustainably farm. The use of heavy equipment to install turbines can disrupt drainage patterns in agricultural land, and Ms. Gallagher believes her farm will suffer.       </p><p>Adding to her frustration is the fact that about 70 percent of the landowners who have agreed to let Apex put turbines on their property live outside Piatt County.       </p><p>\"They don't live here, so they're not impacted,\" Ms. Gallagher said as she tended to her cattle before heading to yet another hearing.       </p><p>More than anything else, Ms. Gallagher fears that the wind turbines, which she would see from her front porch, would disrupt the bucolic land she loves. In the predawn hours, she walks outside and listens to the crickets, which she worries will be drowned out by the low thrum of the turbines. At night, she watches the sun set over a grain silo in the west, and doesn't want the view marred by spinning turbines and flashing lights.       </p><p>\"We all want what's good for society,\" she said. \"But it seems to be coming at the expense of our day to day lives.\"       </p><p>Mr. Bragg was sympathetic. \"The only real argument that is valid, in my opinion, is that it's going to change people's sunsets and the beauty of living out in the country,\" he said.       </p><p>Still, he said, this was working farmland, and it was his right to put it to productive use.       </p><p>\"If you put your nice country house in the middle of my of my business, I'm sorry, there's not much I can do about that,\" Mr. Bragg said. \"I think they probably would do the same thing if they were in my boat. The economics takes precedence over everything.\"       </p><p>Landowners like the Braggs would receive about $210 million in lease payments over the project's 30-year life, Apex said. There would be other economic benefits including $90 million in local taxes. And if the project is built, the company said it would it would create eight permanent jobs, and employ nearly 600 people during construction, including men like Brendan Burton.       </p><p>Mr. Burton, an ironworker who has helped build several nearby wind farms, said the jobs would help fill the void created by factories that have closed or moved overseas.       </p><p>\"We're not building things here like we used to,\" he said. \"We need the jobs.\"       </p><p>Mr. Burton added that he wanted to see his community contribute clean energy to the grid as well.       </p><p>\"We can't keep burning coal or natural gas,\" he said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'We're going to make people angry'</emphasis></p><p>The debate in Piatt County has been remarkably civil. Similar hearings elsewhere have descended into shouting matches. In some cases, activists with ties to organizations that shield their donors have turned communities against proposed wind and solar projects.       </p><p>That was the case in Monroe County, Mich., where local officials recently extended a moratorium that is blocking Apex from developing a solar project.       </p><p>The opposition in Monroe County includes local residents, but also anti-wind activists with ties to groups backed by Koch Industries, which owns oil refineries, petrochemical plants and thousands of miles of oil and gas pipelines. On Facebook, those skeptical of the Apex project shared negative stories about solar power, and opponents of the project went door to door distributing misinformation.       </p><p>On another cold night in December, as the 11th hearing on the Goose Creek Wind project began at the Monticello community building, Phil Luetkehans, a lawyer hired by opponents of the project, called more witnesses, including an audiologist, who discussed what he said were the adverse health effects of wind turbines. A lawyer representing Apex cross-examined him, and the hearing stretched for more than four hours.       </p><p>\"Both sides are getting a full opportunity to portray their position and to put forth the facts, and the people who we elect will make those final decisions,\" Mr. Luetkehans said. \"Some communities end up saying, 'No, we don't want an industrial scale wind at this proximity to homes.' Others say, 'Yeah, we want the money.'\"       </p><p>Among those in the audience was Michael Beem, a newly elected member of the Piatt County board, which will ultimately decide whether Apex can build its wind farm. From the back of the room, Mr. Beem was bracing himself to make a choice that will undoubtedly leave this rural community divided.       </p><p>\"No matter what decision we make,\" he said, \"we're going to make people angry.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008675920</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6778-BNC1-JC85-N14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 3, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"74\"><className>Assessments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjIwOUNEOUU1RUQ5NEU3OTkyNUQxRjJFNkIzQjY3OTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjkxRkVDMkNDMjBGNDdFMkI1RDQ3Nzk4QjgwOTBGQjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N221119OM</classCode><className>WIND POWER PLANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100QG</classCode><className>COUNTY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DAAS</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE VALUATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPLO</classCode><className>WIND ENERGY INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000418</classCode><className>COUNTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Earnings per share decreased by 43.5% to CHF 3.42 on a reported basis, mainly reflecting the 2021 gain on the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares.Free cash flow was CHF 6.6 billion, as working capital increased temporarily in the context of supply chain constraints and capital expenditure remained above historic trendlines.Board proposes a dividend of CHF 2.95 per share, an increase of 15 centimes, marking 28 consecutive years of dividend growth. In total, CHF 18.2 billion were returned to shareholders in 2022 through a combination of dividend and share buybacks.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023 outlook:</emphasis>we expect organic sales growth between 6% and 8% and underlying trading operating profit margin between 17.0% and 17.5%.

Inflation surged to unprecedented levels, cost of living pressures intensified, and the effects of geopolitical tensions were felt around the world.</p><p>The entire Nestl\u00e9 team demonstrated dependability, as we navigated this difficult environment. Organic growth was solid, margins continued to be resilient, and our underlying earnings per share development was strong. At the same time, we ensured access to nutritious products and affordable offerings globally.</p><p>During 2022, we also confirmed our longstanding nutrition strategy, with Good for You, Good for the Planet at its heart. We took important actions to further strengthen our industry-leading responsible marketing practices and to provide transparency on the nutritional value of our global portfolio. At the same time, we also advanced the implementation of our climate roadmap.</p><p>Looking to 2023, we expect another year of robust organic growth, with a focus on restoring our gross margin, stepping up marketing investments and increasing free cash flow. Nestl\u00e9's value creation model puts us in a strong position to achieve our 2025 targets and to generate reliable, sustainable shareholder returns.\"</p><p>Group Results</p><p><sup>*</sup>2021 figures restated following the creation of Zone North America (NA) and Zone Greater China (GC) as of January 1, 2022.

Pricing increased to 8.2%, reflecting significant cost inflation. RIG was positive at 0.1%, following a high base of comparison in 2021, supply constraints and portfolio optimization actions.</p><p>Organic growth was 7.1% in developed markets, driven by pricing. In emerging markets, organic growth was 10.0%, supported by both pricing and RIG.</p><p>By product category, Purina PetCare was the largest contributor to organic growth, with continued momentum for science-based and premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Purina ONE and Fancy Feast, as well as veterinary products.

Starting next month, the company will begin making the nutritional value of its global portfolio transparent, using an external, internationally recognized model for reporting. Nestl\u00e9 will also start reporting on local portfolios in 14 countries, using local external benchmarks. In addition, Nestl\u00e9 recently strengthened its responsible marketing practices, voluntarily restricting its marketing to kids under the age of 16. The company wants to be at the forefront of the industry when it comes to bringing balanced diets within reach for people around the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On 'Good for the Planet'</emphasis>, Nestl\u00e9's greenhouse gas emissions are now below the 2018 levels, based on SBTi standards, even as the company has continued to grow since then. The biggest part of Nestl\u00e9's emissions come from activities within its supply chain (Scope 3), which is why the company is heavily focused on reducing them through the sourcing of its raw materials and regenerative agriculture. It is working with farmers all over the world to help them make the transition to regenerative agriculture. It is sourcing more volumes from farmers who make that transition, while providing technical and financial support to help other farmers start. Through the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan 2030, for example, Nestl\u00e9 is piloting a financial support scheme to encourage coffee farmers to accelerate the shift.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is also tackling the emissions it has more direct control over (Scope 1 and 2). It is using its R&amp;D expertise and innovation capabilities to adapt recipes to lower the emissions of new and established products. Nestl\u00e9 is becoming more energy efficient and ramping up its use of renewable electricity. In fact, the company is on track to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In North America, for example, Nestl\u00e9 completed a large-scale solar energy farm and invested in two more. Combined, the solar energy farms will supply approximately 80% of Nestl\u00e9's energy in the U.S. and reduce its carbon emissions by 3.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalents.</p><p>Additionally, Nestl\u00e9 is implementing nature-based solutions where it sources its raw materials to remove emissions and store them in the ground. In Nicaragua, for instance, the company reached its 2022 goal of planting one million trees, as part of a six-year reforestation project to plant 8.6 million trees on the Nescaf\u00e9 and dairy farms from which Nestl\u00e9 sources. The project is estimated to capture about 3.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalents over 20 years. It is expected to improve biodiversity and forest connectivity, to protect water sheds and to provide job opportunities.</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023 outlook:</emphasis>we expect organic sales growth between 6% and 8% and underlying trading operating profit margin between 17.0% and 17.5%.

Terracing the hills, tilling as little as possible and sowing plants like buckwheat and crimson clover prevented topsoil from eroding. And using varieties suitable to the climate of the area reaped larger harvests while requiring fewer environmentally hazardous substances like pesticides and fertilizers.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These techniques, known as regenerative or climate-smart agriculture, are a cornerstone of the Agriculture Department's approach to addressing a warming planet. For Ms. Klaunig, the practices yield practical benefits and adhere to her convictions, but it remains to be seen whether more widespread deployment of such methods - as the administration has sought to encourage - can truly reverse the effects of climate change.       </p><p>\"Trying to constantly balance what the land needs versus what we need from the land - that's what it is for me,\" Ms. Klaunig said. The important thing for the land is to \"not leave it barren and eroding over the winter,\" she added.       </p><p>The Biden administration committed $22 billion this summer toward Agriculture Department programs using that approach, the largest federal investment to date in climate-smart practices. The funding makes good on a pledge from President Biden in his first week in office to encourage such practices in a sector that produces about 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.       </p><p>Mr. Biden has heralded the potential of these techniques to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as carbon in the soil, thereby reducing the effect of the planet-warming gases. However, scientists still have not determined just how much and for how long carbon can be sequestered and how to even measure any impact.       </p><p>Nonetheless, farmers, experts and the federal government broadly agree that these practices confer benefits like improving soil and water health, building resilience against drought and enhancing biodiversity.       </p><p>\"All these things together are going to be helping with the mitigation and adaptation side of climate-smart agriculture,\" said Caitlin Welsh, an expert on food security and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington.       </p><p>Scott Faber, the vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, said that farmers played a critical role in ensuring a habitable planet.       </p><p>\"We tend to believe that farmers are good stewards of that land,\" he added, but said that positive perception could change. \"That belief will be shattered if and when agriculture is 30 percent of U.S. emissions.\"       </p><p>The bulk of the federal funding, about $19.5 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act that Mr. Biden signed last month, would shore up existing agricultural conservation programs that encourage climate-smart practices. The Agriculture Department announced in recent weeks that it would spend an additional $2.8 billion to enact and research climate-smart production on 20 million to 25 million acres of working lands.       </p><p>Demand for the existing conservation programs has long exceeded the amount of funding that the Agriculture Department has been able to provide, and half to two-thirds of farmers who apply are turned away each year. Likewise, the department received over 1,000 applications for the climate-smart pilot projects that totaled $20 billion in requested assistance, Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said at a news conference this month.       </p><p>\"Farmers want to do these types of conservation programs,\" said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a Minnesota-based research and advocacy nonprofit. \"This is a significant step. We need this money and these resources to help farmers transition.\"       </p><p>Currently, climate-smart agriculture remains a niche but growing trend. The latest Census of Agriculture estimated that farmers use no-tillage systems - planting crops directly into the land without digging or turning the soil - on about 100 million acres of cropland. Farmers also planted cover crops, sown to prevent erosion and to increase moisture, on about 15 million acres out of 900 million total of farmland in the United States.       </p><p>Farmers who tapped into existing conservation programs have observed firsthand the ecological and economic benefits of such climate-smart practices.       </p><p>Seth Watkins, who raises cows on about 2,800 acres in southwest Iowa, said that employing practices like rotational grazing and planting clover as a cover crop has attracted Monarch butterflies and songbirds to his farm - and has also helped his bottom line.       </p><p>He has bought less store feed for his cows, which now graze longer on pasture. Their health has improved from fresh air and grass, translating to reduced veterinary bills. He has also had less fuel to buy for his tractor and no purchases of fertilizer because of the nutrients that his soil has regenerated.       </p><p>\"My savings came because I reduced my fossil fuel usage across the board,\" he said. \"We cannot allow agriculture to continue to be dependent on finite resources.\"       </p><p>In nearby Indiana, Brian Scott has for a decade been planting cover crops like radish and ryegrass on about a quarter to a third of a 2,400-acre farm where he also grows corn, soybeans and wheat. He has also refrained from tilling his land for several years.       </p><p>\"For us, really the reason to do it was less labor and equipment,\" he said. With the increase in available funding, Mr. Scott hopes to apply for another round to expand the cover crops.       </p><p>On her organic vegetable farm in Pennsylvania, Hannah Smith Brubaker has converted cornfields into pastures; planted rows of trees known as windbreaks to control erosion and protect against high gusts; and constructed grass waterways or channels seeded with vegetation to collect water.       </p><p>\"We've had drought so bad this year,\" she said. \"And if we didn't have some of these conservation practices installed, I don't know what we would do. We might just be closing up shop because our soil would be so dry.\"       </p><p>Their experiences are reflected in the data. A March report from the Agriculture Department assessing the effect of its conservation programs over a decade found that these practices helped reduce water erosion by 76 million tons and wind erosion by 94 million tons per year. Average annual fuel use also decreased by 110 million gallons of diesel, equivalent to 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.       </p><p>Still, experts cautioned that to truly make a dent in agricultural emissions, the programs needed to discourage practices with noted harms and incentivize farming and ranching practices that have proven consequences.       </p><p>Ms. Welsh of the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the existing programs and the new grants did not do enough to directly address a major source of emissions from farming: fertilizers. They release nitrous oxide, a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.       </p><p>Encouraging more precise fertilizer application and incentivizing more sustainable manufacturing processes \"would have benefits for both climate change and also benefits producers, given the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine and the high price of fertilizers right now,\" she said.       </p><p>Mr. Lilliston said the additional funding, while a good start, was \"not transformative and doesn't address the fundamental system.\" That system, along with agricultural policies, incentivizes practices that are not so good for the planet, he said.       </p><p>\"Large-scale commodity production requires a lot of fertilizer use and pesticide use,\" he said. \"The core farm bill programs that lock those systems in place are still there.\"       </p><p>Of the hundreds of practices encouraged by existing conservation programs, only a few dozen could actually mitigate climate change, Mr. Faber argued. According to research from the Environmental Working Group, just 20 percent of funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, one of the Agriculture Department's largest conservation programs, supports practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most funding helps farmers and ranchers with structural projects, like installing irrigation systems, that do not curb emissions.       </p><p>\"We're very supportive of these programs because they're our best chance to reduce emissions,\" he said.       </p><p>But, he added, \"there's a real risk based on recent history - not to just past, long ago history - that a lot of this funding will be squandered.\"       </p><p>Mr. Watkins, a self-described \"tree hugger,\" was more hopeful. He recalled a recent lunchtime conversation with two neighbors who are new to farming and regenerative agriculture. They recently received funding to convert some farmland to pasture - \"something that wouldn't have happened without EQIP because they just don't have the margins right now.\"       </p><p>Farms can become \"little oases when we build these projects,\" he said. \"Nature is so forgiving. You give her half a chance, and she gives so much back. I think that's what this is about.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008537177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66GK-18W1-DYR7-C00V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 28, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Business &amp;

Or maybe the selection I chose in early January had not fully recovered from holiday bingeing, when people buy far more wine than they do at any other time.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Either way, this list for winter 2023 looks different to me. Staples like cru Beaujolais? I could not find good bottles under $20. Bottles from Germany? Nope. Italy? I found plenty of French and Italian wines, but not from popular, higher-status regions.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hardest hit country in my selection was the United States, with only one American wine, a chambourcin from Virginia. It was a delicious wine, but no American cabernet sauvignons, pinot noirs, chardonnays or rieslings made the list.       </p><p>My choices were limited because I wanted to branch out from American producers whom I've cited repeatedly. These producers have been a great source of inexpensive wines year after year, names like Broadside and Foxglove from Paso Robles, The Whole Shebang and Tendu, which sell under the California appellation, Montinore Estate in Oregon, and any number of bottles from the Finger Lakes. We'll revisit them another time.       </p><p>I've long believed that the best values in wine can be found in the $15 to $25 range. Myriad wines sell for less than $15, including many American bottles that younger Americans are apparently no longer buying, according to a recent report on the American wine industry from Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, Calif. But to sell bottles for under $15, producers, especially those in the United States, where labor and land costs are often higher, must compromise.       </p><p>They scale up, industrializing both the farming and the winemaking. The wines they make are sound, and might even be delicious, but something is often lost, a sense of place, soulfulness or whatever you want to call it.       </p><p>A little bit more money, though, say $15 to $20, can buy those qualities in wines from lesser-known places, made often from little-known grapes. It takes a spirit of adventure to try, say, a blend of grasevina and gr\u00fcner veltliner from Austria, a pa\u00eds from Chile or a chambourcin from Virginia. Some people are not interested, which is fine, but the rewards are many.       </p><p>For more than a decade I've been offering selections of 20 bottles under $20. Some people have suggested that I raise the price cap to reflect the effect of inflation. But I resist that because plenty of these less-familiar values are still in a $15 to $20 sweet spot.       </p><p>Because these wines are not mass-produced, they will not be available everywhere. That can often prove frustrating to people who want a particular bottle immediately.       </p><p>I get that, but I think that it's simply good to know these wines exist in the world, even if they are not right at hand. You might see some of them on a restaurant wine list next month, or in the nearest good wine shop next vintage. You never know.       </p><p>If you have a good wine shop, ask the proprietor for suggestions if a particular bottle is not available. Often, you might find something akin to it.       </p><p>This winter list is weighted toward red, though I think whites and sparklers will always have a place no matter what the season. Here are the 20 bottles, beginning with the least expensive and rising up to $20.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maris</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Pays d'Oc Rouge I.G.P. 2020, 14 percent, $14.99</emphasis></p><p>Pays d'Oc is a large region in southern France for wines that don't conform to the stricter rules of the Languedoc or Roussillon appellations, which makes sense for Maris, something of a maverick producer that farms organically with careful attention to biodiversity and the environment. This bottle (70 percent merlot, 30 percent syrah) is juicy, focused, refreshing and an excellent value. (Vintners Alliance, New Rochelle, N.Y.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bertha</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Cava Brut Nature Reserva 2020, 11.5 percent, $15.99</emphasis></p><p>Good cava is one of the best values you can find in sparkling wine. All cava must be made the same way as Champagne, with a second, bubbles-inducing fermentation in the bottle. Bertha is made from the trio of classic Catalonian cava grapes - xarello, macabeo and parellada - and it's bone dry, a little bit creamy, with attractive herbal and citrus flavors. (Classic Wines, Stamford, Conn.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Corbi\u00e8res 2020, 13.5 percent, $15.99</emphasis></p><p>I'm drawn to Faillenc Sainte Marie because, in a world of overly polished wines, this is an old school, rough and rustic red that reminds me of the sort of bottles I used to find from the south of France when I was learning about wine in the 1980s. Call it nostalgia if you like, and maybe it is. But this bottle, an equal blend of syrah, grenache and cinsault fermented together, is herbal, fruity and tannic, a wine without makeup or artifice. (Rosenthal Wine Merchant, New York)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pedro Parra y Familia</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Itata Vinista Pa\u00eds 2020, 13 percent, $15.99</emphasis></p><p>Pedro Parra of Chile has a day job, traveling the world as a terroir and geological consultant for an all-star roster of winemakers. But he is also an excellent producer in his own right, specializing in making wines from old vineyards in the Itata region, an area that has recently been threatened by forest fires. This one is from 100-year-old vines of pa\u00eds, also known as mission, a grape brought to the New World by the Spanish. It's herbal and refreshing with just the slightest sandpapery rasp to the texture. (Skurnik Wines, New York)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brigaldara</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Valpolicella 2021, 13 percent, $15.99</emphasis></p><p>Classic Valpolicella is a straightforward style, made without the added power and richness that comes with the increasingly popular ripasso method, in which the wine macerates with grape skins left over from Amarone production. Good classic examples, like this bottle from Brigaldara, are pure and easy, with floral aromas and flavors of sweet cherry that resolve with a refreshing bitterness. Pizza and Valpolicella is an excellent combination. (Vinifera Imports, Lake Ronkonkoma, N.Y.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Luis Pato Portugal Baga Espumante Bruto Rosado NV, 12.5 percent, $15.99</emphasis></p><p>Luis Pato is one of the pillars of the modern wine industry in the Bairrada region of Portugal. This ros\u00e9 sparkling wine, like the Bertha cava, is made with a second fermentation occurring in the bottle, producing the carbonation. It's made of the region's best red grape, baga, and is fresh and lively, with light fruit and herbal flavors. (Wine In Motion, Newark)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gaia</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Retsina Ritinitis Nobilis NV, 12.5 percent, $16.99</emphasis></p><p>Retsina is a style, made since antiquity, in which wine is blended with the resin of the Aleppo pine. Serious retsinas, like this one, are great. Gaia uses mountain-grown roditis grapes and fresh resin to produce this fresh, sharp and savory wine. Try it with any sort of Greek or Middle Eastern food, or simply experiment. (Winebow, New York)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michel Guignier</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Beaujolais 2021, 12.5 percent, $17.99</emphasis></p><p>I especially like the '21 Guignier Beaujolais, which rises above the potential of the straightforward Beaujolais appellation, the lowest level of the region's hierarchy of potential. This bottle, made with organically farmed fruit, has beautiful flavors of red fruit underpinned by earthy minerality that gives it unexpected depth. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Muga</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rioja White 2021, 13.5 percent, $18.96</emphasis></p><p>This white Rioja from Muga, one of the region's leading estates, is wonderfully appealing. It's made of viura, garnacha blanca and malvasia, a traditional blend, and, though it's aged in oak, it's fresh and lively, with just enough of a rub of tannin to give it a bit of texture. (Fine Estates From Spain, Dedham, Mass.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Giordano Lombardo</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Gavi 2021, 13 percent, $18.99</emphasis></p><p>This energetic white, made with organically grown cortese grapes, has all the liveliness you'd expect in a Gavi, with the added bonus of lemon and mineral flavors and a satisfying weight to the texture. This is a good one for all manner of seafood. (Massanois, New York)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Altos Las Hormigas</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Uco Valley Terroir Malbec 2019, 13.5 percent, $19</emphasis></p><p>This is one of the most reliable malbec producers in the Mendoza region of Argentina, with wines that are always balanced and tapered rather than sweetly fruity. Intended to express the character of the high-altitude Uco Valley, this bottle is intense yet fresh, lightly tannic and fruity, just right for burgers or skirt steak. (Skurnik Wines)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jasci</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Trebbiano d'Abruzzo 2021, 13.5 percent, $19</emphasis></p><p>Jasci is one of a growing number of small producers who have turned Abruzzo into a great source for exciting wines. Its Trebbiano d'Abruzzo is made out of the high-quality trebbiano Abruzzese grape, rather than the more run-of-the-mill trebbiano Toscano. The grapes are farmed organically and trained on overhead pergolas, a traditional method that many have rejected as out of date, though some thoughtful producers are finding that older generations might have had excellent reasons to prefer it. The wine is clear, pure, textured and refreshing. (Massanois)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ch\u00e2teau Peybonhomme-les-Tours</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Blaye C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux Le Blanc Bonhomme 2020, 13.5 percent, $19.96</emphasis></p><p>Ch\u00e2teau Peybonhomme-les-Tours is one of my favorite Bordeaux producers. The wines are always excellent, they are great values and they're made from biodynamically farmed grapes. That's the way the owners, the Hubert family, which has a stable of labels, does business. This terrific white, from the sandy soils of Blaye (45 percent sauvignon blanc, 45 percent s\u00e9millon and 10 percent colombard) is uncommonly rich, deep and textured, yet dry and perfectly refreshing. (Summit Selections, Staten Island, N.Y.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ch\u00e2teau de Chaintres</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Saumur Champigny Les Sables 2020, 13.5 percent, $19.96</emphasis></p><p>This is the first bottle I've had from Ch\u00e2teau de Chaintres, but it will not be the last. The 2020 Les Sables is an excellent Saumur Champigny red, made entirely from biodynamically farmed cabernet franc grapes. It's rich yet focused, with earthy flavors of dark fruits and flowers, and it has just enough tannic structure to stand up to a steak or juicy roast. (Rosenthal Wine Merchant)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Orto Vins</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Montsant Les Argiles d'Orto Vins 2019, 14.5 percent, $19.96</emphasis></p><p>Montsant is often a great source for value in rich, structured wines from Catalonia in northeastern Spain, and Orto Vins is one of my favorite Montsant producers. It farms biodynamically, practices regenerative agriculture and makes its wine carefully. Les Argiles is mostly garnacha with about 10 percent carignan grown on clay soils, which gives the wine volume and power. Nonetheless, it's fresh and tapered, and would go well with roasts and stews. (Hogshead Wine Company, Weymouth, Mass.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ch\u00e2teau Puech Redon</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Vin de France Apparente Rouge 2019, 12 percent, $19.96</emphasis></p><p>Cyril Cuche, the proprietor of Ch\u00e2teau Puech Redon in Languedoc, maintains a polyculture at this large estate, a mix of grains, organically farmed grapes, woods and fields. Mr. Cuche, with the aid of \u00c9ric Texier, the excellent Rh\u00f4ne producer, makes this red, mostly cinsault, without any added sulfur dioxide, a stabilizer and antioxidant omitted by only the most militant natural producers. It is delicious, lightly tannic with fresh flavors of red fruits and herbs. (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nittnaus</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Burgenland Anita Red Blend 2018, 12.5 percent, $19.96</emphasis></p><p>Hans and Anita Nittnaus make beautiful wines in the Burgenland region of eastern Austria, including this juicy, deeply fruity blend, mostly zweigelt with blaufr\u00e4nkisch, St. Laurent and merlot. Natural wine fans might call it \"glou glou,\" a French phrase meant to convey the sound of wine rapidly pouring down your throat. I'll settle for thirst-quenching and straightforwardly delicious. (Rosenthal Wine Merchant)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Meinklang</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Burgenland White 2020, 11 percent, $19.96</emphasis></p><p>This striking white, from eastern Austria near the Hungarian border, is nothing like the usual white wine that might be served by the glass in a restaurant. It's got personality and character, and it won't appeal to everybody. It's made of 50 percent gr\u00fcner veltliner, 40 percent grasevina (also known in Burgenland as welschriesling) and 10 percent muscat, which may account for its powerfully fruity perfume and cornucopia of flavors. It's pure and alive, typical of Meinklang, a mixed-use farm that grows everything biodynamically. (Zev Rovine Selections/Fruit of the Vines, Long Island City, N.Y.)       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Early Mountain Vineyards</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Virginia Chambourcin Young Wine 2021, 11.5 percent, $19.99</emphasis></p><p>I haven't had great luck with wines from Virginia or with chambourcin, a hybrid red grape. But this is an excellent example of both, a wine that makes the most of what it is rather than trying to be something it is not. By that I mean it's fresh, fruity and gentle, unimpeded by intrusive winemaking, a refreshing, low-alcohol delight that would be just right for friends watching a game. I've had some very good wines from Early Mountain, which is owned by Jean Case, whose husband, Steve, used to be the chief executive of something called AOL.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Domaine Tatsis</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Macedonia Xinomavro-Negoska Young Vines 2017, 13 percent, $19.99</emphasis></p><p>The Tatsis brothers, Periklis and Stergios, farm biodynamically in the Macedonia region of northern Greece and make wines with minimal processing. This bottle, made of a blend of xinomavro and negoska, is a lovely introduction. It's fragrant with aromas of menthol and licorice and, though made of young vines, is structured enough for lamb chops or roasted meats. (DNS Wines/T.

In our canned and frozen activities, both retail and foodservice, our innovations and the policy of price increases, designed to compensate for rising production costs, have enabled us to maintain the group's profitability.</p><p>In Europe, although our fresh segment is more sensitive to the overall decline in consumption, the recovery and innovation plans initiated in our core businesses are on an encouraging trajectory, particularly in the ready-to-use fresh segment. In North America, the refocusing of activities on valued segments is continuing in parallel with the adaptation of in the industrial set up on the East Coast of the United States.</p><p>In all zones, the teams are mobilizing to offset the impact of the inflationary shock in the short term and to ensure our medium-term growth relays, enabling the group, in an environment that is more uncertain and volatile than ever, to confirm the annual objectives announced in October 2022.</p><p>Our mission, to inspire the transition toward a plant-based diet, guides us in the long term towards becoming a positive impact company. More than ever we are convinced that performance can only be called such if it has a positive impact. The price increase agreements signed in France, based on a strong commitment to \"trickle down\" to our farming partners, the B Corp certification of our Bonduelle Fresh Americas business unit, the development of our renewable energy supplies linked to a long-standing policy of sobriety and decarbonization, and the successful relocation in Europe of pulses cultivation channels, all demonstrate the relevance of our roadmaps.</p><p>*******</p><p>The 2022-2023 half-year financial statements were approved by the General Partner, then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of March 2, 2023 and by the Statutory Auditors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Significant</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Revenue</emphasis></p><p>The Bonduelle Group's revenue for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of financial year 2022-2023 amounted to (EURO) 1,243.4 million, compared with (EURO) 1,094.6 million for the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the previous financial year which represents a growth of +13.6% at current exchange rates and +6.1% on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>with favorable currency variations boosting sales growth by +7.5%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activity</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">by</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Geographic</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Region</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activity</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">by Operating Segments</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe Zone</emphasis></p><p>The Europe Zone representing 59.4% of the business activity over the period, posted an overall growth of +11.4% at current exchange rates and +12.3% on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>over the 1<sup>st</sup>half of the year, with all technologies showing growth over the period.</p><p>The policy of price increase intended to partially compensate for inflations in production costs continues, particularly in canned and frozen activities. A limited decline in volumes over the period is explained by the quotas applied to certain products following a deficit harvest.</p><p>The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service, which is continuing its post-covid recovery, and in retail (success of recent innovations launched, in particular under the Cassegrain brand).</p><p>The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed), where cost increases, and therefore price increases, are more limited, showed growth in value and a stability in volumes. Supply difficulties and less dynamic markets in salads were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-Europe Zone</emphasis></p><p>The Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of the business activity in the 1<sup>st</sup>half year, posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>.</p><p>In an uncertain geopolitical context, the Eurasia zone posted higher revenue (canned and frozen), linked to price increases, with volumes in this area slightly down on the previous year.</p><p>In North America, the ready-to-use fresh segment declined over the period, impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2<sup>nd</sup>half of financial year 2021-2022, by a salad segment that was itself in decline, and on the other hand by an agronomic crisis affecting salad yields in the Salinas region, generating a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In this context, the Bonduelle Group decided to adapt its manufacturing set up on the East Coast of the United States to the expected level of activity and refocused on profitable business segments (see below).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Operating income</emphasis></p><p>The Bonduelle Group's recurring operating profitability for the first half of 2022-2023 stands at (EURO) 43.1 million, up 56.1% on reported figures and 60.9% on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>with a particularly favorable seasonality effect in the first half year. The current operating margin was at 3.5%, up 94 bps when compared to the first half year of last financial year on reported figures and 130 bps on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>.</p><p>In the Europe Zone, price increases, mainly in long life technologies (canned and frozen), helped offset inflation and maintain profitability in the first half year. Thus, the margin operating income increased to (EURO) 42.5 million on reported figures ((EURO) 36.3 million for the same period last year) representing a current operating margin of 5.7% on reported figures (5.8% on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>, compared with 5.5% for the same period last year).</p><p>In the Non-Europe zone, the current operating profitability stands at (EURO) 0.6 million, representing a current operating margin of 0.1% on reported figures (respectively (EURO) 1.1 million and 0.3% on a like for like basis<sup>(2)</sup>) compared to (EURO) -8.7 million over the same period last financial year.</p><p>The ongoing negative contribution of Bonduelle Fresh Americas (BFA), despite the first effects of implemented initiatives, limited the region's profitability, which was offset by the results of the Eurasia zone, with beneficial currency effects improving the competitiveness of Bonduelle EurAsia Markets (BEAM) in its segments.</p><p>After taking into account non-recurring expenses of (EURO) 1.5 million linked to costs and fees related to the reorganization of the Florence site (New Jersey, USA), operating profitability stands at (EURO) 41.5 million on reported figures compared to (EURO) 24.6 million at the end of the first half year of previous financial year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Net result</emphasis></p><p>The net financial result stands at (EURO) -17.5 million against (EURO) -8.7 million last financial year. Despite a positive volume effect linked to the group debt reduction following the partial disposal of its canned and frozen activity in North America at the end of last year, financial expenses increased due to the rapid rise of interest rates in the main currencies in which the Bonduelle Group refinances its activities, particularly outside the Eurozone.</p><p>Moreover, the group recorded foreign exchange losses mainly related to the extreme volatility of the Russian ruble ((EURO) -4.5 million), whose impact is more than offset by recorded competitiveness gains in current operating profitability.</p><p>The tax charge increase ((EURO) 13.1 million compared with (EURO) 4.6 million in the first half of previous year) is due to the non-capitalization of Bonduelle Fresh Americas' losses over the period.</p><p>After taking into account the financial result, the result of the equity method accounted companies (including this year 35% of the net result of Nortera Foods) and the tax charge, the net result of the continuing activities amounts to (EURO) 14.4 million i.e. 1.2% of the revenue, increasing to 35.3% compared to the same period last year.</p><p>The consolidated net result amounted to (EURO) 20 million against (EURO) 24 million the previous year. It includes the result of discontinued operations, i.e. for the first 6 months of 2022-2023 financial year, a favorable adjustment of the sale price of 65% of the BALL business unit for an amount of (EURO) 5.6 million and, for the previous period, i.e. the first half of 2021-2022, 100% of the net result of Nortera Foods representing (EURO) 13.3 million.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial situation</emphasis></p><p>The Bonduelle Group's net financial debt stood on December 31, 2022 at (EURO) 556.7 million against (EURO)\u00a0909.9 million over the same period last financial year, excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16, i.e. a debt-to-equity ratio (gearing<sup>(1)</sup>) of 68.1% (118.6% last financial year). The decrease in debt is explained by the partial disposal of the long life activity in North America (BALL) in June 2022, partly offset by the increase in working capital requirements, which is itself linked to the increase in the value of inventories due to inflation. Finally, the average cost of debt, excluding IFRS 16, in a context of significantly higher interest rates, stands at 3.93%, up from the first half of the previous financial year (1.59%).</p><p>Restated from IFRS 16, the group's net financial debt stands at (EURO) 633.9 million and the gearing<sup>(</sup><sup>1)</sup>ratio at 79.0%.</p><p>It should be noted that the seasonal nature of the business (summer agricultural crops) results in a high level of debt on December 31, which is not representative of the average level of debt or the one observed at the end of the financial year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other significant information</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adaptation of the American industrial set up</emphasis></p><p>In order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market in the United States and to refocus its activity on its valued segments, the Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East Coast of the United States.</p><p>Thus, the manufacturing activities in Florence (New Jersey) will be merged in the coming months with the Swedesboro site, also in New Jersey. This operation aims to optimize the production of all products for customers nationally, while achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.</p><p>The current Florence site will be converted into a warehouse for the East Coast, maintaining these jobs on the site and all current Florence production workers will be offered a position in Swedesboro. The net impact of this reorganization, estimated to date between (EURO) 6.0 million and\u00a0(EURO) 8.0 million and of which (EURO) 1.3 million has already been noted in the first half year, will be recorded in the 2022-2023 fiscal year under non-recurring items.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amendment of the green syndicated loan of (EURO) 400 million</emphasis></p><p>On February 6, 2023, the Bonduelle Group signed an amendment to its (EURO) 400 million syndicated revolving credit facility (RCF) with its banking partners, thereby securing an essential source of financing, which is particularly well suited to the seasonal nature of the group's financing needs, and on very competitive terms, despite the current unstable economic environment. This arrangement provides for a two-year extension, bringing the maturity from 2026 to 2028, with two one-year extension options, bringing the final maturity of the loan to February 2030.</p><p>The financial terms of this credit line include Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators in line with the group's mission and purpose, both in terms of B Corp certification and in terms of reducing its carbon footprint and contributing, with its agricultural partners, to a regenerative agriculture.</p><p>This operation demonstrates once again the confidence shown by the banking partners in supporting the Bonduelle Group's development over the long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Universal Registration Document publication</emphasis></p><p>The Universal Registration Document (URD) for the 2021-2022 financial year can be consulted on the website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bonduelle.com\">www.bonduelle.com</url>.</p><p>For the second year, the group is also publishing an integrated report, also available on the website, describing Bonduelle's business model and its approach in terms of financial and non-financial performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlooks</emphasis></p><p>Bonduelle, like the worldwide food industry, is facing a fragile, volatile and uncertain consumer environment, fueled by unprecedented past and future inflation, particularly for agricultural products, which once again makes significant price increases essential.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the performance achieved in the first half year, which benefited from the favorable seasonal nature of profitability, the Bonduelle Group expects, for the whole financial year, a revenue growth of around 8.0% and a stable current operating margin compared to the previous year, both at constant currency exchange rate and scope consolidation basis, in line with the guidance disclosed at the beginning of fiscal year.</p><p><sup>(1)</sup>net debt / equity<sup>(2)</sup>at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as follows</p><p>For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period, revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year, revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year, revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America, the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data, the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year, revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.</p><p>Alternative performance indicators: the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

Our hands. Not something for the near or mid future. It's here, now. Does anyone remain to be convinced?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I am also an optimist, and proud European, and am impressed by the policy and regulatory changes that Europe is leading. The system of production, consumption and disposal must change - and is changing. We are heading fast towards a full transformation of the food system thanks to the European values that now embed sustainability throughout supply chains.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am also proud of the way business is responding to this change, and even prouder that the company I work for is making this transformation the guiding principle of its business strategy. Today PepsiCo launched pep+ <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(pep Positive),</emphasis> a strategic end-to-end transformation, with sustainability at the centre of how the company will create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. As the second largest food company in the world, I believe this brings real impact. And in Europe, we have one of the best opportunities to make an impact with supportive regulations that are pushing business and entire supply chains to make a step change in the way we operate.</p><p>pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Positive agriculture</emphasis> - spreading regenerative agriculture practices to restore the earth across the company's entire agricultural footprint (approximately 7 million acres), sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more than 250,000 people in our agricultural supply chain. To me, this goes hand in hand with the work that the European Commission is doing to ensure that climate-friendly farming practices make business sense for European farmers via the carbon farming initiative. Scaling up farming practices that restore and maintain soil health will be a complex journey, but one that we can embark on also by looking at what European farmers have already achieved throughout these years. They are the experts, and they are the ones that can show us how much the soil can give back if its richness is fully preserved. For example, in Portugal, we have been working with farmers using techniques to naturally build soil health. Crop rotation has proven to be a critical tool to naturally regenerate soil - our local Portuguese potato farmers found that growing peanuts, which have nitrogen fixing properties, improves soil health.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Positive Value Chain:</emphasis>PepsiCo will help build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, become Net Water Positive by 2030; and will introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. With the ambitious changes that the \"Fit for 55\" package will introduce in Europe, entire value chains will be supported in the shift to zero emission operations. We want our manufacturing facilities to be at the forefront of that.\u00a0 In Poland, PepsiCo is investing 1bnl PLN in a new food manufacturing plant based on green design principles, set to be our most sustainable factory yet in Europe and carbon neutral by 2035. Alongside on-site electricity generation, heating, cooling and water at the site will also be reused and rainwater will be collected for use in the facility. Even the potato waste from manufacturing will play a key role. The leftover peelings will be used in a special biomass generator to help power the plant and will afterwards be converted into a low carbon fertilizer which will be provided to farmers to help grow PepsiCo's next crop of potatoes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Positive Choices:</emphasis>PepsiCo continues to evolve its portfolio of food and beverage products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing food products that are better for the planet and/or deliver nutritional benefits, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains. This is part of the transformation of the food system that the European Green Deal has kicked off. Accelerating the reduction of added sugars and sodium across our portfolio and cooking our food with healthier oils has been part of PepsiCo's response to the European Code of Conduct on Responsible Food Business and Marketing Practices earlier this year. In Europe, PepsiCo has announced its commitment to reduce the average level of added sugars in its beverage portfolio by 50% and to build a $1 billion portfolio of foods rated Nutri-Score B or better by 2030.</p><p>It is an incredible challenge to operationalise change in such a short term, yet one that PepsiCo is ready to face, and one that the EU is ready to trigger and support. But to really deliver positive outcomes for people and the planet, it is not just about one company - the scale of the challenge is too great.\u00a0 Yet as I said, I am an optimist, I think business and regulators are at the right place at the right time to transform long term societal ambitions into operational changes today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1646304</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M5-KNS1-DYXB-V0GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 15, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002DBA</classCode><className>PEPSICO INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS311919 OTHER SNACK FOOD MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS311513 CHEESE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS311511 FLUID MILK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS311411 FROZEN FRUIT, JUICE &amp;

Here are four excellent producers.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNDERWOOD, Wash. - Laura Brennan Bissell was already making wine under her own label, Inconnu, in Northern California when she visited the Columbia River Gorge for the first time.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That was in 2018, after a friend, Ryan Lange, invited her to examine a vineyard he had recently purchased outside this small town in the Columbia Gorge viticultural area, which straddles the Columbia River and includes land in both Washington and Oregon.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's one of several American appellations covering area in two states, though it's hard to imagine one that's more visually stunning.       </p><p>To the south, the imposing, snow-capped Mount Hood dominates the view. Its Cascade sibling Mount Adams looms to the north, and rolling smack through the middle toward the Pacific is the Columbia River itself. It's all part of the Gorge's National Scenic Area, a beautiful river canyon that stretches 100 miles east of Portland and encompasses rain forests, meadows and desert.       </p><p>\"I got out there, saw the mountain, and said, 'I've never been here but it's been in my mind forever,'\" said Ms. Brennan Bissell, whose first vintage of her new Columbia Gorge label, Lorelei, will be released next spring.       </p><p>Over the last decade or so, a handful of ambitious young winemakers like Ms. Brennan Bissell have settled in the area, making gorgeous, intriguing wines and turning the region into a vibrant winemaking hub.       </p><p>They are small producers whose wines are not yet widely distributed, but they are all worth seeking out. Each is practicing some form of regenerative agriculture, a philosophy based on building soil health and establishing a balanced ecosystem. And their wines are so fresh and original, it's further evidence that, as I said in 2017, Oregon is the most exciting winemaking state in the country.       </p><p>Yes, I know the Columbia Gorge includes both Washington and Oregon. Ms. Brennan Bissell is technically making wine in Washington. But beyond this small area, virtually all of Washington's significant vineyard regions are to the east, mostly in desertlike areas. The Gorge area has more in common with other Oregon areas, so for neatness' sake, let's call it Oregon.       </p><p>In most people's minds, the Oregon wine industry is synonymous with the Willamette Valley, its pinot noirs and, to a lesser extent, its chardonnays. This makes sense. It's by far the dominant area. But little by little other Oregon wine regions like the Gorge are demonstrating that the state has much to offer beyond the Willamette Valley.       </p><p>Here are four Columbia Gorge producers that I visited on a quick trip in July. They are not the only Gorge producers worth seeking out. Others like Syncline, Savage Grace and Idiot's Grace are well worth your time, but I find these four particularly compelling.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lorelei</emphasis></p><p>After her first visit to the Gorge, Ms. Brennan Bissell moved quickly. She went into business with Mr. Lange and a third partner, and bought an adjacent 65-acre parcel with a vineyard and a house, where she has moved in with her husband, children and an array of animals including goats, pigs, sheep, chickens and dogs. It has a small winery that she will use as she builds her own facility.       </p><p>She worked hard developing her California label, Inconnu, which will continue, but she knows she's been lucky.       </p><p>\"Such a rare occurrence: To have an estate winery, to farm as I wanted to and to make the wines I want,\" she said.       </p><p>Her vineyard is a work in progress as she has eliminated irrigation and tilling. Chicory, St. John's wort, thimbleberries and other plants and herbs grow wild on the property.       </p><p>The vineyard is currently planted with an eclectic mix of grapes, including gew\u00fcrztraminer, albari\u00f1o, pinot gris, sauvignon blanc and viognier, but she is hoping to add riesling, gr\u00fcner veltliner and, in a block intended for sparkling wine, pinot meunier and pinot blanc.       </p><p>\"High-acid whites are what sing here,\" she said.       </p><p>\"Sing\" is just the right word for her lively, energetic wines. The 2020 vintage was lost to smoke from wildfires, but her unreleased 2019s include a tangy, creamy, quietly persistent edelzwicker, a blend of white grapes; a textured, subtle pinot gris; a bright, mineral viognier; and a Bordeaux-like sauvignon blanc with a lightning bolt of acidity.       </p><p>Ms. Brennan Bissell, 37, gives off a sense of grounded wisdom as a winemaker who believes in history and the classics, not just in whatever is trendy. At the same time, she won't reject styles without good reason. She says she is inspired by the Caravaggio painting, \"David With the Head of Goliath,\" which she interprets as humility killing pride.       </p><p>\"I like the idea of building my practice, not with the influence of others, but by what is beautiful to me,\" she said. \"I think of it like making a perfect pot of rice. It can take 30 years to achieve.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Analemma Wines</emphasis></p><p>Among the Gorge's new wave, Steven Thompson and Kris Fade are old-timers. While vineyards in the area have been traced back to 1852, the modern era began in 1968, Mr. Thompson said. He and Ms. Fade, business partners, founded Analemma in 2010, first making wine only from fruit they purchased, supplemented more recently by their estate vineyard in Mosier, Ore.</p><p>From the vineyard at 600 feet in elevation, where a stiff breeze blows constantly, an amphitheater-like bowl stretches south toward Mount Hood, formed by the catastrophic Missoula floods from glacial lakes at the end of the last Ice Age. It filled the bowl with water, which, as it drained, left what Ms. Fade called a \"huge bathtub ring\" on the sides of rocky hillsides.       </p><p>\"You have evergreens to the west and sagebrush to the east,\" she said. \"We wanted to be at a point of differentiation.\"       </p><p>Analemma farms biodynamically, with a focus on regenerative agriculture. They chose to plant their estate with varieties from western Spain - menc\u00eda, albari\u00f1o and godello, along with tempranillo, trousseau and garnacha, or grenache. They also work with vineyards that supply pinot noir, chardonnay and gew\u00fcrztraminer. It was their floral, citrusy gew\u00fcrztraminer that I tried a few years ago that first made me intensely curious about the Gorge and Analemma.       </p><p>The Analemma wines are alive and energetic, light-bodied yet intense. Favorites included their 2018 Mosier Hills Tinto, a blend of all their red grapes; their 2017 Mosier Hills Blanco, a similar blend of their white grapes; a gorgeous, floral 2019 grenache; and a tangy, textured chardonnay from the Oak Ridge Vineyard at 1,400 feet in elevation.       </p><p>Analemma, too, lost its 2020 vineyard to smoke conditions. Mr. Thompson attributes the liveliness of their wines to their acidity. \"It's something the Gorge showcases,\" he said.       </p><p>Ms. Fade added, \"Ninety percent of our job is creating the conditions for that life, though sometimes we don't know what that means.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Color Collector</emphasis></p><p>Bethany Kimmel may be the ultimate do-it-yourself winemaker. She's worked since 2012 in the Oregon wine industry, in the Willamette first and then the Gorge, where she spent three years working for Analemma, and more recently at Syncline, which makes an excellent array of wines.       </p><p>Her label, The Color Collector, which has made small amounts of gamay in a juicy, floral, thirst-quenching style, along with other similarly accessible wines, is in transition.       </p><p>A few years ago she bought 20 acres, half evergreen forest and half meadow, on a hillside outside of White Salmon on the Washington side. So far she has planted an acre of chasselas, an alpine white grape, and will put in an acre of gamay this fall, all to be farmed biodynamically.       </p><p>To help finance her label, she also works two days a week at a wine shop in Portland, where she has a room. Or she stays at the apartment of her partner, Dan Mahr, in Hood River, across the river in Oregon. But mostly she lives in a tiny, 198-square-foot house, a former artist's studio, that she bought on Craig's List and brought in on a trailer.       </p><p>She had to truck in water until she got a permit to drill a well. She installed an outhouse, put in solar panels and bee hives, and chain-sawed wine barrels in half to serve as planters for herbs and tomatoes.       </p><p>From her miniature front porch, she can gaze at gorgeous starry nights and Mount Hood, which Mr. Mahr said is looking a little \"bony\" as its once copious glaciers recede under climate change.       </p><p>Her first harvest of chasselas won't be ready to taste until 2023, if all goes well, but I anticipate good things. Her past wines have been lovely, and Ms. Kimmel embodies the curiosity, idealism and determination of a group that sees the Gorge as a place to live out dreams.       </p><p>\"What defines the Gorge is diversity,\" she said.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hiyu Wine Farm</emphasis></p><p>Perhaps no place in the Gorge is as astonishing and unconventional as Hiyu Wine Farm outside of Hood River. It includes vineyards, apple and pear trees; a \"food forest\" for foraging herbs, greens and vegetables; and AmericanGuinea hogs, a small heritage breed, along with cows, goats, ducks and four species of chickens. Everything is situated around a lovely tasting room with an excellent restaurant.       </p><p>It's a living, breathing ecosystem, a healthy polyculture, presided over by Nate Ready, a former master sommelier (he resigned from the Court of Master Sommeliers in June 2020 over its stance on racial injustice, months before stories came out about sexual harassment) and China Tresemer, a cooking teacher, who founded the farm in 2010.       </p><p>They first came to the Gorge in 2008, Mr. Ready said, mainly to farm, of which making wine would be just a part. Their influences include the agricultural philosophies of Masanobu Fukuoka, whose views are sometimes oversimplified as \"do-nothing,\" and Sepp Holzer, an Austrian farmer. Both encouraged a permanent natural ecosystem and were against tilling.       </p><p>Such natural farming methods can be challenging. Hiyu almost lost everything in its first vintage. \"The failures are so important,\" Mr. Ready said. But he was encouraged by Maggie Harrison, the proprietor of the excellent producer Antica Terra in the Willamette Valley and something of a mentor to Mr. Ready.       </p><p>\"She said, 'Do exactly what you imagined from the beginning,'\" Mr. Ready recalled.       </p><p>They love the geological and climatic diversity of the Gorge.       </p><p>\"There aren't four seasons here, there are 100 seasons,\" he said.       </p><p>Hiyu fits right in with this complexity. It uses three labels for its wine: Hiyu for wines from the estate, made from a bewildering number of grapes; Tzum for wines made from specific sites with purchased grapes; and Smock Shop, made of blends of both grapes and sites. There's also a label for ciders, Florial.       </p><p>The wines are gorgeous and sometimes challenging. A 2017 Hiyu Hypericum, made from assyrtiko, fiano, greco and other grapes that trace a path from Greece to southern Italy, was bursting with wildflower flavor, tasting like the flowery meadow adjacent to the vines.       </p><p>A 2017 Hiyu Falcon Box, a vibrant, lively white, was made from Burgundian varieties white and red; a Tzum Atavus VI, made from a solera of pinot noir and gew\u00fcrztraminer grown in the high-altitude Atavus Vineyard, was savory, bright and earthy, nothing like I might have imagined.       </p><p>Hiyu also makes wine from Spanish and Portuguese grapes and no doubt many more. Mr. Ready is sure all the things growing on the farm influence the character of the wines, just as the scent of garrigue, the shrubs and wild herbs of southern France, can often be sensed in those wines.       </p><p>\"Something about the landscape here invites experimentation,\" Mr. Ready said. \"You want to try things.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Food on Twitter</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NYT Cooking on Instagram</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Facebook</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">YouTube</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> and </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Pinterest</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Get regular updates from NYT Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EMAIL <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:asimov@nytimes.com\">asimov@nytimes.com</email> And follow Eric Asimov on Twitter: @EricAsimov. </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007970532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NW-Y0V1-DYR7-C52X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2026\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 24, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000956</classCode><className>FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001843</classCode><className>WINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000068</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N312130MM</classCode><className>WINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000067</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX506</classCode><className>PORTLAND, OR, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GS153</classCode><className>OREGON, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Now it was a jumble of weeds.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Most people would want to get out here and start spraying it\" with herbicides, he said. \"My family used to do that. It doesn't work.\"       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead, Mr. Isaacs, a fourth-generation rancher on this rolling land in the northeast corner of the Texas Panhandle, will put his animals to work on the pasture, using portable electrified fencing to confine them to a small area so that they can't help but trample some of the weeds as they graze.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We let cattle stomp a lot of the stuff down,\" he said. That adds organic matter to the soil and exposes it to oxygen, which will help grasses and other more desirable plants take over. Eventually, through continued careful management of grazing, the pasture will be healthy again.       </p><p>\"These cows are my land management tool,\" Mr. Isaacs said. \"It's a lot easier to work with nature than against it.\"       </p><p>His goal is to turn these 5,000 acres into something closer to the lush mixed-grass prairie that thrived throughout this part of the Southern Great Plains for millenniums and served as grazing lands for millions of bison.       </p><p>Mr. Isaacs, 27, runs a cow-calf operation, with several hundred cows and a dozen or so bulls that produce calves that he sells to the beef industry after they are weaned. Improving his land will benefit his business, through better grazing for his animals, less soil and nutrient loss through erosion, and improved retention of water in a region where rainfall averages only about 18 inches a year.       </p><p>But the healthier ranchland can also aid the planet by sequestering more carbon, in the form of roots and other plant tissues that used carbon dioxide from the air in their growth. Storing this organic matter in the soil will keep the carbon from re-entering the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane, two major contributors to global warming.       </p><p>With the Biden administration proposing to pay farmers to store carbon, soil sequestration has gained favor as a tool to fight climate change. Done on a large enough scale, proponents say, it can play a significant role in limiting global warming.       </p><p>But many scientists say that claim is overblown, that soils cannot store nearly enough carbon, over a long enough time, to have a large effect. And measuring carbon in soil is problematic, they say.       </p><p>The soil-improving practices that ranchers like Mr. Isaacs follow are referred to as regenerative grazing, part of a broader movement known as regenerative agriculture.       </p><p>There are no clear-cut definitions of the terms, but regenerative farming techniques include minimal or no tilling of soil, rotating crops, planting crops to cover and benefit the soil after the main crop is harvested, and greater use of compost rather than chemical fertilizers.       </p><p>Regenerative grazing means closely managing where and for how long animals forage, unlike a more conventional approach in which animals are left to graze the same pasture more or less continuously. Ranchers also rely more on their animals' manure to help keep their pastures healthy.       </p><p>These practices are spreading among farmers and ranchers in the United States, spurred by environmental concerns about what industrialized farming and meat production have done to the land and about agriculture's contribution to global warming. In the United States, agriculture accounts for about 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.       </p><p>Agribusiness companies and large food producers are launching initiatives to encourage regenerative practices, part of efforts to appeal to consumers concerned about climate change and sustainability.       </p><p>And the Biden administration, in its initial moves to combat climate change, has cited agriculture as a \"linchpin\" of its strategy. One idea is to allocate $1 billion to pay farmers $20 for each ton of carbon they trap in the soil.       </p><p>Proponents of regenerative agriculture have sometimes made extravagant claims about its potential as a tool to fight global warming. Among them is Allan Savory, a farmer originally from Zimbabwe and a leader in the movement, who in an often-cited 2013 TED Talk said that it could \"reverse\" climate change.       </p><p>Some research has suggested that widespread implementation of regenerative practices worldwide could have a significant effect, storing as much as 8 billion metric tons of carbon per year over the long term, or nearly as much as current annual emissions from burning of fossil fuels.       </p><p>While there is broad agreement that regenerative techniques can improve soil health and bring other benefits, some analyses have found that the potential carbon-sequestration numbers are vastly overstated. Among the criticisms, researchers point out that short-term studies may show strong increases in soil carbon, but that these gains decline over time.       </p><p>\"It's really great to see the private sector and the U.S. government getting serious about reducing agricultural emissions,\" said Richard Waite, a senior researcher at the World Resources Institute, an environmental research organization in Washington. But for carbon sequestration in soils, the institute's analysis suggests that \"mitigation opportunities are on the smaller side.\"       </p><p>Focusing on carbon sequestration through soil also risks drawing attention from other important ways to reduce agriculture's carbon footprint, Mr. Waite said, including improving productivity, reducing deforestation and shifting food consumption to more climate-friendly diets.       </p><p>Jason Rowntree, a researcher at Michigan State University who was a scientific adviser for five years for an institute founded by Mr. Savory, said that while regenerative grazing \"creates a cascade of good things,\" his and others' research has shown the amount of carbon sequestered can vary greatly by region, affected in large part by the amount of rainfall and soil nitrogen available.       </p><p>\"Based on the amounts of these where you are, the ability to build carbon can change dramatically,\" he said. \"It needs to be considered in a localized context.\"       </p><p>What's more, Dr. Rowntree said, using carbon in the soil as the basis for judging how well agriculture is contributing to the fight against climate change could be problematic because it is difficult to measure. As a metric, he said, \"carbon is probably the worst one we could find.\"       </p><p>Tim LaSalle, a former executive director of Mr. Savory's institute who later co-founded a sustainable agriculture program at California State University, Chico, said that he views the movement as \"a change in looking at soil and its potential.\"       </p><p>\"And that's where science is lacking,\" he said, arguing that most research focuses on one or two factors without considering the entire, and complex, plant-soil system.       </p><p>Dr. LaSalle and colleagues are collecting data from research that shows the benefits of regenerative practices, including field trials using compost inoculated with fungi and other microbes that reduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers.       </p><p>\"We've got to get the data out there to shift people's understanding of what goes on,\" he said.       </p><p>Mr. Isaacs, who studied ranch management at Texas Tech University and worked for two years for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, does some measurement and analysis to gauge how well his efforts are working.       </p><p>\"We do a lot of surveys,\" he said, taking photos and samples to determine microbial activity in the soil, how well plants are growing and how the mix of species is changing. \"That way you can see trends,\" he said. \"When you're out here everyday, it's hard to see what you're doing.\"       </p><p>He is certain that he is building more carbon in the soil, and thus benefiting the climate to some extent. But from a drive around his ranch, it is clear that a big source of pride is the visible improvements he is seeing in the land.       </p><p>Stopping in one pasture on the way back to the ranch house he shares with his wife, Aubrie, he pointed to a gentle slope with a mix of vegetation.       </p><p>As with other pastures at the ranch, Mr. Isaacs has used his electrified fencing to put his cattle to graze on small plots here for short periods of time - 200 head, perhaps, eating and stomping around in a space no larger than a suburban homeowner's backyard for as little as half an hour. Moving the fencing down the pasture to new plots allows the grazed land time to recover.       </p><p>\"That's what the bison did,\" he said. \"They'd come in a million at a time, stomp it all down and move on to fresh pasture. And they wouldn't come back until it was time to graze again.\"       </p><p>The work requires planning and frequent moving of cattle. But Mr. Isaacs is aided by technology - he uses a small drone to help herd the animals, and is investing in devices that will lift fence gates on command from an app on his phone.       </p><p>The cattle make one pass around much of the ranch in winter, to prepare the land for spring growth. More passes follow in spring or summer, the number depending on largely on rainfall.       </p><p>\"In spring, the forage grows really fast, so we're rotating cows around the ranch really fast,\" Mr. Isaacs said. \"As summer progresses and it gets hotter and the growth slows down, we slow the cows down.\"       </p><p>Mr. Isaacs pointed to several tallgrass species growing amid shorter ones on the slope. The intensive grazing and recovery has helped these tallgrasses come back, he said, and the cattle devour them. \"In the growing season, this is as good as it gets,\" he said.       </p><p>\"As I do better for the soil, it just becomes progressively better and better and you grow more grass,\" Mr. Isaacs said. \"And as you grow more grass, you get better soils.\"       </p><p>\"It's never ending.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007578242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6228-BCM1-DYR7-C323-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 22, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSGR</classCode><className>GRAZING LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

In a complex and highly volatile market environment, Bel's performance attests to the resilience of our legacy activities and the relevance of our strategic growth areas. Our responsible management of price increases also contributed to these very solid results, which reflect consumer attachment to our iconic brands and the confidence of our distributor partners despite the current economic environment. During the year, we also ramped up our international expansion by carrying out major transactions in China and India and signing strategic partnerships with several start-ups to accelerate the development of products containing alternative proteins. At the same time, we pursued our investment strategy and the deployment of our CSR commitments in order to build - alongside our partners - the food system of the future. This is both the key to our resilience and the foundation of our performance over the long term. Encouraged by these annual results, we look to the future with confidence while remaining attentive to the potential impact of ongoing inflation on sales volumes and consumer price sensitivity.

The new, more ambitious objective involves a 25% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chain by 2035<sup>6</sup>and the integration of carbon reduction as a\u00a0management tool.</p><p>Bel achieved its Scope\u00a01 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction objective in 2022. It also introduced a\u00a0new tool for measuring its products' carbon impact, the \"Bel Carbon Impact Tool\". The aim is to provide accurate and regular updates on its carbon footprint to all employees, departments, markets and brands so that each can contribute actively to the company's carbon strategy. The new tool helps teams make the right decisions by enabling them to estimate their projects' carbon impact. It was designated \"2022 Project of the Year\" at the Digital Finance Awards organized by Future of Finance and won the top award in the \"Environmental Responsibility Development - Distributors\" category at the Troph\u00e9es LSA.</p><p>In October, Bel and WWF\u00a0France celebrated the 10<sup>th</sup>anniversary of their partnership initiated in 2012, aimed at building a\u00a0more sustainable food model. They also renewed their alliance to continue combating climate change and protecting biodiversity, strengthening their initiatives in four ambitious focus areas:</p><p>Sustainable and regenerative agriculture, based on a\u00a0framework of concrete and quantified farming practices that shrink the environmental footprint and place \"living soil\" at the center of the ecosystem, notably by promoting biodiversity, carbon capture, farm resilience and the production of quality ingredients.Preservation of biodiversity via ongoing work on impact measurement, in line with the collective initiatives carried out by Bel through the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) and WWF France's Natural Capital Lab.Protection of forests and natural ecosystems through Bel's commitment to onsite preservation and conservation and its support for WWF France's carbon sequestration strategy.Engagement with consumers so that they become agents of change by choosing to support a more sustainable food system.</p><p>After defining these strategic areas, Bel finalized its adoption of a\u00a0Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework<sup>7</sup>, validated by Moody's ESG Solutions.</p><p>Lastly, in November, Bel and dairy producers association APBO renewed their partnership for the sixth consecutive year, agreeing on a higher milk price and more sustainable farming practices for the whole of 2023, for all volumes collected. This long-term visibility over prices and volumes bolsters the economic viability of 700\u00a0dairy farms and encourages the development of more sustainable practices, including grazing, GMO-free feed, carbon footprint reduction measures and pilot farms for innovative projects. With the economic crisis significantly increasing pressure on the entire food value chain, Bel carried out two price adjustments in 2022 to help dairy farmers deal with higher production costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strong R&amp;D dynamic with a view to developing the food of the future</emphasis></p><p>Bel entered into several research partnerships in 2022, as part of its strategy of innovating to create the food of the future - healthy, responsible and accessible to all.</p><p>In July, Bel and Superbrewed Food initiated a\u00a0strategic collaboration to develop a\u00a0range of cheese products containing proteins made from biomass fermentation.</p><p>In November, Bel announced the signing of an exclusive partnership for cheese applications with French start-up Standing Ovation, which has developed an innovative precision fermentation process that produces caseins of non-animal origin. These proteins are identical to those naturally present in milk and provide all the nutritional qualities, functionality and traditional good taste of cheese. They also pave the way for products with a lower environmental impact and greater accessibility.</p><p>And in December, Bel launched its first range of cheese alternatives containing dairy proteins not sourced from milk, in partnership with start-up Perfect Day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Resilient financial performance confirming the validity of Bel's strategic decisions</emphasis></p><p>The Bel Group recorded consolidated sales of (EURO)3,595.3\u00a0million in 2022, representing organic growth of 13.2%<sup>1</sup>. On a reported basis, sales were up 6.4% over the prior year, reflecting changes in the scope of consolidation, primarily related to the sale of an assets portfolio consisting primarily of the Leerdammer brand,<sup>8</sup>and a positive foreign exchange impact of 5.6%, resulting notably from the U.S.\u00a0dollar's appreciation against the euro.</p><p>This robust performance is attributable to strong growth in volumes in new territories, particularly the fruit segment in all geographies, very strong double-digit growth in China for the third year in a row, positive sales momentum in North America and the responsible management of price increases. Organic growth in annual sales was driven by increased sales of GoGo squeeZ\u00ae and Pom'Potes\u00ae products, as well as by Bel's core brands, particularly Babybel\u00ae and Boursin\u00ae. Overall, annual sales increased across all brands and all regions in 2022.</p><p>Nurishh, Bel's first global brand to be 100% plant-based, continued its development initiated in 2021 in line with consumer demand for alternatives to cheese. Positive momentum was also maintained by the new plant-based ranges rolled out by the core brands, with very good results for these varieties of Babybel<sup>\u00ae</sup>and Boursin<sup>\u00ae</sup>. Lastly, in terms of distribution channels, Bel's e-commerce and out-of-home (OOH) segments posted double-digit sales growth for the third year in a\u00a0row. The e-commerce segment continued to perform well, notably in China, the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Positive trends were also recorded in the OOH segment, particularly in France, China and the United States.</p><p>* Comprising the business activities of MOM (Mont-Blanc, Materne), as well as markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and China.</p><p>After a first-half 2022 negatively impacted by the time\u00a0lag between the additional costs generated by inflationary pressure on expenditure items and the implementation of selling price increases to offset those additional costs, Bel benefited in the second half of the year from the combined effect of price increases, trade-offs on investment projects to preserve profitability and the accelerated deployment of productivity improvement measures initiated several years ago. Recurring operating income totaled (EURO)187\u00a0million, up slightly from the previous year on a\u00a0comparable structure basis (notably adjusted for the impact of the sale in 2021 of an assets portfolio consisting primarily of the Leerdammer brand). The recurring operating margin held firm at 5.2%.</p><p>Net financial expense amounted to a negative (EURO)24\u00a0million, a (EURO)10 million improvement over the previous year due notably to a\u00a0favorable foreign exchange effect related to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Consolidated net profit, Group share came to (EURO)96\u00a0million versus (EURO)524\u00a0million in 2021. The sharp decline is attributable to the (EURO)466\u00a0million capital gain recorded in 2021 following the sale to Lactalis of an asset portfolio consisting primarily of the Leerdammer brand. Excluding this capital gain, consolidated net profit was up (EURO)38\u00a0million.</p><p>Free cash flow stood at (EURO)214\u00a0million despite the impact of inflation on working capital requirement and the investments made to support the fruit segment's future development. This solid performance reflects the dynamic management of the company's working capital, a\u00a0positive calendar effect and the implementation of an off-balance sheet securitization program, which had an (EURO)132\u00a0million impact on free cash flow generation in 2022.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solid financial structure linked to ambitious CSR objectives</emphasis></p><p>At\u00a0December\u00a031, 2022, Bel's balance sheet reflected a sound and solid financial structure. Total equity came to (EURO)1,592\u00a0million versus (EURO)1,682\u00a0million at December\u00a031, 2021. Net financial debt, including right-of-use lease liabilities in application of IFRS\u00a016, totaled (EURO)778\u00a0million compared to (EURO)645\u00a0million in 2021. This increase is primarily due to the acquisition on April\u00a029, 2022 of the balance of capital in MOM, i.e. the remaining 17.44% of ordinary shares, for (EURO)208\u00a0million and to the external growth operations in China and India.</p><p>On December\u00a031, 2022, Bel had (EURO)596\u00a0million in cash and cash equivalents and (EURO)550\u00a0million in credit facilities maturing in 2027 (2028 and 2029 if extended), representing a high level of liquidity.</p><p>During the year, Bel successfully carried out a\u00a0major debt refinancing campaign aimed at securing funds over the long term and further diversifying its sources. The refinancing of its multi-currency revolving credit agreement was completed in September for (EURO)550\u00a0million. Provided by a syndicate of 11\u00a0banks or groups of banks and granted to Bel for a period of five years, with two one-year extension options, this credit facility is based on the achievement of three sustainable development objectives, in line with Bel's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, put in place in July, 2022.</p><p>In December\u00a02022, Bel successfully completed a\u00a0(EURO)315\u00a0million Schuldschein issue, linked to the company's sustainable development performance, for the purpose of pursuing its growth dynamic. The sustainability-linked issue was largely oversubscribed at attractive financial terms, attesting to lenders' confidence in Bel's ability to deliver on its financial and non-financial commitments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2023</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">o</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">utlook</emphasis></p><p>In a complex economic and financial environment, Bel demonstrated its resilience once again in 2022, recording another year of organic growth and protecting its margins thanks to its agility, its ability to adapt and its solid approach to both operational and financial management.</p><p>In line with the previous year, the beginning of 2023 was shaped by high across-the-board inflation, which notably resulted in soaring energy prices and increased labor costs. This inflationary trend seems to have taken hold in all regions of the world, making consumers more sensitive to product prices. Nevertheless, consumer confidence in Bel's iconic brands, strong volume growth in the fruit segment and sustained momentum in China all confirm the validity of the strategic development areas chosen by Bel. In addition, the joint venture created with India's Britannia Industries and the acquisition of a\u00a0majority stake in China's Shandong Junjun Cheese will enable Bel to pursue its growth strategy, expand its product portfolio and further strengthen its industrial footprint in Asia.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Bel intends to pursue the development of its three strategically-related business segments - dairy, fruit and plant-based products.</p><p>Bel's financial performance indicators</p><p>The Group uses non-IFRS financial performance indicators internally and for its external communication. Thesenon-IFRS indicators are defined below:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Organic growth</emphasis>corresponds to reported sales growth, excluding impacts from foreign exchange fluctuations andchanges in the scope of consolidation, i.e. on a constant structure and exchange rate basis and excluding inflationin Iran and Turkey.

Rather they are provoked and made more likely through decades of status quo politics, accelerating the climate crisis through fossil fuel subsidies and lack of real climate action.</p><p>Recognizing that past inadequate policies have brought us to this point opens the possibility to break from them. While there is no way to regain what has already been lost, there is still so much to save and we know that swift action can curb an ever greater accumulation of extreme weather events.</p><p>Europe is the promise of a free, democratic and equal society transcending national borders. There is an apparent struggle to uphold Europe's values and human rights are not consistently upheld within the Union.</p><p>This is, of course, unacceptable and there is no way a Fortress Europe policy can continue when millions in and outside of the continent have to flee their homes because of an escalating climate crisis.</p><p>What is absolutely clear: The foundation for building a more just Union in the future is keeping the promise of Europe in the present. Central to that is limiting the climate crisis with every tool possible.</p><p>Too often politicians seem to forget that empty words and fancy slogans like \"Fit For 55\", \"European Green Deal\" or \"Next Generation EU\" will not decarbonise our society and economy. The snazzy titles cannot cover up the fact that the legislation is lacking when it comes to concrete policies and measures to get to net zero quickly.</p><p>In the end, the question of how many disastrous floods and heatwaves we will have to suffer through is decided by how many tenths of a degree we allow the climate to warm.</p><p>While officials proclaim they are making Europe the \"first climate neutral continent\" its climate law does not even meet the Paris Agreement and puts us on a track to over 2 degrees warming.</p><p>Globally, temperatures have already risen at an average of around 1.2-degrees. And while many could not fathom the floods we have seen in the last days it is hard to even begin to imagine what kind of human suffering a 2 degrees world would bring.</p><p>The supposed \"details\" of policies will in the end make the difference between the Europe we want and the one we may get instead. We need to tackle the big questions of a Coal Exit and renewable energy transition, a comprehensive mobility shift and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>While these issues are not ignored there is an obvious hesitancy to truly engage - instead there is no fossil fuel phase-out planned and the Common Agricultural Policy is shown to not notably reduce emissions.</p><p>Dominant EU countries like France and Germany need to step up and take initiative instead of hiding behind smaller, less ambitious countries as is their current practice. EU legislative processes need to be reformed in order to stop overcorrecting policies downward and need to be able to withstand Poland's constant vetos.</p><p>While we yell \"climate justice\" there has been a failure in understanding that an intact climate is the basis for everyone having enough to eat and drink and a safe place to live and thus the basis of our very democracy and source of social stability.</p><p>Finally, however ambitiously we reduce emissions there is a degree of warming we can not reverse immediately and the next decades will be rough no matter what.</p><p>Next to climate protection we will need disaster prevention and mitigation measures that make sure, for instance, that heavy rains do not cause as much suffering. If we want anything to stay as it is - it's clear that everything will need to change.</p><p>The transformations we stand before will not be easy, but we cannot let this moment divide us. The EU needs to rise to the occasion with courageous and comprehensive climate policy and solidarity.</p><p>Ultimately there is no Europe to fight for in the future if we do not do everything in order to fight the climate crisis right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1634779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638R-PDP1-DYXB-V18F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 2, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>climate emergency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>future eu</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;
