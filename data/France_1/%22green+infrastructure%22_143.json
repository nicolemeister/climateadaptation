Thanks to their curved shape, these roadside barriers are designed to protect pedestrians from fine particles from vehicle emissions by deflecting them back towards the road.\u00a0</p><p>When watching her child playing in a school playground alongside a busy main road in London, Tilly Collins, a researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London, started to worry about the future of children living on such a polluted planet.</p><p>As part of her research, Dr Collins realized that fine particles emitted by vehicles were becoming trapped in vortices near roadside walls, making pedestrians -- and children -- particularly vulnerable. Together with her colleague Huw Woodward, she began investigating types of urban infrastructure that could mitigate these vortex effects and improve air quality for pedestrians.\u00a0</p><p>When working on their anti-pollution barriers, the two researches were inspired by airfield baffles, as well as the curved sound-walls found alongside freeways in Germany and the Netherlands.\u00a0</p><p>Although still a prototype, this kind of urban infrastructure, specially designed to protect pedestrians from pollution, could prove a major first. The way it works is simple: according to the researchers, the curved shape of the barriers helps to disperse and deflect pollutants back towards roads more effectively, potentially improving air quality for pedestrians very quickly and at relatively low cost.</p><p>\"Air pollution in cities disproportionately affects children and those living in economically-deprived areas near busy roadways. Walls are effective in deflecting particulate matter but the addition of shaping either at the design stage, or as retrofit, improves performance,\" argue the researchers, whose findings are published in the journal,\u00a0Cities &amp; Health. \u00a0</p><p>Beyond air quality, these curved barriers may also help reduce noise pollution and could act as scaffolds to increase green infrastructure throughout cities, the researchers state.</p><p>According to a\u00a0recent study\u00a0from scientists at Harvard University, air pollution linked to the combustion of fossil fuels could be responsible for some 6.7\u00a0million premature deaths worldwide in 2018.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6268-0BP1-JDVB-60TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>WELL-BEING</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 12, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And they\u2019ve already said they will be doing lots of oversight,\u201d she said. \u201cI imagine they\u2019ll be doing lots of investigations into ESG. That has become part of the anti-wokeism agenda of that extreme right wing.\u201d</p><p>ESG refers to environmental, social and governance corporate performance evaluation criteria that assess a firm\u2019s sustainability and responsibility.</p><p>Investigations into ESG and other climate issues could slow progress, but Healy remained steadfast that bills, if crafted and branded correctly, could succeed with bipartisan support.</p><p>As for policies that President Biden is unable to whip the votes for, she said that the administration will have other means, both domestically and internationally, of pursuing policy without congressional support.</p><p>These include the implementation of the already-passed Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 which Healy believed Republicans may try to slow down through House investigations but will eventually succeed \u2013 as well as Environmental Protection Agency regulations.</p><p>Additionally, because Democrats retained control of the Senate, the Biden administration will be able to continue appointing judges more amenable to climate action, which will also help the administration when its EPA regulations are challenged in court.</p><p>Abroad, President Biden has already begun pushing for World Bank and IMF reforms in order to facilitate more investment in green infrastructure and disaster relief efforts around the world.</p><p>This mirrors <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/macron-calls-to-pressure-rich-non-european-states-at-cop27/\">similar calls for IMF reform</url> made by French President Emmanuel Macron at COP27 earlier this month.</p><p>Healy predicted that green global economic development will be a major focus of the administration and an area that President Biden will be able to navigate with fewer congressional restrictions.</p><p>\u201cBigger than climate, it\u2019s economic development,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look at Biden\u2019s rhetoric, and the rhetoric coming out of his administration, including via the World Bank [\u2026] I think this will be a big part of their diplomacy going forward.\u201d</p><p>However, this strategy could also be inhibited by congressional oversight of government spending. President Biden has been pushing Congress to appropriate $11.4 billion for international climate aid but has been unsuccessful, and is even less likely to achieve this goal with a fiscally conservative Republican majority in the House.</p><p>Healy also emphasised that even if Republicans push back against US climate action, EU rules regarding corporate sustainability will still catalyse change in the US economy.</p><p>\u201cThe Republican House is not going to change what Europe is doing on those rules, those rules will set quite a high bar and will affect US multinational [corporations],\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, the companies and market players, the investors, the big corporations that actually want this information [on how to operate within sustainability guardrails], they want clarity. They want mutually aligned frameworks,\u201d she added.</p><p>However, European action has also already caused the EU and US to butt heads, particularly over the former\u2019s planned Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which could levy a tariff on imported goods from countries such as the US.</p><p>The two also clashed over the US\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act, which included tax incentives to buy American-made electric vehicles and ruffled feathers in Brussels about its impact on EU electric vehicle exports.</p><p>The two sides have launched a task force to explore ways to navigate these concerns, but Healy and other experts are not yet sure how the two sides will be able to mend the rift.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionenergyenvironmentinterviewbidensclimateagendawillsurviveusmidtermsexpertpredicts</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66X7-9YK1-F03F-K117-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

At 6,000 acres, the Great Trinity Forest is one of the largest urban woodlands in the United States, an expanse of hardwood trees, ponds, swamps and meandering creeks.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is not its size that is remarkable so much as its wildness. Neglected, ignored and abused for years, much of it has become an impenetrable thicket with a dense understory that teems with wildlife - feral hogs, turtles, white-tailed deer, beavers, otters and alligators - all at a short distance from the skyscrapers of this very corporate American city.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cities often contain perfected, simplified forms of nature, ones that look pretty but are biologically impoverished. But forget parks, neat and tidy as they are. Nature at its insurgent best insinuates itself in the gaps in the urban fabric: the soggy, unloved floodplain of Dallas, but also abandoned lots, roadsides and intersections, railroad lines, mortared walls, empty malls, disused factories, the edges of chain-link fences and the cracks in the concrete.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is where we find the rough, tough vegetation and wildlife, adapted to living in proximity to us, seemingly against the odds. It is not the nature you might find in a national park, and that is why it is worth celebrating: for its sheer ability to survive and thrive in a hostile environment and nurture other life.       </p><p>Every city has acres of in-between land that, if managed well, could become oases of greenery harboring insect, bird and other animal life. And with cities still reconfiguring themselves in the wake of the pandemic, the case for rethinking their purpose and potential could not be more urgent. We need to make urban areas more walkable, more fun and more livable, to be sure. But we should also make them greener. The city must be not just a place of wealth generation, culture and activity, but also a unique ecosystem that offers us protection against climate threats and a vital, visceral connection with wildlife.       </p><p>Among the first to document the exuberance of urban ecosystems were casual observers and curious botanists in war-torn Europe in the 1940s. The rubble-strewn cities of World War II, to the astonishment of their inhabitants, very quickly brimmed with plant and animal life. The vegetation that emerged from the debris was totally unexpected, a cornucopia of exotic, often nonnative species that were adept at exploiting and thriving in the damage. Blitzed areas of London brimmed with pink swaths of rosebay willow herb - \"bombweed,\" as it was nicknamed. In central M\u00fcnster, Germany, piles of rubble were veiled with spontaneously growing pussy willow, mountain maple, birches, yellow mulleins and wild strawberry.       </p><p>These disaster-loving plants often evolved on coastal cliffs, arid mountainsides and other inhospitable places: pioneers of nature that reclaimed scarred territory and prepared the way for larger shrubs and woody species. They had come to the city accidentally over the centuries, concealed in shipping containers or as hitchhikers on the tires of vehicles and the soles of boots. And they had been there, biding their time, until the destruction of war allowed them to run riot and make bombed-out cities look amazingly verdant. They became the key components of a distinctively novel and amazingly diverse urban ecosystem.       </p><p>It was in West Berlin in the 1950s that urban ecology became a science. One of its earliest pioneers, the botanist Herbert Sukopp, noted that the city's ecology was in continual flux as nature responded to changes in the human-made environment. Neglected sites were profuse in biodiversity, often containing many more species of plants and insects than nearby parks or even the countryside.       </p><p>Today in Berlin, a patch of wildness called the Natur-Park S\u00fcdgel\u00e4nde has bloomed in what was once among the city's busiest railroad yards. Like the Great Trinity Forest, first it was abandoned and then hundreds of species took over, many of them endangered. But in contrast to Trinity, its wildness is now carefully stewarded. Elevated metal walkways give visitors access without disturbing rare flowers and ground-nesting birds; pockets of precious grassland and meadow flowers are protected by mowing and grazing sheep.       </p><p>This is a work of intention rather than simple neglect; the S\u00fcdgel\u00e4nde is biologically successful because it was unplanned. But, paradoxically, it has remained successful because humans now play a superintending role, managing it for both our needs and biodiversity. It is a model for how we can integrate wildscapes into the cityscape.       </p><p>Imagine a city latticed with lightly cultivated wild spaces, microforests and roadside meadows. (For that matter, imagine the manicured neatness of suburbia blooming with wildlife gardens in place of ecologically impoverished, pesticide-soaked lawns.) That would be a different kind of city, where the human and the natural coil together and where the conventional cityscape is visually enriched by exuberant wildlife.       </p><p>In the English city of Sheffield, the landscape architects Nigel Dunnett and James Hitchmough chose plants that thrive in disturbed, acidic, dry and nutrient-poor urban environments for densely planted, low-maintenance, self-generating meadows that are the opposite of carefully groomed urban parks, but no less beautiful. In the Netherlands the new policy of Tijdelijke Natuur (Temporary Nature) encourages landowners to allow habitats to establish themselves for a limited period on lots destined for development. The practice acknowledges cities as places that continually create, destroy and recreate areas of biodiversity. Freshkills Park on Staten Island went from the world's biggest garbage dump to a self-generating habitat largely through natural processes, proof that urban space can be returned to the bald eagles, ospreys, herons and grasshopper sparrows that long ago inhabited the terrain. And the roof of Chicago's City Hall has become a kind of aerial prairie, with 20,000 plants selected for their ability to withstand sunny, windy and arid conditions. The roof garden cools the building during summer and absorbs a huge amount of storm water.       </p><p>If cities are to survive a hotter, wet, less predictable climate it is in their interests to strike an accommodation with nature. Urban centers like Louisville, Ky., denuded of tree canopy and foliage, can be 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than the lusher surrounding areas. Green spaces offer another form of much needed protection from the elements.       </p><p>New York, which spent the 20th century remorselessly filling in and building over its tidal marshes, is waking up to the fact that wetlands are the surest defenses against storms and rising sea levels. Hunter's Point South Park in Queens now has a constructed tidal marsh; parts of Staten Island and Jamaica Bay, among others, are reverting to marshland. This signals a recognition that green infrastructure must be part of the plan to protect the city alongside hard engineering projects.       </p><p>The priority for New York in the 21st century is to \"restore and sustain a mosaic of habitats within the human-dominated landscape\" in order to rehabilitate the wider ecosystem. Those are the words not of an eco-warrior, but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in a 2020 report. And it is true for all cities battling the effects of climate change. Happily, from Dallas's Great Trinity Forest to New York's Freshkills Park, wildness is becoming a pronounced feature of modern cities.       </p><p>Understood and appreciated, it can bring us deep pleasure. We should embrace it and learn to love the curious, unpredictable hybrid ecosystem that sprouts from the concrete.       </p><p>Ben Wilson is a historian and the author of \"Urban Jungle: The History and Future of Nature in the City.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Priceless,\" she continues.</p><p>Ruckelshaus says the best way to assign value to ecosystems is to get all the interested parties around a table.</p><p>\"If you articulate and quantify where the most value is for each stakeholder, often you don't have as many trade-offs as you think,\" she says.</p><p>- Regulation still key -</p><p>When you scale things up, the numbers are eye-popping.</p><p>Some $44 trillion (37 trillion euros) of annual economic value generation -- half of the world's gross domestic product -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature, according to the World Economic Forum.</p><p>Using the natural capital as the guiding principle, proponents favour integrating natural resources into the calculation of a country's wealth.</p><p>\"This is the first step to integrating biodiversity in national strategies and plans and to bring about real change, thanks to clear targets and indicators,\" said Girouard.</p><p>But the concept remains controversial for some.</p><p>In 2018 British writer and environmentalist George Monbiot argued against the idea, which he said \"reinforces the notion that nature has no value unless you can extract cash from it\".</p><p>French author, environmentalist and member of the European Parliament Aurore Lalucq agrees.</p><p>\"We don't need to give a price to bees -- we need to outlaw the pesticides that kill them,\" she told AFP.</p><p>She believes that legislation, not financial incentive, will work best to protect remaining ecosystems.</p><p>\"We need to regulate, make practices illegal and invest in green infrastructure and biodiversity,\" she said.</p><p>Ruckelshaus acknowledges that the monetary value system has its limitations and that government regulation remains crucial.</p><p>\"Valuing nature... gives everybody the same information but it doesn't guarantee that everyone will make the decision to protect nature,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H6-TXT1-JDVB-62MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

Adjacent to the two new mines at Kamoa, a new, five-million-tonne-a-year concentrator plant will be established, taking total processing capacity to more than 14-million tonnes a year. Power for the expansion will be hydroelectric, through a partnership with the DRC's Inga II hydro project, the Kamoa-Kakula statement said.</p><p>READ MORE DRC: China Moly court ruling shows Tshisekedi still in charge, says mining expert</p><p>In Zambia, Africa's second-largest copper producer after the DRC, UK-based mining company Moxico Resources plans to expand its majority-owned Mimbula copper mine, with a $100m investment.</p><p>Moxico started low-cost production in April 2020 at the Mimbula Copper Project, a copper-rich oxide and sulphide deposit located in the ZambianCopperbelt on the outskirts of Chingola town.</p><p>Zambia's copper output fell to 800,696 tonnes in 2021 from 837,996 tonnes in 2020 but its new president Hakainde Hichilema has committed to creating a far more inducive investment climate for miners and mining exploration.</p><p>Hichilema, who took over in August 2021, won widespread support in Zambia's 'copperbelt' region, due to his supportive stance towards the industry.</p><p>Hichilema announced in April that Zambia's government was close to finding a private investor for its Mopani Copper Mines, one of the country's biggest. Zambia has been looking for a buyer after taking on $1.5bn in debt to buy Mopani from Glencore in January 2021.</p><p>Also in April, Uganda began the official hunt for an investor to revive copper and cobalt production at its defunct Kilembe mine.</p><p>'With the increase in demand for copper and cobalt worldwide, the government of Uganda through the privatisation unit wishes to implement the development of Kilembe mines,' the country's Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development said in an Expression of Interest document.</p><p>Kilembe is Uganda's largest copper mine, with estimated deposits of copper in excess of four million tonnes. The mine began operations in 1952 and was closed in 1982 when exploration ceased due to depressed world copper prices.</p><p>'Thereafter, the company operated on a care and maintenance basis in anticipation that mining will resume at a future date when global prices are more favourable,' the ministry said.</p><p>Uganda expects winning bidders to also process Kilembe's copper output for domestic use. The government wants local copper to be used in the manufacture of electrical wires, transformers and coils to bolster its manufacturing industry, as well as for export.

His dominance of the party, however, evidenced by last week's strong performance in local elections, is such that they have no choice but accept it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, Johnson announced plans to cut carbon emissions by 78% compared to 1990 levels by 2035, bringing the timetable forward by 15 years, and vowed to use the pandemic to \"build back greener\".</p><p>On Friday, Alok Sharma, who Johnson moved from a cabinet post as business minister to be president-designate of COP26, described the summit as \"our best chance of building a brighter future [...] of green jobs and cleaner air\".</p><p>Johnson will chair the G7 summit in Cornwall next month and is expected to urge fellow wealthy nations to increase their financial assistance to poor countries to help them cut their emissions and pay for projects to mitigate the effects of dangerous climate change.</p><p>But, of course, this is Boris Johnson we are talking about and so there are contradictions between the rhetoric and the reality.</p><p>While the EU has its multi billion euro Green New Deal, and US President Joe Biden boasts a $2.3 trillion green infrastructure plan, the UK government's Ten Point Plan involves a mere \u00a34 billion of new funding.</p><p>A subsidy on environmentally friendly home improvements, designed to stimulate business amid the pandemic, was quietly scrapped because a complicated set of criteria and bureaucracy put consumers off.</p><p>And then there is coal. King Coal has been history in the UK for 30 years, an industry that fell victim to Margaret Thatcher's union-busting in the 1980s.</p><p>Yet the Johnson government has enthusiastically signed off on a new coalmine in the northwest of England, though it has since backtracked, first by insisting that the mine would only produce coking coal and then by putting the final decision to a public inquiry.</p><p>US climate envoy John Kerry has chided Johnson over the project, remarking that \"the marketplace has made the decision that coal is not the future\".</p><p>Alok Sharma, meanwhile, says that \"if we are serious about 1.5C, Glasgow must be the COP that consigns coal to history\".</p><p>The question for world leaders coming to Glasgow, who will be under pressure to step up their own carbon reduction targets, is which Johnson are we going to see?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A message from FACEBOOK: Working together to reduce COVID-19

Additionally, the authors of the study argue that the Commission's approach, focused too much on providing price signals and incentives for the private sector to lead the green transition.</p><p>They therefore call for a \"large-scale publicly funded investment initiative targeted at putting the required green infrastructure in place quickly and at scale\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green investments lead to economic growth</emphasis></p><p>The prevailing narrative around the green transition is that it entails a lot of costs and will require sacrifices from people. Moreover, a significant part of the green movement argues that the economy must shrink for the planet to stay within its ecological boundaries.</p><p>The FEPS study, however, argues that an investment-led approach to the green transition would have a largely expansionary effect on the economy.</p><p>In the long run, the study argues, every euro spent on green investments would lead to an increase in GDP of more than (EURO)5, the so-called multiplier effect. The (EURO)10 trillion in public investments over 12 years would thus result in a long-term increase of GDP of more than (EURO)50 trillion.</p><p>Due to this large economic expansion, this investment boom would decrease public debt levels relative to GDP even if the entire programme was financed by public debt.</p><p>However, the study heavily depends on its estimation of the multiplier effect, a notoriously difficult economic discipline. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/03/19/Building-Back-Better-How-Big-Are-Green-Spending-Multipliers-50264\">working paper</url> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from earlier this year, for example, found considerably smaller multiplier effects for spending on renewable energy than the authors of the FEPS study found for green investments.</p><p>Depending on the implementation of such an investment initiative, the positive effect on the economy could therefore be considerably smaller. Furthermore, the effect of public investments on the economy will only be positive if the infrastructure projects are useful and productive.</p><p>Na\u00efm Cordemans, an advisor to the Belgian secretary of state for recovery, strategic investment and scientific policy stressed that it takes time to develop good quality projects.</p><p>\"When you have to go fast, you open the drawer and look at the projects that were not financed before. But these might not be the best ones. There is a reason why they were not financed before\", Cordemans told a panel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU fiscal rules stand in the way of green investments</emphasis></p><p>At the moment, a public investment initiative of this scale appears politically unfeasible in Europe. The EU fiscal rules that are currently under review are one of the barriers to investments on such a scale.</p><p>The fiscal rules impose limits on debt levels and deficits. Crucially, they do not make a difference between investments and other public spending. Even though an investment might lead to GDP growth and therefore contribute to lower debt levels relative to GDP in the long term, the investment might need to be cancelled if it increases the public deficit in the short term.</p><p>The European Commission recently called for a broad debate on the future of the bloc's fiscal rules. One of the stated aims is to combine a long-term goal of lowering debt levels with increased investments in the green transition.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economic-governance/news/brussels-relaunches-eu-fiscal-reform-aims-to-boost-green-investments/\">Brussels relaunches EU fiscal reform, aims to boost green investments</url></h><p>The European Commission on Tuesday (19 October) took another step towards reforming the EU's much-discussed fiscal rules, including the bloc's strict debt and deficit limits enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>Another <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.feps-europe.eu/articles/36-project/91-fiscal-rules.html\">study</url> by FEPS proposes a way out of the dilemma by introducing, among other measures, a \"green golden rule\" that would enable debt-financed, sustainable investments worth at least 1.5% of GDP.</p><p>\"A green golden rule could be politically viable in the EU. Not only because green investments are a core priority in Europe but also because the EU has developed a taxonomy to give us an indication on what is sustainable and what is not\", said David Rinaldi, one of the authors of the study.</p><p>A recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bruegel.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PC-2021-18-0909.pdf\">policy contribution</url> by the economics thinktank Bruegel also backed a \"green golden rule\".</p><p>Additionally, the authors of the FEPS study proposed replacing the deficit rule with an expenditure rule that would only limit non-investment expenditure.</p><p>Anni Marttinen, a macroeconomist at the central organisation of Finnish trade unions, agreed with the general direction of the proposals but warned that it would be hard to define which expenditure should be considered investments and which were sustainable.</p><p>\"Supervision will be crucial,\" she concluded.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Benjamin

I'm proud of our partnership with the Government of Rwanda, which is helping to counter the work of criminal smuggling gangs.</p><p>But it's only one part of our wider strategy to overhaul the broken asylum system and ensure people can access safe and legal routes of migration. It's been clear for a long time that the current way of doing things, with desperate people paying their life savings to smugglers and crossing the ocean in flimsy dinghies, isn't working.</p><p>Increasingly tight visa restrictions are preventing Africans with valid reasons from visiting the UK - doesn't this undermine the promise of 'Global Britain'?</p><p>The United Kingdom is open to the world. Our businesses and universities are welcoming the best and brightest from across the globe, under a new post-Brexit visa system that breaks down disparities for non-European visitors - we're already seeing an increase in skilled immigration from outside Europe.</p><p>The Ukraine refugee crisis has created some delays in visitor visa processing times recently, but African businesses visitors and tourists are welcome and valued in the UK.</p><p>Africa will lose out multiple times to climate change - unable to fully tap hydrocarbon wealth, prevented from getting cheap energy to industrialise, worst affected by the effects of rising temperatures. Because self interest is a powerful lever, is it worth reminding Europeans nations what a climate exodus of migrants would really look like?</p><p>It is the great tragedy of the climate crisis that the countries which have belched out the least emissions face some of the biggest threats from rising global temperatures.</p><p>The good news is that we now have the solutions to climate change at our fingertips. We know what works, and how to marry new green technologies with rapid economic growth. The potential for this in Africa - to transform the continent's vast natural sun, wind and hydropower resources into clean energy for its people - are limitless.</p><p>The UK is helping to mitigate the impacts already being felt on the frontlines of climate change, including shoring up flood defences and supporting drought-resistant agriculture. And we are working with governments and industry to reverse the terrible loss of natural habitats and ensure that Africa's future transport networks and power grids protect people and planet.</p><p>French economic diplomacy in places like Nigeria and Kenya is leaving UK counterparts in the dust. Can't Brexit be an opportunity for UK companies? Current efforts appear small beer.</p><p>Free trade is the key to unlocking economic progress and drives peace and prosperity in societies.  I want the UK to be at the forefront of working with African partners on business innovation and clean green infrastructure development - and we're backing Africa's vision for a continental free trade agreement which the World Bank predicts will lift 98m people out of poverty by 2035.</p><p>Leaving the European Union has offered British businesses and investors huge opportunities to increase trade with key economies like Nigeria and Kenya, which I'm pleased to see them grasping with both hands. The facts speak for themselves. Trade between the UK and Africa is up nearly 30% from 2020, and we've now agreed trade deals with 18 countries on the continent - more than we had under the EU.</p><p>The latest report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development estimates that some $88bn in illicit financial flows (mainly tax evasion and deliberate trade mispricing schemes) left Africa in 2021, much of this money was routed through UK dependencies, such as British Virgin Islands, or tax-havens such as Jersey and Guernsey. Why doesn't the British government better finance its anti-corruption and investigative agencies, given that cutting these flows would strengthen African economies and boost their capacity for legitimate trade with industrial economies such as Britain's?</p><p>Corruption deprives a nation of its rightful resources and stifles economic growth. It's odious. We are working to tackle financial corruption worldwide, upping the settlement for the UK's National Crime Agency to \u00a3760m last year and providing direct technical assistance to governments in Africa to address money laundering.</p><p>Where funds are recovered, they can be ploughed back into development -earlier this year, for example, \u00a34.2m stolen by the governor of Nigeria's Delta State and recovered by UK agencies was returned to Nigeria to be spent on key public infrastructure works.</p><p>It's worth noting that the UK Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies have their own elected governments who are responsible for their financial services policy. They have committed to introduce publicly accessible registers of who ultimately owns companies registered there, which is a welcome and progressive step.</p><p>Your predecessor David Cameron described Nigeria as 'fantastically corrupt' then was subsequently criticized by the Treasury Select Committee for lobbying ministers in a text message campaign on behalf of Greensill Capital in which he had a significant personal interest. Do British politicians have any moral right to lecture African governments on accountability and good governance?</p><p>I don't believe in lecturing other governments and leaders. Every country can do more on accountability, but the reality is that the UK has robust institutions, free and fair media and an independent judiciary to hold government to account.</p><p>We're working in partnership with a number of African countries as they work to improve governance - in Tanzania for example the UK is supporting the government to deliver their strategy for public financial management, and in Zambia we funded a civil society-run voting tracker in the recent elections.</p><p>Does the UK support Lady Scotland for a second term in charge of the Commonwealth?</p><p>We are of course grateful to Baroness Scotland for her service to the Commonwealth, but after consideration, I have decided that the UK will support Jamaican candidate Kamina Johnson Smith to be the next Secretary-General. She has the vast experience and support across the Commonwealth to unite our unique family of nations. As we come out of the pandemic and deal with the global fallout from Russia's barbaric invasion of Ukraine, a new Secretary-General can address challenges head on and seize the many opportunities the Commonwealth offers.</p><p>With the growing influence of Russia in the Sahel, and waning ability of France to hold the line, what can the UK offer either African governments in the Sahel or international efforts to promote peace and development?</p><p>It's important that the international community doesn't take its eye off the Sahel, with Russian mercenaries and Daesh offshoots sowing insecurity and suffering. I discussed this with my friend President Akufo-Addo in London a few months ago - the UK is committed to strengthening security cooperation with our allies in West Africa.</p><p>We're funding the humanitarian response, providing \u00a3160m in aid to the region since 2019, and using our diplomatic presence across the region to promote peace and stability - through troop contributions to the UN mission in Mali, for example, and conflict resolution work in Niger.</p><p>How can UK positively affect peace talks in Ethiopia?</p><p>The crisis in Tigray has been deeply concerning, threatening to set back recent democratic and economic progress in Ethiopia. The UK is committed to working with the parties to support the peace process, and my Africa Minister Vicky Ford has been working with the government in Addis to drive progress.</p><p>The only way to end the violence and alleviate the humanitarian crisis is through a negotiated, political solution; we would like the see the parties get round the table for meaningful talks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT200620220007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65RN-18T1-F00C-63TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 20, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It could actually create a healthier, more stable and more secure future for our youngest and future generations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To do that, the Italian prime minister will have to use his role as president of this year's G20 leaders' summit to charm China into a new alliance that brings the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter on board for a global transformation to net zero emissions.</p><p>This will be no easy feat, against the backdrop of raging weather extremes, Afghan turmoil and the unrelenting Covid-19 pandemic. But tackling these global crises takes cooperation between the biggest economic and political powers and across East and West, developed and developing worlds. And there is no better place to begin building that cooperation than in the G20, whose leaders meet in a summit chaired by Draghi in Rome on 30-31 October.</p><p>Draghi's charm offensive started this month, with a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two reportedly agreed on the need to lead their bilateral relationship through China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for international infrastructure development and for coordination between the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022 and Milan in 2026.</p><p>Next, however, Draghi will need to turn attention to brokering a G20 agreement on climate action with China's buy-in - starting with the United Nations General Assembly this week, where leaders will gather in person and virtually.</p><p>Specifically, the climate crisis calls for agreement between the 20 economies and emitters to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and follow the science on what it takes to get there. That includes phasing out support for coal and earmarking some Covid-19 recovery spending to cut emissions and adapt to the climate impacts we're already experiencing.</p><p>China is crucial in this agreement because what it does on foreign and domestic policy sends waves around the world, through its expansive BRI, its world-leading share of emissions, its seat on the UN Security Council and its economic and political influence in Asia, Africa and elsewhere.</p><p>The question is whether Draghi can meet the challenge of forging international leadership, after years of Italy driving from Europe's backseat.</p><p>We certainly think he can. As a former head of the Financial Stability Board and European Central Bank, Draghi has experience forging cooperation rooted in economic security. It helps that, as the first Western power to join the BRI in 2019, Italy started building a new and trusted partnership with China during its darker relations with the US Trump administration.</p><p>In so doing, Draghi would revive Italian explorer Marco Polo's role as a bridge between the East and the West, a reliable and pragmatic security and humanitarian partner and a green economic partner with China along the many modern-day Silk Roads.</p><p>Here's how. First, Draghi needs to present Xi with a strong political offer: an in-person visit to Rome for the G20 leaders summit. There was no reported mention of this on their phone call. But as Xi's first international trip since the Covid-19 pandemic began, it would send a political signal of new efforts to collaborate, allow Xi to meet the new US President Joe Biden and attend the crucial UN climate summit in Glasgow the following week.</p><p>Second, Draghi needs to reassure Xi that a consensus deal is within reach. This would ensure that Xi can bring home a win after leaving the country in the midst of one of the world's strictest Covid-related restrictions. This deal should of course include strong climate ambition, with an accelerated coal phase out.</p><p>Third, Draghi can expand the Italy-China relationship with a joint commitment for climate action and international Covid-19 vaccine distribution. They could commit to aligning future investment in the other country with a global warming limit of 1.5 degrees and each country's target for reaching net zero emissions. This should include commitments to exclude new investments in fossil fuels, including gas, and to jointly invest in projects in third countries that exclude coal, oil and gas.</p><p>For both China and Italy, the only credible path forward is one with strong green credentials. Anything less could be dismissed as a kowtow to China.</p><p>For Italy, building and leading a new East-West alliance is a chance to pick up the mantle of an awkward-but-friendly outward-looking European interlocutor, particularly in an uncertain post-Brexit Europe where Germany and France face leadership challenges. 2021 has been one of Italy's most successful years in a long time. Now comes the geopolitical test that could showcase Italy's ability to thrive outside the long shadows of France, Germany and Great Britain.</p><p>A concerted deal on G20 climate action will reposition Italy in this new era of major power diplomacy while helping pave a new Silk Road for cooperation and investment towards clean and green infrastructure. This, in turn, will set a positive foundation for global agreement at the UN's COP26 climate summit Glasgow in November, which Italy is co-hosting with the UK.</p><p>It's time for Draghi to begin a new Marco Polo act.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1645643</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63MK-J0R1-JCF9-435K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 17, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU-China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>G20</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mario Draghi</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

normalizedValue=\"https://epc.eu/en/past-events/The-future-of-the-EU-ASEAN-partnership~37fc08\">event</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) consists of Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippnes, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We all know ASEAN is growing very rapidly economically and demographically but also in terms of CO2 emissions,\" Driesmans said, calling the potential future figures \"staggering.\"</p><p>While the growth of energy-related CO2 emissions <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/24/4650/pdf\">has slowed</url> in some major emitters in the region due to improved energy efficiency, the overall share of ASEAN countries in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions\">global emissions</url> has been steadily rising from 3.07% in 2000 to 4.39% in 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile, Southeast Asia's energy demand is projected to grow by 60% to 2040, and it was one of the few regions where the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/southeast-asia-energy-outlook-2019\">share of coal in the power mix is increasing</url>, with policy choices indicating that coal demand is projected to rise steadily over the coming decades to fuel coal-fired power plants, according to a 2019 report of the International Energy Agency.</p><p>One 2018 <url normalizedValue=\"http://environment.asean.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SOER-Executive-Summary.pdf\">study</url> showed that energy-related CO2 emission levels could rise in the ASEAN region by as much as 61% from 2014 to 2025, with rapid urbanisation as one of the factors affecting emissions.</p><p>At the same time, five of the fifteen countries most affected by climate change between 1999-2018 are located in the ASEAN region: Myanmar (ranked at number 2), the Philippines (4), Vietnam (6), Thailand (8), and Cambodia (12), according to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://germanwatch.org/sites/germanwatch.org/files/20-2-01e%20Global%20Climate%20Risk%20Index%202020_14.pdf\">Climate Risk Index</url>\u00a0</emphasis>2020.</p><p>Cambodian Environment Minister Say Samal, who chairs the meeting of ASEAN ministers on environmental issues, said the bloc's countries are working on the updates to their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in the context of the Paris Agreement, which set concrete targets for each country to reduce emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change by 2030.</p><p>\"Although the commitment to greenhouse gas reduction targets is voluntary for least developed countries like Cambodia, setting clear targets demonstrates ASEAN Member States' serious commitment to addressing this disastrous global threat,\" Samal told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Asean</emphasis> magazine in a recent interview.</p><p>According to Samal, whose country managed to increase the share of solar power in its electricity production capacity from zero to almost 10% in four years, one of the key commitments made by ASEAN is to achieve a 21.9 per cent reduction in energy intensity compared to 2005 levels.</p><p>\"Things like the Green Deal can be of great interest to ASEAN if packaged, delivered, and supported by the EU in terms of a green recovery, a better recovery and a sustainable recovery,\" according to Noel Clehane, global head of regulatory and public policy at BDO, a consulting and business advisory firm.</p><p>Clehane pointed out, however, that\u00a0there is a sense in ASEAN that the Green Deal and all of the initiatives around climate may be \"protectionism in disguise.\"</p><p>There is a growing worry in Southeast Asian partners that green projects like the carbon border tax could effectively be a barrier to imports.</p><p>\"I think the climate diplomacy side of things at the EU level could really do with a bit more gloss,\" said Shada Islam, senior adviser at the European Policy Centre think tank.</p><p>\"We're not communicating the Green Deal, ... creating a bit of uncertainty in the world about what the plans are but that's possibly because we don't know ourselves yet.\"</p><p>Jaya Ratnam, Ambassador of Singapore to the EU, said that one area of convergence between the EU and ASEAN is green financing, which will be much needed to sustainably complete the infrastructural projects in the region.</p><p>One joint initiative is the $1 billion ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility that will provide loans and technical assistance for state-run green infrastructure projects on sustainable transport, clean energy, and resilient water systems, more than half of it financed by the European Investment Bank, as well as the German and French national development banks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Georgi Gotev/Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Before she was elected to the European Parliament, Kountoura was tourism minister in the government of Alexis Tsipras (2015-2019). </emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">She responded in writing to questions from EURACTIV about the future of tourism in the Mediterranean region.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">////</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Mediterranean region is the world\u2019s leading tourist destination, welcoming more than 400 million people per year. At the same time, tourism also causes environmental degradation and is a growing source of greenhouse gas emissions, notably from transport. How can tourism be reconciled with green objectives? Can emissions be reduced to zero?</emphasis></p><p>The Mediterranean is a precious ecosystem of life on land and below water, and also a cradle of diverse cultures, history and civilisations that makes it one of the top global tourism destinations.\u00a0</p><p>Yet, the future of the Mediterranean is under threat and concerns us all. A common vision and strategy, followed by firm action are required for its protection. It is a great challenge, and an even greater responsibility to act proactively to mitigate the environmental crisis in the Med and to ensure the well-being of its people, who are the first to be impacted by human activity.</p><p>To succeed in this goal, no country can do it alone. We need to cooperate to accomplish the Paris Agreement on climate change and set common targets and deadlines to achieve sooner than 2050 the reduction of 90% of greenhouse emissions from the transport sector, and such should be the case for tourism and travel.</p><p>We also need to align our national strategies and policies and act together for the protection of the environment, but also for sustainable business activity and sustainable jobs in the whole region. Because in the end, tourism is all about connecting people and places, and tourism\u2019s workforce is its strongest asset.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who are the leading countries or municipalities on sustainable tourism across the Mediterranean region? Are there best practices that are worth mentioning that others could draw inspiration from?</emphasis></p><p>Several destinations in the Mediterranean and Southern Europe region have partnered through Interreg and other European programs, and today represent success stories in how to work together, exchange best practices and implement ambitious plans that are already transforming popular destinations.\u00a0</p><p>I can speak of inspiring examples in my country Greece, where several islands are in the process of becoming sustainable. For example, Astypalea island has already shifted to e-mobility by switching from conventional to electric vehicles. </p><p>Tilos island is to become the first island in the Mediterranean 100% energy self-sufficient, using solar and wind for energy, and 80% of its waste is now recycled. Paros aims to become the first single-use plastic, waste-free island in the Med. </p><p>And Rhodes has launched the \u201cCo-Lab\u201d project for a holistic sustainable transformation of the destination\u2019s tourism value chain, for environmental, social and economic progress.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What initiatives is the European Union taking in order to promote more sustainable tourism?</emphasis></p><p>Tourism represents over 10% of the European economy and employment, and also supports social cohesion. It is a multiplier of growth, supporting almost every productive sector, such as transportation, energy, agriculture, construction, trade and creative industries.\u00a0</p><p>Therefore, tourism\u2019s sustainable transformation should be placed high on the European agenda. The European Parliament has adopted a resolution in March 2021 for the urgent need for an EU Strategy for sustainable tourism, the first to be drafted.\u00a0</p><p>Following our resolution, the European Commission presented last June the Transition Pathway for Tourism. This paper is basically shaping the guidelines for tourism stakeholders to take action and will lead to the European Agenda for Tourism 2030, following a wide consultation across Europe.\u00a0</p><p>Sustainable tourism strategies will not only help tackle seasonality by extending the tourism season but also prevent overtourism and its negative impact on the destination, by developing sustainable alternative tourism offering and green infrastructure in both the public and private sectors. </p><p>Tourism activities that will help preserve local culture, history and heritage, whether it is natural or cultural sites, but also local gastronomy and local products by local producers, and artefacts by local craftspeople, are part of a global trend and mindset about how each traveller can positively contribute to the destination. </p><p>Authentic travel experiences, such as nature-based activities, ecotourism, health tourism, sports tourism and cultural tourism, allow visitors\u2019 flows to spread year-round, but mostly create steady business and income to the benefit of the environment, the economy and the society.\u00a0</p><p>The European and national strategies for sustainable tourism will require significant funding for European stakeholders and especially SMEs. European funding is available through various instruments, which are however scattered and very difficult to access. </p><p>The EU needs to do more in terms of funding, such as creating a new budget line specifically for tourism and facilitating access to funding, especially for SMEs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cities like Venice have restricted access to large ships from their waters because of the environmental damage they can cause. In cities, ferries also emit toxic fumes that cause air pollution. Do you think a European framework is needed to address this nuisance? Or is this a matter best addressed at the local level?</emphasis></p><p>Common European guidelines and rules are definitely needed to prevent environmental harm from excessive marine activities. Indeed, several major cruise destinations and European ports are introducing restrictions to prevent environmental degradation. </p><p>The European Parliament adopted last month its legislative resolution concerning the EU rules on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport. The whole of Southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin relies heavily on shipping and on cruise activity, requiring stricter rules and more ambitious targets to tackle pollution. </p><p>We, therefore, called for the shipping sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 2% from 2025, 20% from 2035 and 80% from 2050 compared to 2020 levels. National and local governments, but also the private sector, have to take into account the emergency and align to adopt more effective measures the sooner as possible.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The European Union is considering restrictions on pollution from maritime fuels as well as measures to encourage electric mobility. What is the relevance of this for the tourism industry? Can clean mobility become a selling point for the Mediterranean?\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Electromobility is about to become the norm in our everyday life in the coming years, on how we move and travel.\u00a0The European Parliament recently voted on the resolution regarding the AFIR Regulation, part of the \u2018Fit for 55\u2019 package and the strongest legal framework we have come up with, to date. </p><p>The Regulation sets legally binding minimum requirements for member states to develop the necessary alternative fuel infrastructure, aiming to create a fully interconnected and interoperable network across Europe. </p><p>Our position is steady that we need in advance to secure adequate infrastructure across all European road networks and in popular spots within cities, to be able to cope with the increasing need for capacity of both residents, professionals, and visitors. </p><p>We know Europe is a leader globally in addressing climate change. I would like to see Europe also become a global example of green travel, being the most visited destination in the world.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some municipalities have started restricting access to sites or cities in order to prevent nuisance caused by tourism. Are we moving towards the end of mass tourism?</emphasis></p><p>Mass tourism is gradually giving its place to authentic personalised and diversified travel experiences, which have been trending in the past years. The pandemic and the priority on health safety have accelerated the changes in travel patterns. </p><p>We already see a swift shift in demand for experiences linked with health tourism, wellness, sports and outdoor activities in nature. Countries and destinations that in the past had relied heavily on mass tourism or almost exclusively on the sea-sun-sand are already shifting towards thematic tourism products based on their natural and cultural wealth that will bring new demand and new tourist flows throughout the year. </p><p>It is very important though, to have the right framework in place so that businesses can be supported to adjust to the new demand, in terms of tourism products and services. States also must provide a holistic strategy and action plan, with clear guidelines and the necessary funding for the infrastructure needed in destinations, for business activity to be able to develop such services, for the workforce\u2019s upskilling and reskilling, and eventually to attract new investments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The European Parliament has proposed that Member States draft national plans for sustainable tourism, as part of the COVID-19 recovery programme. What progress has been made on this? How much support is there for the idea?</emphasis></p><p>Transportation and tourism were the sectors mostly hit by the pandemic outbreak. In our resolution for the first EU strategy for sustainable tourism, we asked member-states to devise national plans for sustainable tourism development, with funding from the Next Generation EU program.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Especially countries that rely on tourism, should be able to rebuild a stronger, more resilient and more sustainable tourism sector. Yet, each country has been responsible for the national plan submitted, based on specific national priorities. </p><p>There is no way to track the exact amount each country has secured for tourism, as such actions are part of the wider horizontal national strategies, for example, digitisation and greening of the economy.\u00a0</p><p>What also is important, especially in times of crises, such as now, is that we are dealing with an acute shock in energy prices and inflation, countries should rethink their taxation policies, and implement tax reliefs on goods and services that are heavily related to tourism.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It is essential to support local, family-run, small and medium-sized businesses, which are at the core of hospitality and represent about 90 per cent of business in the wider tourism sector.\u00a0</p><p>And the most urgent priority of all is to support the workforce and restore jobs in the sector at the pre-pandemic levels. Tourism suffered a great shock with the loss of millions of jobs globally and in Europe due to the pandemic. </p><p>Also, the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d phenomenon needs intense efforts at all levels to be reversed permanently. So, a permanent solution requires combined efforts from the public and private sectors, focusing on supportive policies to ensure decent work conditions and better salaries in the sector, specialised employment programs, mutually recognised skills across boarders and flexibility, as well as support for ongoing education, training and new skill development.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you believe specific restrictions on tourism should apply to islands, which have a more fragile ecosystem? Can the EU bring added value here or are these decisions best taken at the local level?\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Responsible governance at a local level is imperative to prioritise the different needs of each island for building up resilience, including managing its natural resources and its tourism activities, addressing climate change impacts, diversifying the local economy and engaging the local community. Coordination of local efforts with central policies is of course needed.</p><p>Yet, at a European level, it is today more than urgent to tackle collectively the issue of insularity which is key for Europe\u2019s social and economic cohesion and inclusiveness. Many remote and island regions of Europe have special needs that were systematically neglected for decades. </p><p>Decision-making has been poor in mitigating the high cost of transportation that islands and remote areas endure, mostly because of the lack of efficient and affordable mobility and connectivity. </p><p>While in the summer, several are very popular destinations, this is not the case for the winter, where everyday life is difficult for locals and the cost of living is becoming unbearable, with the current energy crisis.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Now is the time that policies in the Med and Europe for sustainability, green and digital transition, address in a fair way the issue of insularity. Not only because it is a matter of social justice for the people living in these areas, but also because growing social and economic inequalities threaten cohesion. </p><p>If the transition to sustainability is not entirely fair, covering the needs of all citizens and all regions, a significant part of the human capital, entrepreneurship and jobs in several European regions is at risk of being lost. These areas also need to be facilitated for their green and digital transformation, and for adopting circular practices in green growth and blue economy.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You also mentioned the idea of creating a European crisis management mechanism to ensure a just transition to a green economy.

Green opportunities and investments are vital to assist in the country's long-term energy transition.</p><p>For Europe, the Cotonou agreement provides a framework within which the multi-billion-dollar European Green New Deal can benefit ACP countries through new investments in green infrastructure and technology.</p><p>The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/von-der-leyen-calls-for-african-green-deal/\">argued</url> that the green transition and the transition to renewable energy, in particular, can be an engine of post-COVID-19 recovery in both Europe and Africa, calling this 'the biggest economic opportunity of our times'.</p><p>Across Europe, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.die-gdi.de/en/the-current-column/article/how-the-european-green-deal-should-reshape-africa-eu-relations/\">discussions</url> have kicked off on <url normalizedValue=\"https://ettg.eu/publications/green-transitions-in-africa-europe-relations-what-role-for-the-european-green-deal/\">how Africa can benefit</url> from the European Green New Deal by accessing much-needed investment for its sustainable energy transition. These discussions should also touch on how to learn from past development failures, as European nations support African nations' Green New Deals.</p><p>Yet, across Africa, there is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/cotonou-20-a-bad-trade-deal-for-africa/a-57503372\">growing concern</url> that the post-Cotonou agreement fails to recognize the intra-Africa Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) as the framework within which the African Union articulates its policies to promote economic growth and sustainable development. In not recognizing AfCFTA, it may be the EU that ends up <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/africa/opinion/building-an-eu-africa-partnership-of-equals/\">losing out on an opportunity</url>.</p><p>Due to its size and importance, Nigeria's renewable energy transition offers as much if not more opportunity to Europe as Europe's Green New Deal offers to Nigeria.</p><p>Nigeria's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.power.gov.ng/download/NREEE%20POLICY%202015-%20FEC%20APPROVED%20COPY.pdf\">renewable energy policy</url>, and in particular its new <url normalizedValue=\"https://rea.gov.ng/solar-power-naija/\">solar power plan</url>, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.africanews.com/2020/12/07/african-countries-must-take-a-balanced-approach-to-the-energy-transition-by-nj-ayuk/\">immense potential</url> given the country's energy needs and its diesel-dependent economy in which more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.se4all-africa.org/seforall-in-africa/country-data/nigeria/\">40% of the population</url> has limited access to electricity.</p><p>Implementation is the major challenge for Nigeria's plans. The success of the plan to use renewables to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978725/\">promote energy security</url> in Nigeria relies on private investment. In the history of development and of the EU's partnership with Africa this has been a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/1087-extracting-profit\">recipe for disaster</url>.</p><p>With Cotonou 2.0, there is a chance to choose a different model than the one that has failed in the past, by balancing investment promotion with strengthening industrial policy and the national agencies involved in its implementation.</p><p>In describing Africa's green energy transition as an opportunity for Europe, there is a need to question <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2c30674-a4c9-3b47-9e50-f47c6f45495c\">for whom</url> new opportunities exist, who is being <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/green-new-deal-whom/\">left out</url>, and how economic transformation can foster genuine diversification and inclusive sustainable growth.</p><p>In turn, sustainability and green investment from Europe cannot be based on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://africasacountry.com/2020/11/energy-transitions-and-colonialism\">historical patten</url> of domination and extraction.</p><p>To break the mould, the new EU-Africa partnership should focus on strengthening African governments and working with them on their renewable energy strategies. Nigeria's solar power plan underscores the possibilities of an energy transition that is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2018.1455143\">state-led</url>.</p><p>The role of the state should be to maximize the potential for industrial development and green jobs. A partnership with Europe would therefore involve European support for African green new deals on African terms and private investment that is directed by, and conforms to, the national development strategies and industrial policies of African states.</p><p>In Nigeria, the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) has suggested the solar power plan has the potential to impact up to 25 million beneficiaries, create 250,000 jobs, generate $17 million in tax revenue, and achieve $10 million in annual import substitution-all from a $75 million investment.</p><p>While these would seem to be inflated figures, the 20th-century new deal was a state-led approach to economic development, largely aspirational in the beginning, that did indeed drastically reduce unemployment in the US. In a country like Nigeria, in which official youth unemployment is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-youth-unemployment-trfn-idUSKBN29V1EX\">nearly 30%</url>, there is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/42135/can-renewables-light-up-nigerias-economic-growth/\">enormous potential</url> in such an approach.</p><p>The most important, yet underdeveloped, aspect of Nigeria's solar power plan is the promotion of large-scale assembly of solar components in Nigeria, or the 'local content' aspect. For the past two decades, local content has been fundamental to Nigeria's strategy to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214790X14000604\">capture more benefit</url> from its petroleum resources.</p><p>Although this strategy was slow to take off, it is a made-in-Nigeria approach supported by a variety of stakeholders and led by the Nigerian government through the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB).</p><p>The role of foreign governments and international oil companies should be to offer support and assistance, which they are more inclined to offer given the strategic importance and significance of Nigeria's oil resources.</p><p>If it is serious about a just transition, Europe's role in promoting renewable energy in Africa must also be focused on support to state agencies like the REA, debt relief, investment directed in alignment with its strategy, and facilitating rather than hindering local content, technology transfer, and in-country value addition to address longer-term structural transformation.</p><p>In this way, Nigerians and Africans more broadly will be not only users of green energy but producers of the technology and inputs used in the renewable energy industry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1617113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62XR-2KH1-JCF9-418M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 16, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000619</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

As the United Nations Secretary-General says, we are on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/04/1090072\">edge of the abyss</url> and so our next step has to be in the right direction.</p><p>As home to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/11/global-continent-urban-population-urbanisation-percent/\">more than half</url>the world's population, action taken by cities plays a huge part in cutting emissions.

Countries, especially those in the Global North, must step up. C40 cities are pioneering the action that governments everywhere can be inspired by.</p><p>Youth activists, alongside the rest of civil society, must keep up the pressure on governments at all levels to treat the crisis with the urgency it demands.

They were demanding the House first approve a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan package of other public works projects that's already passed the Senate.</p><p>In brokering the compromise, Pelosi committed to voting on the bipartisan package no later than Sept. 27, an attempt to assure lawmakers it won't be left on the sidelines. It's also in keeping with with Pelosi's insistence that the two bills move together as a more complete collection of Biden's priorities. Pelosi has set a goal of passing both by Oct. 1.</p><p>Easing off the stalemate will shelve, for now, the stark divisions between moderate and progressive lawmakers who make up the Democrats' so-slim House majority. But as the drama spilled out during what was supposed to be a quick session as lawmakers returned to work for a few days in August, it showcased the party differences that threaten to upend Biden's ambitious rebuilding agenda.</p><p>'A \"which side are you on\" moment'</p><p>With Republicans fully opposed to the president's big plans and arguing that Congress should be focused instead on the crisis in Afghanistan, the Democratic leaders have just a few votes to spare. That gives any band of lawmakers leverage that can be used to make or break a deal, as they are in position to do in the weeks to come as moderates and progressives draft and vote on the broader $3.5 trillion package.</p><p>\"I think it's important to those of us who are moderate Democrats to make sure that our voices are heard,\" said Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., one of the negotiators.</p><p>Challenging their party's most powerful leaders, nine moderate Democrats signed onto a letter late last week raising their objections to pushing ahead with Biden's broader infrastructure proposal without first considering the smaller public works plan that has already passed the Senate.</p><p>Their ranks grew as other moderates, including Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a leader of the Blue Dog caucus of centrist Democrats, raised similar concerns.</p><p>Progressives were outraged at the moderates, blaming them for potentially jamming Biden's agenda, which is stocked with hard-fought party goals like child care, paid family leave and Medicare expansion, along with green infrastructure spending.</p><p>Outside groups, including Justice Democrats, started running campaign ads and members of Our Revolution, the organization aligned with Bernie Sanders, protested Tuesday outside the New Jersey office of Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a leader of the moderate effort.</p><p>\"This is a 'which side are you on' moment,'\" said Our Revolution executive director Joseph Geevarghese, who promised to \"organize like never before to hold Democrats accountable and get this bill over the finish line.\"</p><p>The budget measure is at the heart of Biden's \"Build Back Better\" vision for helping families and combating climate change and is progressives' top priority, all of it largely financed with tax increases on the rich and big business.</p><p>The House committees are already fast at work drafting legislation to fill in the details of the $3.5 trillion package for consideration later this fall.</p><p>Democratic balancing act</p><p>Progressives signaled early on they wanted the Biden budget priorities first before they agree to the smaller Senate package, worried it would be an insufficient down-payment on his goals.</p><p>But the moderates want the opposite, insisting Congress quickly send the smaller, bipartisan infrastructure measure they helped shape with the senators to Biden so he can sign it before the political winds shift.</p><p>While the moderates insist they also want to support Biden's broader package, progressives are skeptical. Senate centrists Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., have said they cannot support a $3.5 trillion package.</p><p>In fact, the moderates were also trying to win assurances from Pelosi that whatever version of the broader bill they draft in the House will be the same in the Senate \u2014 setting up another showdown between the party's competing flanks and their vision for the rebuilding priorities.</p><p>The compromise structured Tuesday's vote to include passage of the budget resolution and the commitment for the September vote on the bipartisan package as part of a procedural vote, called the Rule.</p><p>So far, the White House has backed Pelosi as she has led her party in a tightly scripted strategy.</p><p>Republicans plan to reject the the $3.5 trillion effort as big government spending, and GOP support for the slimmer $1 trillion bipartisan measure is now uncertain.</p><p>The conservative House Freedom Caucus said it opposes both the Biden budget and the bipartisan bill.</p><p>Republicans blasted Democrats for pursuing their priorities at a time when they said all focus should be on Afghanistan, as thousands of people including Americans are trying to flee the country as the U.S. withdraws its forces.</p><p>\"We should be doing nothing else on this floor until every single American is home,\" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader.</p><p>Inserting his own wedge into the politics of the situation, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday on Fox News that he was rooting for the House moderates.</p><p>\"I wish the moderates in the House success,\" McConnell said. \"I'm pulling for them.\"</p><p>(FRANCE 24 with AP)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-236925685</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63FM-9XT1-F11P-X3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1068\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Sadly, it has done little to douse the '<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2014/09/20/europes-ring-of-fire\">ring of fire'</url> that surrounds the European neighbourhood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turkey and Russia may be inching towards a potential ceasefire in Libya, but the conflict ravages on. Likewise, in\u00a0war-torn\u00a0Syria, the civil war continues unabated. The added burdens brought by the pandemic has pushed Syrian civilians to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/in-war-torn-syria-the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-brought-its-people-to-the-brink-of-starvation-144794\">brink of starvation</url>.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/burkina-faso/central-sahel-spike-violence-leads-higher-deaths-more-1-million-fleeing-homes\">confirmed last week</url> that rising violence across the Sahel - particularly in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - caused a 62% spike in deaths and forced more than a million people to flee their homes in 2019 alone.</p><p>The fires of the Moria refugee camp in Greece and rising tensions with Turkey over Eastern Mediterranean gas fields mean that five years on from the migration crisis, Europe's sticking plaster solutions look like they are starting to peel off.</p><p>The EU Commission must invest in the root causes of conflict and migration to effectively support peace, and the European Green Deal is one of the best instruments it can deploy.</p><p>It's often assumed the conflicts we see today are driven by a cocktail of politics, geostrategy and even ideology. But our understanding of the complex triggers of instability and violence show that climate change, environmental degradation and the struggle to control a finite pool of natural resources are increasingly important factors.</p><p>The disruptive effects of climate change on food systems are putting millions at dire risk of food insecurity, and this is all too often a pathway towards conflict and violence. This is particularly acute in many countries across the Middle East as well as in North and Sub-Saharan Africa. Its effects on the African continent - which is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2018-march-2019/global-warming-severe-consequences-africa\">warming faster</url> than any other - are particularly profound.</p><p>In her State of the Union speech, Ursula Von der Leyen upped the ante in the Commission's climate ambitions, now looking to reduce EU emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030. This revises an earlier target of 40%.</p><p>This heightened ambition is welcome, but if Von der Leyen's Commission want to promote peacebuilding and socio-economic development in the European neighbourhood, then the conclusion is simple. The EU must put the transformation of food systems at the very heart of its strategy.</p><p>The EU's Green Deal - through which it hopes to mobilise at least (EURO)100 billion for climate-friendly economic development between 2021 and 2027 - is a\u00a0unique opportunity to\u00a0align the objectives and incentives set out in Europe's COVID-19 recovery plans with climate-friendly development and food systems transformation in Europe's neighbourhood.</p><p>The need for green investment is urgent. The cash promised by world leaders to pay for the UN's ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) falls $2.5 trillion short every year. This means trillions less for green infrastructure, energy, food security, agriculture, rural livelihoods, climate change adaptation and mitigation, health and education.</p><p>The Green Deal could help align a small but sufficient portion of private capital invested daily in capital markets towards achieving the SDGs. Encouragingly, the volume of private sector investment that integrate 'environmental, social and governance' (ESG) factors has increased dramatically to $22.8 trillion so we should capitalise on this appetite for financial investments with social returns.</p><p>The EU's ambition to decarbonise by 2050 - and the consequential need for cleaner energy - could also drive investment in renewables provided by African and Middle Eastern partners, providing livelihoods that counter the draw of radicalisation.</p><p>The European Union remains the world's biggest market for agri-foods, and 2019 was a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/2019-record-year-eu-agri-food-trade-2020-mar-27_en#:~:text=2019%20proved%20to%20be%20a,year%20to%20%E2%82%AC270.5%20billion.\">record year</url>\u00a0with a trade surplus of (EURO)31.9 billion. Its sheer size means it can almost dictate or at least heavily influence standards in markets across the world. It can use its influence to drive transformation all along the food supply chain - from smallholder farming to large scale Agri-Tech food production.</p><p>Setting food waste and recycling standards for the EU's half a billion consumers can also drive a dramatic step change in how we encourage a more circular economy. This will have knock-on effects on supply and demand that will ricochet all the way back through food systems, while also helping Europe to reduce its carbon footprint.</p><p>The EU needs to break down institutional silos, ensuring coherence between internal policies and external action so it can better address the complex interlinkages between climate change, food systems, peace, migration and prosperity.</p><p>From my own experience, I see a stark need to make humanitarians, peacebuilders, climate scientists, agriculturalists and investors work together more effectively. The European Green Deal could be the glue that brings us together.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1513971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YY-RSV1-DYXB-V007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 2, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>green investment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East and North Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N541710GG</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRNP</classCode><className>GREEN DEALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp;

The stimulus package, which follows an initial (EURO)25 billion package introduced in March, includes a mix of grants and tax breaks to help firms ride out the downturn. It also offers help to families, including subsidies for childcare and incentives to boost the ravaged tourism sector.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The key measures</emphasis></p><p>The new decree temporarily freezes corporate tax for all companies with an annual turnover below (EURO)250 million and grants non-repayable aid of up to (EURO)40,000 to small businesses.</p><p>The package also allows the government to intervene and recapitalize struggling companies in line with new EU state aid rules on allowing public capital injections.</p><p>\"The tools that we are introducing have been defined by the new European framework and are being adopted in all countries,\" said Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri, adding that Italy was among the first countries to make use of the new EU rules.</p><p>The government also earmarked (EURO)25.6 billion to extend existing unemployment benefits, more than (EURO)3 billion for the health care system, (EURO)1.4 billion for universities and research, and more than (EURO)1 billion for the agricultural sector.</p><p>The decree also introduces a so-called \"emergency income\" of up to (EURO)800<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>for low-income families.</p><p>Minister Gualtieri also announced (EURO)2 billion in aid to help businesses which will have to adapt their activities to meet new social distancing requirements, particularly in the tourism sector.</p><p>Italy will also grant residence permits to migrants working in the agriculture and housekeeping sectors.</p><p>\"We did an incredible job,\" says the premier. \"We have approved an impressive decree that supports businesses, workers and the health care system, but also lays the foundations for the future, for a new start.\"</p><p>The political contrasts and the difficulties of finding this mountain of resources, which represent two financial manoeuvres in one, took many weeks of work. And the prime minister explained that he had the clear feeling that every hour that passed would weigh on companies and workers. For Conte, the government worked with in the awareness of the difficulties in which the country finds itself in mind.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Italian green deal</emphasis></p><p>The stimulus package is an emergency measure, of a different nature will be the investments that the government will have to implement if the recovery fund is approved by the European Council.</p><p>Italy would receive (EURO)81.8 billion in grants and (EURO)90.9 billion in loans at very low rates. To access these funds, a National Reform and Public Investment Plan will have to be presented by next October. This is a great opportunity to define an organic framework for the measures to relaunch the country, to overcome the - perhaps inevitable in the first phase - emergency and fragmented nature of the measures adopted so far.</p><p>The commission proposal foresees that the use of grants and loans from the recovery fund should be aimed at pursuing the green deal as a strategy for Europe's economic growth, capable not only of addressing the emergency, but also of ensuring a future for the next generation.</p><p>The resources of the recovery fund should be used to implement a number of challenging measures which are briefly listed in the commission's communication. The first measures mentioned are those for the achievement of more ambitious targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 that require significant investments in energy transition, energy efficiency and savings, development of renewables, hydrogen and carbon capture and sequestration technologies.</p><p>Important and strategic changes are also required in urban mobility systems, particularly with new forms of sharing, and in vehicles, towards low impact vehicles and electrification. These strategies should also be rooted locally, in cities, by investing in new urban regeneration projects that include not only traditional regeneration of buildings and brownfield sites, but also climate mitigation and adaptation measures and an enhancement of green infrastructure.</p><p>The European recovery fund is an unmissable opportunity that Italy should not waste to activate a deep process of structural modernization of the country's economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LLOENG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603D-1JR1-JC8F-N004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442999</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Leaders League All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Leaders League Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28199\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 5, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DGXV</classCode><className>ECONOMIC STIMULUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0F9</classCode><className>US ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 2008-2009</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

JP Morgan and Citigroup both announced combined commitments of $255m for their own respective initiatives, which aim to target projects with financial and social returns.</p><p>These commitments reflect similar trends we are seeing in the green bonds markets: global investors want more investments that combine returns with positive environmental outcomes.</p><p>In 2019, green bond issuances continued to soar, even overshooting initial projections.</p><p>Last year, $250bn worth of green bonds were issued, a significant increase from $171bn the year before, and $84bn in 2016.</p><p>And while developed markets still make up the bulk of bonds in terms of value and volume, the growth of emerging markets are gaining pace. Last year, emerging markets including UAE, India and Chile accounted for 21% of the total green bond issuances in 2019.</p><p>In some ways the developing world has more to lose, with climate change expected to put increased pressure on food production, health and economic growth. Across Africa, we've seen positive steps from policy makers work to develop the structures that will give them access to the global green bond market. For example, Nigeria and Kenya have both developed frameworks to ensure local green bonds meet international certification standards and align with national priorities around food security, waste management and energy.</p><p>The two countries were therefore ahead of the European Union which agreed only in December on the EU taxonomy to provide investors with clarity on which activities are considered environmentally and socially sustainable.</p><p>Last month, Kenya issued the first local-currency green bond on the London Stock Exchange. While the bond's value is only US$42 million, it represents a turning point for Kenya's bond market. This is one of the first corporate bonds to be issued after Kenya's bond market collapsed in 2016 following failure of two banks.</p><p>These are important developments and the role of the UK government, which funded the creation of the framework through FSD Africa, shouldn't go unnoticed. But more work needs to be done to ensure that the opportunities being offered by Africa's green bond markets, are not being missed.</p><p>For a start, we must encourage collaboration and investment in green financing and adaptation from Africa's private sector. African businesses are not immune to the challenges of climate change and they cannot rely on governments only to supply project and infrastructural finance.</p><p>Green bonds will be a vital tool for the private sector to raise capital and become investors in the continent's green finance markets. We also need to recognise the role of public-private partnerships and tax incentives to encourage the entry of private investors. Kenya leads the way again, by enhancing governance structures and regulation as well providing tax incentives to help encourage investments.</p><p>Next, the international community must continue training initiatives which ensure policy makers have the skills to drive the regulatory changes required. A good example of this is the work undertaken by the Climate Bonds Initiative and FSD Africa in Nigeria last year, where the two organizations delivered training to the Securities Exchange Commission and the National Pensions Commission. Elsewhere, in Kenya, training on the country's National Treasury has been carried out to improve the capabilities of policy makers and regulators. We need to ensure policy makers have the skills needed to foster the continued growth of local green bond markets.</p><p>Lastly, governments across the continent must play a key role in developing and rolling out green bond regulations as well as encouraging market development. Frameworks are a good start, but governments also need to attract investors through sovereign bonds.</p><p>Nigeria has already started. In 2017 it became the first African country and the fourth in the world after Poland, France and Fiji, to issue a sovereign green bond. Kenya is expected to follow this year.</p><p>We are entering an important decade for the continent. There are ten years remaining to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and global momentum around transitioning to a green economy is growing.

This is the result of the report on Germany's nature, presented on Tuesday (19 May) by Federal Environment Minister Svenja Schulze (SPD).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only a quarter of nature is in a healthy condition. Intact ecosystems are a \"life insurance for us humans and the cornerstone of a crisis-proof society,\" Schulze commented on the report. \"We all notice that droughts are following each other more and more closely, the landscapes are drying up. Nature conservation is a very important part of the solution.\"</p><p>The report of the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) is based on 14,000 samples collected by volunteers between 2013 and 2018. Every six years, the Federal Government and the L\u00e4nder carry out an assessment of environmental conditions in Germany and forward the results to the European Commission.</p><p>The latest figures show a mixed picture. Some 69% of the habitat types in the Bundesrepublik are in an insufficient or poor condition. While the environment in the Alps is largely intact, it is ailing in large parts of the country.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/eu-aims-to-ring-fence-old-growth-forests-in-new-biodiversity-plan/\">EU aims to ring-fence 'old-growth forests' in new biodiversity plan</url></h><p>At least 10% of land - considerably more than the current 3% - will have to be declared \"strictly protected areas\" under a new EU biodiversity strategy due to be unveiled later this month.</p><p>The situation in meadows, pastures, and farmland is particularly critical. There, biodiversity is declining significantly, especially for beetles, butterflies and dragonflies. Only one-fifth of the insect species are in a healthy condition overall, and 33% of all species studied are in a \"very poor\" condition.</p><p>The situation with wild birds paints a rather mixed picture. One-third of breeding bird species are now declining, while another third are increasing.</p><p>Individual species, however, are critically affected. According to the report, only one-tenth of the original population of partridges and lapwings still lives in Germany.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Schulze wants to pass an insect protection law this year</emphasis></p><p>At the presentation of the report, Environment Minister Schulze emphasised that she sees large-scale agriculture as the source of many problems: \"There is simply too much fertilisation, there is too much mowing.\"</p><p>The CAP negotiations in Brussels are therefore the \"greatest lever\" for an agricultural turnaround that would create more space for unused natural areas. According to Schulze, farmers, who leave parts of their land to nature, are demonstrating a public service that must be rewarded.</p><p>\"It's worth it if we invest not only in our grey infrastructure but also in green infrastructure,\" emphasised Beate Jessel, the president of the BfN. The agency had calculated that unused grassland, unlike arable land, can have a monetary value of (EURO)500 to (EURO)2,000 per hectare.</p><p>Schulze also emphasised the role of the action plan for insect protection, which the government adopted last September. The plan provides for an additional (EURO)100 million to be made available annually for the promotion of insect protection and research into this field.</p><p>In addition, pesticides will be severely restricted from 2020 onwards, and glyphosate will be banned completely by the end of 2023. The minister also announced an insect protection law that is to be passed this year.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/eu-plans-sweeping-bioenergy-review-by-end-2020/\">EU plans sweeping bioenergy review by end 2020</url></h><p>The European Commission intends to push a \"transformative approach\" to all forms of bioenergy - including biofuels and woody biomass - as part of a biodiversity strategy due to be unveiled on Wednesday (20 May).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commission wants to put 30% of the land area under protection</emphasis></p><p>The report presentation comes one day before the EU Commission presents its long-awaited biodiversity strategy for 2030, which should have been published in February.</p><p>\"I hope that this will be a bold strategy, and I will do everything I can to ensure that we make great progress on it under the German Presidency,\" promised Schulze. Five years ago, a mid-term review of the strategy, which has been in force since 2011, found only slight improvements in the protection of biodiversity.</p><p>According to leaked information on tomorrow's biodiversity strategy, the Commission now plans to introduce a mandatory quota of 30% protected land area and expand the Natura 2000 network of protected areas. Currently, around 19% of the EU's land area is considered protected.</p><p>In February, the Commission launched the second stage of an infringement procedure against Germany for failing to adequately designate and maintain Natura 2000 sites.</p><p>\"The deadline for the completion of these measures for all sites in Germany in some cases expired more than ten years ago,\" the authority reprimanded.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/new-eu-budget-proposal-reignites-fringe-against-cap-cuts/\">New EU budget proposal reignites battle against CAP cuts</url></h><p>As the European Commission prepares to put forward an updated multi-annual financial framework proposal (MFF) next week (29 April), the agri-food sector has unanimously called for keeping post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) spending at least at its current level in value and avoiding further cuts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-557859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXY-PV51-DYXB-V35B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 19, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Animals</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biodiversity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CAP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>insects</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>nature</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Svenja Schulze</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Falling technology costs and compounding efficiency savings mean the average European corporate expects to realise a profit of (EURO)17 for every tonne of emissions cuts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And with 2.4 gigatons of emission reductions expected over the life of European investments made last year - equivalent to the annual emissions of Germany, the UK, Italy, Poland and France combined - this amounts to a tidy profit of more than (EURO)40 billion.</p><p>But even greater opportunities lie in developing solutions to help customers cut their emissions. European companies anticipate (EURO)1.2 trillion of new revenue opportunities from low-carbon goods and services that would cost less than (EURO)200 billion to realise.</p><p>These are two of the findings of CDP's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cdp.net/europeanreport\">Doubling Down</url> report, written in partnership with global management consultancy Oliver Wyman, which examined the low-carbon investments of 882 European corporates. Those companies cover 76% of Europe's market capitalisation and are the source of over 3 gigatons of annual emissions - equivalent to about three quarters of the EU's total.</p><p>Overall, European companies reported (EURO)124 billion of new low-carbon investment to CDP in 2019. (EURO)59 billion was capital expenditure, with the rest spent on research and development in new technologies.</p><p>That's a lot of capital investment. Companies are installing new renewable technologies, building green infrastructure, purchasing zero-emission vehicles and increasing the efficiency of their manufacturing processes, buildings and distribution systems.</p><h/><p>The European Union continues to lag behind in terms of 'green' investment compared with China and the US, the EIB warned on Tuesday (26 November). The lender said that financing should increase by one-third to achieve a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Half of what's needed for net-zero carbon goal</emphasis></p><p>But (EURO)59 billion is half of what is needed: to get on track for net-zero emissions by 2050 - the EU's new target - we estimate low-carbon capital expenditure must double. This is a big ask. But it is modest in the context of overall capital spending: it requires low-carbon investment to grow from 12 to 25% of total capex.</p><p>Companies' investment data reveals industries at very different stages of transformation. In the power sector, transformation to low carbon models is well underway. Investments in renewables, infrastructure and grid-balancing technologies were responsible for more than three quarters of low-carbon capex reported last year.</p><p>This is a story of large-scale technology deployment.</p><p>In contrast, investment in the transport sector tells a story of technology development. Transport manufacturers were responsible for two thirds of low-carbon R&amp;D, primarily focusing their investments towards their electric and autonomous vehicle technologies.</p><p>The transformation of European road transport has barely begun, but companies' R&amp;D means the direction of travel is clear. The future is electric.</p><p>In the materials sector, transformation is further away. Between them, materials companies were the source of nearly 40% of emissions among the group of over 800 companies. Yet their spend made up only 5% of low-carbon investment reported to CDP.</p><p>The decarbonisation of these industries depends on the roll out of transformational technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen. But these technologies are expensive, capital intensive and will require significant cross-sector investments in new infrastructure to be scalable. Their prospects are also shrouded in uncertainty about future carbon prices, demand for zero-carbon materials and the prices they might command.</p><p>Although these technologies will likely prove critical to material companies' continued existence in a net-zero future, they currently look like very risky propositions and struggle to attract much investment.</p><p>In 2019, CCUS received about 0.2% of all new reported low-carbon investment across all sectors, and hydrogen just 0.1%.

Frank</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not too late to fight climate change with a long-overdue policy that would have surprisingly broad impact, an economist says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United States has been stalled in its approach to climate change, and with attention so heavily focused on the coronavirus pandemic, this may seem an inauspicious moment for action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the shock of the pandemic hasn't merely upended people's lives. It may also open doors to policy changes previously considered beyond reach. Economic analysis can help identify the most promising opportunities among them.</p><p>The economics of climate change is straightforward. Earth is warming both because greenhouse gases are costly to eliminate and because governments have permitted people to emit them into the atmosphere without penalty.</p><p>The classical remedy is a carbon tax, a fee on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Generally levied where fuels are extracted or imported, it discourages carbon emissions by making goods with larger carbon footprints more expensive. The World Bank reports that as of 2019, 57 local, regional and national governments have either enacted some form of carbon tax or plan to do so. When people must pay for their emissions, they quickly discover creative ways to reduce them.</p><p>Why, then, hasn't the United States adopted a carbon tax? One hurdle is the fear that emissions would fall too slowly in response to a carbon tax, that more direct measures are needed. Another difficulty is that political leaders have reason to fear voter opposition to taxation of any kind. But there are persuasive rejoinders to both objections.</p><p>Regarding the first, critics are correct that a carbon tax alone won't parry the climate threat. It is also true that as creatures of habit, humans tend to change their behavior only slowly, even in the face of significant financial incentives. But even small changes in behavior are greatly amplified by behavioral contagion - the social scientist's term for how ideas and behaviors spread from person to person like infectious diseases. And if a carbon tax were to shift the behavior of some individuals now, those changes would quickly spread more widely.</p><p>Smoking rates, for example, changed little in the short run even as cigarette taxes rose sharply, but that wasn't the end of the story. The most powerful predictor of whether someone will smoke is the percentage of her friends who smoke. Most smokers stick with their habit in the face of higher taxes, but a small minority quit, and still others refrain from starting.</p><p>Every peer group that includes those people thus contains a smaller proportion of smokers, which influences still others to quit or refrain, and so on. This contagion process explains why the percentage of American adults who smoke has fallen by two-thirds since the mid-1960s.</p><p>Behavioral contagion would similarly amplify the effects of a carbon tax. By making solar power cheaper in comparison with fossil fuels, for example, the tax would initially encourage a small number of families to install solar panels on their rooftops. But as with cigarette taxes, it's the indirect effects that really matter.</p><p>According to a 2012 study by the economists Bryan Bollinger and Kenneth Gillingham, a carbon tax that induced a family to install solar panels could be expected to stimulate a neighbor's copycat installation within four months, on average. Let another four months pass, and each of these two will have spawned additional installations of their own, for a total of four.</p><p>At the end of just two years' time, these figures suggest, the initial new installation will lead to 32 new installations. Contagion doesn't stop there, either, since each of these families will have shared news about their projects with friends and family in other locations.</p><p>Behavioral contagion also has been shown to influence dietary choices. People often eat meat because they grew up with, and continue to live among, people for whom substantial meat consumption is the norm. Because meat has a large carbon footprint, a carbon tax would make it more expensive relative to plant-based foods.</p><p>The direct effect of this price change would be small. But as some people shifted the composition of their diets, others would find it easier to shift as well. In short order, these positive-feedback effects would produce more widespread shifts in eating habits. Behavioral contagion would similarly amplify initial responses to a carbon tax in virtually every other energy-intensive activity.</p><p>Even with such gains in prospect, many legislators remain unenthusiastic because they perceive a carbon tax as being unpopular with voters. Many families have been struggling to make ends meet, they might say, and the last thing they need is a stiff new tax on energy use. But this problem has a simple solution, which is to adopt what economists call a revenue-neutral design. Under one version, all revenue from the tax would be returned to consumers in the form of monthly rebate checks.</p><p>Because the wealthy consume much more energy than others, they would contribute a disproportionate share of the revenue from a carbon tax. The top 10 percent of all income recipients account for almost half of carbon emissions worldwide, an Oxfam International study has found.</p><p>Use patterns are less skewed in the United States, but here, too, the wealthy live in bigger houses, drive bigger cars and, at least when the pandemic isn't raging, take many more trips to distant destinations. Even with equal rebates per capita, most people would get a monthly check for more than they'd paid that month in carbon taxes. Rebates could, of course, be distributed in a more progressive fashion.</p><p>Although low- and middle-income families would be net cash beneficiaries under this plan, the wealthy would pay more in tax each month than they would receive in rebates. Even so, prosperous voters would also come out ahead, on balance.</p><p>That's both because they would benefit disproportionately from the resulting reductions in climate losses and because they would otherwise have to shoulder much of the tax burden of climate adaptation measures. In short, compelling evidence suggests that a carbon tax would improve life outcomes for rich and poor alike.</p><p>Had carbon taxes been widely adopted decades ago, the planet would not be facing a climate crisis today. Critics are correct that it is too late for this measure alone to defuse the climate threat. Having waited, it will now be necessary to spend trillions of additional dollars on green infrastructure and other mitigation measures.</p><p>But adopting a carbon tax even at this late date would greatly reduce both the cost of achieving climate stability and the time needed to achieve that goal.</p><p>Robert H.

Thankfully, \"Lady Liberty leapt out of the way barely in time, and she's now sitting on the curb, her heart pounding, just glad to be alive.\" But she knows just how narrowly she escaped.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I hoped that once Joe Biden took charge my anxiety over how close we came to losing our democracy would soon fade. It hasn't.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just listen to Donald Trump or Senator Ron Johnson or Fox News whitewashing the ransacking of the Capitol as a Republican white boys' picnic that just got a little rowdy. Just listen to Trump's former lawyer Sidney Powell trying to escape a lawsuit by arguing that no serious person would have believed her claims that Dominion Voting Systems machines had helped to perpetrate a stolen election. Just watch Georgia's legislature pass a measure supposedly designed to prevent the very fraud that Powell now says never happened by creating obstacles for Black voters - even making it a crime for anyone to serve water to someone waiting hours in a voting line.       </p><p>Yes, that crazy bus driver is still out there and Lady Liberty is still in danger of being run over.       </p><p>Instead of the G.O.P. sitting down after the election and resolving, \"Let's complete a bridge to the votes of a diverse 21st-century America - where a G.O.P. message of immigration reform, plus pro-business, pro-law-and-order, pro-smaller-government ideas could win\" - it's decided to burn down any pieces of that bridge and compete only for a white-dominated 20th-century America.       </p><p>As Michael Gerson, the former George W. Bush speechwriter and now columnist for The Washington Post, put it the other day: \"One of the United States' venerable, powerful political parties has been overtaken by people who make resentment against outsiders the central element of their appeal. ... Elected Republicans who are not bigots are generally cowards in the face of bigotry. And that is a shocking, horrible thing.\"       </p><p>This Trump G.O.P. must never be allowed to occupy the White House again. It cannot be trusted to cede power. It barely did so in January, and it shows no signs of regretting its behavior. Which is why, if we want to preserve our democracy, we still have the fight of our lives on our hands.       </p><p>The key to winning that fight is for Joe Biden to succeed well enough and long enough for this antidemocratic Trump version of the G.O.P. to flame out and be replaced by a new, principled, center-right Republican Party, ready to compete for 21st -century America. (We need a healthy conservative party to keep some of the excesses of liberal Democrats in check, like cancel culture.)       </p><p>And the key to that is for Biden to deliver real stuff that enables all Americans to realize their full potential. And the key to that is to make sure that the $1.9 trillion stimulus and his coming $3 trillion green/infrastructure proposal actually deliver as promised. And the key to that is for Biden to not only channel his inner F.D.R. but also a little Ronald Reagan and some rip-roaring capitalism.       </p><p>Democrats are all agog that Biden was able to pass more stimulus dollars than Barack Obama. What will make a sustainable difference, though, is whether the Biden stimulus doesn't just rescue the poor but also propels the private sector to start new companies and create more good jobs that improve productivity and sustainably boost living standards, so that we're not just redividing the pie, but rather growing the pie.       </p><p>Despite concerns that the $1.9 trillion could drive up interest rates to levels that tank the stock market and crimp government borrowing and discretionary spending down the road, there are lots of signs that we could be headed for just such an explosion in entrepreneurship.       </p><p>Consider this report from The Wall Street Journal on Friday: \"After a year of economic shutdowns and other changes brought on by Covid-19, rents for Manhattan storefronts, apartments and work spaces have been marked down to their lowest prices in years. That is already bringing in new small businesses and residents, and has the potential to change the character of the city's most-exclusive borough. ... New York state as a whole saw its highest number of new businesses launched last year since 2007.\"       </p><p>If we do this right, Biden's stimulus will fuel an already restructuring economy and supercharge it. With so much cheap money available, so much cheap access to high-powered computing, so many new services being digitized and so many new problems to solve, we have all the ingredients for a burst of innovation, start-ups and creative destruction.       </p><p>What would Trump do if he presided over such a boom? HE'D PUT HIS NAME ON IT. That's what Biden should do. If it comes, call it the \"Biden Boom\" - and celebrate entrepreneurs, capitalists, job creators, farmers and all those who work with their hands. Make clear that they all have a home in the Democratic Party, not just left-wing educated elites. That's how you win the midterms.       </p><p>Biden also needs to maximize his green aspirations. It's not just about unleashing spending. It also about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">unleashing capitalism.</emphasis> The key to a green revolution is scale. You need a whole lot of everything - wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, batteries, efficient materials. And the only way to get that kind of scale is by leveraging the market - by getting all kinds of public-private partnerships going that reduce carbon and grow profits.       </p><p>The government can catalyze these in two ways. The first is to use its buying power to drive down costs. For instance, \"offshore wind used to be much more expensive than onshore wind,\" explained Hal Harvey, C.E.O. of Energy Innovation, \"but then the British and Danish governments stepped in to subsidize it and move it down the cost-volume curve. Now it is a huge and cost-effective resource.\"       </p><p>The Biden team just announced $3 billion in loan guarantees to do exactly the same here. Kudos!       </p><p>Then, once these green technologies are affordable, said Harvey, \"you stimulate the private sector to make them steadily cheaper and more efficient by having the government set improved performance standards every year\" - like California recently did, requiring the end of internal combustion engines in cars by 2035, and the way Obama did in 2012, when he required U.S. automakers to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025.       </p><p>That is how you get scale, Harvey added: \"You enable the private sector to deliver public goods\" - for a profit. The government makes new technologies more cost effective, and the private sector, spurred by ever-stronger standards, \"makes them ubiquitous.\"       </p><p>That's just smart capitalism. And it's the surest way to ensure the success of Biden's two gigantic spending bills and deal a knockout blow to this pathetic dumpster fire called the Trump G.O.P. That would be a gift to both liberals and principled conservatives - and to Lady Liberty.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

Net earnings amounted to ISK 4,913 million for the quarter and ISK 2,742 million for the first six months. Return on equity was 10.5% for the quarter and 2.9% for the first six months of the year.</p><p>Total assets amounted to ISK 1,182 billion at the end of June 2020, compared with ISK 1,082 billion at the end of 2019. Liquid assets increased as the proposed ISK 10 billion dividend payment did not materialize, the Bank issued AT1 in February and deposits increased. Loans to customers increased slightly from year-end 2019, mainly due to mortgage lending. Deposits increased by 12.8% from year-end 2019. Total equity amounted to ISK 189 billion at the end of June, compared with ISK 190 billion at the end of 2019.</p><p>The Bank's capital ratio at the end of June 2020 was 28.1%, compared with 24.0% at the end of 2019. The CET 1 ratio was 22.9% at the end of June 2020, compared with 21.2% at the end of 2019. The Group's own funds increased by ISK 28.1 billion from year-end 2019, primarily due to the successful issuance of a USD 100 million Additional Tier 1 capital instrument in February 2020, and as a result of the Board of Directors' decision to propose that no dividends are paid in connection with operations in 2019 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The Bank is committed to its medium term targets, assuming the economy recovers in the medium term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Benedikt G\u00edslason, CEO of Arion Bank</emphasis></p><p>\"Arion Bank's financial results for the second quarter are most satisfactory and we have achieved our target of 10% return on equity. This is particularly pleasing given that the Bank's capital ratio is exceptionally strong and far in excess of the requirements made by the regulators. Regular operations developed positively in the quarter, and unusually high financial income, both from equities and fixed income holdings, had a very positive impact on the results. Improving regular operations therefore remains a key priority. The subsidiaries V\u00f6r\u00f0ur and Stefnir are performing well and Valitor, which is for sale, has reduced its losses after undergoing restructuring at the beginning of the year. The aim is to strengthen Valitor's core business, and the company's operations in Denmark were sold during the quarter.\u00a0 Although there is still some way to go before the goals of restructuring are fully realized, excellent results have already been attained.</p><p>Despite the positive second quarter results, the Covid-19 pandemic is still causing considerable uncertainty in the Bank's operating environment. The impact of the pandemic on the domestic and international economy will continue to leave its mark on operations. The key area of uncertainty is the performance of the Bank's asset portfolio. Loan impairments decreased significantly during the second quarter compared with the first quarter, although it must be remembered that further impairments may be required in the present economic climate. However, the Bank's robust capital and liquidity positions mean that it is well placed to cope with the current conditions.</p><p>There was strong demand for mortgages during the quarter, both new loans and the refinancing of existing loans. Lower interest rates undoubtedly played their part in this, and the Bank lent ISK 17 billion in the form of new mortgages during the second quarter. Furthermore, business support loans which formed part of the raft of government measures and which are partly or entirely government-backed, are proving popular and straightforward to process to our customers.</p><p>Arion Bank recently launched green deposits which are aimed at anyone wishing to help contribute towards a greener future. Initially green deposits will be used to finance investments by customers in vehicles which are powered by green energy. Green vehicles are an appropriate place to start as nearly all electricity in Iceland comes from sustainable sources. Offering our customers the option of green deposits is an innovative step in Iceland and in keeping with the Bank's environment and climate policy according to which we aim to focus more strongly on financing projects which relate to sustainable development and green infrastructure.</p><p>In May we merged our corporate services in the Reykjav\u00edk area into a single unit located at the Bank's headquarters. It brings together a dedicated team of highly experienced specialists from our branches in the Reykjavik area whose focus is on SMEs. The goal of creating the Corporate Business Hub is to enhance our services to companies in the Reykjav\u00edk area and to make our specialist services and expert advice more easily available to our customers. It is also part of the continuing trend at the Bank to adapt our services to the new and evolving needs of our customers, with a greater emphasis on digital solutions and personal financial advice.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investor meeting in English on 30 July at 10:30 CET (8:30 GMT)</emphasis></p><p>Arion Bank will be hosting a meeting / webcast on Thursday 30 July at 10:30 CET (8:30 GMT) where CEO Benedikt G\u00edslason, CFO Stef\u00e1n P\u00e9tursson, Deputy CFO Eggert Teitsson and Head of Investor Relations Theod\u00f3r Fridbertsson will present the results and answer questions from participants.

That was where floodwaters reached during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His home, a humble two-story wooden structure, is decorated with nautical maps, horseshoe crabs and assorted maritime paraphernalia. It sits right on Jamaica Bay, with a small dock at the water's edge, where he moors his 22-foot boat. He has a spectacular view of the east end of the bay with the spires of Manhattan in the distance.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Riepe, a former manager of the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, considers himself blessed to be surrounded by nature and still have all the perks of a big city a subway ride away. But he knows his neighbors' time there may be coming to an end. During his four decades living in the area, Hurricane Sandy was the worst Mr. Riepe has seen; the flooring and all the electrical appliances on the first floor of his house were destroyed. Since then, during lesser storms and even high tides, he moves his computer and furniture upstairs, where he sleeps - and he hopes for the best.       </p><p>Mr. Riepe is just one of tens of thousands of residents who live on the wild fringes of Queens, in communities like Hamilton Beach, Edgemere and Howard Beach, where the ocean threatens to encroach as sea level rises and coastal storms intensify owing to climate change. It is also the focal point of a major environmental restoration project that aims to protect the area - and in fact the whole city - by returning salt marshes and sand dunes to their natural states. How this will affect the community of Broad Channel (the only inhabited island in Jamaica Bay) remains to be seen.       </p><p>Already, Mr. Riepe's neighbors are scrambling to adjust to their new climate-changed reality - moving their cars to higher ground on high-tide days, and in some cases converting their ground floors into garages and shifting their living quarters upstairs and out of harm's way. One thing that they are not yet prepared to do, however, is move out.       </p><p>\"People in Broad Channel were born there,\" Mr. Riepe said. \"They raised their kids there. I mean, it's a great place to live in New York City. You can fish, you can have a boat.\"       </p><p>The mostly working-class neighborhood (population roughly 3,000) where Mr. Riepe lives is a throwback to an earlier era of detached homes, bungalows and preternaturally quiet streets. \"These folks are not going anywhere,\" he said.       </p><p>But that's not completely true. Mr. Riepe, who nowadays is best known for the bird walks and shoreline cleanups that he leads, fully expects that in 25 or 30 years, sea level rise will make his home and many others like it unlivable. He is 82, and he doesn't expect to be around then. But for the sake of those who will be, he and his neighbors are banking on a plan to restore the wetlands and to build up the islands in the bay, which they hope will soften the blow of future storms. It will also return some of the natural beauty for which the bay was once known.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jamaica Bay is an estuary</emphasis> nearly the size of Manhattan that carves into the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, and it is far and away the largest natural space within New York City. For Native American tribes like the Lenape, the bay was a \"hugely important hunting and fishing grounds,\" according to Eric W. Sanderson, who is best known for the Mannahatta Project, which reconstructed Manhattan's ecological past. He is now conducting a similar survey of the other boroughs.       </p><p>Mr. Sanderson and a group of city officials recently paid an inspection visit to a restored marsh on the Rockaway Peninsula, an area that used to be filled with rubble, concrete blocks and construction debris. Almost as if on cue, a great blue heron glided past the group noiselessly, creating barely a ripple in the mirror-like waters. A small fenced-in plot on the shore bristled with the stalks of newly seeded marsh grasses planted by the New York City Parks Department.       </p><p>Mr. Sanderson, who is a senior conservation ecologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, gestured toward a tidal channel, above which loomed a four-story apartment complex with a \"now leasing\" sign.       </p><p>\"If we were here with the Lenape a few hundred years ago, they would be there in the channel in their dugout canoes,\" he said. \"But they would never have built their wigwam right there on the edge of the beach, because it's dangerous. It floods, it's exposed to the winds.\"       </p><p>The restoration area and the channel that abuts it sit incongruously between a busy avenue and a neighborhood of mostly new low-rise apartment buildings and multistory homes, many of which flooded during Sandy. The odd architectural mix and wild natural features make Rockaway unique. They also present unique challenges to city planners.       </p><p>The city today has lost most of its protective sand dunes and close to 80 percent of the coastal marshlands that it had historically. Without these natural barriers, residents in the Jamaica Bay area are far more vulnerable to rising waters.       </p><p>In a multimillion-dollar effort to remedy the situation, state and city agencies and the National Park Service are partnering with nonprofit groups to build \"living shorelines\" - restored coastal edges that are stabilized with sand, rocks and bags of oyster shells, as well as deep-rooted native plants. Roughly 10,000 acres of parkland ring Jamaica Bay and the Rockaway Peninsula.       </p><p>Marit Larson, who is leading the restoration work for the city, said that the purpose of the dozens of projects that are underway on public land throughout Jamaica Bay is threefold: helping nature to recover, providing a buffer for residents against coastal storms and also offering New Yorkers natural sanctuaries where they can go to renew themselves.       </p><p>Residents are mostly enthusiastic about the efforts to strengthen shorelines and create ecological buffer zones.       </p><p>But nobody suggests that Jamaica Bay can be restored to its condition before urbanization.       </p><p>In the 19th century, the city's fishermen flocked there by horse and buggy. \"Their boats were so thick on a Sunday, you could practically walk from one to the other without getting wet,\" according to John R. Waldman, a biology professor at Queens College who wrote a book with Mr. Sanderson about Jamaica Bay.       </p><p>Nowadays the fishers are fewer, but the fish are making a surprising comeback, said Mr. Waldman, who recalls spending many happy hours chasing striped bass in the autumn as the ravenous fish jumped all over the deeper channels. The bass, along with Southern species like skilletfish, are prevalent in the bay as some cold-water fish (like tomcod and winter flounder) become scarcer as waters heat up.       </p><p>Seals are even returning to the islands, and whales not infrequently venture into the deeper channels. Diamondback terrapins, hunted almost to extinction during the colonial era for turtle soup, currently number around 10,000. New oyster reefs are being seeded.       </p><p>\"The future is looking good,\" Mr. Waldman said. \"Jamaica Bay is relatively unpolluted and still functioning fairly well in an ecological sense.\" This, he says, is owed largely to the aggressive protection efforts undertaken by public and private agencies.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">While the natural environment</emphasis> continues its surprising comeback in Jamaica Bay, time may be running out for the people who live there.       </p><p>After Hurricane Sandy, a debate ensued about how to prevent the next catastrophe. On the one hand were the technological solutions like the one proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers: a massive sea wall from Sandy Hook, N.J., to the Rockaway Peninsula. In addition to its huge expense, critics of the project said that it would protect only against storm surges but not sea level rise itself, which poses the more enduring threat. Others maintained that a greener approach - restoring natural features like sand dunes, oyster reefs and coastal wetlands - offered the strongest defense.       </p><p>In the end, the more moderate measures prevailed. Shorelines are being \"hardened\" in some locations with concrete walls and rock jetties; in other places natural coastal ecosystems are being rebuilt. The proposal for a giant sea wall has been withdrawn for now but will surely be reconsidered if another Sandy-size storm hits the metropolitan area.       </p><p>Given the projections that the sea level may rise six feet or more along U.S. coastlines before the end of the century, most experts say the government will eventually have to buy out homeowners in the lowest-lying areas and help move them to higher ground. Ultimately, many of the people who live around Jamaica Bay are going to have to leave.       </p><p>\"A conversation needs to happen at the neighborhood level, and the city should take the lead,\" said Robert Freudenberg, a vice president of Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group that works in partnership with local governments in the New York metropolitan region to promote sustainable development. \"We have to start preparing residents for maybe being the final generation in those places. But that is the conversation that nobody wants to have.\"       </p><p>Donovan Finn, a professor of environmental design at Stony Brook University and a member of the Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay, agrees that there are only tough choices ahead.       </p><p>\"The question is which is the less difficult option,\" he said. \"This huge engineering sea wall project that's going to cost tens of billions of dollars and will have big ecological and other impacts, or uprooting 50,000 or 100,000 families from their homes,\" Mr. Finn said. \"I think it's an open question. Neither one is easy. None of this is easy.\"       </p><p>Mr. Finn added that a sea wall, even if built, would offer only a temporary fix since sea levels would eventually rise to supersede it. Ultimately in coastal areas throughout the city, he says, we'll need to combine \"green infrastructure\" like living shorelines with \"gray infrastructure\" like the system of smaller sea walls and levies used in the Netherlands, much of which lies below sea level.       </p><p>But the city needs to act quickly, Mr. Finn said. A number of neighborhoods in Jamaica Bay are already experiencing \"sunny day flooding,\" which happens during the highest tides every month.       </p><p>By far the most ambitious - and widely admired - project aimed at minimizing flooding risks is being conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers. This is not the gargantuan sea wall originally proposed but a humbler effort, which is enlarging several barrier islands in Jamaica Bay, and even creating some new ones.       </p><p>\"We have already restored more than 160 acres,\" Lisa Baron, a project manager with the corps, said. \"We plan on restoring another 206 acres on five islands.\" Some of the most enthusiastic proponents of the new islands are the people of Broad Channel, who can see them rising out of the bay.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broad Channel looks</emphasis> more like a New England fishing village than a big-city neighborhood, and it remains somewhat insular, with many families who have lived there now for several generations. Residents tend to be politically conservative but environmentally active. They are currently leading the charge to save their beloved bay.       </p><p>One of the main proponents is Daniel Mundy, a 58-year-old battalion chief in the New York Fire Department.       </p><p>Mr. Mundy grew up in Broad Channel and has a long history of organizing residents to help protect the bay. His love affair with the water started early. While other city kids headed off to ball fields after school, a young Dan Mundy would paddle his kayak through the labyrinth of creeks and channels in Jamaica Bay. \"You had the place to yourself,\" he recalled. \"It did not seem like you were in the city at all.\"       </p><p>During the 1990s, however, Mr. Mundy noticed a change. \"The salt marshes were just melting away, becoming lifeless mud flats,\" he said. \"We also saw that the water had become rust-colored. We were seeing fish die off, small bait fish piling up dead on the shore.\"       </p><p>At that time, Mr. Mundy showed up with a handful of neighbors at meetings held by agencies charged with protecting the environment. \"We were told: 'It's just not happening. Listen, you guys mean well. But you're not scientists - you're a fireman, you're an electrician,'\" Mr. Mundy said.       </p><p>Then the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation decided to conduct its own analysis. It found that the bay was indeed losing upward of 50 acres of wetlands a year to erosion. And high nitrogen levels caused by effluent from four sewage treatment plants were killing off fish and other creatures.       </p><p>It was the confirmation residents needed. Mr. Mundy organized the Jamaica Bay Ecowatchers, which joined forces with the Natural Resources Defense Council and went to court to stop the pollution that was destroying the salt marshes. In 2010, they worked out a negotiated settlement with the Bloomberg administration.       </p><p>\"We won a hundred-million-dollar agreement that forced them to upgrade all the treatment plants,\" Mr. Mundy said. \"It's had an amazing impact; the water is now the clearest we've ever seen. We also received $15 million to create new wetland islands.\"       </p><p>He added: \"Those waves that formed during Sandy were huge. If you place new wetland islands out there, that storm energy gets dissipated. It's still going to come into my house, but the wave energy will be blunted. My house won't get knocked down or washed away.\"       </p><p>Recently, the Ecowatchers were instrumental in blocking a proposed new runway at Kennedy International Airport, which the group said would have destroyed hundreds of acres of bay and salt marsh.       </p><p>Local champions like Mr. Mundy and Mr. Riepe have succeeded in making Jamaica Bay something of an ideal for ecological recovery in a major urban area. But the question remains: How much longer can the residents of Broad Channel stay there?       </p><p>On a recent bird-watching tour that he led in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, Mr. Riepe pointed toward an osprey nest on top of a wooden pole that he and his volunteers had just set up. \"I've been involved with efforts to bring back raptors for the past 30 years,\" he said. \"We're restoring habitats. But sea level rise is opposing our restoration efforts.       </p><p>\"I don't think the marshes that we have will be all that protective if we have a major storm,\" Mr. Riepe continued. \"So that's our goal for the future: to greatly increase the scope of the restoration effort to rebuild the marshes and put in new islands.\"       </p><p>But he is frustrated by the slow pace of the work. \"Congress has to allot funds to the Army Corps of Engineers,\" he said. \"They have to get a contractor, they have to find clean fill. In the meantime, nature is relentless. Nature doesn't take a holiday. Nature doesn't have a Congress to deal with.\"       </p><p>He paused for a moment to reflect. \"It's a beautiful place to live,\" Mr. Riepe observed somewhat wistfully. \"But nothing is forever.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008276811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6552-52P1-JC85-N2HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2550\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 5, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Wetlands Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY2NjI1NjQ3Qzk2NDE5NzlGQjFDNTkzQjg5QTAyMkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D9UP</classCode><className>HURRICANE SANDY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F7U</classCode><className>HURRICANES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

To succeed, it must end the old alliance of big business and organised crime; that is already the aim of the country\u2019s second city, Medell\u00edn.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport\u00a0in Rionegro, there are two routes into Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019s second largest city (2.5 million inhabitants). First, though, you pass through the highlands of the Oriente Cercano (near east), with some of the country\u2019s most expensive real estate, much of it owned by former president \u00c1lvaro Uribe (currently on trial for bribery and witness tampering). Upscale restaurants, bars and shopping centres, along with luxury SUVs and sports cars, dot the roadside. The greenery is abundant, the air is clear and smells of pine, and it rarely gets above 24\u00baC.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is easy to see why Medell\u00edn\u2019s elite and middle class prefer the suburbs to the city centre. Whether you take the first route, through the exclusive neighbourhoods of Envigado and El Poblado, then down 600m to the valley floor, or the second, crowded with dump trucks, semi-trailers, cars and motorcycles, through the lower-middle-class town of G\u00faarne and the tough northeastern slums, your eyes, nose and throat will suffer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Pablo Escobar's war on the Colombian government, in his last years, turned Medell\u00edn into the homicide capital of the world. These days, the city's bloody history of gangsterism, nicely sanitised, is part of its allure     </p><p>Depending on the time of year, air pollution blocks the view of the valley or the surrounding mountains. The noise of road traffic and construction is crushing; poverty is everywhere, even in quiet residential neighbourhoods with private security guards. Novelist H\u00e9ctor Abad Faciolince sees the valley as one of Dante\u2019s circles of hell \u2014 one to which the poor are confined \u2014 yet the city\u2019s brand has gained international currency\u00a0(1).</p><p>Known as \u2018the city of eternal spring\u2019, Medell\u00edn is in the words of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> \u2018one of Latin America\u2019s most progressive cities\u2019 thanks to \u2018infrastructure projects that are bringing exciting libraries and parks to impoverished neighbourhoods, and creative methods of transportation\u2019\u00a0(2). <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Courrier International</emphasis> describes its transformation \u2018from the world\u2019s most violent city to its most innovative\u2019 (8\u00a0January 2015).</p><p>This tourist paradise recently saw popular protests unprecedented in contemporary Colombian history in their scope, duration and militancy. They began in September 2018 among public university students (especially at the University of Antioquia, the department\u2019s largest). Provoked by riot police repression, they went on strike nationwide and paralysed the city with mass demonstrations more than a dozen times over several months, demanding respect for their constitutional right to peaceful protest as well as adequate funding for public education. Despite government and media efforts to portray them as vandals and terrorists, the students won significant support in the hillside neighbourhoods from which many of them came, as well as city-centre offices, warehouses and workshops.</p><p>The student movement won its key demands, especially for greater government funding of higher education, which had greatly expanded under neoliberal reforms, swelling the student population, many of whom were burdened with debt. As expected, the government failed to keep its promises and the students launched another strike, which in late 2019 became a nationwide general strike, backed by Colombia\u2019s (small) trade unions, social movements and (tiny) opposition parties\u00a0(3).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From student movement to protests</emphasis></p><p>Unlike in 2018, which was largely a student affair, the following year\u2019s action had broad support across society. Non-student youth from poor suburbs, working-class adults from all sectors, victims\u2019 rights groups, indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities, feminist, trans/queer and peace activists, and environmentalists all marched. When the Christmas holidays arrived, the government was on the ropes despite \u2014 or because of \u2014 its disproportionate repression of the protesters, and the strike was set to resume in March 2020.</p><p>Then came Covid-19. Government mismanagement and corruption during the pandemic worsened Colombia\u2019s economic and social problems, and in May 2021 popular anger exploded in an uprising led by the poor and precarious suburban young (sometimes with their whole families). The mobilisation in poor hillside neighbourhoods was unprecedented. Except for a handful of opposition figures, politicians lost all authority and legitimacy. This exercise in popular sovereignty lasted two months. After close to 50 protesters were killed and over 3,000 wounded, state repression from Bogot\u00e1 eventually won out.</p><p>Although the popular resistance was fearless and tenacious, and not only among young people, it\u2019s too early to say if it will translate into formal political representation or greater grassroots participation in Medell\u00edn\u2019s city planning and public policy. In the 2018 presidential election\u00a0(4), leftist candidate Gustavo Petro won 22% of the vote in Medell\u00edn, and in 2022 he looks poised to increase that share (though \u00c1lvaro Uribe\u2019s candidate, former mayor Federico Gutierrez (2016-19), took three times more votes than Petro in the Medell\u00edn primary on 13\u00a0March).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Change must start in Medell\u00edn</emphasis></p><p>Should Petro be elected, as seems likely, the question will be whether the new government, in alliance with its grassroots supporters in Medell\u00edn, can stand up to the city\u2019s economic elite, not to mention local and regional organised crime. As Petro has said, if Colombia\u2019s transformation is to be more than a campaign slogan, it will have to start in Medell\u00edn.</p><p>So what makes Medell\u00edn and its metropolitan area (population 4.07 million) special? The city\u2019s economy is marked by extreme levels of capital concentration. The Antioquia Business Group (GEA) is one of Colombia\u2019s, indeed Latin America\u2019s, most powerful conglomerates. Before taking its current form in the late 1990s, Medell\u00edn\u2019s industrial heyday, it shaped the city\u2019s politics, public authorities, legal regimes, property rights and economic policies. In the recent past, GEA has expanded its activities across Central America, the Caribbean, South America and the US. Between 1980 and 2004, the number of companies owned by the group more than tripled and gross profits increased more than eightfold. This trend was reflected in a 7.1% contribution to Colombia\u2019s GDP last year. GEA includes several conglomerates, linked by cross-shareholding.</p><p>GEA\u2019s flagship, Bancolombia, is not only Colombia\u2019s largest financial and banking group, with a quarter of the country\u2019s banking assets. Since 2013 it has also established itself as the leading banking and financial services provider in Central America and the Caribbean. The same goes for the Suramericana Group (SURA), Colombia\u2019s largest insurance company, which over the past decade has expanded its operations throughout the western hemisphere, including the US.</p><p>GEA\u2019s main sub-holding company, the Argos Group, now has a presence in 20 countries. Originally a cement producer, it has extended its investment portfolio to energy, mining, real estate, infrastructure and motorway concessions. Last, the Nutresa Group is a national leader in processed foods, with 30 production plants in Colombia and 16 across the subcontinent and the US. All four conglomerates act as sub-holding companies of GEA, which brings them together under a giant holding company.</p><p>The concentration of ownership, capital and wealth are closely related to Medell\u00edn\u2019s high levels of socioeconomic inequality, precarity and poverty, which are ubiquitous in the hillside <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">comunas</emphasis> surrounding the city. For over three decades, the Colombian government has been trying to reduce poverty on paper by changing how it is measured. Protein intake has been replaced by calories; household expenditure has been revised downwards, and new calculation methods have been adopted to artificially increase income. In 2020 the government calculated Medell\u00edn\u2019s poverty rate at 19.2%, only slightly above the national average, while the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) put it at 32.9%. A third of the population have reduced their daily calorie intake and eat only one or two meals per day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rich pay minimal taxes</emphasis></p><p>Colombia\u2019s regressive tax structure, and its historic inability to tax the rich, account for much of the inequality. Small companies pay tax at a far higher rate than larger ones. In 2019 revenue from individual income tax was a sixth of the OECD average; at 19.7% of GDP, overall tax revenue was among the lowest in Latin America (the OECD average was 33.8%).</p><p>Colombia\u2019s concentration and centralisation of capital has produced one of the world\u2019s largest internally displaced populations. In 2021 nearly 74,000 people were forcibly displaced \u2014 more than double the number in 2020\u00a0(5). The victims are chiefly peasant smallholders who resettle precariously on the margins of cities. Despite the 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrillas\u00a0(6), clashes (as well as alliances) among neo-paramilitaries, neo-guerrilla factions, organised crime and the military continue unabated in the countryside. All involved have financial and logistical links to Medell\u00edn.</p><p>As the capital of Antioquia, Colombia\u2019s most populous department (population 6.4 million), Medell\u00edn receives displaced people primarily from the Bajo Cauca region in the north of the department, and the Urab\u00e1 region in the northwest; both are home to the Zen\u00fa indigenous people, Afro-Colombians and peoples of mixed descent. Like Bajo Cauca and Urab\u00e1, the city lies on a major cocaine trafficking route to the Caribbean Sea and on to Central America, Mexico and the US.</p><p>Narcotrafficking is only one factor behind Medell\u00edn\u2019s intra-urban displacement. In 2021 the number of people forcibly displaced within the city is conservatively estimated to have more than doubled compared to 2020. The main perpetrators are criminal gangs, who have tightened their territorial control. In Bajo Cauca and Urab\u00e1, they work hand in hand with rightwing paramilitary groups and/or dissident FARC guerrilla fighters. Turf wars, death threats, extortion, torture, killings and the recruitment of minors into gangs have forced many families to flee their homes a second time. This double displacement is common in Medell\u00edn and hard to quantify: victims generally remain silent and anonymous.</p><p>Besides gangs, drugs and organised crime, \u2018green\u2019 infrastructure projects in areas settled by the displaced have led to evictions, relocations and demolitions. The Cintur\u00f3n Verde is a metropolitan green belt that runs across the eastern mountain range, and the Jard\u00edn Circunvalar is a 75km-long park on the slopes surrounding the city centre. Both are part of the municipality\u2019s effort, backed by GEA, to change Medell\u00edn\u2019s image from a violent city of crime to a safe, modern and liveable urban hub. Launched in 2012, the green belt project aims to reduce the risk of landslides caused by extreme weather, ever more frequent with climate change. It also seeks to curb population growth and urban sprawl in the hillside suburbs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2018Green dispossession\u2019</emphasis></p><p>Some 180,000 households live on hillsides at risk; many lack formal land titles. Long-time residents suspect the municipality is deliberately overestimating the number of at-risk areas to justify demolishing settlements and clearing the way for upper middle-class housing complexes. The creation of ecological enclaves and artificially beautified landscapes for high-end living is meant to attract investors and wealthier residents to areas where they would once have feared to go. The driving force behind the project is the city\u2019s urban planning department, construction companies like Argos and estate agents such as SURA. Colombia\u2019s construction sector projects 18% growth this year \u2014 three to four times higher than the economy as a whole.</p><p>   How do we explain industrial-scale poverty, environmental degradation and despair, on the one hand, and high-tech, cutting-edge capitalism, \u2018modern' government and local, organised crime dominance on the other\u00a0?     </p><p>The city government has also pushed for an urban farming programme, which would incidentally destroy the small gardens of residents displaced or relocated to those areas. The idea is to grow vegetables in a formalised, regulated setting and sell them at organic farmer\u2019s markets in high-income neighbourhoods, such as El Poblado or Laureles. Community-based agriculture would be pushed aside, and land and labour integrated into the local capitalist economy. Accumulation through \u2018green dispossession\u2019 reproduces existing spatial fractures, exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities.</p><p>Medell\u00edn\u2019s gentrification started with the inauguration of Sergio Fajardo as mayor in 2004. As a close ally of GEA and foreign capital, Fajardo pursued a neoliberal development strategy, promoting competitiveness and entrepreneurial innovation. Economic growth was to be increasingly based on the city\u2019s global comparative advantages in services, finance, tourism, medicine and construction. City rebranding to create an investment-friendly business climate continued under Fajardo\u2019s successors. Through promotion of the IT sector, in which it claims to be a leader, and generous tax incentives to transnational corporations, Medell\u00edn now presents itself as Latin America\u2019s Silicon Valley.</p><p>Medell\u00edn\u2019s green rebranding and efforts to attract investors are closely related to the rapid expansion of tourism. In 2008 the city announced the creation of a special business tourism, conventions and trade fair cluster. The objective was to strengthen the links between tourist companies and business events. Over the next decade, the number of domestic and foreign visitors nearly quadrupled, while the contribution of tourism to economic growth doubled.</p><p>Yet trade fairs and business conventions are not the only factors behind this development. Medell\u00edn has become one of Latin America\u2019s main hubs for sex tourism and medical tourism (plastic surgery). Another asset is the global fascination with Pablo Escobar. Thanks to the popular Netflix series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Narcos</emphasis> (2015-17) and a wide range of soap operas and documentaries, the life of Medell\u00edn\u2019s drug kingpin has become a global commodity. \u2018Narco-tours\u2019 allow tourists to take selfies outside his houses and hideouts. The glamorisation of narco-culture has helped to trivialise a dark chapter in Colombia\u2019s history.</p><p>Escobar\u2019s war on the Colombian government, in his last years, turned Medell\u00edn into the homicide capital of the world. These days, the city\u2019s bloody history of gangsterism, nicely sanitised, is part of its allure. The municipal authorities, GEA and most ordinary citizens, are desperate for a more positive image abroad \u2014 the better to attract tourists and investors.</p><p>Since tourism has become a key piece of regional development strategy, Medell\u00edn <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">looks</emphasis> safer than many cities in the western hemisphere. Despite upticks in the homicide rate in 2007-09 and, to a lesser degree, 2016-21, Medell\u00edn\u2019s overall drop is close to 90%, resulting mainly from shifting alliances and changes of leadership in the underworld rather than visionary governance. Since 2015, for the first time since the late 1970s, the rate has been roughly consistent with national trends and far below those of Baltimore, Chicago, Kingston or Caracas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Murder is bad for business</emphasis></p><p>For local organised crime groups, confederated as the Oficina de Envigado, with ties to the municipal authorities and national politics that go back decades, less is more when it comes to homicide. In terms of criminal violence, Medell\u00edn has certainly changed since the extradition of narcotrafficker and paramilitary warlord Diego Fernando Murillo to the US in 2008 \u2014 it was Murillo, a veteran of the US-led campaign to kill Escobar, who decided murder was bad for business \u2014 but it has not improved in terms of the rule of law or the safety and security of the majority of its citizens\u00a0(7).</p><p>Local organised crime groups and drug gangs continue to rule over most of the city, through murder, threats, intimidation and extortion, and people feel safe in their own neighbourhoods, where gangs prohibit rape, robbery etc on pain of death, but not outside of them. Crime remains highly organised, yet now decentralised. Through campaign finance and money laundering, it is connected to the city\u2019s politics and legitimate business, especially in the surveillance technology and private security sectors, as well as sex tourism, hotels, bars and restaurants, transport, construction and real estate.</p><p>As some of its architects admitted at the time, paramilitary demobilisation was a cruel farce: the Gaitanist Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AGC), heir to the national paramilitary confederation United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), is almost solely responsible for the uptick in massacres in Antioquia in 2021. It has high-level allies in the Colombian military, one of whom \u2014 known as \u2018The Godfather\u2019 \u2014 was recently caught supervising cocaine shipments to Cauca and Nari\u00f1o on the southwest Pacific coast, near the Ecuadorian border. The AGC also has ties to Mexican organised crime, specifically to the Guzm\u00e1n faction of the Sinaloa cartel (\u2018El Chapo\u2019 and his sons).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Poverty and capitalism</emphasis></p><p>How do we explain the paradox of industrial-scale poverty, environmental degradation and despair, on the one hand, and high-tech, cutting-edge capitalism, \u2018modern\u2019 city government, and local organised crime dominance on the other? Two principal structural features \u2014 licit and illicit capital \u2014 and their interaction stand out. GEA concentrates and centralises capital, especially in finance, real estate, construction and insurance, and also transnationalises part of it across the hemisphere. With this kind of clout, GEA is able to set the parameters of city government. Through PR campaigns and sponsorship, it also influences local popular culture with concerts and shows, not to mention elections. Recent rifts between GEA and current mayor Daniel Quintero are the exception that proves the rule.</p><p>Though GEA is the principal nucleus of power in the city and department \u2014 acting as a de facto permanent, unelected government \u2014 the Oficina de Envigado is next most powerful in terms of collecting taxes and tribute for local sovereigns (organised crime captains and dons). The Oficina, not the mayor\u2019s office, arbitrates the endless territorial disputes over retail drug sales and extortion, controls everyday life, monopolises the use of torture, murder and extortion, and launders money through the licit economy \u2014 construction, finance, insurance, transport, public works and real estate business, not to mention tourism, hospitality, political campaigns and private security.</p><p>GEA casts the long shadow within which the Oficina operates. The profit-seeking imperative for both ultimately dictates how the local authorities formulate and implement their development plans. The urban planning department designates new green zones, which GEA then promotes and invests in heavily, and the Oficina clears out the old residents to make room for the new.</p><p>The wildcard in this scenario is an incipient new urban left dominated by young people affected by unemployment and precarious jobs, who are demanding far-reaching change to the political and economic order. If the political centre moves leftwards, could further fractures in the fa\u00e7ade of Medell\u00edn\u2019s \u2018miracle\u2019 open up? Will it become possible to formulate a more democratic programme for the city and region, and implement it? Time will tell, but stranger things have happened.</p><p>(1)\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angosta,</emphasis> Seix Barral, Barcelona, 2003.</p><p>(2)\u00a0Nell McShane Wulfhart, \u201836 Hours in Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times,</emphasis> 13\u00a0May 2015.</p><p>(3)\u00a0Lola Allen and Guillaume Long, \u2018Colombia\u2019s growing repression\u2019,\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Le Monde diplomatique,</emphasis> English edition, June 2021.</p><p>(4)\u00a0See Lo\u00efc Ramirez, \u2018Colombia after the FARC deal\u2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Le Monde diplomatique,</emphasis> English edition, September 2018.</p><p>(5)\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.unocha.org/colombia/\">www.unocha.org/colombia/</url>.</p><p>(6)\u00a0Gregory Wilpert, \u2018Why didn\u2019t Colombia vote for peace?\u2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Le Monde diplomatique,</emphasis> English edition, November 2016.</p><p>(7)\u00a0Caroline Doyle, \u2018Perceptions and Realities of Urban Violence in Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u2019, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">International Journal for Crime, Justice, and Social Democracy,</emphasis> vol 8, no 2, 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LMNDEN-9992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LMNDEN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65CB-RX51-F035-X007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420124</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Le Monde Interactif All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Le Monde Diplomatique (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37590\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 1, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Bank reported net earnings of ISK 1,616 million for the same period of 2018. Return on equity was negative by 5.8% for the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with a positive return of equity of 3.2% in 2018. Net earnings for the year 2019 amounted to ISK 1,100 million, compared with ISK 7,777 million in 2018. Return on equity was 0.6% in 2019, compared with 3.7% in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Net earnings from continuing operations amounted to ISK 5,209 million for the fourth quarter and ISK 14,055 million for 2019, compared with ISK 2,132 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and ISK 8,938 million for 2018. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2019 are positively affected by ISK 1.1 billion by the sale of a mortgage portfolio to the Housing Financing Fund. Return on equity from continuing operations measured 10.8% for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7.2% for the year 2019, compared with 4.3% for both the fourth quarter and the year 2018.</p><p>Total assets amounted to ISK 1,082 billion at the end of 2019, compared with ISK 1,164 billion at the end of 2018, which is in line with the Bank's strategy of increased revenues on risk weighted assets rather than loan growth. Loans to customers decreased by ISK 59.9 billion, or 7%, during the year which is largely due to the sale of the aforementioned mortgage loan portfolio of ISK 48 billion in October. In spite of the decrease the Bank was actively supporting its customers as ISK 24 billion of new loans were granted to corporates and individuals in the fourth quarter. Borrowings decrease by ISK 113.0 billion in 2019 or 27% mainly due to prepayments of structured covered bonds and the repurchase of EMTN bonds. Total equity amounted to ISK 190 billion, compared with ISK 201 billion at the end of 2018.</p><p>An important aspect of the Bank's capital optimizing process is the reduction of surplus capital. In line with the Bank's medium-term target of reducing its CET 1 ratio to circa 17%, the Bank paid dividends and bought back own shares in 2019 for the total amount of ISK 12.4 billion. The Board proposes a dividend payment in 2020 of ISK 10.0 billion equaling ISK 5.5 per share.</p><p>The Bank's capital ratio at the end of 2019 was 24.0%, compared with 22.0% at the end of 2018. The CET 1 ratio was 21.2% at the end of 2019, the same as it was at the end of 2018. The capital ratios take into account the proposal for ISK 10 billion dividend payment in 2020 and the on-going ISK 4.2 billion share buy-back program.</p><p>BENEDIKT G\u00cdSLASON, CEO OF ARION BANK</p><p>\"During the fourth quarter we saw clear indications that the organizational and strategic changes made at the end of the third quarter are delivering results, as Arion Bank reported earnings of ISK 5.2 billion from continuing operations during the quarter, the strongest quarter in 2019. The net interest margin increased and operating expenses decreased at the same time as customers repaid low yielding loans and the Bank prepaid expensive funding. Insurance activities delivered strong growth and we have high hopes for our continuing partnership with V\u00f6rdur and the benefits it will bring to our customers.\u00a0 The outlook is therefore bright in many areas of operations.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>However, companies held for sale weighed heavily during the year. Taking into account the negative impact of these companies, net earnings for 2019 only amounted to ISK 1.1 billion, and there was a net loss of ISK 2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. One of these companies is Valitor and towards the end of the year its board of directors decided to implement extensive organizational changes with the aim of consolidating the company's core operations and reducing its investment need. Valitor's budget for 2020 assumes that the company will be EBITDA positive during the year.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The Bank remains strongly capitalized and one of our key priorities now is to optimize our capital structure through the issuance of Tier 2 and Additional Tier 1 capital, by using capital more efficiently in operations and by placing greater emphasis on financial activities which require less capital. Equity represents the Bank's debt to its owners and is the most expensive source of funding. It is therefore important not to have more equity than necessary. A share buy-back program was initiated in the second half of 2019 and dividends were paid during the year. It will also be proposed at the Bank's AGM in March to pay extraordinary dividends. Reducing core equity is vital in order for the Bank to achieve its target of 10% return on equity as growth opportunities offering satisfactory profitability are limited in an environment where interest rates are declining.</p><p>Another key factor in achieving satisfactory return on equity has to do with lending to major corporations. As a result of high capital requirements and extensive taxation the Bank is in actual fact unable to compete effectively with pension funds and international banks when it comes to lending to large companies. Therefore the focus at Arion Bank will be on providing these companies with expert advice and helping them find the most effective financing at any given time, as well as of course providing credit when required. Our strategy on lending to individuals and SMEs remains unchanged and despite our emphasis on the profitability of the loan portfolio rather than loan growth, the fourth quarter did see a healthy increase in new lending, totalling ISK 24 billion, of which loans to individuals amounted to ISK 10 billion.\u00a0</p><p>In December the Board of Directors adopted an ambitious environmental and climate policy and targets for the next few years. The policy dictates that Arion Bank is committed to contributing to efforts to ensure that Iceland can meet its obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement and other local and international environmental and climate agreements. Our goal in 2020 is to evaluate the Bank's loan portfolio according to green criteria and establish targets in this respect. We will also increasingly turn our focus on to financing projects which relate to sustainable development and green infrastructure. Furthermore, we will require our suppliers to take into account the environmental and climate impact of their activities.\"</p><p>INVESTOR MEETING / WEBCAST IN ENGLISH ON 13 FEBRUARY AT 9:30 CET (8:30 GMT)</p><p>Arion Bank will be hosting a meeting / webcast on Thursday 13 February at 8:30 GMT (9:30 CET) where CEO Benedikt G\u00edslason, CFO Stef\u00e1n P\u00e9tursson, deputy CFO Eggert Teitsson and Head of Investor Relations Theod\u00f3r Fridbertsson will present the results and answer questions from participants.

Technological cooperation was one of the main points for discussion, indicating once again the key role the tech sector has acquired in transatlantic trade and investments. The main outcome of the summit seems to be to form a tech coalition based on shared democratic values to counter China's growing technological influence.</p><p>The change of tone and atmosphere compared to the Trump administration is impressive. The two blocs are again committed to close cooperation, certified with the establishment of the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). EU leaders put aside the usual talk about digital sovereignty to sing the praises of the transatlantic partnership. At a time when both sides want to mend relations with their historical transatlantic ally, looking outwards is also a way to avoid more controversial questions.</p><p>\"The overall sentiment that you get from much of the reporting these days is that the policy priorities of both America and Europe are almost identical. That leaves out the issues that are problematic in transatlantic relations, including what's going to happen with the Privacy Shields.\" Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE), told EURACTIV. Antitrust legislation and taxation also feature on the list of more controversial issues. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/transatlantic-tech-talks-team-up-on-china-but-avoid-confronting-key-issues/\">Read more</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't miss: </emphasis>On Tuesday (15 June) the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a ruling that might have far-reaching consequences for GDPR's one-stop shot mechanism. The CJEU specified that under specific conditions already defined in the privacy framework, national authorities might bring alleged GDPR breaches to court even for cross-border cases where they are not the leading authority. The exceptional circumstances include urgency and the limited impact of the GDPR breach in the authority's jurisdiction. In the one-stop shop mechanism, the leading authority is determined by where the data processing organisation is legally based, and since most tech giants have their legal basis in Ireland and to a lesser extent in Luxembourg these countries had to face an overwhelming number of complaints. Civil society organisations assessed that the Court decision might finally end the deadlock over GDPR enforcement. Industry associations, however, fear this might lead to multiple legal proceedings against the same complaint. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/eu-court-gdpr-cross-border-cases-not-limited-to-leading-authority/\">Read more</url>.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Also this week:</emphasis></emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>UK data adequacy decision approved by the EU Council.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>France and Germany scale up their efforts to counter disinformation ahead of the elections.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Connecting Europe Facility 2.0 programme adopted.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>US Congress found bipartisan agreement on 5 bills to curb the power of Big Tech.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Suspected murders of Slovak investigative reporter J\u00e1n Kuciak to stand retrial.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Digital Brief powered by ITI</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does Tuesday's Transatlantic Summit mean for tech?</emphasis></p><p>ITI applauds the EU-U.S. discussions this week and stands ready to work with policymakers to advance the transatlantic digital agenda.

EU countries approved the UK data adequacy decision on Wednesday (16 June). The European Commission will now be able to adopt the decision that would enable the free flow of personal data from the EU to the UK. The European Parliament recently condemned the adequacy decision, pointing to the UK migration law that restricts data protection rights of immigrants and that has recently been ruled illegal by a UK court. As Boris Johnson already <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/uk-to-diverge-from-eu-data-protection-rules-johnson-confirms/\">expressed</url> his intention to change the current UK data protection framework, which is very close to GDPR, the Commission promised to revise the decision should there be any change in the UK privacy laws.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More to follow. </emphasis>With the UK, 13 countries have already been deemed adequate to process EU personal data. On Wednesday (16 June) the European Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2964\">announced</url> it launched the process for the adoption of the adequacy decision for South Korea. The negotiation between the EU and South Korea on data adequacy have lasted for several years now, and led the Asian country to align its data protection law to GDPR.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No option but to ban. </emphasis>An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/06/BanBS-Statement-English.pdf\">open letter</url> signed by more than 175 civil society organizations, researchers and activists called for an \"outright ban\" on the use of facial and remote biometric recognition technologies that enable mass surveillance. The letter contends that \"no technical or legal safeguards could ever fully eliminate the threat [these technologies] pose\", considering they are by design potentially harmful per human liberties and civil rights. The signatories hence urge governments, international organisations and private actors to put an end to the use of biometric recognition technologies in public spaces.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dinsinformation</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brace yourself</emphasis>. Germany and France will go through national elections in less than one year, and both countries fear foreign powers might try to influence the voting by manipulating the online environment through cyber-attacks, fake news and disinformation offensives. Earlier this month, Paris announced the launch of an agency to fight foreign disinformation in September, somewhat replicating the East Stratcom Task Force that since 2015 operates under the European External Action Service (EEAS). The EEAS <url normalizedValue=\"https://euvsdisinfo.eu/villifying-germany-wooing-germany/\">warned</url> in March that Germany is the main target for disinformation campaigns.

With measures not dissimilar to some of those found in the EU's own Digital Markets Act, the bills could serve to prevent these tech giants from crowding their smaller counterparts out of the market. While it remains to be seen whether these bills make it into law, there is an evident appetite for antitrust legislation, with one US senator indicating that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-says-working-companion-bills-house-antitrust-measures-2021-06-15/\">work is already underway</url> to introduce companion bills in Congress's upper chamber.

They've mostly grown to like him, if not love him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Wall Street donors arrived at a fund-raiser for Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a Midtown Manhattan restaurant earlier this year, campaign staff members asked if they wanted to sign up for pictures with the candidate. More than a few of the bankers and private-equity investors politely declined, opting to mingle over glasses of wine instead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was Feb. 13, and Mr. Biden had just been thrashed in the New Hampshire primary after finishing poorly in the Iowa caucuses a week earlier. He was in desperate need of both momentum and money. Still, as Mr. Biden confided to the private-equity executive who co-hosted the event that night: Win or lose, he planned to \"play my heart out to the very end,\" the executive, Jon Gray, later recalled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And finance executives have played a critical role in helping him do it. As Mr. Biden survived a turbulent winter to become the presumptive Democratic nominee running against President Trump, the millions of dollars Wall Street denizens donated to Mr. Biden and outside groups supporting his candidacy have helped him build a strong lead in national polls.</p><p>Wall Street has fared extraordinarily well under Mr. Trump: deep cuts to taxes, slashed regulations and, until the pandemic hit, record stock prices. But in recent months, dozens of bankers, traders and investors said in interviews, a sense of outrage and exhaustion over Mr. Trump's chaotic style of governance - accelerated by his poor coronavirus response - had markedly shifted the economic and political calculusin their industry.</p><p>More and more finance professionals, they say, appear to be sidelining their concerns about Mr. Biden's age - 77 - and his style. They are surprisingly unperturbed at the likelihood of his raising their taxes and stiffening oversight of their industry. In return, they welcome the more seasoned and methodical presidency they believe he could bring.</p><p>They may not exactly be falling in love with Mr. Biden. But they are falling in line.</p><p>\"I've seen meaningful numbers of people put aside what would appear to be their short-term economic interest because they value being citizens in a democracy,\" said Seth Klarman, founder of the hedge fund Baupost. A longtime independent, Mr. Klarman was at one point New England's biggest giver to the Republican Party. But in this cycle, he has given $3 million to groups supporting Mr. Biden. </p><p>Or as James Attwood, a managing director at the Carlyle Group and a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, put it, \"For people who are in the business of hiring and firing C.E.O.s, Donald Trump should have been fired a while ago.\" (Mr. Attwood contributed $200,000 in June to the Biden Action Fund, a joint committee with the Democratic National Committee.)</p><p>In May and June alone, the Biden Action Fund raised more than $11.5 million. That tally - a good measuring stick for Wall Street support because it was set up in part to draw contributions from that industry - included $710,000 from Josh Bekenstein, a co-chair of Bain Capital, and his wife.</p><p>But Wall Street money has proved to be a double-edged sword for Democrats, as Hillary Clinton discovered when she was hounded four years ago for delivering private speeches to Goldman Sachs and other firms. Progressive voters and activists - many of whom backed Mr. Biden's more liberal rivals in the primary - are particularly leery of any appearance of coziness with the finance industry.</p><p>Asked about Wall Street's role in Mr. Biden's current bid, the campaign invoked Mr. Biden's refrain that America wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, C.E.O.s and hedge fund managers.</p><p>\"Everything you need to know about this, Joe Biden has said himself throughout his career - and repeatedly on the trail since the earliest days of this campaign,\" said T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman.</p><p>As a senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden has for decades had relationships with credit-card companies there, but less of a presence in the financial power center of New York. He has counted a small circle of finance executives as supporters. Marc Lasry, the co-founder of Avenue Capital, for example, held a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden during his first run for president in 1988, and continues to back him now. The former hedge-fund executive Eric Mindich and the short-seller James Chanos have been supporters from well before the pandemic began. </p><p>It doesn't hurt that Mr. Biden has also not crusaded against Wall Street, the way his primary rivals Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders did. Financial executives mostly seem to believe that while their taxes would rise in a Biden administration, they would not be subjected to the kind of \"fat cat\" rhetoric that soured some of their relationships with former President Barack Obama.</p><p>\"Rich people are just as patriotic as poor people,\" Mr. Biden told donors at a fund-raiser at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan last year. At a Brookings Institution gathering in 2018, he said, \"I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden's more benign stance toward the finance industry has provoked skepticism among advocates for stricter regulation. \"When the candidate doesn't have a clear plan on something like Wall Street reform, it tilts the playing field toward what is probably the most powerful industry in the world,\" said Carter Dougherty, a spokesman for Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group. \"We need more than 'not Trump appointees' when it comes to financial regulation.\"</p><p>While Wall Street financiers tend to be more socially liberal, they have collectively swung back and forth between parties. Data from the Center for Responsive Politics show the securities and investment community donating more to President George W. Bush in 2004, and then to Mr. Obama in 2008, and then to Mitt Romney in 2012, followed by Mrs. Clinton in 2016, than to their respective presidential rivals.</p><p>This year, it's Mr. Biden. Financial industry cash flowing to Mr. Biden and outside groups supporting him shows him dramatically out-raising the president, with $44 million compared with Mr. Trump's $9 million.</p><p>Last month, multiple Wall Street bundlers, including Alan Leventhal, the chief executive of Beacon Capital; Nat Simons, who runs a clean-tech investment fund; and Mr. Gray, Blackstone's president, held virtual fund-raisers for Mr. Biden. The giving has been so robust that the Biden campaign is now asking for at least $1 million in donations before it will confirm the former vice president's attendance at an event, say bundlers.</p><p>As the checks roll in, the Biden campaign has been carefully cultivating its relationship with the business community, with a focus on Wall Street. The outreach has included offering private briefings ahead of major policy rollouts and dangling various donor packages for the upcoming, and mostly virtual, Democratic National Convention.</p><p>In one call last month, two of Mr. Biden's top advisers on financial policy, Ben Harris and Jake Sullivan, led a wide-ranging conversation to preview the candidate's economic plan, which focuses on broad policy initiatives like investing in green infrastructure projects and minority-owned businesses. Two former Treasury secretaries, Robert E. Rubin and Jacob J. Lew, were part of the call.</p><p>Several major Wall Street executives and investors were also present, including Blair Effron, co-founder of the financial advisory firm Centerview Partners; Penny Pritzker, a fund-raiser and former commerce secretary; David Cohen, a top Biden bundler and Comcast executive; and Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google.</p><p>Mr. Ducklo said the call was one of dozens the campaign held with a variety of groups, including members of the labor and small-business communities.</p><p>Nonetheless, how Mr. Biden might affect their wallets is still a major concern for industry executives who aggressively fought the implementation of new regulations after the financial crisis of 2008. Some in the business community have suggested tweaks to the former vice president's tax and economic policies in ways that might soften the impact for companies.</p><p>At a separate July meeting with campaign staffers and a handful of Wall Street participants, Charles Phillips, chairman of the software company Infor and a onetime Morgan Stanley tech analyst, argued that Mr. Biden shouldn't make huge expenditures on infrastructure and other new programs without also identifying spending cuts. \"We can fund some of this by getting more efficient and getting rid of waste that no one will miss,\" Mr. Phillips recalled saying. He said he also argued for a simpler tax code with a corporate rate lower than Mr. Biden's proposed 28 percent.</p><p>In addition to those watching the policy details, many financiers are closely attuned to Mr. Biden's selection of a running mate, arguing that they might reconsider their votes if he were to choose someone like Ms. Warren, whose campaign sold coffee mugs that read \"Billionaire Tears\" in a nod to her proposed wealth tax on the superrich.</p><p>Some in the finance industry are concerned about Ms. Warren's emergence as an informal policy adviser, and the possibility that she could be installed as Treasury secretary.</p><p>Mr. Biden's policy platform on the issues affecting Wall Street's most affluent players has been relatively sparse. He has proposed a series of tax increases on businesses and on wealthy individuals, including raising the top marginal income tax rate and taxing capital gains as ordinary income for the richest Americans. But he has not embraced a wealth tax like Ms. Warren's, nor has he rolled out any kind of detailed policy plan focused on financial regulation.</p><p>Since Mr. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, the campaign has appointed Rufus Gifford, a former finance director for the 2012 Obama campaign, as a deputy campaign manager overseeing the money operation nationwide. Mr. Gifford is in regular touch with Wall Street donors, coordinating a slew of virtual fund-raisers and discussing campaign issues with deep-pocketed financiers.</p><p>In recent meetings with donors, Mr. Biden has said that while the wealthy are going to have to \"do more,\" the details of his tax hikes are still being hammered out, according to someone who has attended multiple fund-raisers but requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. At a virtual fund-raiser held in July, the candidate spoke of the need for corporate America to \"change its ways.\" But the solution, he said, would not be legislative.</p><p>Back in February, Mr. Biden had taken a precious day off the trail to collect a critical $800,000 at two New York fund-raisers, including the one Mr. Gray co-hosted. \"You're putting me in a position to be able to be very competitive,\" Mr. Biden said, thanking his Wall Street supporters.</p><p>A few of his finance industry donors, looking back, have privately remarked how the evening turned out to be the most quintessential of Wall Street plays: seeing a distressed asset at that time, and buying low.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007253326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JN-W3C1-DYR7-C00H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0006377</classCode><className>CARLYLE GROUP LP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6799 INVESTORS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

But the pandemic is forcing the Biden campaign and other leaders to redraw plans for 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 36 million Americans are suddenly unemployed. Congress has allocated $2.2 trillion in aid, with more likely to be on the way as a fight looms over government debt. Millions more people are losing their health insurance and struggling to take care of their children and aging relatives. And nearly 90,000 are dead in a continuing public health catastrophe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This was not the scenario Joseph R. Biden Jr. anticipated confronting when he competed for the Democratic nomination on a conventional left-of-center platform. Now, with Mr. Biden leading President Trump in the polls, the former vice president and other Democratic leaders are racing to assemble a new governing agenda that meets the extraordinary times - and they agree it must be far bolder than anything the party establishment has embraced before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, neither Mr. Biden nor Mr. Trump has defined in itemized terms what an agenda for the first 100 days of a new presidency in the coronavirus era might look like. But on the Democratic side, far more than within the Republican Party, there is an increasingly clear sense of the nature and scale of the goals a new administration would pursue.</p><p>Mr. Biden's campaign has been rapidly expanding its policy-drafting apparatus, with the former vice president promising on Monday to detail plans for \"the right kind of economic recovery\" within weeks. He has already effectively shed his primary-season theme of restoring political normalcy to the country, replacing it with promises of sweeping economic change.</p><p>On Wednesday, Mr. Biden signaled anew that he was willing to reopen his policy platform, announcing six policy task forces - covering issues including health care, climate and immigration, as well as the economy - that combine his core supporters with left-wing allies of Senator Bernie Sanders, his vanquished primary opponent.</p><p>The formation of those committees was aimed in part at easing divisions between Democrats that are already flaring on subjects like the size of a potential infrastructure bill and the intractable issue of health care. Despite having dashed Mr. Sanders's populist insurgency in the primary, Mr. Biden is still facing loud calls from his party's activist wing to adopt ideas he has firmly resisted, like single-payer health care.</p><p>But in several areas there are already strong signs of consensus within Mr. Biden's party, as once-cautious electoral and legislative tacticians shed their opposition to huge price tags and disruptive change amid a crisis that has melted traditional obstacles to government action.</p><p>Democratic leaders say that if they hold power next January, they must be prepared to move to pump trillions more into the economy; enact infrastructure and climate legislation far larger than they previously envisioned; pass a raft of aggressive worker-protection laws; expand government-backed health insurance and create enormous new investments in public-health jobs, health care facilities and child care programs.</p><p>Discussions are also underway, some of them involving Republicans, about policies that would ban stock buybacks and compel big corporations to share more of their profits with workers.</p><p>And there is more to come: Interviews with more than a dozen influential lawmakers, union leaders, think tank experts and advisers to Mr. Biden and other senior Democrats revealed an intensifying set of deliberations in the Zoom meetings of Mr. Biden's campaign, the skeletally staffed offices of Capitol Hill, and a web of conference calls and email chains initiated by powerful Democratic interest groups. Across all of them, there is a sense that Democrats must use the next six months - with an unpredictable campaign still in progress - to prepare to act swiftly in case they get the chance.</p><p>\"There is a recognition that this event is more transformative than 2008, more transformative than 9/11, more transformative than the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a centrist Democrat.</p><p>The party's moderates, Mr. Warner said, had begun to think \"exponentially bigger\" about a legislative vision for overhauling the economy.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who since ending her presidential campaign has laid out an array of plans for countering the pandemic, said she saw a widening recognition within her party that it faced \"a big moment that we must meet with big ideas.\" Ms. Warren, who has recently spoken several times about policy with Mr. Biden, said she believed the former vice president saw the moment in similarly urgent terms.</p><p>\"The coronavirus has pushed to the front the need for real change,\" said Ms. Warren, a contender to be Mr. Biden's running mate. \"Families need more economic security and we need an economy over all that has more resilience and more protection built in for helping each other in a time of crisis.\"</p><p>For Mr. Biden and other leaders of the Democratic establishment, a difficult balancing act still awaits, as they navigate competing pressures from their party's left flank and the middle-of-the-road voters Mr. Biden is determined to court in the general election. If the current political mood and conditions of the country seems ready-made for promises of dramatic change, that does not necessarily mean most voters are hungering for the same wish list as the ideological left.</p><p>As Mr. Biden surely knows from his years as vice president - most of all the battle over the Affordable Care Act - voters who demand new policies from the government in one moment may not patiently endure the disruptions and unintended consequences that tend to accompany structural change, particularly in times of economic hardship.</p><p>Yet Mr. Biden has plainly changed his outlook on the mission he would pursue in office: As a newly announced presidential candidate last year, Mr. Biden presented himself as a tinkerer under whom \"nothing would fundamentally change.\"</p><p>That spirit was absent from a speech Mr. Biden delivered this month from his porch in Delaware, telling voters that his aim was \"not just to rebuild the economy, but to transform it.\"</p><p>The task of reimagining the economy is in many respects an unlikely one for Mr. Biden, whose driving interests for most of his career were foreign affairs and criminal justice. His most prominent stint as an economic leader came as vice president, when the Obama administration shepherded a reeling financial sector back to functionality and imposed new regulations on Wall Street - but stopped well short of seeking to overhaul the nature of the American private sector and rewrite the rules of the workplace.</p><p>Mr. Biden earned praise for his high-profile role overseeing the distribution of a $787 billion economic stimulus program. But the Recovery Act has come to be seen by many Democrats as something of a cautionary tale about governing in a recession: a law that stitched up a tattered economy but failed to spur a strong comeback, leading to deep electoral losses for the party.</p><p>It is a scenario Democratic leaders are determined not to repeat, particularly progressives who have long faulted the Obama administration for paring back the stimulus in the hope of winning Republican support.</p><p>Many of Mr. Biden's close advisers are veterans of the Obama administration with similar political scars from the last recession. But the Biden campaign has also begun to recruit and corral scores of other Democratic experts into a web of advisory groups aimed at generating policy faster and with greater ambition. Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden's policy director, said much of the campaign's energy was devoted to mapping out a \"quick slate of executive actions\" to address pandemic conditions and carry out other aspects of Mr. Biden's agenda.</p><p>But Mr. Biden is also soliciting input from a range of party luminaries outside his campaign, some of whom described him as eager for new ideas.</p><p>\"I think that he wants to work and support working families, and I think he's interested in hearing programs and thinking outside the box as far as what needs to be developed to achieve that goal,\" said Lee Saunders, president of the government workers' union Afscme, who has spoken several times recently with Mr. Biden.</p><p>Separate from the Biden campaign, about three dozen influential figures at labor unions, think tanks and other progressive institutions have convened a weekly virtual meeting \u00ad- known as the Friday Morning Group - with the same goal, according to multiple participants who spoke about the sessions on the condition of anonymity. Among its motivating forces is a view that liberal Democrats failed in the last recession to take the initiative in specifying plans for achieving large-scale change.</p><p>This convening of progressive minds, one of several brainstorming-and-planning initiatives underway in Washington, has mulled a range of policy options, including mainstream proposals like major new spending on public health and child care and less widely supported options like creating a universal basic income or offering a federal jobs guarantee.</p><p>Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than a million health care workers, said she had briefed Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate about her organization's view that it was time to \"change the rules of the economy for the long term,\" including a powerful expansion of the rights and employment benefits of lower-income workers.</p><p>\"We don't want to stand for any short-term fixes when we need a total overhaul,\" said Ms. Henry, who has also been in touch with the Biden campaign.</p><p>Hanging over Mr. Biden's plans will be uncertainty about elections for the House and Senate that will determine whether Mr. Biden would have cooperative Democratic majorities or face opposition from a Republican-held Senate aligned with conservative business interests. Mr. Trump, who has said little about his goals for another term, has begun accusing Democrats of imperiling an economic recovery by proposing new regulations and taxes.</p><p>For now, however, the political atmosphere seems to be one of demand for more aggressive action: One Democratic group, Navigator Research, that has been conducting daily polling on the pandemic, found large majorities of voters concerned that the government would do too little to help people and eager for the government to do more, even if it cost a lot of money.</p><p>Jake Sullivan, one of Mr. Biden's closest policy advisers, said the former vice president had not shed the underlying view of the American economy that defined his candidacy for much of the last year, when Mr. Biden rejected calls for his party to embrace the agenda of democratic socialism. But, he said, the external circumstances facing a potential Biden administration were different now.</p><p>\"We are going to have to do more, push further, be more creative coming out of this once-in-a-century pandemic - no doubt about it,\" Mr. Sullivan said.</p><p>According to several aides, Mr. Biden is expected to produce detailed plans for funding health care jobs and green infrastructure, and initiatives to rebuild the domestic manufacturing of critical supplies and help Americans who lost jobs in the most devastated industries find lasting employment.</p><p>In his speech on the economy this month, Mr. Biden also said he wanted to \"insist that big corporations, which we've bailed out twice in 12 years, set up and take responsibility for their workers and their communities\" - a striking flash of populist sentiment that Mr. Biden has not yet translated fully into policy.</p><p>Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a moderate Democrat who also ran for president last year, said he hoped Mr. Biden would embrace policies that would shift wealth and economic power away from the extremely rich and toward workers and middle-class people hit hardest by the pandemic.</p><p>Mr. Bennet, who has proposed a range of tax and health benefits for low- and middle-income households, said he saw a window for action that did not exist during the last recession.</p><p>\"I think there was not the same recognition, 10 years ago, that there is today, that we've had 50 years of an economy that only works for people at the very top,\" Mr. Bennet said, adding with blunt impatience: \"I think a decade of not achieving the stuff we need to achieve is probably enough.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007134209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXS-9MG1-JC85-N00P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 19, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001377</classCode><className>PRIMARY ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQCW</classCode><className>BIDEN'S FIRST 100 DAYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Net sales increased by 8.5 per cent, of which 6.2 per cent was organic growth. Net sales increased in all divisions.Adjusted operating profit was EUR 10.2 million (8.7) and operating profit was EUR 10.6 million (-2.2). Earnings per share were EUR 0.21 (-0.07).Net sales in January-June totalled EUR 390.7 million (367.5). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 13.8 million (12.3), operating profit was EUR 14.3 million (0.7) and earnings per share were EUR 0.27 (-0.07). Earnings per share were positively influenced by a reduction in net financial expenses to EUR -1.6 million (-3.1). Exchange differences amounted to EUR 0.0 million (-1.2).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook for the year 2021, updated 27 July 2021</emphasis></p><p>Net sales in 2021 are estimated to grow and adjusted operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PRESIDENT AND CEO EERO HAUTANIEMI:</emphasis></p><p>In the first half of the year, net sales increased by 6.3 per cent from the comparison period. \u00a0Organic growth accounted for 5.7 per cent. Operating profit increased across all divisions, and in addition to growth in net sales, we succeeded in enhancing our operational efficiency. All of the divisions boosted their results even though the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on all of our businesses throughout the first half of the year. In the second quarter, material volumes began to recover and the prices of secondary raw materials continued to recover. Demand in the industrial segment was strong. We are now focusing on taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the recovery of the markets.</p><p>One of our strategic targets is to continuously improve customer satisfaction. In a customer satisfaction survey conducted in Finland in April, we achieved record results and customer satisfaction improved across all of our divisions. Employee satisfaction also improved.</p><p>We carried out three business acquisitions in the second quarter, strengthening our position in Environmental Services and Facility Services Finland's food hygiene and retail services in accordance with our strategy. The combined net sales of the acquired businesses amounted to approximately EUR 25 million in 2020. The acquisitions support our goal of annually increasing our net sales organically and through acquisitions by more than 5 per cent.</p><p>We received international recognition for our sustainability efforts. EcoVadis, a leading ratings platform for assessing sustainability, awarded the highest possible Platinum rating to L&amp;T in its assessment. This means we are in the top 1% of the 75,000 companies analysed by EcoVadis. We also received recognition in a study by the Financial Times and Statista, which listed European companies that achieved the highest reduction in emissions relative to net sales in 2020. Lassila &amp; Tikanoja was one of fourteen Finnish corporations on the list.</p><p>The new Waste Act entered into force in Finland on 19 July 2021. The new Waste Act implements the EU's new and more ambitious recycling requirements for municipal waste and packaging waste in Finnish legislation and also introduces national reforms to the collection systems concerning materials collected from housing properties. The amendments will enter into force in stages by 2025 and do not have an impact on L&amp;T in 2021.</p><p>The expansion of the sorting and separate collection obligations to businesses is estimated to increase the market for collecting and processing materials. The impact of the new Waste Act on the retail and industrial waste streams and the competitive landscape in areas will become clear by the end of 2025.</p><p>Municipalities will take on a larger role in collecting packaging materials and biowaste from residential properties. L&amp;T's direct customer agreements with housing properties will be transferred to municipal waste companies by the end of the transition period. The change will not have a direct impact on the collection of mixed waste from housing properties. Housing properties' contractual waste management services accounted for slightly over 10 per cent of the net sales of Environmental Services in 2020. The amendments will enter into force in stages by the end of 2025.</p><p>It is still too early to assess the overall impact of the new Waste Act. The trend of municipalisation of waste management for residential properties has reduced the household segment's share of the Environmental Services division's business portfolio significantly over the past 10 years. We have been able to compensate for these losses effectively by focusing on the growing corporate market.</p><p>The amendment to the Waste Act will not result in changes in L&amp;T's strategy. We are continuing to focus on the organic growth in the corporate customer market and business acquisitions, with the acquisition of Sihvari Oy's business operations in June being a good example of this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GROUP NET SALES AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">April-June</emphasis>Lassila &amp; Tikanoja's net sales for the second quarter amounted to EUR 198.7 million (183.2), up 8.5% year-on-year. Adjusted operating profit was EUR 10.2 million (8.7), representing 5.1% (4.7%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 10.6 million (-2.2), representing 5.3% (-1.2%) of net sales.\u00a0 Earnings per share were EUR 0.21 (-0.07).</p><p>Net sales grew across all of the Group's business segments. Operating profit increased in Industrial Services and Facility ServicesSweden. In Environmental Services and Facility Services Finland, operating profit was on a par with the comparison period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">January-June</emphasis>Net sales for January-June increased by 6.3% from the comparison period to EUR 390.7 million (367.5). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 13.8 million (12.3), representing 3.5% (3.3%) of net sales. Operating profit was EUR 14.3 million (0.7), representing 3.7% (0.2%) of net sales. Earnings per share amounted to EUR 0.27(-0.07).</p><p>Net sales and comparable operating profit increased across all of the Group's business segments.</p><p>The realisation of occupational accident expenses concerning accidents that took place prior to 2018 had a negative effect of EUR 0.8 million on the Group's operating profit. In the comparison period, non-recurring items had a positive net effect of EUR 0.9 million on the Group's operating profit. The items in question are not included in the figures of the Group's businesses. In the comparison period, operating profit was improved by the temporary lowering of pension insurance contributions by 2.6 percentage points from 1 May to 31 December 2020, which had a positive impact of approximately EUR 3.8 million in 2020.

L&amp;T's carbon handprint reduces the customer's carbon footprint. Our services generated emission reductions for customers through, for example, customers replacing virgin raw materials with secondary raw materials and fossil fuels with biofuels and solid recovered fuels. During the period under review, we expanded our calculation to also cover the material services of the Industrial Services division more comprehensively than before.</p><p>Recycling rate and material recovery</p><p>The recycling rate is the weighted average of our customers' recycling rates. It also includes materials that cannot be recycled at present. To increase our reuse and recycling rate, we actively look for new material streams whose refining rate we can increase. Reporting covers municipal waste collected from corporate customers, hazardous waste, industrial waste and construction waste in Finland. Slurry, contaminated soil and ash are excluded from reporting.</p><p>Progress towards science-based emission reduction targets, using 2018 as the baseline</p><p>L&amp;T's strategic objective is to halve the carbon footprint of its operations by 2030 and to reduce the indirect emissions generated by its supply chain. The emission reduction target set by L&amp;T has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. The achievement of this objective will be promoted by switching to zero-emission transport technologies and fuels and by opting for renewable energy at L&amp;T's properties. We increased the number of biogas-powered heavy vehicles to 21 (Q1/2021: 18) and started a project to set emission reduction targets in the supply chain.</p><p>Social responsibility</p><p>Overall accident frequency</p><p>We use effective proactive measures - such as risk assessments, safety observations, Safety Walks and occupational safety sessions - to improve our safety as well as the safety of our customers and other stakeholders, while also eliminating risk factors.</p><p>Well-being at work</p><p>In the first half of the year, the sickness rate among employees was lower than in the comparison period and the occupational health rate improved by two percentage points to 66 per cent (64%). Supervisors received training on remote management practices and employee well-being was supported by a dedicated COVID-19 helpline and digital discussion services to help them cope with the situation psychologically. L&amp;T also provided COVID-19 vaccinations to employees through the occupational health provider in locations where the municipalities' arrangements made this possible.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Current issues related to sustainability</emphasis></p><p>EcoVadis, an international platform for rating corporate sustainability, awarded a Platinum rating to Lassila &amp; Tikanoja.

As part of the Action Plan for a Circular Economy, the EU approved a waste regulation package in summer 2018, with its key goal being to enhance compliance with the waste hierarchy, or order of priority, and increase the resource-efficient use and recycling of materials. The aim is for 55 per cent of municipal waste by weight to be prepared for reuse or recycling in 2025, 60 per cent by weight in 2030 and 65 per cent by weight in 2035. The goals for the recycling rate of packaging waste were also tightened.</p><p>The EU's new more ambitious recycling requirements for municipal and packaging waste will be implemented in Finland with the amendment to the Waste Act issued on 19 July 2021 and decrees issued under it. New obligations relating to the separate collection of waste fractions considerably stricter than the current ones will be adopted in order to achieve the recycling objectives.</p><p>In L&amp;T's view, stricter recycling targets that increase sorting at source, the separate collection of waste and the recycling business in Finland represent important steps forward.</p><p>However, still approximately 40% of Finns are left outside the tightening sorting obligations, living in small properties, and effective market-based instruments and incentives still under preparation are needed alongside the obligations.</p><p>The reform of the Waste Act will see municipalities take on a larger role in organising the collection of packaging materials and biowaste from housing properties. As a consequence of the reform, L&amp;T's direct customer agreements on the separate collection of packaging waste and biowaste with housing properties will be transferred to municipalities for competitive bidding. With regard to mixed waste, the possibility of a dual waste transport system for housing properties will remain in place, but its importance will decrease with the increase in the separate collection of packaging and biowaste. Housing properties' contractual waste management services accounted for slightly over 10 per cent of the net sales of Environmental Services in 2020.</p><p>It is still too early to assess the overall impact of the reform. The expansion of the sorting and separate collection obligations to businesses is estimated to increase the market for collecting and processing materials. In the housing property segment, the amendments will restrict the free market. In addition to the market-based instruments, the overall impacts will be influenced by the development of the volumes of separate collections with the tightening of the obligations. The amendments will enter into force in stages between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2024. The amendments will not have an impact on the operations of L&amp;T in 2021.</p><p>In the future, municipalities will put up waste management services for residential properties for tender more frequently and L&amp;T will participate in these tendering processes along with other operators. The trend of municipalisation of waste management services for residential properties has reduced the household segment's share of the Environmental Services division's business portfolio significantly over the past 10 years. L&amp;T has been able to compensate for these losses by focusing on the growing corporate market. We are continuing to focus in the corporate customer segment and execute acquisitions, with the acquisition of Sihvari Oy's business operations effective from 1 June 2021 being a good example of this.</p><p>L&amp;T published an updated outlook for the year 2021 on 27 July 2021. The updated outlook is as follows: net sales in 2021 are estimated to grow and adjusted operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NEAR-TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</emphasis>The measures and recommendations issued by the authorities to restrict the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting customer-specific production restrictions and adjustment measures are expected to potentially cause disruptions in service production during 2021. Customers are adapting their service agreements to the changing circumstances and the volumes of waste and secondary raw materials decrease when customer volumes decline. The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is reflected particularly in the demand for separately ordered services and makes it difficult to predict.</p><p>Fluctuations in the price of oil influence both fuel costs and the prices of oil-based secondary raw materials, such as recycled plastic and regenerated lubricants.</p><p>The company has several ERP system renewal projects under way. Temporary additional costs arising from system deployments and establishing the operating model may weigh down the company's result.</p><p>More detailed information on Lassila &amp; Tikanoja's risks and risk management will be provided in the 2020 Annual Report and in the Report of the Board of Directors and the consolidated financial statements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook for the year 2021, updated 27 July 2021</emphasis></p><p>Net sales in 2021 are estimated to grow and adjusted operating profit is estimated to be at the same level or better compared to the previous year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Previous outlook for the year 2021 (January 28, 2021)</emphasis></p><p>Net sales in 2021 are estimated to be at the same level and adjusted operating profit at the same level or better compared to the previous year.</p><p>Helsinki, 27 July 2021</p><p>LASSILA &amp; TIKANOJA PLC</p><p>Board of DirectorsEero HautaniemiPresident and CEO</p><p>For additional information, please contact:Eero Hautaniemi, President and CEO, tel. +358 10 636 2810Valtteri Palin, CFO, tel. +358 40 734 7749</p><p>Lassila &amp; Tikanoja is a service company that is putting the circular economy into practice.

(\"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Northland</emphasis>\" or the \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Company</emphasis>\") (TSX: NPI) is pleased to announce an update on its long-term plans and objectives as well as provide its 2021 financial outlook, which will be further discussed at the Company's virtual investor day later today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the next decade, the global transition to renewable energy is expected to accelerate as de-carbonization efforts by governments and private entities increase and further electrification of the economy gathers momentum, resulting in significant opportunities for further growth in renewable power generation and green infrastructure, especially in offshore wind. Countries with land constraints and high carbon energy usage are increasingly adopting offshore wind to support their de-carbonization objectives and their renewable energy targets. As a global developer with extensive expertise in developing offshore wind projects, Northland is strategically positioned to compete in this global transition and further grow its global portfolio and market share.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"Northland's deep expertise in renewables development combined with its established offshore wind capabilities and portfolio pipeline in Europe and Asia positions us to capture an outsized share of the renewable energy transition opportunities going forward,\" said Mike Crawley, Northland's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Offshore wind is a focal point of our strategy with over 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of gross offshore wind operating capacity and an additional 4 to 5 GW of gross capacity of identified projects under development, we are now a top ten global offshore wind owner and developer. Our growth aspirations are much larger than this and we have amassed a total pipeline of approximately 12 GW of gross offshore wind capacity globally. Pursuing offshore wind projects provide us the opportunity to deploy significant capital to generate attractive returns on assets underpinned by long-term, government backed revenue contracts. We are very excited to embark on the next growth chapter at Northland where we expect to execute on our development projects adding significant incremental operating capacity, furthering the global shift to a carbon free world.\"</p><p>Pauline Alimchandani, Northland's Chief Financial Officer, said \"Northland continues to position itself for future growth and expects its strategy will continue to generate growing shareholder value over the coming years. The next growth inflection point for Northland offers the opportunity to deploy at least $15 to $20 billion of gross capital investment into new renewable projects over the next five years, anchored by identified offshore wind projects that are currently in active development. These projects have the potential to more than double our adjusted EBITDA<sup>1</sup>from current levels, once commercially operational. In addition, we are targeting new opportunities in onshore renewables, utilities and transmission as well as establishing a position in renewable fuels and energy storage. Our allocation to utilities and transmission is targeted to account for approximately 10 to 15% of our adjusted EBITDA over time. This should enable Northland to maintain solid and diversified cash flows thereby supporting a strong balance sheet and credit rating to fund expenditures related to our core focus of securing and developing offshore wind development assets.\"</p><p>1. This press release makes reference to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and adjusted Free Cash Flow. Please see Non-IFRS disclosures at the end of the release for additional information.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STRATEGIC UPDATE</emphasis></p><p>For over 34 years, Northland has created shareholder value by leveraging its expertise and early mover advantage to develop and operate high-quality, sustainable projects supported by long-term revenue contracts that deliver predictable cash flows. While energy markets continue to change and the emphasis shifts through sector cycles, Northland's core capabilities remain unchanged:</p><p>Opportunity identification and project origination;Commercial acquisition negotiation, project financing and equity funding;Project development and construction; andOperations &amp; asset management.</p><p>Northland has established a global presence across eight offices in four continents and has over 1,000 employees. This presence in multiple regions has resulted in developing local expertise and strategic partnerships that facilitate securing early stage development opportunities encompassing a range of clean technologies in target markets. This strategy has created both geographic and technological diversification across Northland's operating and development portfolio. Northland remains focused on meeting the growing global need for renewable energy primarily through developing and operating generation projects but also through enabling transmission and distribution infrastructure to support electrification.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Offshore\u00a0Wind</emphasis></p><p>Offshore wind is the largest segment of Northland's business and is expected to account for over 60% of its 2020 adjusted EBITDA. Through the development, construction and operation of its first three offshore wind projects in Europe over the past six years, Northland has developed engineering, project design, procurement and construction expertise in offshore wind that it expects to leverage to execute on new early-stage offshore wind projects globally. The Company considers its offshore wind resources to be a key asset not only in developing new projects but also in securing new partnerships, such as the recently announced 1,200 megawatt (MW) Baltic Power project located off the coast of Poland in the Baltic Sea, to be developed with PKN ORLEN.</p><p>One of the Company's strategies is to augment its existing pipeline of offshore opportunities by securing interests in early stage projects in key target markets in Asia and Europe, through greenfield development, and by seeking long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy entities to generate strong returns and stable cash flows.</p><p>In Asia, several markets have demonstrated strong sovereign support for de-carbonization through renewables development. Northland will leverage its capabilities in offshore wind development and existing presence to increase its position and footprint in Asia.\u00a0Current development activities are focused on advancing the 1,044 MW Hai Long, the 600 MW Chiba and the 1,000 MW Dado Ocean projects in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, respectively. In addition, Northland is pursuing feasibility-stage development in the markets above and is considering additional market entry.</p><p>Beyond its Identified Development Projects<sup>2</sup>, Northland has built a robust pipeline of opportunities in offshore wind with the potential to add an incremental 12 GW of gross capacity. Successful execution of these projects will deliver significant incremental contracted cash flows starting in the latter half of this decade and is expected to further bolster Northland's long-term business sustainability, extending into the 2040s and 2050s.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Onshore Renewable Power</emphasis></p><p>While Northland expects significant growth will come from its core focus on offshore wind development, the cash flows from these projects are expected in the latter half of the decade. To complement its offshore wind development, Northland expects to advance shorter-term development and explore acquisition opportunities in the onshore renewable segment that can achieve commercial operations within the next few years. Northland's focus is on markets in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, and Eastern and Southern Europe. Additional markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America are also under consideration. Current advanced development and under-construction projects encompass the 300 MW onshore wind projects in New York State, the 130 MW La Lucha solar project in Mexico and the 16 MW Helios solar project originating from EBSA in Colombia that will soon commence construction.</p><p>2. Identified Development Projects include: Hai Long, Dado Ocean, Chiba, Baltic Power, Nordsee Two/Three, and New York Wind</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Utilities and Transmission</emphasis></p><p>Expansion of renewable power will necessitate expansion of transmission and distribution networks in many countries. EBSA and similar utility infrastructure assets have demonstrated accretive returns and immediate cash flow for Northland in Latin America. Utilities offer perpetual and stable cashflows and can also be a platform for further investment and growth in their markets. Utilities are also considered as key enablers of the renewable energy transition in developing markets such as Latin America. As such, part of Northland's long-term strategic positioning includes incremental investment in electricity distribution and transmission infrastructure, primarily in Latin America which are complementary to Northland's development strategy and its existing portfolio.</p><p>In addition to EBSA, which serves as a platform to develop renewable power projects in Colombia, growth in Northland's utility segment is expected to be supported by further investments and acquisitions in Latin America with strong rate base growth. The utilities segment is expected to account for approximately 10 to 15% of Northland's adjusted EBITDA over the long term, growing from 7% currently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Renewable Fuels</emphasis></p><p>With positive momentum behind renewable power, policy makers, regulators and corporations are now turning their focus to reducing and eventually eliminating carbon in fuels.\u00a0As a result, renewable natural gas and hydrogen appear to be positioned for tremendous growth in the years to come and offer attractive returns to early movers who can manage the inherent risks in an emerging sector, similar to what Northland achieved through its investment in and ownership of offshore wind.\u00a0In 2020, Northland created a dedicated team that is focused on establishing an early mover position in new growth asset classes. There are also potential synergies between Northland's renewable assets and hydrogen production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ESG and SUSTAINABILITY</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Our Mission is to Develop a Carbon Free World\"</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability is integral to Northland's business and its ability to safely and reliably deliver the energy people need while delivering long-term economic value to its shareholders. Northland has been committed to delivering renewable and cleaner energy projects, health and safety and having a lasting, positive impact on its communities for 34 years. Northland is focused on advancing its Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives by integrating ESG into everyday activities, while enhancing its reporting on material ESG issues for stakeholders. These activities align with Northland's mission of helping develop a carbon-free world. ESG has always been prominent at Northland and the Company is formally launching targets as part of its 2021 Sustainability report and will be committed to the following objectives:</p><p>Supporting carbon reduction targets of the countries in which the Company operates by building significant green energy / renewable projects;Adding at least 4 to 5 GW of gross new renewable energy capacity to its portfolio by 2030;Committing to reducing Company carbon intensity levels by 65% by 2030 from 2019 levels;Continued commitment to diversity and inclusion (including 30% female representation at each of the Board and Executive Management levels);Continued emphasis on Corporate Governance best practices;Continuing to uphold the highest standards of Health &amp; Safety (Zero life-changing incidents);Continuing to serve as a positive and contributing community partner; andBeing a leader in ESG, through alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, reporting in line with SASB in 2021 and a commitment to report inline with TCFD by 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Efficient Natural Gas</emphasis></p><p>Northland's efficient natural gas assets have played a role in the de-carbonization of the Canadian energy grid, helping achieve the country's objectives of diversifying its energy mix away from coal. In addition, these assets have been a staple of Northland's business, providing a stable source of revenue and cash flow. Going forward and for the foreseeable future, however, Northland believes that by far its best opportunities to support global de-carbonization initiatives and generate positive financial returns for its shareholders will come from further development and growth in renewables. Through the execution of its offshore wind strategy, the relative financial contribution from the efficient natural gas assets to the overall corporate results is expected to continually decline. In the meantime, the free cash flow that is generated from the efficient natural gas assets supports the funding of development capital required for offshore wind. As such, Northland will take a measured approach to any decisions regarding its efficient natural gas assets with consideration to the impacts on cash flow and Northland's broader strategic objectives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCIAL STRATEGY</emphasis></p><p>Northland's financial position continues to be excellent, with approximately\u00a0$0.6 billion\u00a0of total available liquidity, and an investment grade balance sheet that has no material maturities over the next five years and over 95% of total debt being non-recourse to Northland.</p><p>In addition to historical sources of funding utilized by Northland, the Company is pursuing additional options to expand its funding sources. These additional sources are intended to extend financial flexibility and continue to preserve the Company's strong investment grade balance sheet while supporting the capital requirements for its growth. These sources are expected to encompass green financing instruments, partial sell-down of ownership interests in development assets and other tools.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asset Sell-downs</emphasis></p><p>Northland intends to consider a selective sell-down strategy of partial interests of certain of its development projects once they have achieved financial close to allow the Company to: (i) manage jurisdictional exposures, (ii) crystalize some development profit prior to construction as a result of the de-risking of the project; (iii) enhance its free cash flow and liquidity position; and (iv) increase project returns, amongst other considerations. Northland will assess each opportunity individually and intends to remain a long-term owner in the renewable projects it develops globally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green Financings</emphasis></p><p>Effective today, Northland is launching a Green Financing Framework, available on the Company's website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.northlandpower.com/sustainability/\">northlandpower.com/sustainability/</url>), that focuses on greening and optimizing its balance sheet to secure green corporate and project financings starting in 2021. The financings will be required to meet internal eligibility criteria that align with the Green Bond Principles (GBP), Green Loan Principles (GLP), and EU Taxonomy.\u00a0The framework has received an independent second-party opinion from Sustainalytics\u00ae which confirms the framework is credible, impactful and aligns with the core components of the GBP and GLP.\u00a0Green capital issuances will afford Northland a number of benefits including allowing the Company to capitalize on strong investor demand for renewable power investments, diversifying funding sources, and optimizing liquidity (through green corporate bond instruments), all of which should ultimately decrease the Company's cost of funds and allow for better matching of tenors and/or currencies to its asset base.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other Tools</emphasis></p><p>Northland will also aim to enhance its corporate liquidity through DRIP participation and asset level financing optimizations, including re-financings of existing assets. All of these financial tools should ensure that Northland maintains a solid balance sheet to fund development and execution of its growth plans over the long term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2021 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adjusted EBITDA</emphasis></p><p>For fiscal 2021, management expects adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to remain consistent relative to 2020 guidance levels, primarily due to the following factors (all amounts approximate):</p><p>Higher contribution from German offshore wind facilities as a result of anticipated fewer periods of negative market prices and un-compensated curtailments ($30 million);Higher contributions from Gemini primarily as a result of higher assumed 2021 wholesale market price ($10 million); andContribution from the La Lucha solar project in Mexico ($10 million), with the project expected to begin producing power in March 2021, with commercial operations expected to follow soon after.</p><p>Factors offsetting the increase in 2021 adjusted EBITDA include:</p><p>Lower anticipated contribution from efficient natural gas facilities primarily due to a scheduled extended maintenance outage at the North Battleford facility in Saskatchewan ($15 million decrease); andHigher expected growth expenditures relating to activities intended to advance Northland's identified projects including New York Wind, Baltic Power, Chiba and Dado Ocean and Nordsee Two projects ($35 million), as well as higher G&amp;A and other costs to support this growth ($25 million).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free Cash Flow</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, management expects Free Cash Flow to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.50 per share. This level of Free Cash Flow per share is expected to be lower than the revised 2020 guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per share primarily due to the following factors (all amounts approximate):</p><p>Higher contribution from German offshore wind facilities as a result of fewer periods of negative market prices and un-compensated curtailments net of higher interest, taxes and other items ($15 million);Higher contribution from Gemini primarily as a result of higher assumed market prices net of higher debt repayments and other items ($5 million); andContribution from La Lucha ($5 million) and from EBSA ($10 million), including proceeds from anticipated upward financing of the EBSA Facility that is expected to occur annually based on growth in EBSA's rate base.</p><p>Factors more than offsetting the aforementioned increases include:</p><p>Lower anticipated contribution from the efficient natural gas facilities, amounts as noted above; andHigher project development and corporate costs to support growth, amounts, as noted above, which is the primary driver for the decrease in Free Cash Flow.</p><p>To achieve its growth objectives, Northland will deploy increasing amounts of early-stage investment capital (development expenditures) to advance its projects. As in 2020, with the regional development offices fully functional and certain growth opportunities secured, such as New York Wind and Baltic Power, Northland expects to incur higher development expenditures and growth investment in 2021. Early-stage development investments will reduce near-term free cash flow and short-term liquidity until the projects achieve commercial operations but should deliver long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow.</p><p>As such, the 2021 Free Cash Flow guidance range reflects increasing development expenses in pursuit of the Company's continued execution of its global growth strategy. These expenditures relate to the development and advancement of Baltic Power, New York Wind, Chiba Energy in Japan, Dado Ocean in South Korea and other offshore wind projects. The 2021 development expenses are expected to be approximately $100 million or $0.50 of 2021 Free Cash Flow per share, which is included in the aforementioned variance explanations.</p><p>In addition to development expenditures, the Company expects to incur capital expenditures of $100 million in 2021 to advance Hai Long and other advanced-stage projects. Capital expenditures are largely expected to be funded through cash on hand and through Northland's corporate credit facilities and do not impact Free Cash Flow.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Free Cash Flow Excluding Growth Expenditures)</emphasis></p><p>Commencing with the fourth quarter 2020 results, Northland intends to disclose a new supplementary non-IFRS free cash flow per share measure, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which will exclude growth expenditures as management deems them to be investment related. These growth expenditures are incurred for the purposes of generating future cash flow. Adjusting for growth expenditures in relation to 2021 cash flow guidance would result in Northland's Adjusted Free Cash Flow for 2021 to be in the range of $1.80 to $2.00 per share and in management's view, allow for a better representation of cash flow generated from the business before investment-related decisions. Management believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a meaningful measure of Northland's ability to generate cash flow, after on-going obligations, to re-invest in growth and fund dividend payments. For comparison, the 2020 Adjusted Free Cash Flow supplementary guidance range would have been $1.95 to $2.15 per share relative to the revised Free Cash Flow per share guidance of $1.60 to $1.70 per share as disclosed in the third quarter of 2020.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Iroquois Falls Update</emphasis></p><p>Northland's 120 MW Iroquois Falls natural gas facility achieved commercial operation in 1997 and has contributed significantly to the Company's financial performance through a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the government of Ontario. The PPA is set to expire at the end of 2021 and given the current forecasted Ontario market capacity needs, Northland anticipates participating in the Ontario market through Capacity Auctions as a generation resource, offering capacity for both the summer and winter commitment periods. In addition, Management intends to seek other offtake opportunities.</p><p>Currently, Iroquois Falls contributes approximately $75 million annually in adjusted EBITDA and this contribution is expected to materially decline starting in 2022 contributing less than $10 million in adjusted EBITDA annually.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LONG-TERM OUTLOOK AND GROWTH IN ADJUSTED EBITDA</emphasis></p><p>Northland is at an inflection point given the accelerating global trend towards de-carbonization and electrification, and its extensive portfolio of offshore wind development. The Company has advanced and secured the rights to a number of offshore projects, which if successful will increase Northland's installed gross capacity by at least 4 to 5 GW and require approximately $15 to $20 billion ($10 to $14 net) of total gross capital investment over the next five years. These projects, once operational by the latter half of the decade, are expected to more than double the Company's adjusted EBITDA, after taking into account the Company's ownership share. The Company's investor day materials will provide more details on the identified development projects, an illustration of its funding plan and the additional large-scale growth opportunities expected to create value for shareholders over the long-term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Northland's Investor Day Conference</emphasis></p><p>Management will host a virtual investor conference today at\u00a010:00 a.m. ET.\u00a0The conference will be webcast live and can be accessed through Northland's website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.northlandpower.com\">www.northlandpower.com</url></p><p>Details of the webcast:</p><p>Presentations and supporting materials will be posted on Northland's website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.northlandpower.com\">www.northlandpower.com</url></p><p>A webcast replay will be available after the conclusion of the conference and posted to Northland's website on February 5, 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All dollar amounts in this press release are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABOUT NORTHLAND POWER</emphasis></p><p>Northland Power is a global power producer dedicated to helping the clean energy transition by producing electricity from clean renewable resources.

to infrastructure problems, such as allowing natural wetlands to absorb excess water from heavy rain, instead of building concrete flood protection infrastructure. </p><p>In what green campaigners in Brussels view as a 'Eureka moment', the package will allow stone beaches to receive preferential funding for coastal protection, and river banks and marsh areas to be chosen for soaking up floodwaters and reducing water pollution.</p><p>\"Building green infrastructure is often a good investment for nature, for the economy and for jobs,\" Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said. \"We should provide society with solutions that work with nature instead of against it, where that makes economic and environmental sense.\"</p><p>Green infrastructure is often cheaper and more durable than traditional civil engineering solutions, according to the EU's statement, which also noted that heat waves can be mitigated by biodiversity-rich parks, green spaces and fresh air corridors.</p><p>Europe's biodiversity has been hammered over the last 50 years by habitat loss, land degradation and fragmentation, due to the rapid expansion of cities and transport

when in many cases nature provides a more cost effective and lasting solution,\" said Alberto Arroyo Schnell, a senior policy advisor at WWF.</p><p>The EU plans would also ease pressures on the environment caused by intensive farming and infrastructure such as dams and, levies and canals, according to the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).</p><p>Martina Mlinaric, a spokeswoman for the EEB, said that investing in green infrastructure would \"deliver significant benefits in both economic and ecological terms.\"</p><p>\"The move from grey to green is vital to reaching the objectives which the EU set for 2020,\" she said, \"and not only in the field of environment.\"  </p><p>The package will now need to ensure that funding is routed from the EU's cohesion and agricultural policies, currently being negotiated between EU states and the European Parliament.</p><p>One cautionary note was sounded by Birdlife Europe, which stressed that it expected to see a new impetus for strengthening , the EU's ecological network, and to link this to EU states' commitments to restore 15% of degraded ecosystems by 2020.</p><p>The Commission will review progress towards developing its

A new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) proposes a method for mapping this 'green infrastructure'. </p><p>The EEA report, 'Spatial analysis of green infrastructure in Europe', maps a network of natural and semi-natural spaces and other environmental features in Europe with a good capacity to deliver  'ecosystem services'. These include air filtration, erosion protection, regulating water flow, coastal protection, pollination, maintaining soil structure, water purification, and carbon storage. The report also identifies key habitats for large forest-dwelling mammals and the analysis of connectivity among them.</p><p>This experimental methodology, applicable at different scales, indicates that healthy areas of green infrastructure cover approximately a quarter of Europe's land. In many cases, these areas are also home to Europe's large wild animals, including the brown bear, wolf, reindeer and lynx. This underscores the need for effective conservation and restoration, the report says.</p><p>Roads, towns and other developments continue to fragment habitats, splitting wildlife populations into smaller groups, reducing the gene pool and making species more vulnerable to pressures such as climate change. The report authors map several corridors where the environment could be restored in order to reconnect habitat fragments.</p><p>There is some uncertainty in this analysis, the report notes. However, it provides a useful starting point for identifying priority areas for conservation and potential restoration.</p><p>Multiple benefits of green infrastructure</p><p>The multiple benefits of green infrastructure were highlighted in EU Green Infrastructure Strategy, published last year. For example, in cities trees and green areas can prevent flooding, reduce air pollution and reduce noise levels. In addition, using natural systems in this way can often be cheaper and more robust than the typical 'grey' infrastructure such as concrete flood barriers. Many more examples are explained in a recent publication from the European Commission.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN276483</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BNY-XF41-JDKF-63RY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 7, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With an acceptance rate exceeding 97%, the Group supports its customers in all its regions through its various retail banks (three quarters of SGL applications are handled by the Regional Banks<sup>2</sup>). The Group's total net exposure to SGLs stands at (EURO)3.1\u00a0billion in France (LCL, Regional\u00a0Banks and CACIB<sup>3</sup>), with only a small proportion of SGLs currently classified as Stage 3 (2.0%<sup>4</sup>at end\u00a0March 2021). For the past two quarters there has been a slowdown in SGL growth in France (+2.5% in SGLs outstanding versus 15 January 2021). In Italy on the other hand, where CA Italia has granted (EURO)2.8\u00a0billion in SGLs to 40,000 customers, the pace remains brisk (+16.7% versus December 2020).</p><p>At the same time, the Group continues to support the economy by implementing<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">payment holidays</emphasis>on loans, notably for corporate, SME and small business customers, whose activities have been impacted by the economic consequences of the pandemic. After a high of 552,000 payment holidays granted, for (EURO)4.2\u00a0billion in maturities extended in June 2020, as at 9 April 2021, a total of 93,000 payment holidays were still active at the Regional\u00a0Banks and LCL, representing approximately (EURO)0.7\u00a0billion in deferred maturities (of which 68% for SME and small business and corporate customers and 32% for households, with 87% at the Regional\u00a0Banks and 13% at LCL<sup>5</sup>). This corresponds to total remaining capital due of (EURO)10.1\u00a0billion in France. In Italy, 42,000 payment holidays are still active, accounting for less than (EURO)0.5\u00a0billion in deferred maturities<sup>6</sup>. Less than 2%<sup>7</sup>of Regional Banks and LCL moratoria are within stage 3. Payments have resumed on more than 98% of expired payment holidays of Regional Bank and LCL customers<sup>8</sup>. The situation is similar at CACF, where payments have resumed on 98% of Retail and Corporate customers' payment holidays.</p><p>Fully committed to a fair transition, i.e. one that promotes social cohesion, the Group continues to deploy social inclusion measures and take steps to protect vulnerable customers. It is supported in this effort by special mechanisms set up by each of the business lines: \"Points Passerelle\" at the Regional Banks, \"LCL Parenth\u00e8se\", and \"Customer Support Agencies\" at CACF. Thus, a total of 11,000 vulnerable customers have received support through the Points Passerelle, for example, with 2,300 personal microcredit granted in 2020. CAA has supported 170 local projects as part of its inclusion programme, taking its contribution to almost (EURO)2.5\u00a0million in 2020. Lastly, the Grameen Foundation, which is active in 39 countries and supports 75 microfinance institutions and 12 social impact businesses, had outstandings of (EURO)81.2\u00a0million in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Group is determined to</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">boost the recovery, in a context of economic upturn and renewed</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">international competition</emphasis></p><p>The Group is actively contributing to the economic recovery, most notably through its pledge to distribute Pr\u00eats Participatifs Relance (Recovery Participating Loans) to customers in all regions. These loans, which are distributed by banks, including those in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole networks, are equivalent to quasi-equity capital and will help promote job creation and investment by allowing companies to finance their expansion as they come out of the pandemic. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has embarked on a major review of its customer base to identify companies with potential that would be eligible for a Recovery Participating Loan. According to initial estimates, almost 45,000 SME and mid-cap customers of the Regional Banks and 8,500 customers of LCL are eligible. They are currently being contacted proactively by their corporate account managers. Webinars and an information campaign are also being conducted to raise awareness. The Recovery Participating Loans are part of a range of solutions that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole has been offering its customers since the onset of the pandemic. In addition to the moratoria and state-guaranteed loans granted since March 2020, the Group is further supporting the recovery by leveraging its complementary areas of expertise.</p><p>Amundi, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, IDIA Capital Investissement and the regional capital investment companies of the 39 Regional\u00a0Banks are particularly involved in these capital injections. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances is providing (EURO)2.25\u00a0billion in financing for the Recovery Participating Loans in an initial (EURO)11-billion round of financing, while Amundi is involved in managing the vehicle that will carry these loans. The general mechanism set up by the French government is expected to raise (EURO)20\u00a0billion from French and international institutional investors ((EURO)14\u00a0billion for the state-supported equity loans, known by the French acronym \"PPSE\", and (EURO)6\u00a0billion for state-supported subordinated debt, known by the acronym \"OSSE\").</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's strong momentum also attests to how committed its employees are to supporting the economic recovery.</emphasis>The payments business is up significantly (number of mobile payment contracts at the Regional Banks: +54% in Q1-2021). Outstandings other than SGLs rose sharply (+4.7%, of which +5.0% for the Regional Banks and +3.4% for LCL), while the Regional Banks have continued to increase their market share in home loans (+0.33 percentage points Dec/Dec) and corporate loans (+0.37 percentage point Dec/Dec).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Group is</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">fulfilling its commitments</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to societal</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">transformation</emphasis></p><p>As part of the human and societal pillars of the Group Project, the Group supports the societal transitions that its customers have requested and are experiencing. For example, the Group has gone from CSR to general impact management. In June 2019 it came out with an innovative climate strategy featuring strong governance, the full integration of energy transition issues in customer relationships, and a gradual reallocation of financing and investment portfolios.</p><p>Internally, the Group relies on what is recognised as an ambitious Human Resources policy. The Group is the the number one employer in France,<sup>9</sup>and 30% of its new hires in 2020 are under the age of 30. The Group has taken steps to increase the number of women in its executive management, and in 2020 the percentage of women on an executive committee at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Group entity decision-making bodies was respectively 25% and 24%<sup>10</sup>. With more than half of employees working abroad, making the talent pools more international is a major challenge for the Group. The succession plans for 2022 include a target of 20% foreign candidates, a criterion that has also been incorporated into the indicators we use to guide our Human-centric Project.</p><p>The Group's innovative climate strategy depends first and foremost on a dedicated governance structure made up of three umbrella committees: a Group societal project committee, which oversees the implementation of the Group's societal commitments and ensures they are consistent with its ESG strategy, a scientific committee composed of 12 independent experts renowned in their field, and an operational committee, which monitors climate strategy. The two latter committees support the work of the Group societal project committee.</p><p>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole places utmost importance on transparency. In 2019, the Group pledged to report regularly on the exposure of its financing and investment portfolios to thermal coal, and outsourced the certification of its climate strategy implementation to an independent third party. This year, for the first time, the mix of energy-related financing and investment assets managed by Amundi, LCL, CAA and CACIB was provided in the 2020 Universal Registration Document<sup>11</sup>.</p><p>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole also broke new ground in 2020 by setting up a non-financial reporting platform to cover the Group's entire reporting scope. The only one of its kind, the platform collects external and internal non-financial data to calculate the main societal impact indexes for all Group entities. It also generates a unique climate transition rating for listed companies using public data.</p><p>The Group has fully integrated the climate transition into its customer relationships, and from the first quarter has used the climate transition rating to measure and support the transformation efforts of 8,000 listed companies at CACIB and Amundi. The tool will next be adapted for the Group's SMEs and mid-caps. New investment solutions have also been introduced for customers, such as LCL's range of climate impact investing products (\"LCL Placements Impact Climat\") and Amundi's green energy fund, which is the first climate transition fund eligible for life insurance policies investing directly in green infrastructure. Amundi's assets under management linked to climate transition and green growth initiatives increased by 80% in 2020 to (EURO)22\u00a0billion. At the start of the year, Amundi launched the first \"fair transition\" fixed income fund.</p><p>Lastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's climate strategy involves reallocating financing and investment portfolios for the benefit of climate transition. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is now France's number one private financier and institutional investor in renewable energy.<sup>12</sup>As noted in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. 2020 Universal Registration Document, renewable energy financing loans for large corporates increased by +11% in 2020. Asset under management invested in renewable energy were also up for the year (+22%). CAA invested (EURO)1.4\u00a0billion in renewable energy. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is the first bank which committed to exit from thermal coal by 2040 (and exit coal in the European Union and OCDE by 2030). Large corporates financing loans and assets under management dedicated to coal fell by -28% and -34% respectively in 2020. The Group continues to support SMEs in less favoured areas as well as the public health sector, and helps maintain social ties through a reference framework set up for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. social bonds. Moreover, in 2020, CACIB arranged (EURO)12.2\u00a0billion in social bonds (10% market share).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Group activity</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Despite ongoing restrictions during the quarter, the Group's business rose sharply thanks to the soundness and efficiency of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">its</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Universal Customer-focused Banking model. Gross customer capture was very strong: +469,000 customers in first quarter 2021, of whom 430,000 were in France and 39,000 in Italy. The increase over one year was also significant, with +1,565,000 new customers, of whom 1,438,000 were in France and 127,000 in Italy. The Group's customer base continued to expand in first quarter 2021 (+76,000 customers).

The Asset gathering and Large customers business lines posted strong revenue growth of +18.6% (+(EURO)249\u00a0million) and +11.9% (+(EURO)177\u00a0million) respectively, due not only to brisk business but also the recovery in the markets. In French retail banking, the Regional\u00a0Banks recorded a sharp rise in revenues of +9.9%, or +(EURO)320\u00a0million, from first quarter 2020, mainly due to the impact of market revaluations on securities portfolios, while LCL recorded a more modest increase of +1.9% in revenues this quarter. Specialised financial services showed resilience during the quarter, with underlying revenues falling by just -0.5%: revenues for CACF fell by -3.1% in first quarter 2021 but held steady on a like-for-like basis (+0.1%<sup>21</sup>) due to the stability of consolidated outstandings over the past year, despite a return to robust production levels in first quarter 2021; CAL&amp;F posted strong revenue growth of +10.0%, having benefited from an excellent level of leasing activity in Poland and France.

Expenses in the Large\u00a0Customers business line showed a moderate increase of +3.3% over the period (+(EURO)29\u00a0million), in line with increased provisions for variable compensation in CIB and development projects at CACEIS. In Asset gathering, expenses rose by +2.1% (+(EURO)16\u00a0million), largely as a result of the scope effect related to the integration of Sabadell\u00a0AM and the establishment of Amundi\u00a0BOC and Fund\u00a0Channel (+(EURO)12\u00a0million).</p><p>Overall, the Group posted a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">positive jaws effect of +8.0 percentage points</emphasis>and a decline in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF</emphasis>of -4.8\u00a0percentage\u00a0points, taking it to 60.6% in first\u00a0quarter\u00a02021. The contribution to the Single Resolution Fund was (EURO)652\u00a0million this quarter, up +43.4% compared to first quarter 2020. Note that the (EURO)185\u00a0million refund of an overpayment for financial years 2016-2020 was accounted for this quarter and classified as specific items.

Of the factors comprising this change, only the provisioning for proven risks (stage 3) was up between fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021. It rose by +11%. The decrease in the cost of risk was particularly marked this quarter for the Regional Banks (divided by 1.9 compared to first quarter 2021 and divided by 2.7 compared to fourth quarter 2020), financing activities (-38.2% compared to first quarter 2020 and -30.0% compared to fourth quarter 2020) and CA Consumer Finance (-30.4% compared to first quarter 2020 and -11.0% compared to fourth quarter 2020).

Asset quality was good: the NPL ratio showed little change from end\u00a0December 2020, standing at 2.3% at end\u00a0March 2021, while the coverage ratio<sup>22</sup>, which was high at 84.4%, gained strength during the quarter (+0.5 percentage points compared to end\u00a0December 2020). The diversified loan book is mainly geared towards home loans (47% of gross outstandings at Group level) and corporates (32% of gross outstandings at Group level). Loan loss reserves amounted to (EURO)19.7\u00a0billion at end\u00a0March 2021, of which 35% was for performing loans (Stages 1 and 2). Loan loss reserves increased by +(EURO)0.1\u00a0billion compared to end\u00a0December 2020. Starting in first quarter 2020, the context and uncertainties related to the global economic conditions were taken into account and the expected effect of public measures were incorporated to anticipate future risks. Provisioning levels were established to reflect the sharp deterioration in the environment, taking into account<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">several weighted economic scenarios</emphasis>and applying flat-rate adjustments for the retail banking portfolios and corporates portfolios and specific additions for some target sectors, namely tourism, automotive, aerospace, retail textile, and energy. Several weighted economic scenarios were used to define provisioning for performing loans. These are unchanged from those presented in the 2020 URD, and include a more favourable scenario (French GDP at +7.1% in 2021 and +2.7% in 2022) and a less favourable scenario (French GDP at +3.0% in 2021 and +4.8% in 2022).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The cost of credit risk relative to outstandings</emphasis><sup>23</sup><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">over a rolling four-quarter period was 33\u00a0basis points.</emphasis>It stood at 22 basis points on a quarterly annualised basis<sup>24</sup>.

Non-controlling interests rose by +18.4%, mainly due to a change in Insurance in the recognition methods used for subordinated debt (RT1) coupons, with no impact on net earnings per share.

This was particularly the case for unit-linked policies, which accounted for 35.4% of gross inflows in first quarter 2021, or 1.9 times those of first quarter 2019<sup>28</sup>.

In first quarter 2021, the cost of risk on Stages 1 &amp; 2 totalled (EURO)57\u00a0million. The cost of risk relative to outstandings came in at 16\u00a0basis\u00a0points over a rolling four-quarter period and 11\u00a0basis\u00a0points on an annualised quarter basis.

Therefore,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">underlying gross operating income</emphasis>excluding the SRF was up by +19.1% compared to first quarter 2020.</p><p>As at 31 March 2021, risk indicators confirmed<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the high quality of Cr\u00e9dit\u00a0Agricole\u00a0S.A.'s assets and risk coverage level</emphasis>. The diversified loan book is mainly geared towards home loans (27% of gross outstandings) and corporates (45% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. gross outstandings). The non-performing loan ratio was still low at 3.2% (stable compared to 31 December 2020), while the coverage ratio<sup>46</sup>was high at 72%, up +0.6 percentage points in the quarter. Loan loss reserves amounted to (EURO)9.7\u00a0billion for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., a +(EURO)0.1\u00a0billion increase from 31 December 2020. Of these loan loss reserves, 28% were for performing loan provisioning.

The -(EURO)384\u00a0million expense in first quarter 2021 consisted of performing loan provisioning (Stages 1 &amp; 2) for -(EURO)90\u00a0million (versus an allocation of -(EURO)223\u00a0million in first quarter 2020 and an allocation of -(EURO)193\u00a0million in fourth\u00a0quarter\u00a02020) and provisioning for proven risks (Stage\u00a03) amounting to -(EURO)283\u00a0million\u00a0(versus -(EURO)382\u00a0million in first quarter 2020 and -(EURO)291\u00a0million in fourth quarter\u00a02020).

Insurance revenues also benefited over one month from the unwinding of an additional 15% of the Switch mechanism carried out on 1 March 2021. Underlying expenses were down -5.7% in first quarter 2021 compared to the year-earlier period. This change breaks down into a +3.1% rise in expenses for the businesses relating to investments to develop the activity, and a drop in the C3S corporate social contribution applied to the activity in 2020. Underlying gross operating income was therefore recorded up +48.5%, at (EURO)391\u00a0million in first quarter 2021. The underlying cost/income ratio in first quarter 2021 stood at 37.4%, an improvement of -11.1\u00a0percentage\u00a0points compared to first quarter 2020.

Net management fee and commission income increased by +5.1% and performance fee income reached a record level of (EURO)111\u00a0million. In addition, the first quarter 2021 benefited from a positive scope effect (Sabadell AM and Fund Channel for +(EURO)17\u00a0million in revenues). Underlying expenses excluding SRF came to (EURO)379\u00a0million, a 13.2% increase, which can be explained by the scope effect of Sabadell, Fund Channel and the creation of Amundi Bank of China WM of (EURO)12\u00a0million, as well as the rise in variable compensation linked to the growth in gross operating income. Underlying gross operating income was up a strong +44.4% and the underlying cost/income ratio excluding SRF stood at an excellent level of 50.3%, down 6 percentage points compared to first quarter 2020. The contribution of equity-accounted entities, notably including the contribution of Amundi's joint ventures in Asia, was +28.3% higher than in first quarter 2020, and came in at (EURO)18\u00a0million despite a negative scope impact due to the change to full consolidation of Fund Channel and reached (EURO)20\u00a0million.

In the end, excluding state-guaranteed loans, outstanding loans were also up year-on-year for LCL (+3.4%), driven by small business loans (+11.4%), and CA Italia experienced strong performance in home loans, with outstanding loans increasing by +6.3% year-on-year, taking the bank's market share to 9.21%, up +7 percentage points year-on-year. In France, renegotiations on LCL home loans remained stable compared to fourth quarter 2020 at (EURO)0.2\u00a0billion in outstandings, below first quarter 2020 at (EURO)0.5\u00a0billion, and still well below the high point of (EURO)5.2\u00a0billion in fourth quarter 2016.

On-balance sheet deposits at LCL were up year-on-year (+11.9% March/March) in line with the increase in precautionary household savings and deposits of a portion of the state-guaranteed loans that were granted to promote corporate liquidity. Against this backdrop, demand deposits showed a rise for both individual customers (+14% March/March) and SME, small business and corporate customers (+49% March/March). At CA Italia, on-balance sheet deposits were up year-on-year (+5.4% March/March), but down in the last quarter, reflecting the commercial actions taken to optimise resources. Off-balance sheet savings increased at LCL (+7.4% March/March), including +3.2% for life insurance. CA Italia's managed deposits also rose significantly year-on-year (+16.9% March/March), driven both by the acquisition of new customers and by the redirection of savings towards investment products, both of which reflect the significant mobilisation of networks.

Risk weighted assets had a downward impact on CET1 of -20 basis points<sup>68</sup>, and the methodology and regulatory effects impacted the CET1 by -12 basis points (of which -11 basis points related to the TRIM - targeted review of internal models). This ratio includes a negative impact of -4 basis points on the \"M&amp;A, OCIE and other\" item linked in particular to the effect of OCI reserves (-9 basis points in connection with the increase of rates over the period). The stock of OCI reserves reached 38 basis points at 31 March 2021 (vs. 48 basis points at 31 December 2020).

It is based on the definition of a mapping table between the Group's IFRS financial statements and the sections of the cash balance sheet as they appear in the next table and whose definition is commonly accepted in the marketplace. It relates to the banking scope, with insurance activities being managed in accordance with their own specific prudential constraints.</p><p>Further to the breakdown of the IFRS financial statements in the sections of the cash balance sheet, netting calculations are carried out. They relate to certain assets and liabilities that have a symmetrical impact in terms of liquidity risk. Deferred taxes, fair value impacts, collective impairments, short-selling transactions and other assets and liabilities were netted for a total of (EURO)62\u00a0billion at end\u00a0March 2021. Similarly, (EURO)120\u00a0billion in repos/reverse repos were eliminated insofar as these outstandings reflect the activity of the securities desk carrying out securities borrowing and lending operations that offset each other. Other nettings calculated in order to build the cash balance sheet - for an amount totalling (EURO)159\u00a0billion at end-March 2021 - relate to derivatives, margin calls, adjustment/settlement/liaison accounts and to non-liquid securities held by Corporate and Investment banking and are included in the \"Customer-related trading assets\" section.</p><p>Note that deposits centralised with Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations are not netted in order to build the cash balance sheet; the amount of centralised deposits ((EURO)67\u00a0billion\u00a0at end\u00a0March 2021) is booked to assets under \"Customer-related trading assets\" and to liabilities under \"Customer-related funds\".</p><p>In a final stage, other restatements reassign outstandings that accounting standards allocate to one section, when they are economically related to another. As such, senior issues placed through the banking networks as well as financing by the European Investment Bank, the Caisse\u00a0des\u00a0D\u00e9p\u00f4ts\u00a0et\u00a0Consignations and other refinancing transactions of the same type backed by customer loans, which accounting standards would classify as \"Medium long-term market funds\", are reclassified as \"Customer-related funds\".</p><p>Note that for Central Bank refinancing transactions, outstandings related to the T-LTRO (Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations) are included in \"Long-term market funds\". Indeed, the T-LTRO 3 operations do not allow for early redemption at the ECB's discretion; given their contractual maturity, they are deemed equivalent to long term secured refinancing, identical in liquidity risk terms to a secured issue.</p><p>Medium/long-term repos are also included in \"Long term market funds\".</p><p>Finally, the CIB's counterparties that are banks with which we have a commercial relationship are considered as customers in the construction of the cash balance sheet.</p><p>Standing at (EURO)1,549\u00a0billion at 31 March 2021, the Group's banking cash balance sheet shows a<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">surplus of stable funding resources over stable application of funds of (EURO)279\u00a0billion</emphasis>, up (EURO)14\u00a0billion compared to end\u00a0December 2020 and up (EURO)147\u00a0billion compared to end\u00a0March 2020.</p><p>In line with initiatives already undertaken during the past quarters in connection with the COVID-19 crisis, the Group once again took part, in March 2021, in the T-LTRO 3 medium-to-long-term refinancing transactions of the European Central Bank for (EURO)19\u00a0billion<sup>69</sup>, helping to raise its level of stable resources. Total T-LTRO 3 outstandings for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group amounts to (EURO)152\u00a0billion<sup>70</sup>at 31 March 2021. Note that the subsidy applicable to the refinancing rate for these operations is accrued over the drawdown period and that the additional subsidy for the period June 2020 to June 2021 is accrued over one year, as the Group already meets the lending trigger.</p><p>In addition, the Group recorded a net increase in customer activity during the quarter. Funds collected increased by (EURO)17\u00a0billion, while loans and trading assets to customers increased by (EURO)22\u00a0billion.</p><p>The surplus of 279\u00a0billion\u00a0euros, known as \"stable resources position\", allows the Group to cover the LCR deficit generated by long term assets and stable liabilities (customer, tangible and intangible assets, long-term funds, own funds).

It is a supranational fund financed by Eurozone member states, notably enabling the pooling of financial resources to be used for banking resolution. The Single Resolution Fund will be gradually built up by contributions from national resolution funds over a period of eight years from 2016, to reach a target of at least 1% of the covered deposits of all approved credit institutions of the participating Member States combined by 2023.45 Recorded in the first quater based on more exact information communicated by the SRB in March.46 Provisioning rate calculated with outstandings in Stage 3 as denominator, and the sum of the provisions recorded in Stages 1, 2 and 3 as numerator47 A decrease of 10 points in the weight of the favourable scenario towards the less favourable scenario would lead to a change in \"forward-looking central\" ECL reserves of around 0.8% of total ECL reserves. However, such a change in the weight would not necessarily have a significant impact due to \"forward looking local\" adjustments, which could mitigate the effect.48 The cost of risk relative to outstandings (in basis points) on a four quarter rolling basis is calculated on the cost of risk of the past four quarters divided by the average outstandings at the start of each of the four quarters49 The cost of risk relative to outstandings (in basis points) on an annualised basis is calculated on the cost of risk of the quarter multiplied by four and divided by the outstandings at the start of the quarter50 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0See Appendixes for more details on specific items.51 Equipment rate: percentage of individual banking customers holding at least one insurance product (Pacifica estimates).

The consortium also includes Japanese trader Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd, as well as US General Electric and insurance group John Hancock.</p><p>PPF has not made a final decision but is expected to do so before Wednesday, the deadline for the submission of non-binding offers for GIB, sources were cited as saying.</p><p>Among the interested parties is also said to be Australian bank Macquarie Group Ltd.</p><p>GIB's privatisation was announced last month by UK business secretary Sajid Javid. At the time, Javid said that the government would retain a so-called 'golden share', which will allow it to ensure that the GIB remains firmly focused on providing funding for environmentally friendly projects.</p><p>GIB was established in 2012 with state funding of GBP 3.8 billion and has since poured GBP 2.6 billion into nearly 70 green energy projects. It was created to finance green infrastructure which is otherwise shunned by profit-oriented private sector investors.

Environmental NGOs are now taking steps for it to become part of the European Commission's green infrastructure strategy and UNESCO World Heritage.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Where barbed wire, watchtowers and minefields once separated Europe, an unintentionnal, almost pristine ecological habitat could develop along the 12,500 km border. Indeed, during its forty years of existence, the iron curtain allowed no human activities, no development, and thus offered endangered species and flora an unexpected refuge. Today, the European Green Belt project involves 24 countries, 49 national parks, 7,319 protected areas and benefits from specific European funds such as the Danube Transnational Programme and Life programme.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But intensive land-use, roads construction, illegal logging and poaching are posing a serious threat, environmental NGOs argue. They say half of the area in a one-kilometre wide corridor along the Green Belt benefits from a protected status. They are therefore calling on the European Commission to recognise the European green belt as a whole, one single ecological project.</p><p>\"That is our expectation towards the new European Commission as it would secure long-term funding. In 2013, the European Green Belt Initiative has been identified as a lighthouse project for the implementation of a pan-European green infrastructure but not much has happened since. We are missing concrete measures,\" Hubert Weiger, chair of Friends of the Earth Germany (BUND) and one of the initiators of the project, explained to EURACTIV.</p><p>The iron curtain refers to the boundary that divided Europe politically and militarily from the end of World War II until the end of the cold war in 1989. Its borderline ran from Estonia to former Yugoslavia.</p><p>The term 'iron curtain' was popularised by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in a landmark speech at Westminster College in Fulton (United States), in March 1946. \"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,\" he declared.</p><p>The Berlin Wall was the most famous section of the Iron Curtain and became its symbol. It stretched for 155 kilometres, with a heavily controlled no-man's land on the eastern side. Historians estimate that between 600 and 700 people died trying to flee East Germany, with 136 at the Berlin Wall alone.</p><p>The first crack in the Iron Curtain appeared in May 1989 when Hungary and Austria decided to open their border.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Memorial landscape</emphasis></p><p>For Hubert Weiger, the European Green Belt is more than just a pan-European ecological project, it is about building a European memorial landscape. \"All along the trail, you can see military remnants from the cold war. And it is important to keep them in order to be able to show how bad it was,\" he said. The 72-year old forestry economist was among the first environmental activists to take steps to protect the German green band soon after the iron curtain was torn down.</p><p>\"Indeed, the European Green Belt combines the ecological and historical dimensions in a unique way. And this other part of the project, the historical part, has become more and more important, it goes beyond the classical nature conservation, it is something that engages, fascinates and motivates people,\" he continued.</p><p>\"If we succeed to permanently secure the European Green Belt, then it will become part of a new European identity with the former iron curtain border becoming a symbol of cohesion, right here, in the middle of Europe,\" he said.</p><p>\"Europe is colourful and diverse, that is our very own specificity, Europe is not a uniform culture. Not only do we think our project reflects that idea, but we believe it can serve as an inspiration elsewhere in the world,\" he insisted.</p><p>As it is, his organisation is making efforts for the European Green Belt to win a place on UNESCO's World Heritage list.</p><p>Specific conditions have to be met, one of which being that the application should come from as many countries as possible, preferably from so-called \"core countries\" from Scandinavia, the Baltic, Central Europe and the Balkans. Friends of the Earth Germany is hoping that the current Finnish EU-presidency will provide \"positive impulse\".</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">An inspiration for divided Korea</emphasis></p><p>Faced with a highly sensitive political situation and a heavily militarised inner-separation reminiscent of cold-war Germany, the Korean peninsula is divided in two parts, with the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) serving as a buffer between North and South Korea.</p><p>And just like the green belt in Europe, the DMZ has turned out to be an unexpected ecological haven for numerous species of flora and fauna. Which is why South-Korean environmental organisations are having a close look at the European Green Belt Initiative.</p><p>\"Since the end of the Korean War, South Korea has experienced a fast economic development that literally left no place for environment,\" Marie-Yon Str\u00fccker from Seoul-based National Nature Trust told EURACTIV. \"As for North Korea, it has over-exploited its natural resources. So no matter what political and economic system you are in, the environmental impact is big and the DMZ has become the last natural refuge for our biodiversity,\" she continued.</p><p>It is impossible to say precisely how many animal and plant species have found protection within the DMZ because of the many mines that prevent researchers from entering the area. Every two to three years, researchers are allowed to enter the DMZ but only in very specific areas, Marie-Yon Str\u00fccker said.</p><p>\"The DMZ is not exactly an ecological corridor; I would describe it as an ecological area with a well-preserved jungle. This area is older than its European counterpart, it is 66-years old, not 40 like the Iron Curtain. So nature really had time to develop and stay untouched,\" Marie-Yon Str\u00fccker added.</p><p>Members of the European Green Belt Initiative and the South-Korean National Nature Trust are currently sharing experiences with a special focus on the land legislation, i.e. land property, along the 248 kilometre-long border (which encompasses an area of 907 km2).</p><p>\"Contrary to the green belt in Europe, where the European legislation on land ownership is pretty clear, no one really knows who actually owns the DMZ. It involves the two Koreas, but also the United States, China and the United Nations. That means we cannot do anything without the international community,\" she said.</p><p>There is also another major difference between the two projects: the South-Korean government does not provide direct financial support. Instead, it enacted the National Trust Act in 2006, which led to the creation of the UK-inspired National Nature Trust. Its aim is to bolster both public and private funding, in and outside South Korea.</p><p>\"And maybe the DMZ could become the first project both Koreas could agree on, such as becoming a nature reserve,\" Marie-Yon said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1371615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-7C31-JCF9-41WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1116\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp;

Corporation has [7 November] launched a report alongside the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry -FICCI- calling on policymakers to reduce barriers to investment in order to accelerate the development of India's green finance market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Written with input from the UK-India Green Finance Working Group, Untapped Potential: Supercharging Green Finance in India looks at the opportunities and challenges for sustainable finance in India and offers recommendations on how to drive forward the sector, including:</p><p>Reduce structural barriers to investment, including development of the Rupee-denominated Masala bond market,<br/>Innovative financing mechanisms tailored to the Indian landscape,<br/>Increased transparency and standards; Greater visibility of opportunities and funding gaps,<br/>Further government cooperation to building domestic support in India, and greater technical experience sharing among regulators,<br/>Targeted policy reforms and incentives, such as changes to the External Commercial Borrowing -ECB- guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India for issuers with \"green' track records.<br/>The UK-India Green Finance Working Group was founded in May 2019 to showcase best practice among London-based firms with an interest in sustainable infrastructure projects in India.</p><p>Chaired by Richard Abel, Managing Director for UK Climate Investments at Macquarie and Hitendra Dave, Managing Director at HSBC India, it aims to create a link between London-based service providers with a business interest in green infrastructure in India, and Indian-based firms searching for expertise or financing through the UK-India Green Finance Dialogue and Partnership.</p><p>City of London Corporation Policy Chair Catherine McGuinness said:</p><p>\"The UK is a leading global hub for green finance, home to many world-class institutions from all stages of the investment lifecycle, from project conception to delivery and advisory.</p><p>\"India is a market with incredible diversity of opportunity and collaboration between our two countries gives us a chance to make a real difference to the climate change efforts.</p><p>\"We are therefore delighted to be launching this step towards supercharging relations between the UK and India.\"</p><p>FICCI Secretary General Mr Dilip Chenoy said:</p><p>\"Sustainable finance is indeed an imperative for achieving low-carbon, inclusive and stable growth for India.</p><p>\"India and UK have a long-standing relationship and both countries can mutually collaborate and proactively support initiatives on green growth and investment internationally to unlock domestic and international flow of green capital.</p><p>\"The report Untapped Potential: Supercharging Green Finance in India of the UK-India Green Finance Working Group is a welcome step in this regard.\"</p><p>India-Chair, India-UK Working Group on Green Finance and Managing Director and Head of Global Banking and Markets, HSBC India Mr Hitendra Dave said:<br/>\"India and UK both are witnessing a greater understanding of new opportunities created by the convergence of the economic and environmental priorities.</p><p>\"The report is indeed a very high quality first report being launched at the most opportune times and should act as an anchor and reference point as we all move to the next stage of implementation, policy advocacy and defining and executing the more granular steps to scale up sustainable finance for India.\"</p><p>The City Corporation has a longstanding programme of work in India, and opened a representative office in Mumbai twelve years ago. 15 Indian financial firms are based in the Square Mile which the City Corporation works closely with, and there are many more based across London.</p><p>Notes to editors</p><p>The City of London Corporation is the governing body of the Square Mile dedicated to a vibrant and thriving City,

With the restructuring in 2018, a different name was chosen to represent the diversity of the issues we deal with.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The German government has recognised the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europeangreenbelt.org/\">Green Belt Initiative</url> as a national natural heritage and is running it as a beacon project for the protection of biological diversity. In 2009, it was even anchored in the country's Nature Conservation Act. What is it like in Austria?</emphasis></p><p>In Austria, too, the Green Belt Initiative is a beacon project as it covers 1,200 km of land and valuable natural assets, such as Lake Neusiedl, the March-Thaya floodplains and the Bohemian Forest.</p><p>Many of the areas are also protected, including three national parks (Neusiedler See-Seewinkel, Donau-Auen and Thayatal), ten cross-border nature parks, as well as numerous protected Natura 2000 areas. A UNESCO biosphere park called Mur-Drava-Danube with a total of 850,000 hectares located along the lower part of the Mur on the Styrian border with Slovenia.</p><p>Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Serbia are also involved.</p><p>In contrast to Germany, Austria does not have a Federal Nature Conservation Act, as nature conservation remains a sole competence for the provinces.</p><p>However, when it comes to nationally significant projects, such as the national parks or the Green Belt, the federal government assumes its responsibility. It offers non-material and financial support to these projects and institutions.</p><p>Already since 2005, the ministry has had the patronage of \"Das Gr\u00fcne Band \u00d6sterreich\" (Green Band Austria) and continues to finance National Focal Point and Naturschutzbund Austria in their activities. The ministry also supports membership and cooperation via the environment ministry in the Green Belt Association.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Intensive agriculture, including in Austria, has been criticised as an obstacle to the preservation of the Green Belt. What is your position on this?</emphasis></p><p>The so-called 'Illmitz Declaration', which was signed on 19 August 2019, strongly expresses the principle of sustainable use of our natural resources. With my and the signatures of all five nature conservation state ministers involved (Upper Austria, Lower Austria, Burgenland, Styria and Carinthia), a commitment was made. We committed to preserve the special natural environment and to develop green infrastructure further.</p><p>It is essential to preserve the enrichment of biological diversity that has been gained and to make future projects in the fields of infrastructure and tourism sensible. It is also crucial to continue sustainable forms of management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Green Belt connects 24 countries. How do member states of this initiative deal with coordination? In other words: How do they deal with the language barrier, different legislatures, different interests, different financial possibilities?</emphasis></p><p>Ten pan-European conferences have already been organised, and several projects have been carried out, including with the support of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p><p>The working language is always English.</p><p>When it comes to projects, the differences in financial possibilities and legal structures are well-considered. There are excellent opportunities for rural development at the EU level, including with the help of funding schemes such as Interreg and LIFE.</p><p>Regular meetings of nature conservation experts and joint projects are essential to strengthen the feeling of togetherness. Moreover, the Green Belt Association, in which Austria is also represented, was founded in 2015. The association aims to optimise the structure and organisation of the initiative and ensure that all activities take place within a coordinated framework.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-508720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-7C31-JCF9-41X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Austria</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>EU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>European Union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Green Belt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Green Belt Initiative</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

President Karl-Heinz Lambertz described the report as an \"emergency call to all levels of government\" to work together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report by the IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), whose key findings were released by the UN on 6 May, reflects conclusions of scientists from around the globe derived from 15,000 academic studies. The report is frank and stark in its warnings. It states that biodiversity is declining at a rate unprecedented in human history, species are dying out at an ever faster pace, and humankind is \"eroding the very foundations of economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.\" </p><p>President Lambertz (BE/PES) said: \"Nature gives us life - and we are destroying it. Over the past half-century we have met the challenge of feeding a fast-growing global population with great success, but at great cost to the natural world. We need urgently to find a way to feed the world and ensure sustainable development, while restoring biodiversity. This crisis needs a shared response from all levels of government, including cities and regions. Together with tackling climate change, protecting biodiversity should move to the top of the EU's agenda. It is not too late to secure a biodiverse carbon-free world, but it needs concerted efforts and investment that delivers locally.\"</p><p>Roby Biwer (LU/PES), 1st Vice-Chair of the CoR's ENVE Commission and its rapporteur on biodiversity, said: \"Biodiversity should be considered the foundation for our health and well-being. It underpins the functioning of the ecosystems on which we depend; and because it constitutes the environment in which we live, we have to protect biodiversity, learning to live in harmony with our ecosystems.\" </p><p>Mr Biwer underlined that European voters understand the deep connection between biodiversity and climate action, citing a survey by Eurobarometer published on 6 May that found that \"two-thirds of Europeans totally agree that looking after nature is essential in tackling climate change.\"</p><p>The CoR is involved in the development of the post-2020 global and European policy framework for biodiversity. Recommendations adopted by the CoR in October 2018 insist - as does the IPBES report - on the need for Europe's cities and regions to become sustainable entities that conserve nature, restore biodiversity, maintain and enhance ecosystem services while meeting the critical needs of their populations. The CoR called for the development of an ambitious, time-bound, science-driven post-2020 EU Strategy on Biodiversity to save the diversity and abundance of life on Earth. It has also insisted on explicit recognition in EU and UN policies that local and regional authorities have an indispensable role to play in promoting biodiversity, and to provide cities and regions with the support they need. </p><p>Specific actions recommended by the CoR include: more cross-border green infrastructure and green corridors so that animals can pass from one place to another; strengthening local and regional governments' ability to combat invasive species; a greater role for municipal and regional authorities in ending wildlife trafficking; more research into ways to increase biodiversity in urban areas; and more funding for biodiversity work.</p><p><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newspress.fr/common/getImageEm.ashx?imid=32763&amp;emid=3359\">http://www.newspress.fr/common/getImageEm.ashx?imid=32763&amp;emid=3359</url><br/>Contacts<br/>Andrew Gardner<br/>Tel. +32 473 843 981<br/>andrew.gardner@cor.europa.eu</p><p>Nathalie Vandelle (FR, EN)<br/>Tel. +32 2 282 2499<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:nathalie.vandelle@cor.europa.eu\">nathalie.vandelle@cor.europa.eu</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN311463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-NKF1-F12G-X0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Integrated Municipal Stormwater and Wastewater Planning Approach Framework assists EPA regional offices, states, and local governments to develop voluntary storm and wastewater management plans and implement effective integrated approaches that will protect public health by reducing overflows from wastewater systems and pollution from stormwater. In developing the framework, the EPA worked in close coordination with a variety of stakeholders, including publicly owned treatment works, state water permitting authorities, local governments, and nonprofit environmental groups.</p><p>EPA's framework outlines new flexibility to pursue innovative, cost-saving solutions, like green infrastructure, and will help communities as they develop plans that prioritize their investments in storm and wastewater infrastructure.</p><p>The framework also highlights the importance of controlling and managing releases of storm and wastewater into the nation's waters. When wastewater systems, many of which are aging, overflow they can release untreated sewage and other pollutants into local waterways. These overflows can carry a variety of harmful pollutants that can threaten communities' water quality, including bacteria, metals, and nutrients, and can contribute to disease outbreaks, beach and shellfish bed closings, and fishing or swimming advisories. Stormwater discharges can also contain many of these pollutants, and municipalities are often faced with difficult choices about how to direct their funds to solve the most critical problems first.</p><p>The framework document is available on EPA's website, where the agency will also provide practical examples of how municipalities are implementing this approach, as they become available.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN255349</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55WD-5091-F12G-X1NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"311\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 14, 2012 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The two new operations demonstrate how crucial new investment in nature conservation across Europe can be unlocked by a well-designed financial instrument which makes EU financing go further for nature. The exciting range of projects already supported shows future partners how the joint engagement of the European Commission and European Investment Bank through the Natural Capital Financing Facility can better protect nature and improve economic opportunities said Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.</p><p>Unique financing available to support nature based investment across Europe</p><p>Companies, public authorities and local financial partners can all benefit from dedicated new financing to support nature-based investment.</p><p>The first three projects to receive investment from the Natural Capital Financing Facility will support activities in approximately 12 countries. The European Investment Bank is now looking to continue rollout of the Facility to support new projects covering a broad range of nature-focussed investment.</p><p>Following the successful roll-out of initial pilot projects under the Natural Capital Financial Facility covering activities in 12 countries. The European Investment Bank is looking to expand the impact of the initiative by supporting new projects covering a broad range of nature focused investment.</p><p>\"Encouraging investors to realise the business case for nature conservation is crucial for biodiversity and climate change adaptation across Europe. The Natural Capital Financing Facility is demonstrating the diverse benefit of pro-nature commercial investment and helping transformational initiatives in countries including Romania, Ireland and Croatia. The European Investment Bank is committed to supporting conservation finance and looks forward to working with new partners in the years ahead. We call on companies, public bodies and stakeholders considering nature focused investment to get in touch to see how financial support and technical expertise can be obtained.\" said Jonathan Taylor, Vice President of the European Investment Bank responsible for climate action and the environment.</p><p>First project to encourage Continuous Cover Forestry in Ireland</p><p>New investment in sustainable forestry across Ireland will be supported by the latest operation under the Natural Capital Financing Facility. Irish commercial forests are amongst the most productive in the world and the new scheme will enable global institutional investors to support a more sustainable forestry model.</p><p>\"The European Investment Bank is pleased to work with SLM Silva Fund to improve sustainable practices in Irish forests. The new EUR 12.5 million investment builds on the EIB's recent support for forestry and agriculture in the country and will demonstrate how best practice in Ireland's world-class forestry industry can take better account of the need to safeguard biodiversity, soils and landscapes, and help resist the threats associated with climate change.\" said  Andrew McDowell, Vice President of the European Investment Bank responsible for Ireland.</p><p>The SLM Silva Fund will work with commercial forest schemes across Ireland to encourage Continuous Cover Forestry. This provides an alternative to the predominant clear felling model that leaves bare hillsides and focuses on a narrow range of tree species, reducing habitat value and ecosystem health. Continuous Cover Forestry also enables productive forests which are more resilient to pests and diseases, as well as avoiding the negative impacts on soil and water resources of conventional practices.</p><p>\"Agriculture and forestry play a key role as custodians of natural capital and the agri-food sector is an essential and integral part of any solution to ultimately deliver natural capital imperatives for rural areas and society as a whole. This new forestry investment in Ireland, with participation of the EU's LIFE Programme and the European Investment Bank, shows how conservation considerations can be combined with commercial activity,\" said Phil Hogan, European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p><p>Successful partnership with national authorities to protect natural assets and enhance green growth</p><p>National financial institutions understand local investment challenges and priorities. A new EUR 15 million cooperation with the Croatian Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HBOR) under the Natural Capital Financing Facility is supporting new investment that will improve conservation of existing biodiversity, improve green infrastructure and strengthen resilience to climate change.</p><p>Technical and financial expertise from similar nature conservation focused projects elsewhere in Europe will strengthen investment in Croatia. A dedicated technical assistance programme is currently being rolled out that will ensure that HBOR can better identify natural capital projects with the greatest environmental impact and improve preparation of individual schemes by local businesses and public bodies.</p><p>HBOR is the first intermediary to benefit from both financing and technical preparations supported by the Natural Capital Financing Facility. This reflects Croatia's rich biodiversity and crucial role in nature conservation as one of the most diverse locations for plant diversity anywhere in Europe. 34% of nature areas in the country are protected under Natura 2000.</p><p>Croatian companies expected to benefit from new financing include firms engaged in sustainable agriculture, commercial forestry operations and tourism.</p><p>Supporting conservation and local companies in 30 projects across Europe</p><p>The diverse scope of green investment and nature-based projects that can be supported under the Natural Capital Financing Facility has been highlighted by support for 30 different schemes in partnership with Rewilding Europe Capital (REC), Europe's first dedicated financier of conservation and rewilding enterprises.</p><p>New investment in a diverse range of projects, including flood protection, rainwater recycling, programs to protect forests and reduce water and soil pollution, biodiversity offsets, and eco-tourism have demonstrated the potential for long-term investment by private and public partners in schemes traditionally perceived as too challenging to be commercially viable.</p><p>Promoting dedicated investment in nature based solutions in urban areas</p><p>Financing backed by the Natural Capital Financing Facility is not restricted to rural regions.
