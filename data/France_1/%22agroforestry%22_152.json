A fully functioning global voluntary carbon market (VCM) could not only generate attractive returns on investment in African countries but also help them meet their own environmental challenges, from boosting renewable power to adopting cleaner cooking methods to reducing deforestation.</p><p>Fatal missteps</p><p>Unfortunately, that potential is far from being realised. The organisations we represent - focused on speeding the energy transition, ending energy poverty and addressing climate change- have launched an initiative to foster integrity (high-quality carbon credit generation and exchange) in the voluntary carbon market by establishing a concrete action plan to stimulate the production of quality carbon credits across the continent at scale. We believe that missing out on this opportunity would be a tragic error for Africa and a setback for the global effort to curb climate change.</p><p>Globally, VCMs have grown strongly in the last five years. Last year saw a greater than 50 per cent increase in real demand (as measured by the retirement of existing carbon credits), and the value of carbon credit transactions exceeded $1bn for the first time. But of the total credits issued between 2015 and 2021, only about 11 per cent stem from African countries, and the bulk of these come from a few large projects.</p><p>This is just scratching the surface. We estimate Africa could generate over 2Gt of CO2 (based on existing methodologies) - and at $20/tonne CO2, this could be worth over $45bn.</p><p>Consider, for example, the opportunity to generate credits through investment in energy transition, such as by replacing diesel generators with distributed renewable energy or switching from wood fires to clean cookstoves. As projects like these scale, revenues earned can go towards additional development priorities such as expanding access to clean and affordable energy, supporting the protection of water catchment areas thus building resilience in hydropower projects and creating jobs through economic development.</p><p>Some innovative projects already underway demonstrate what success could look like.</p><p>Creating victory</p><p>SunCulture is a climate-tech platform for rural emerging markets that has raised $40m to provide smallholder farmers with reliable access to water, irrigation, lighting and mobile charging through off-grid solar technology. Their solar irrigation systems allow farmers in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African markets to switch from CO2-emitting petroleum and diesel pumps to solar pumps for irrigation and create sustainable jobs in agriculture less dependent on rainfall.</p><p>SunCulture is working on developing its carbon credit business to reduce end-user prices and increase accessibility to the systems - SunCulture has received validation under Verra standards and the project is estimated to generate a total of over 2 Mt of CO2 emissions reduction over the period 2020-2027.  SunCulture has the ambition to scale across several other sub-Saharan African countries in the next years, reaching hundreds of thousands of solar pumps sold by 2025.</p><p>KOKO Networks is 'the technology platform protecting African forests'. KOKO is driving an energy transition across Kenya, replacing deforestation-charcoal with sustainable bioethanol delivered via a unique utility platform that resembles a mobile telco in scale and sophistication.  Over 600,000 households now cook with KOKO Fuel, with carbon revenues solving the affordability gap instead of government subsidies.</p><p>Potential in the continent</p><p>In addition to energy projects, Africa, with its vast forests, has a significant share of the global nature-based solution potential. Estimates suggest that just 11 African countries could provide 15 per cent of global NCS by 2030, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone potentially contributing 5 per cent.  One of the largest REDD+ projects in Africa and the first to issue third-party-verified REDD+ credits is the Kasigau Corridor, which seeks to protect endangered species, prevent forest degradation and drive direct climate finance to local communities for self-determined, transformative economic development in a fragile region of Kenya.</p><p>In partnership with local communities, Wildlife Works has co-created new economic opportunities, increased food and water security, and improved access to healthcare and education to relieve deforestation pressure on the project area. The Kasigau Corridor covers over 500,000 acres of dryland forest and generates carbon credits to offset 1m tonnes of CO2 emissions annually for the next 30 years.</p><p>The Acorn agroforestry platform established by a Dutch financial institution encourages small farmers in a number of African countries to plant trees on their land, to improve soil quality and extract CO2 from the atmosphere. It uses satellite data to measure biomass on participating farms and rewards increases by issuing certified Carbon Removal Units (CRUs) that can be bought by companies, like Microsoft, seeking to offset their emissions.</p><p>A number of factors are holding back the wider adoption of carbon credit projects across the continent. First, the ecosystem of project developers is very limited in scale and scope: 65+ per cent of project developers in Africa operate only one project and 80 per cent operate in only one country. Second, navigating land rights for NCS projects can be challenging. Third, and partly as a result, it can be expensive to validate and verify individual projects. And fourth, market mechanisms to de-risk investment in supply have not been developed.</p><p>Future focus</p><p>Our joint initiative aims to develop a structured approach to address each of these issues. As neutral players in this space, we aim to define a roadmap for voluntary carbon markets in Africa - as an accelerant, not a competitor, to existing work.</p><p>By the time of the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt this November, we hope to have achieved agreement on the overall ambition for VCMs in Africa, partnered with African governments and developed a concrete roadmap, including a set of lighthouse projects, for the years ahead.</p><p>The potential of these efforts to strengthen African economies and advance the global fight against climate change, while driving important development priorities such as energy access and energy transition, should not be underestimated. If successful, they will radically reduce the time it takes to generate credits, increase the underlying quality of African carbon credits while enabling them to command a premium price, and significantly increase the volume of credits. The time to act is now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT150920220000502</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66D6-CX41-JCH9-G2K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1180\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 15, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The country's environment minister, Ruslan Strilets, is resolute in holding Russia accountable for the devastating impact of the war on the region's natural environment.\u00a0</p><p>\"Our state is a habitat of about 74,000 species of flora and fauna. By destroying our home, Russia is also destroying their home. Russian occupiers are trying to destroy all of Ukraine, thus endangering more than a third of Europe's biodiversity,\" Strilets said <url normalizedValue=\"https://geographical.co.uk/science-environment/the-cost-of-war-in-ukraine#:~:text=One%2Dthird%20of%20the%20country's,natural%20resources%20into%20military%20bases.\">during his speech</url> in Montreal at COP15.\u00a0</p><p>To date, 2,369 consequences of military actions with a severe negative impact on the environment have been registered on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecozagroza.gov.ua/en\">EcoZagroza</url> platform, set up by the ministry and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to collect reports of environmental damage.\u00a0</p><p>Due to the war, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecozagroza.gov.ua/en/news/108\">20% of protected natural areas</url> were damaged, and approximately 80 animal species are at risk of extinction. Russians have taken control of 10 national parks, eight reserves, and two biosphere reserves, and in some of these areas, they are permitting the hunting of protected animals.</p><p>Among the many environmental casualties of the war are dolphins, with hundreds of them found dead along the shores of the Black Sea.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/ukraine-black-sea-dolphin-deaths-russia-war-1850279402\">Scientists have attributed this</url> to several factors, such as the harmful effects of sonar, which damages their ability to hunt, as well as the usage of phosphorus incendiaries which causes burns on their bodies. Additionally, explosions caused by the conflict can result in dolphins experiencing embolisms and decompression sickness, leading them to rise to the surface.</p><p>A recent report\u00a0by the Kyiv School of Economics depicts a horrible situation where environmental pollution has risen sharply as hundreds of industrial enterprises and critical infrastructure sites have been damaged.</p><p>Forests have also suffered significant damage, with fires caused by ammunition explosions or deliberate arson related to warfare tactics. In addition, significant forest areas have suffered from mechanical damage caused by military manoeuvres and ammunition explosions, which leads to the weakening or death of forest plantations.</p><p>Some 298,000 hectares of forest and 1,438,000 hectares of grass fires were recorded in the combat zone, which, together with the burning of oil products, caused significant air pollution estimated at\u00a05.5 million tonnes of pollutants since the start of the war.</p><h>Holding Russia accountable</h><p>Ukrainian authorities have drawn attention to the environmental damage caused by the war since its very beginning. If the country succeeds in its attempt to recognise ecological damage, this could set a precedent for reinforcing an international mechanism against environmental crimes in military conflicts.</p><p>However, building a case against Russia in this sense is not easy, as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2023/environmental-accountability-justice-and-reconstruction-russian-war-ukraine\">explains</url>.</p><p>The International Criminal Court does not recognise ecocide as an international crime under the Rome Statute.\u00a0</p><p>While international humanitarian law does prohibit the employment of \"methods or means of warfare which are intended, or may be expected, to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment\", the absence of specific thresholds for these criteria, however, is a challenge when building a case.</p><p>There are also precedents of compensation for environmental destruction at international level. In 1991, the United Nations Security Council required Iraq to provide reparations for the devastation caused during its aggression towards Kuwait, including environmental damage and the exhaustion of natural resources.</p><p>However, due to Russia's veto power in the Security Council, this solution is not feasible in the current conflict, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\u00a0</p><p>And even if the European Union is now promising a '<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/AC_22_6385\">Marshall Plan for Ukraine</url>', restoring the biodiversity and ecosystems that have been devastated, cleaning up the polluted soil, water, and air, as well as addressing the CO2 emissions that are undermining climate goals, will likely require several decades, if not longer.</p><p>\"There can be no effective climate policy without peace on the Earth,\" said the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, during a speech at COP27.\u00a0</p><p>Perhaps now is a good moment to consider the inclusion of ecocide in the list of international crimes punishable under international law, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/parliament-adds-ecocide-to-eus-draft-list-of-environmental-crimes/\">similar to what is currently being considered in the EU</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Valentina Romano\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Today's edition is powered by Fediol</emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0EU grain and oilseeds sector encourage the legislators to cover important</p><p>and needed adjustments to make the Directive legally clear, fit for purpose, and</p><p>effective in combatting adverse environmental and human rights impacts of</p><p>business operations.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://eurac.tv/9WqJ\">Find out more &gt;&gt;</url></p><h>Top stories</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Summit-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/north-sea-countries-aim-for-300-gw-of-offshore-wind-energy-by-2050/\">North Sea countries aim for 300 GW of offshore wind energy by 2050</url></h><p>Nine European countries signed the Ostend Declaration on Monday (24 April), aiming to jointly produce at least 120 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030 and at least 300 gigawatts by 2050 in the North Sea.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/Hansen-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/campaigners-hail-historic-day-as-parliament-adopts-eu-anti-deforestation-law/\">Campaigners hail 'historic' day as Parliament adopts EU anti-deforestation law</url></h><p>The European Parliament voted on Wednesday (19 April) in favour of a landmark regulation\u00a0to ensure that products sold in the EU do not come from deforested or degraded land.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/11421116-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/german-government-adopts-fossil-boiler-ban-starting-2024/\">German government adopts fossil boiler ban, starting 2024</url></h><p>The German government has adopted a law that would see new fossil heating installations banned from 2024, following a month-long row over the level of state support and pushback from business-friendly FDP lawmakers.</p><h>The Capitals - editor's pick</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LJUBLJANA.

The cost of protecting forests at high risk of deforestation by 2030 would be more than $130 billion per year, according to a new study by the global Energy Transitions Commission (ETC).\u00a0</p><p>The ETC's new report, 'Financing the transition: the costs of avoiding deforestation', estimates the order of magnitude of concessional and grant payments required to compensate landowners for not cutting down tropical forests for profit (e.g., to raise cattle or grow commodities). Currently, the domestic and international total amount of finance destined at protecting forests is just $2-3 billion a year, the report finds.\u00a0</p><p>The estimated required amount of $130 billion is simply too substantial, and it is not reasonable to assume that concessional and grant payments on such a massive scale, which would be funded by corporations through voluntary carbon markets, philanthropy, and high-income countries, will ever materialise, the ETC says.\u00a0</p><p>To halt deforestation, the report argues that a combination of financial and non-financial actions is required, including a reduction in consumer demand for the main products that make deforestation profitable - such as meat - and the development of alternative businesses which can profit from standing forests - for instance, eco-tourism and sustainable agroforestry. Additionally, governments have the responsibility to make deforestation illegal, combining this with effective enforcement.\u00a0</p><p>\"Without a significant flow of concessional/grant payments, any reduction in deforestation will come too late to make it possible to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C, let alone to 1.5\u00b0C. But finance alone cannot deliver an end to deforestation,\" commented Adair Turner, Chair of the Energy Transitions Commission.

Renewable energy production does not necessitate a considerably greater amount of metals than fossil fuels, a recent study conducted by Berlin-based NGO PowerShift says. On the contrary, certain renewable energy technologies, including solar PV systems, exhibit substantially improved performance in terms of their metal footprint when compared to fossil fuel power plants.</p><p>Mining has a huge environmental impact, causing conflicts over water and land use, pollution, and the destruction of rainforests, and is also responsible for around 10 to 15% of global CO2 emissions, PowerShift says.\u00a0</p><p>To address this, a \"raw material transition\" is needed, says the study, titled 'Metals for the Energy Transition'. \"This means, first, that metallic raw materials, including those needed for renewable energy technologies, must be mined under the highest possible environmental and social standards. In addition, it is essential to reduce the absolute consumption of metallic raw materials, for example through sector-specific targets,\" says Michael Reckordt, PowerShift's raw materials expert.</p><p>Alongside this, the expansion of a circular economy with a focus on durability, repairability, and product design geared toward the recycling of raw materials will be key. This is because many solar and wind power plants in Germany will be replaced in the next few years, resulting in large quantities of recycled scrap from this industry.

According to environmentalists, this creates a \"carbon debt\" that can take decades to pay back as new trees are planted and suck an equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere.</p><p>For others, the cycle of planting and cutting trees is part of sustainable forest management practices which should be regarded as carbon neutral - or even carbon negative in cases where planted areas are expanding. And with climate change taking its toll on forestry ecosystems, the active management of forests will become all the more necessary, they argue.</p><p>Whichever path the European Commission chooses, it will likely meet with heavy criticism.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/win-win-or-lose-lose-eu-scientists-highlight-two-faced-bioenergy-policies/\">'Win-win or lose-lose': EU scientists highlight two-faced bioenergy policies</url></h><p>Around 14% of bioenergy used in Europe is of unknown origin, according to an EU report, which highlights the need to improve the tracing of wood burned for electricity production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The 'right biomass'</emphasis></p><p>The executive's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, has already nailed his colours to the mast, saying biomass will be necessary to help Europe meet its renewable energy targets.</p><p>\"Without biomass, we're not going to make it.

Or, in production forests, you never use 100% of a tree. There's maybe close to 20% of the tree that you can't use for construction or other industries,\" he explained.</p><p>But there is concern about whether all the biomass used in Europe will fall under the Commission's definition of what Timmermans calls \"the right biomass.\"</p><p>Only last week, Greenpeace released a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/issues/nature-food/45765/eu-renewables-rules-destroying-estonias-forests/\">report</url> criticising Europe's rules around what type of biomass is counted as contributing towards its renewable energy targets, saying these have led to the destruction and degradation of Estonian forests.</p><p>Environmental NGOs are calling for drastic changes to the sustainability criteria for biomass spelled out in the EU's renewable energy directive, which is coming up for a revision on Wednesday. According to WWF, there needs to be meaningful restrictions on the role of bioenergy.</p><p>\"Fighting the climate emergency without changing the EU's biomass rules is like trying to bail out a boat with a hole in the bottom. To plug the gap, we must limit incentives under the renewable energy directive to fast-decaying wastes and residues with no other uses,\" said Alex Mason, senior policy officer at WWF.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/emissions-trading-scheme/news/scientists-call-on-eu-to-correct-biomass-carbon-accounting-rules/\">Scientists call on EU to 'correct' biomass carbon accounting rules</url></h><p>Europe's academies of science have called on EU lawmakers to introduce a \"radically new standard\" in the bloc's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to ensure net carbon emissions from biomass power stations are \"properly accounted for and declared\".</p><p>Meanwhile, the industry argues that the sustainability criteria for biomass under the renewable energy directive are still fit for purpose and should not be changed.</p><p>Reopening it is troublesome for the industry, especially as the current criteria, set up in 2018, is facing delays in being rolled out, said Giulia Laura Cancian, policy director at Bioenergy Europe, a trade organisation.</p><p>\"If they remain as they are right now [in leaked draft legislation], they could cause disruptions in the market especially for small operators that will be confronted with impossible red tape and retroactive measures,\" she warned.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Balancing economy and climate in forestry</emphasis></p><p>The industry has also voiced concern about the forest strategy, also due to be released on Wednesday, that will decide the future of Europe's forests.</p><p>Ideas contained in a leaked draft of the strategy promote a hierarchy that is biased against bioenergy, the industry says.</p><p>\"Bioenergy was not perceived as one of the pieces of the puzzle that works in synergy with the rest of the forest sector,\" Cancian told EURACTIV.</p><p>Worries are also being expressed in the European Parliament.

Scientists say leaders face a crucial challenge: agreeing on a common way forward to safeguard biodiversity by 2030 in order to preserve plant and animal life and help combat climate imbalance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildlife populations have fallen by 69 percent globally in the past 50 years, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said in an October 2022 report. At the same time, land degradation \u2013 including deforestation, soil erosion and loss of natural areas \u2013 now affects up to 40 percent of the Earth's land and half of humanity, according to the UN. These alarming figures are the backdrop for the COP15 conference on biodiversity that began on December 7 in Montreal with an ambitious objective: to agree a new global framework for safeguarding the natural world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The stakes are crucially high: we are currently living through a biodiversity crisis,\" says Philippe Grandcolas, entomologist and research director at France's National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). \"Biodiversity is essential to human survival. It ensures that we can feed ourselves, have access to drinking water, and it plays a major role in our health. But, above all, biodiversity plays an indispensable role in the stability of the planet.\"</p><p>At present, 70 percent of ecosystems around the world are in a state of degradation, largely due to human activity \u2013 a rate of decline described as \"unprecedented and dangerous\" by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).</p><p>In addition, more than 1 million species are threatened with extinction. Vertebrates, which include mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians and make up five percent of all animal species, are especially under threat. \"Our previous report found that there had been a 68 percent fall among the total [vertebrate] population [over 50 years],\" says Pierre Cannet, director of advocacy and campaigns at WWFFrance. In 2022 that figure has risen to 69 percent. \"Losing one percent in two years is massive. For species that already have small populations, it could mean extinction.\"</p><p>Climate imbalance: A growing threat </p><p>According to the IPBES, the most significant driving factor of the \"biodiversity crisis\" is change in how land is used and fragmentation of natural space, most often due to agriculture. This is followed by overfishing, hunting and poaching. There is a tie for third place between climate imbalance, pollution and invasive species.</p><p>\"In the majority of cases there are multiple factors at play,\" says Grandcolas. \"But climate imbalance is becoming the most significant threat. The more it escalates, the more it disturbs ecosystems and has an impact on flora and fauna.\"</p><p>There are plenty of examples of this impact. In the past 30 years elephant populations in African forests have fallen by 86 percent. The main causes are poaching and black market trade, causing the death of 20,000 to 30,000 elephants per year, according to the WWF. But repeated cycles of drought and flood are also having an impact on access to fresh water \u2013 a vital resource for the species as each animal consumes around 150 to 200 litres per day. Without it their survival is at risk.</p><p>Similarly, leatherback sea turtles in Suriname have seen their populations fall by 95 percent in 20 years. This is due in part to destruction of their habitat caused by human intervention and illegal fishing. But climate instability is also disrupting their reproduction rates as sea level rise has destroyed and disrupted turtle nesting beaches.</p><p>Mass deaths </p><p>\"Currently there are a few species that are classed having climate change as the reason for their extinction,\" says Camille Parmesan, research director at CNRS and author of the first report of its kind on the links between climate change and biodiversity, produced by IPBES and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021. Yet this is the reason for the demise of the Bramble Cay melomys: \"a species of little rodent that lived on the small islands between Australia and Papua New Guinea. Scientists proved that their disappearance was due to their habitat being submerged [by the sea],\" Parmesan says.</p><p>\"We have also noted the disappearance of 92 amphibian species, killed by the growth of a type of fungus. We have proof that it developed due to climate instability which modified ecosystems and created the right conditions for it to thrive.\"</p><p>The number of species that are officially classed as having died out due to climate instability may be low, but increasing extreme weather events are causing mass deaths among mammals, birds, fish and trees. \"In Australia, we counted 45,000 flying fox deaths [a type of bat] in a single day during a heatwave\", Parmesan says. In France, record summer heat in 2022 caused temperatures in the Mediterranean Sea to rise to levels that killed thousands of fish and shellfish.</p><p>&gt;&gt; Biodiversity: Ocean 'dead zones' are proliferating due to global warming</p><p>Yet, disappearing species is not the only consequence of climate change. \"We can also add behaviour changes, notably migrations induced by climate modifications,\" Parmesan adds. \"Certain species try to move to [new] habitats that are more favourable but this can cause even more disruption in ecosystems.\"</p><p>Biodiverse carbon storage </p><p>Shrinking biodiversity also has multiple consequences on human life. In some parts of the world it can disrupt economies reliant on fishing or hunting and negatively impact the tourism industry.</p><p>\"It's a vicious circle. Biodiversity is a victim of global warming, but it is also one of the major tools to fight against it\", says S\u00e9bastien Barot, researcher at French public research institution Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD).</p><p>From plant life to animal species, individual elements of the natural world all contribute to regulating and supporting the environment as a whole. Bardot says, \"water and earth play a role in filtering pollution, and bumblebees are essential for plant reproduction\".</p><p>But when one element is compromised the rest can suffer too. \"The survival of the planet depends on a fine balance,\" says Grandcolas. \"Imagine a group of frogs suddenly die in a habitat. As insignificant as that may seem, it will have an impact: by disappearing they modify the conditions of the environment. This could allow other species to develop, damage plant life and lead to progressive destruction of the ecosystem, which will then no longer be able to play its role as a climate regulator.\"</p><p>Nowhere is this more evident that with carbon storage. Scientists estimate that the earth and sea currently absorb almost 50 percent of C02 created by human activity. \"Forests, wetlands, mangrove swamps and even deep water are real C02 sinks. When they disappear, emissions are released into the atmosphere,\" Barot says.</p><p>Consequently, \"when we see a forest burn, we are watching a carbon sink disappear\", says Grandcolas. In this way, \"[the presence of] plant life has an obvious impact on the climate.\"</p><p>Two crises, one solution? </p><p>Experts agree on the need to tackle both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis at the same time. \"We tend to treat them as separate entities, but they go hand in hand,\" says Grandcolas. \"They should be seen as a joint struggle with equal importance. For this to happen, we need to give nature the space it deserves.\"</p><p>Scientists and the WWF have called for more nature-based solutions for both issues. One of the most prominent is increasing protected habitats, which currently make up 17 percent of land and eight percent of ocean globally. \"We need to increase that to 30-50 percent of the planet,\" says Grandcolas. A significant step towards this goal, he adds, would be better global policies for fighting deforestation as preserving forests has the potential to both protect biodiversity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>\"There are also many things to consider in terms of agriculture,\" says Barot. \"We need agriculture systems that are more durable such as developing agroecology and agroforestry. We can improve how cultivated land is managed and limit use of fertilizer \u2026 which would help both biodiversity and the climate.\"</p><p>\"Protection alone is no longer enough; 70 percent of land is now in a degraded state,\" Parmesan adds. \"It is essential to put stronger policies in place for restoring ecosystems. That would enable us to recreate habitats for animals and plants, and the climate benefits would follow.\" For this to be successful a holistic approach is needed. \"There's no point planting trees purely to compensate for carbon emissions,\" Parmesan says. \"It needs to be done with respect for balance in the ecosystem. Big plantations filled with monocultures are not good for biodiversity or for the climate because they are more vulnerable to climate risks.\"</p><p>The three scientists estimate that nature-based solutions could provide around a third of necessary climate mitigation measures even if other steps, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, must come from changes in human behaviour.</p><p>Many such solutions are up for discussion at the COP15 biodiversity conference. Even so, other issues \u2013 namely money \u2013 may dominate. Supported by 22 other countries, Brazil has requested that rich nations provide \"at least $100 billion per year until 2030\" to developing countries in order to finance nature protection initiatives. The request is yet to receive a response.</p><p>This article was adapted from the original in French.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-100231990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:672K-9T61-JDJN-60HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

We are excited to scale up carbon markets with our technology and onboard millions of farmers around the world to help them monetize their carbon, and give investors access to this fast-growing asset class.\"</p><p>Earthbanc has been tapped by the African Development Bank to demonstrate the issuance of the world's first Sustainable Land Bond with fully audited carbon removal on the Earthbanc platform, at the UNCCD COP15 in Africa, May 2022. Solving carbon removal auditing issues with its AI technology is helping attract corporate carbon buyers and investors, unlocking the USD 14 billion pledged at COP26 for the Great Green Wall - an African-led and UNCCD sponsored program. Earthbanc is well-positioned to deliver climate finance and carbon credit services to this 156M hectare mega-project that will sequester 250M tonnes of carbon, estimated to generate USD ~7.25B in credit revenue for local farmers and carbon service providers.\u00a0</p><p>Regen Network Development Inc CEO, Gregory Landua, said: \"Regen Network invests in the best regenerative finance (ReFi) ventures to scale faster. The Earthbanc platform is built for the next 1 billion people coming out of poverty through regenerative agriculture, carbon payments, and regenerative payments - enabling capital to flow where it's needed to achieve planetary regeneration and stabilize the climate. The Earthbanc app will provide a carbon bank with accessible on and off fiat ramps for users globally, particularly for the unbanked, bringing the next billion users into the regenerative finance revolution.\"</p><p>Nicole Small, Investment Director at Rampersand VC: \"The Earthbanc team has extensive experience in regenerative finance markets,\u00a0 with a demonstrated capability and commitment to the community and environment. Earthbanc's tier-one relationships with leading NGOs, together with proprietary automation and remote sensing technology, deliver huge value in the fast-growing climate finance and nature-based solution (NbS) carbon markets. Equally important is that Earthbanc provides a win-win outcome to farmers through global carbon market access and meaningful carbon sequestration projects.\"</p><p>About Earthbanc</p><p>Earthbanc is pioneering a super cost-effective and precise carbon credit and finance platform. On the Earthbanc platform, you can purchase fully audited carbon credits, or choose to invest in carbon removal.

Ten years after the fall of Libyan President Gadhafi, governments across the Sahel have been faced by an unequal struggle against violent insurgents. Military collaboration has been put under strain, and the institutions for managing government administration have been rendered ever-more fragile.\u00a0</p><p>The immense effort in blood and money made by the region's armies and their western partners to suppress armed insurrections will have no end unless accountable government and broad-based development draws oxygen away from these insurgencies.</p><p>Tackling the combination of socio-economic-environmental challenges present in the Sahel is urgent. Doing so demands understanding the root causes, which include restoring the viability of the landscapes in which farmers and herders seek to make a living. Across the region, the incomes of farmers and herders remain amongst the lowest in the world, and young people are leaving rural areas in ever-greater numbers.\u00a0</p><p>While the Sahel has seen significant progress on health and education, overall progress with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been patchy, with the state absent from many areas. Low land productivity has been exacerbated by uncertain rights to land and natural resources, and rising environmental stresses, further exacerbated by more volatile patterns of rainfall. Yet agroforestry and agroecology could help build resilient crop and livestock production in these regions.</p><p>One year ago, in January 2021, a number of bilateral and multilateral donors committed over (EURO)14 billion to the Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative at the One Planet Summit hosted by President Macron of France. Having started as a simple campaign to plant millions of trees along the edge of the Sahara Desert, the GGW now espouses a thoughtful, mosaic approach, tailored to local context and recognising the power of local knowledge and expertise. Provided with these financial resources and a more integrated approach, the GGW could become utterly transformative, enable a rapid scaling-up of grassroots-led initiatives, and achievement of the SDGs.\u00a0</p><p>Many of the region's countries have begun to recognise the importance of regenerating their badly degraded landscapes, if only to fulfil their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the global climate change effort, agreed at Paris in 2015. Some nations have gone much further, such as Niger, which has strengthened local farmers' rights over land and trees, thus providing them with firmer incentives to invest in their resources.\u00a0</p><p>As we move towards the AU-EU Summit in this decisive year for strengthening Africa-Europe relations, the critical challenge for 2022 is to build a partnership to ensure this financial commitment to the GGW can do the greatest good across the region.\u00a0</p><p>This means encouraging initiatives at multiple scales, supporting concrete actions to restore productivity, and putting in place the policies to shift power, rights, funding and decision-making to local people. Practical examples of farmer-led approaches have successfully transformed landscapes in Niger, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, Sudan, Ethiopia and elsewhere.\u00a0</p><p>In each successful case, improved tenure and governance, usually backed with targeted technical and financial assistance, have encouraged the regeneration of trees, investments in soil fertility, and better management of grazing. This rapidly reverses land degradation and boosts productivity. In turn, it kickstarts a virtuous circle of development: the growing confidence farmers and pastoralists feel in their tenure of land, trees and grazing prompts them to invest in simple measures to grow more crops and protect valuable trees and shrubs. This generates new jobs within and outside agriculture, encouraging young men and women to stay home and develop their communities.\u00a0</p><p>Alongside the hard work of local people, governments must also invest in public infrastructure in rural areas, in roads and better telecoms coverage, and in essential health and education services. In stark contrast to the very mixed impacts from large-scale agricultural investments in the region, the benefits from institutional, technical and economic investment in local communities are well-established and positive.</p><p>Governments across the Sahel need to show their people they can listen to, learn about, and support local people's priorities. Now is the time to rebuild land and livelihoods in the Sahel and strategic partners, including the European Union must demonstrate it can support a just rural transformation in the region.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Co-signed by:</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">H.E Mahamadou Issoufou</emphasis>, former President of Niger, President of the Mahamadou Issoufou Foundation, Champion of the Great Green Wall and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and member of the Africa-Europe Foundation (AEF) High Level Panel of Personalities;\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chrysoula Zacharopoulou</emphasis>, MEP, co-chair of the Africa-Europe Foundation (AEF) strategy groups and co-chair of the COVAX council initiative;</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Catherine Chabaud</emphasis>, MEP and French sailor.\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1713519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64T1-8GK1-JCF9-42B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 16, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>AU-EU summit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Great Green Wall</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>infrastructure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sahel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sustainable Development Goals</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSB8</classCode><className>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001456</classCode><className>REBELLIONS &amp;

Why aren't they being converted to cultivate crops? The potential seems enormous, but \"urban farming\" is still in its infancy. EURACTIV Germany<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.de/section/landwirtschaft-und-ernahrung/news/urban-farming-gehoert-die-zukunft-dem-feld-auf-dem-dach/\">reports</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Salad from the roof of the supermarket or tomatoes from the facade of a high-rise building? What sounds like fiction is already reality in some cities, albeit on a small scale. Urban farming is not a new concept, but one that has hardly been exploited to date.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cultivating fruits and vegetables could experience a boom in the coming decades. After all, the human population is growing rapidly and is increasingly settling in cities. More than half of this population is already living in cities, and by the middle of the century, around 66% of people are expected to be living in cities - out of a world population of 9.7 billion.</p><p>More food also means correspondingly more demand for farmland, but this already accounts for 42% of global land area.</p><p>Another problem is transport. According to the Fraunhofer Institute, around 12% of agricultural emissions are attributable to this alone.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/rewarding-farmers-for-ecological-services-could-help-protect-biodiversity/\">Rewarding farmers for ecological services could help protect biodiversity</url></h><p>As the World Summit on Biodiversity opens on Wednesday (30 September), new measures to halt its decline are being discussed, including the concept of payments for environmental services, which is currently widely debated in France and Europe. EURACTIV France reports.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Urban gardens for times of crisis</emphasis></p><p>Could urban farming be part of the solution? One thing is certain: The idea is not new. Until the 19th century, cultivating crops was common practice within cities. When they disappeared, private allotment gardens spread.</p><p>Interestingly, a new trend is emerging: self-sufficiency is booming in the city, especially in times of crisis.</p><p>Often with success, as the British example shows: During World War Two, the government launched the \"Dig for Victory\" campaign. As a result, up to 50% of fruit and vegetables were produced by the population in allotment gardens.</p><p>In Spain, during the economic crisis, the proportion of allotment plots and community gardens increased six-fold between 2006 and 2014.</p><p>Apart from private cultivation, however, there are hardly any places where agriculture takes place on a larger scale in cities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Roof gardens of the future use domestic heat and rainwater</emphasis></p><p>In Europe, urban farming is still in its infancy.</p><p>\"Every morning, I ask myself why not many more cities invest in it,\" says J\u00f6rg Finkbeiner, architect and co-founder of the Berlin network '<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dachfarmberlin.com/\">Dachfarm</url>.' The consortium consists of gardeners, agroscientists and architects, who together plan greenhouses for growing crops in the city.</p><p>However, Finkbeiner believes that this cannot be the case with urban farming, because most buildings are not statically suitable for it: \"If you put crops in tubs on a roof and water them, you can quickly achieve 300 kilograms per square meter. Most buildings can't support that.\"</p><p>Dachfarm, therefore, relies on roof structures that are as light as possible and are built on top of existing buildings. The plants grow either in substrates such as pumice, lava or compost, as these are much lighter than soil, or in hydroponic systems, where the nutrient supply is provided directly via a nutrient solution.</p><p>The glass gardens are designed to operate as efficiently as possible by using the waste heat from the building, collecting rainwater or recycling greywater from households.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/europe-revives-carbon-farming-but-without-access-to-carbon-markets/\">Europe revives carbon farming but without access to carbon markets</url></h><p>The concept of soil carbon sequestration, a\u00a0cornerstone of regenerative farming, is regaining strength as a key measure in both climate mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>With Dachfarm, we want to show that the increasing amount of pavement in cities and the loss of arable land do not contradict themselves, Finkbeiner told EURACTIV.de.</p><p>Other advantages are that roof gardens can be used to produce close to the consumer and \"on-demand,\" so to speak, eliminating long transport routes or the need to store food. But not every type of agricultural cultivation is structurally possible, Finkbeiner points out. Besides, there are many open questions particularly in terms of building codes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bologna and Amsterdam with great potential</emphasis></p><p>For supermarkets or restaurants, the own roof garden could be an attractive concept.</p><p>However, it is not worthwhile for everyone, because investment costs are still comparatively high and the food harvested in this way is more expensive.</p><p>A 2017 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_IDA(2017)614641\">study</url> by the European Parliament's Scientific Service (EPRS) also came to the same conclusion: urban agriculture is \"associated with considerable ecological, social and health benefits,\" but can increase biodiversity and counteract the heating of cities.</p><p>However, this is also associated with high operating costs, for example for electricity, and is in competition with other types of use, for example for solar energy systems. In addition, the report says, tensions between \"traditional and innovative farmers\" and an increase in land values are also concerns.</p><p>There are no reliable figures on how widespread urban farming is in the EU. However, according to the ERPS evaluation, the potential could be huge, depending on the city.</p><p>In Bologna, for example, more than three-quarters of the vegetables consumed there could be grown in roof gardens. In Amsterdam, where currently only 0.0018% of food is produced locally, up to 90% of the fruit and vegetables consumed could be grown.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/farmers-need-financial-reassurance-to-support-uptake-of-agroforestry/\">Farmers need financial reassurance to support uptake of agroforestry</url></h><p>In a clear nod to the strategic importance of agroforestry, the term has now cropped up in both the European Green Deal, the European Commission's roadmap for making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050, and the EU's flagship new food policy, the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Commission has no plans special funding</emphasis></p><p>These figures seem optimistic, as they would probably require strong political support. In the current EU Common Agricultural Policy, urban farming projects can theoretically be financed with funds from both pillars as well as from the European Social Fund and the Regional Development Fund, but this is at the discretion of the member states.</p><p>Further support is not in sight, as the Commission \"currently has no plans to coordinate strategies for urban agriculture beyond different levels of government,\" according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2020-001450-ASW_EN.html\">response</url> EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski gave in the European Parliament in May.</p><p>However, a planning <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/eupolicylab/portfolios/farmers-of-the-future/\">study</url> on the topic is currently being prepared. This should be completed this autumn.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Gerardo Fortuna/Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-580587</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YP-K7N1-JCF9-418J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 30, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>agriculture</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>urban farming</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Urban Gardening</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST000DRLX</classCode><className>URBAN AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRME</classCode><className>COMMUNITY GARDENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DSB8</classCode><className>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N541310MM</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000123</classCode><className>POPULATION GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00096VN</classCode><className>POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D8SX</classCode><className>EURO CRISIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

It will be dedicated to protecting biodiversity, and supporting land severely affected by natural disasters -- with the company citing the recent examples of Australia's ongoing bushfire crisis and the fires in the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires.</p><p>\"We are truly shocked and saddened to see the devastation from the recent fires that have destroyed beautiful landscapes, native wildlife and communities in different parts of the world,\" said Reinold Geiger, CEO of the L'Occitane Group. \"As responsible business leaders, we cannot just sit back and watch. We need to do our part to help rebuild a healthy ecosystem for the sake of the generations to come.\"</p><p>The fund, which will be financed by an internal donation campaign among the group's shareholders, will be used to respond to climate emergencies on an \"ad hoc\" basis as they unfold. An initial support fund of \u20ac400,000 has been pledged to finance long-term projects, with \u20ac200,000 set to be donated immediately to tree-planting and agroforestry schemes in Australia, in a bid to help restore its landscape over the next decade. The L'Occitane Foundation will select these projects alongside the company's agricultural engineers and its operational teams in the country.</p><p>L'Occitane Group -- whose beauty brands include L'Occitane en Provence, Elemis and Erborian, is not the only major beauty player currently strengthening its efforts to protect the environment.

The idea finally turned into a request for the allocation of funds from the water agencies,\" said Laurans.</p><p>Since February 2020, (EURO)150 million have indeed been mobilised by the French water agencies to pay for environmental services provided by farmers.</p><p>However, while the measure is quite innovative, its range is currently too small to have a real impact on biodiversity.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/germany-should-protect-moors-consume-less-meat-to-reach-eus-new-climate-targets-say-experts/\">Germany should protect moors, consume less meat to reach EU's new climate targets, say experts</url></h><p>In Germany, where agriculture is officially responsible for 6.3% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions, around 14 million tonnes of greenhouse gases must be saved in order to reach the Paris climate goals. But now that the EU climate targets are to be raised, what contribution can the agriculture sector make? EURACTIV Germany reports.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Interest at EU level?</emphasis></p><p>The future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will introduce new \"eco-schemes\", which, like the PES, aim to remunerate farmers engaged in sustainable practices.</p><p>\"These practices could include the implementation of environmentally friendly production systems, such as agro-ecology, agro-forestry and organic farming,\" according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/cap-reforms-compatibility-green-deals-ambition-2020-may-20_fr\">report</url> published by the European Commission.</p><p>It adds that the rural development framework also includes commitments on environmental and climate management, which aim to compensate farmers and other beneficiaries for voluntarily committing to sustainable practices.</p><p>Given that the implementation of PES remains complex, it is unclear whether such a measure could halt the decline of biodiversity across Europe.</p><p>\"If these schemes do not develop further, it is because they require a lot of work. PES model contracts are drawn up on a case-by-case basis and must be perfectly adapted to local circumstances,\" said Laurans.</p><p>\"It is very difficult to do this effectively and on a large scale. If you pay everyone a lump sum for something you don't have the power to control, it won't work,\" he added.</p><p>Another difficulty with this kind of payment system is its temporality. To have any form of real impact, such aid must be spread over long periods of time.</p><p>However, as Aur\u00e9lie Trouv\u00e9, an economist at AgroParisTech, pointed out in her <url normalizedValue=\"https://pouruneautrepac.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Note-sur-la-PAC-apr%C3%A8s-2020.pdf\">article</url>, \"the eco-scheme will have to follow strict rules. The aid must remain annual, decoupled from production and paid per hectare.\"</p><p>According to her, however, \"the European Court of Auditors stresses in its report that 'it is necessary to commit to several years to produce certain environmental and climatic benefits'.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">(EURO)20 billion per year for biodiversity</emphasis></p><p>Although it still needs to be fleshed out, the \"eco-scheme\" has opened the debate on the conditions for obtaining aid allocated under the CAP.</p><p>Moreover, the European Commission presented in May its <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/actions-being-taken-eu/eu-biodiversity-strategy-2030_fr#principaux-lments-de-la-stratgie-en-faveur-de-la-biodiversit\">ambitious biodiversity strategy</url>, which foresees a 50% reduction in the use of pesticides by 2030, the planting of three billion trees, the creation of protected areas representing at least 30% of the land and 30% of the seas in Europe, and all this with legally binding nature restoration objectives.</p><p>According to the Director of IDDRI's Biodiversity Programme, \"PES are not a panacea\" but \"interesting tools which must be accompanied by other measures.\"</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/farmers-need-financial-reassurance-to-support-uptake-of-agroforestry/\">Farmers need financial reassurance to support uptake of agroforestry</url></h><p>In a clear nod to the strategic importance of agroforestry, the term has now cropped up in both the European Green Deal, the European Commission's roadmap for making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050, and the EU's flagship new food policy, the Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-531023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YH-TJ71-DYXB-V004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1097\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 30, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>agriculture</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biodiversity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CAP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>eco-scheme</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>farmers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>France</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>payments for environmental services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>PES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Summit on Biodiversity</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

It provides them with a personalised action plan to help them decarbonise their farms.</p><p>Finally, the national action plan for adapting to climate change adopted in June aims to \"set a course for our agriculture and food system to collectively meet the challenge of our climate commitments and obligations\", according to Julien Denormandie.</p><p>One of the six major axes of this plan is to \"develop the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils and forest and agroforestry biomass\", in other words, carbon farming.</p><p>\"The agriculture-forestry-wood sector is of strategic importance for the climate by contributing to climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration\", the action plan reads.</p><p>Concretely, the ministry wants to develop measures to help increase ground cover and \"agroecological infrastructures\" such as hedges and support the development of Low Carbon methods through the label and carbon diagnostics.</p><p>Finally, the ministry announced it would look into ways of offering \"direct financial valorisation\" of farmers' actions favouring climate change mitigation using a study to be carried out this year.</p><p>Carbon compensation mechanisms \"could constitute an important additional lever for mobilising the agricultural sector in the national climate change mitigation effort\", the ministry stated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Developing soil life: a medium-term risk for a long-term benefit</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>\"We need positive feedback for farmers\", told EURACTIV Henri Bies-P\u00e9r\u00e9, vice-president of the main French farmers' syndicate FNSEA.</p><p>\"We're in favour of the government's Low Carbon strategy and are trying to turn it into an opportunity for farmers\", he added.</p><p>Bies-P\u00e9r\u00e9 explained that in the face of climate change, carbon farming could allow farmers to recover resilience and benefit from a \"new source of income\".</p><p>However, while \"we are aware that we need to advance because doing nothing is suicidal\", farmers could \"use a little helping hand\" with the necessary investments to adopt carbon farming measures.</p><p>Changing their ways represented a financial cost and a medium-term risk for farmers, he explained. He added that \"when we change things, we need to wait several years before finding a new equilibrium and seeing positive feedback on our investment\".</p><p>In this period, financial aid - in the form of compensation for environmental services or higher consumer prices -and a strong political framework were necessary to sustain farmers during their evolution.</p><p>A similar view is shared by Herv\u00e9 Mesnard, a French conservation farmer and professor of Agronomy at the University of Picardie Jules Verne.</p><p>\"We need to make a living; that's the purpose of the game\", Mesnard the owner of a Bayer reference farm, told EURACTIV. On his farm, he tests and explores different solutions put forward by the agrochemical giant to protect biodiversity and optimise farming practices.</p><p>To change an agricultural production system towards greener and more sustainable practices, \"you need to invest at a loss for several years\", he said, underlining that as a conservation farmer \"I take risks to work with nature, but if nature doesn't cooperate with me, I fall flat on my face\".</p><p>Young farmers starting out today need help to shoulder the risks and investments of the first years, according to Mesnard.</p><p>On the other hand, \"receiving a financial recompense or not doesn't change my personal vision: what I am doing is a long-term investment with the aim to one day be able to pass on a more healthy and productive land\", he explained.</p><p>\"With the deterioration of our climate, I realise that the approach I started taking 30 years ago is today bearing its fruits\", he continued.</p><p>\"Be it draught or excessive rainfalls, soil life protects us.

normalizedValue=\"https://www.birdlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CAP-report-eco-schemes-assessment-Nov2021.pdf\">report</url>, published on Tuesday (30 November) by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and BirdLife Europe, is the first attempt to systematically catalogue and assess the 166 eco-schemes currently proposed in 21 member states' national action plans across the EU.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Through these plans, EU countries will set out how they intend to meet the nine EU-wide objectives of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) while at the same time responding to the needs of their farmers and rural communities.</p><p>This includes an individually tailored list of so-called 'eco-schemes', a new instrument designed to reward farmers that choose to go one step further in terms of environmental care and climate action.</p><p>But it is currently unclear as to how EU countries will use this new policy instrument in their National Strategic Plans, the drafts of which are to be submitted to the Commission for approval by the end of the year.</p><h><url

Green Deal alignment 'unimaginable'</url></h><p>The EU's Agriculture Commissioner has said he does not foresee a situation where a member state's Common Agricultural Policy national plan would be rejected for failing to align with the Green Deal, banking instead on the power of persuasion.</p><p>While it is based only on drafts and currently available information, the new report gives an indication of the direction of travel for many EU countries and whether the (EURO)48.5 billion EU funding earmarked to be spent over 5 years in the post-2022 CAP is likely to pay dividends.\u00a0</p><p>According to the report, as they currently stand, member states' proposed eco-schemes will fall \"very short\" of expectations.\u00a0</p><p>National experts concluded that only 19% of eco-schemes are deemed likely to deliver on their stated environmental objectives, while 40% would need significant improvements to be effective and 41% are \"completely misaligned\".\u00a0</p><p>The assessment also concluded that many well designed schemes that are likely to deliver are either underfunded or likely to be outcompeted by less demanding and/or more financially attractive schemes.</p><p>Among the schemes listed as the worst examples included precision farming projects, which the report points out include no benchmarks or requirements for actual input reductions, and eco-schemes for no-till farming, which it warns \"do not have any safeguards on the use of herbicides\", including the hotly-debated glyphosate, nor requirements to apply crop rotations and constant soil cover.\u00a0</p><p>\"Not only does no-till have limited benefits as a standalone practice, but these schemes could even lead to increases in herbicide use, as the most common alternative strategy to ploughing for weed suppression,\" the report warns.\u00a0</p><p>It was also critical of a number of eco-schemes targeted towards intensive livestock production, which \"do not tackle the underlying drivers of pollution or excessive antimicrobial use\" and could become \"polluter-gets-paid\" subsidies for intensive animal farming, the report warns.</p><h><url

However, non-binding targets and national leeway might hinder the Commission's quest to keep track of results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'More greenwashing, more destruction, more problems'</emphasis></p><p>Speaking during a press conference on Tuesday (30 December), Jabier Ruiz, senior policy officer for agriculture and sustainable food systems at the WWF European Policy Office, said that the report underlined the \"utter disconnect\" between the Green Deal and the CAP reform.</p><p>Meanwhile, the EEB's policy officer for agriculture, C\u00e9lia Nyssens, pointed out that although there were some good schemes listed, including on agroforestry and soil health, these were few and far between.</p><p>She also reserved criticism for the \"piecemeal approach\" to these eco-schemes, highlighting that it is \"very unlikely\" that on their own single practices will deliver benefits.</p><p>\"The eco-schemes represent the largest pot of money the EU has to drive these changes, but as they stand, they will not deliver on any of these priorities,\" she said, adding that \"everyone loses\" from member states' business-as-usual approach.</p><p>Ariel Brunner, senior head of policy at BirdLife Europe, pointed out that eco-schemes have the potential to lead down the right path but that, as it stands, it appears that they will mostly lead to \"more greenwashing, more destruction and more problems.\"</p><p>Addressing concerns over the weak NSPs on Twitter, EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski argued that this CAP reform creates a \"full set of opportunities\" for the sector to become more friendly to the climate, environment and animal welfare, mainly thanks to the eco-schemes recommended by the Commission.</p><p>Pointing out that a lot rests on the level of ambition of the member states in their NSPs, he added that the EU executive \"will encourage and support member states to achieve a fairer and greener CAP\".</p><h><url

Welcomed by Abidjan and Accra, the system must prove that it works not only in theory, but also in practice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Has Nestl\u00e9 found a miracle solution that will help improve incomes for Ivorian cocoa farmers? This is the question on people's minds after the Swiss-based multinational presented an ambitious bonus scheme on 27 January. The programme is expected to benefit some 10,000 farming families in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire this year and then be extended to Ghana from 2024.</p><p>The two African countries account for about 70% of the world's bean production: Abidjan produces about 2m tonnes per year and Accra about 1m tonnes. Nestl\u00e9 achieved sales of 84.3bn CHF in 2020 ($91bn at the exchange rate in effect at the time of publication), of which 8.3% came from confectionery sales (Nestl\u00e9 brands, KitKat, Smarties, Aero...).</p><p>Speaking at a virtual conference attended by C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's prime minister Patrick Achi, Nestl\u00e9 CEO Mark Schneider said the new system is part of a wider plan to 'combat the risks of child labour' and 'achieve full traceability of cocoa'. Chocolate makers continue to be criticised for their use of underage labourers and a lack of transparency when it comes to sourcing for cocoa.</p><p>Over $1.1bn by 2030</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 has established four virtuous practices that it wants to encourage: children's education, using efficient agricultural techniques (including pruning), agroforestry (including planting shade trees) and crop diversification (combining cocoa production with that of cassava and/or livestock, poultry and beekeeping activities). For each of these, the group plans to pay 100 CHF ($109) per year to farmers who adopt them and a 100 CHF bonus if all four are implemented.</p><p>The maximum premium, which amounts to 500 CHF per year, will first be paid over two years and then halved in subsequent years. This represents a total commitment of '1.3bn CHF by 2030', or three times its 'current annual investment', says the group, whose aim is to reach a total of 160,000 families.</p><p>'Farmers who are members of the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan [the group's sustainable development plan launched in 2009] have an annual income of around 3,000 CHF per year, which is already higher than the average income of a farmer, which is around 2,000 CHF,' a Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson tells The Africa Report.</p><p>'The 500 CHF bonus, which represents an almost 20% increase in annual income, is an accelerator of change,' he says, reiterating that this financial package is in addition to the certification premiums and the decent income differential - this $400 bonus per tonne has been in place since the 2020-2021 season due to pressure from the Ivorian and Ghanaian authorities.</p><p>On paper, Nestl\u00e9's plan ticks many boxes. Presented with great fanfare, it adopts a global and responsible approach and is in line with the efforts made in recent years by the actors in the cocoa chain - chocolate makers, bean buyers and processors, certifiers and governments - to rebalance the relationship in favour of the farmers. Farmers receive only 6% of the $100bn generated each year worldwide by chocolate sales, according to the NGO Public Eye.</p><p>Welcomed by C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana, the Swiss group's project is also supported by several international partners, including the KIT Royal Tropical Institute, the International Cocoa Initiative, the Sustainable Trade Initiative and the NGO Rainforest Alliance. In addition, the proposed system was tested with 1,000 Ivorian farmers in 2020.</p><p>'The opinions and suggestions of farmers and farming cooperatives, as well as ongoing data collection and third-party evaluation, will be used to inform, readjust and improve the programme as it is extended to other communities,' says Nestl\u00e9.</p><p>One sector player praised the 'good foundations' of the project, which 'intends to create a new agricultural model based on the diversification of the producer's income, both in terms of sources of income and crops'. Nestl\u00e9's spokesperson cites another advantage of the project as the fact that mobile payment can be used to pay the premium, which will help guarantee transparency.</p><p>According to him, the financial transaction will be done via an electronic phone transfer from the Nestl\u00e9 supplier's account to the farmers and their wives so that women's empowerment can also be encouraged. This way, 'it is easy to verify and trace all payments from the supplier to the beneficiaries', he says.</p><p>A system that is still too opaque</p><p>However, several actors in the field remain concerned about the system's real impact. Although the Conseil Caf\u00e9-Cacao welcomes any initiative aimed at improving farmers' income, they are waiting to see how it will be implemented. The organisation points out that Nestl\u00e9 does not buy beans directly from cocoa farmers, but instead obtains them from intermediaries, including grinders. This makes tracing the beans and paying premiums more complicated.</p><p>'All the premiums and benefits granted to producers are currently channelled through cooperatives and exporters. However, studies conducted on this system show that it gives rise to significant cost losses, as much as 70%,' says Fran\u00e7ois Ruf, an economist at the Centre de Coop\u00e9ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD) based in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, who works with a team made up of around 10 researchers.</p><p>He believes that only a direct payment to the growers can improve the sector's transparency, as it would put pressure on the cooperatives to clarify their practices. However, this is not the path chosen by Nestl\u00e9, which, by entrusting its suppliers with the task of paying, is taking the risk of maintaining the current opaque practices that external controls find difficult to combat.</p><p>Tracing the origin of the beans remains a challenge. As the demand for chocolate is cyclical and concentrated at the end of the calendar year, cooperatives are forced to supply a large volume of beans over a short period. This means that they often turn to 'pisteurs' (intermediaries who buy the beans at the edge of the field from farmers and resell them to the cooperatives) in order to meet the quotas that buyers have imposed, without any guarantee of the brown gold's origin. Multinationals have been aware of this problem for a long time, but have done nothing to address it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT0802202200005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RG-SJH1-JCH9-G0TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1066\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 8, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In 2020, 94.4% of the wood used at the Kourou power plant was certified by the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). Voltalia has been asking its Kourou plant suppliers since 2019 to comply with PEFC standards.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Kourou biomass plant was the first French overseas power plant operating 100% on biomass to obtain this type of certification.</p><p>PEFC is a non-profit, non-governmental organization. With 330 million hectares of certified forest, PEFC is the world's largest forest certifier. Its certification criteria take into account the environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable forest management.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Voltalia confirms its environmental and social commitment, particularly within the Guyanese biomass sector where Voltalia commissioned a second biomass plant at the end of 2020, located in Cacao, while developing several future similar plants in the region. As the leading private player in the sector in Guyana, Voltalia also produces solar and hydraulic electricity there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More information</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biomass in French Guyana</emphasis></p><p>Thanks to its abundant forest resources, FrenchGuyana has a strong potential for producing electricity from biomass. This non-intermittent source of energy is highly beneficial for a region that suffers from significant electricity supply deficits. Voltalia is a major player in the wood energy sector in French Guiana, with more than 20 megawatts of installed biomass capacity by 2023. In addition to the Kourou plant (1.7 megawatts), which has been in operation for 10 years, the Cacao plant (5.1 megawatts) began operating in December 2020. They will be followed by the future Sinnamary (10.6 megawatts) and Iracoubo (5.1 megawatts) power plants, which are currently being developed. Voltalia's ambition is to meet the objectives of the FrenchGuyana's PPE (Pluriannual Energy Programme), namely the massive integration of renewable energies, including 40 megawatts of installed biomass capacity by 2023, and the region's energy autonomy by 2030 in order to replace conventional thermal power plants that are highly polluting and dependent on fossil fuel imports.</p><p>Biomass technology contributes to a virtuous environmental cycle by producing energy from sawmill waste, land clearing related to other activities (housing, urban, industrial or agricultural development included in the development plan of the Guyana...), recycled wood (end-of-life pallets...) or logging from sustainably managed forests. Their combustion in a boiler makes it possible to control the emission of harmful particles, unlike traditional burning techniques in the open air (more than 99% of fine particles are retained in the filtration systems). At the end of the cycle, the ash produced by the combustion can be applied to fields as a soil amendment improving soil acidity and providing some of the phosphorus requirement, thus replacing chemicals with the same properties. The development of the wood-energy sector has many positive consequences at the regional level, promoting sustainable and integrated growth.</p><p>\u00a0First of all, it helps to structure and economically strengthen the associated sectors of logging and timber industry (income generated by fuelwood which can represent 10 to 20% of the turnover of companies concerned). It also creates local jobs related to the operation of power plants. Other actors benefit from positive side effects, such as the future farmers in the Iracoubo basin who, on the one hand, will supply the local food market and, on the other hand, will earn a stable basic income by cultivating energy crops in agroforestry systems for the Iracoubo power plant.</p><p>Furthermore, biomass encourages innovation in French Guyana. A major example of this dynamic is the deployment of Triton's activity (Triton is a company belonging to Voltalia since end of 2019) to exploit the submerged forest of the Petit-Saut hydroelectric reservoir in order to supply the future Sinnamary power plant. This will be the world's first biomass power plant to receive wood from a submerged forest, exploited with a niche technology. The implementation of Triton's innovative method (SHARC\u00ae) will bring diversification and prospects to FrenchGuyana. It will also be associated with a virtuous biomass supply plan that respects the aquatic fauna of Petit-Saut. Indeed, until now, submerged logs stimulate the dissolution of mercury in water and their degradation in anoxic processes leads to carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Therefore, the extraction of the wood will have a direct positive impact on the lake ecosystem.</p><p>Next on the agenda: First half 2021 results, September 23, 2021 before market</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attachment</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ml-eu.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/f133a7a9-ca8c-4356-97d7-0ef2c7e8a362\">Certification PEFC Kourou Biomass Plant</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNWSEN-GNW1000532340en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNWSEN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63D7-51D1-F15W-N00V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222306</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><timeReceived>06:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Thomson Reuters Norway AS All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>GlobeNewswire - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61672\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 18, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Fortuna</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline><highlight><bodyText><p>The European Commission has unveiled the first list of environmentally friendly practices that could receive EU funding in the next Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the EU's farming subsidy programme.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/food-farming-fisheries/key_policies/documents/factsheet-agri-practices-under-ecoscheme_en.pdf\">list</url> aims to contribute to the debate around the CAP reform and its role in reaching the targets of the EU's Green Deal, a note from the Commission reads.</p><p>Eco-schemes are at the core of the green architecture of the Commission's CAP proposal and are designed to reward farmers for certain agricultural practice considered important in delivering environmental goals.</p><p>Alongside practices already established in EU policy instruments such as organic farming and Integration Pest Management (IPM), the list put a strong focus on agroecology practices and animal welfare.</p><p>Organic farming and IPM practices can both rely on existing legislative frameworks, respectively, the recently reformed <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2018.150.01.0001.01.ENG\">organic production and labelling of organic products regulation,</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0128\">directive on the sustainable use of pesticides,</url> meant to be overhauled in the coming years in the context of the Farm to Fork Strategy.</p><p>The F2F strategy, the EU's flagship sustainable food policy, contains a target for 25% of EU farmland to be farmed organically by 2030 and specifies that the Commission will put forward an action plan on organic farming to help member states stimulate both supply and demand for organic products.</p><p>The IPM practices are an important part of the EU's strategy to decrease farmers dependence on pesticides and involve an integrated approach to plant protection including sustainable biological and other non-chemical methods such as living organisms that are naturally pathogenic to or out-compete pests.</p><p>In February, the EU auditors recommended that the Commission should include IPM practices as a condition for receiving payments under the new CAP programme, but the Commission rejected the recommendation.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/integrated-pest-management-should-be-linked-to-cap-payments-say-auditors/\">Integrated pest management should be linked to CAP payments, say auditors</url></h><p>The European Commission has been unable to adequately measure and reduce either the effects or the risks from pesticides due to a lack of rigorous and suitable data, according to a new report from the European Court of Auditors, released on Wednesday (5 January).\u00a0</p><p>Agroecology and its younger sibling, agroforestry, have a prime position on the Commission's list, particularly when it comes to crop management and maintenance of landscape features.</p><p>Husbandry and animal welfare also entered the list with practices that include feeding plans and friendly housing conditions such as increased space allowances per animal.</p><p>As expected, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/handling-soil-with-care-conservation-agricultures-role-in-post-2020-cap/\">Conservation Agriculture (CA)</url> and other farming practices designed to avoid physical degradation of the soil have been included, as well as measures to boost soil carbon sequestration, which is a cornerstone of regenerative farming.</p><p>Precision farming actions can be funded as environmentally friendly practices under the new CAP program when they are intended to reduce fertiliser and pesticide use or to minimise nutrient release.</p><p>The Commission has also listed protecting water resources and managing crop water demand as worthy of the EU's eco-incentives.</p><p>On 15 January, German water companies warned of the risk that current conventional agricultural practices can cause irreparable damage to groundwater quality, calling on the Commission to better align CAP to Green Deal objectives.</p><p>The budget figure for eco-scheme is currently under discussions in the final CAP negotiations between EU ministers and the European Parliament, with the latter proposing a higher amount of (EURO)58.7 billion.</p><p>Once the CAP reform is sealed by the EU legislators, member states will be expected to declare the eco-schemes they intend to pursue in their national strategic plans, which the EU executive will ultimately have to approve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Zoran

He added that the most effective regulations are those that promote the protection of grasslands or agroforestry systems.</p><p>The German Farmers' Association (DBV) has also repeatedly emphasised agriculture's potential for climate change mitigation.</p><p>\"Agriculture and forestry remain the most important pillars in the creation of negative carbon emissions in the long term,\" said DBV Secretary General Bernhard Kr\u00fcsken at the end of June on the adoption of the amended climate protection law.</p><p>\"To achieve this, farmers must be politically supported in the area of humus build-up, and this climate service must be remunerated accordingly,\" he added.</p><p>The Climate Protection Act sets sectoral targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for various sectors of the economy, which were tightened with the amendments passed in June. In agriculture, emissions will be reduced by 2030 to 56 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, compared to 1990 levels.</p><p>\"Agriculture and forestry are the only economic sectors that can store carbon naturally,\" said Agriculture Minister Julia Kl\u00f6ckner when the law was passed.</p><p>This is particularly important because it is impossible to operate emission-free in the agricultural and forestry sector as part of the biological system, she said, adding that \"to achieve the goals, corresponding supporting measures and funding are necessary.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Protecting and restoring peatlands</emphasis></p><p>But according to Christian Rehmer, the German plans for implementing the CAP have not included any funds to promote climate-reducing measures such as peatland restoration, carbon storage or a reduction in livestock numbers.</p><p>In a joint statement, the farmer's working group and the German environmental protection organisation Deutsche Naturschutzring demanded that the environmental impact of the CAP strategic plan is reassessed. This should be done in terms of its contribution to achieving the amended Climate Protection Act and the Climate Protection Plan 2030.</p><p>The reduction of animal numbers and the \"adequate financing of rewetting measures on peat soils\", in particular, should be given more significant consideration as climate protection measures, according to the two organisations.</p><p>In its document, the Commission also points to the importance of peatlands as carbon reservoirs and recommends that Germany promote \"the protection of carbon-rich soils through rewetting and the restoration of peat bog areas and wetlands\".</p><p>Earlier this month, Germany's environment ministry presented a National Peatland Protection Strategy, which, according to the ministry, ensures both the protection of intact peatlands and the restoration and sustainable management of previously drained peatlands.</p><p>But associations and the opposition criticised the strategy because it was not adopted by the whole government, mainly because it was not coordinated with the agriculture ministry.</p><p>\"First of all, we have to rewet peatlands, but secondly, we also have to ensure that people can still farm on the rewetted areas,\" said Rehmer. He added that farmers whose peatlands can no longer be farmed need to be adequately compensated.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rewarding climate protection</emphasis></p><p>According to Rehmer, sufficient money and \"massive consultations\" are necessary to ensure measures are successful. \"This is a necessity that is almost not addressed by the CAP,\" he added.</p><p>\"However, all concepts for rewetting must be developed voluntarily and with local people,\" commented DBV Deputy Secretary-General Udo Hemmerling on the peatland protection strategy. The farms needed a long-term economic perspective, he added.</p><p>Concerning the CAP strategic plan, the DBV also calls for greater promotion of grassland management within the eco-schemes. For example, a grassland climate bonus could be introduced to \"reward the carbon sink of agriculture\", Hemmerling told EURACTIV Germany.</p><p>According to the European Commission, greenhouse gas emissions from grassland are higher in Germany than in any other EU country, despite a downward trend. The national strategic plan should therefore promote less intensive grassland management, the Commission said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Alice Taylor]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-645387</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PR-7YW1-JCF9-4110-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 27, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>agriculture associations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>agriculture ministry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Berlin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CAP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CAP reform</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon emissions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>greenlands</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Moore</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Business &amp;

A documentary sets out to show how\u00a0community members are pulling together to build a well that will not only quench thirst, but also promote equality for women and girls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Above Water, by Franco-Senegalese director and actress A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga, shows the hardships of women and children who spend kilometres day after day trooping off\u00a0to fetch water from their nearest well.</p><p>You can almost feel the grit of the sand and earth as you travel by their side, listening to the gentle clanking of the water containers on the donkeys' backs.</p><p>\"It didn't always used to be this way,\"\u00a0says an elder from the village of Tatiste. \"There used to be plains with grass so high it could hide the wild animals. Giraffe and jackals used to gambol.\"</p><p>But the land is drying out, and water is scarce.</p><p>The film's viewers are made to squint\u00a0through beige-coloured dust as they listen to the howling desert wind. The smoky beige sky sits low beyond the sparse, bare trees.</p><p>The villagers harness the donkeys with\u00a0ropes to pull buckets up out of the well. Sometimes there's next to no water.</p><p>The irony is, like many areas across Africa, there is a rich supply of water hidden in reservoirs deep below the surface, but too deep for ordinary wells.</p><p>The nomadic people of the land are literally \"walking on water\", which is the name of the film translated into French.</p><p>Immersion</p><p>Above Water is not a lesson on climate change, but rather an observation of the effects of global warming seen through the eyes of the villagers themselves.</p><p>\"I really wanted the spectator to feel they were\u00a0immersed in the story, to be in this village, to be with the people, to be in their reality, and be a part of their challenge,\" Ma\u00efga told RFI's Sophie Torlotin after the official launch of the film at the\u00a0Cannes\u00a0festival in July.</p><p>\"I certainly didn't want to look down on this story, or be detached from it, to see people struggling and not feel touched by it. I wanted to create a strong emotional connection.\"</p><p>Child leader</p><p>It was important for Ma\u00efga to have two parallel stories driving the narrative forward, to humanise the subject and raise awareness.</p><p>That\u00a0connection is guaranteed thanks to the authenticity of 14 year-old Houlaye in front of the camera. It is through her eyes you sense the difficulties of village life, season after season.</p><p>Her parents, aunt and other adults must travel on foot to neighbouring countries in search of work, leaving her in charge of the younger children.</p><p>We sense her anxiety over the long months as she knows what dangers they might face. Besides lack of food, water and shelter, the Azawak region\u00a0is prone to\u00a0raids\u00a0by rebel groups and rival tribes.</p><p>\"There was something about her look, some shyness too, but there was this depth and sensitivity, intelligence and a strength also,\"\u00a0says Ma\u00efga after her first meeting with Houlaye.</p><p>\"She was the leader of the film. She really understood the presence of the camera, what it meant, and how to let herself be filmed. It was a very impressive encounter,\"\u00a0Ma\u00efga said.</p><p>One of her goals was to emphasis the fact that water scarcity affects every aspect of a village life, from security, to health, to education and equality.</p><p>Born in Senegal and raised between France and Africa, Ma\u00efga says her own experiences of growing up in a West African family, and frequent holidays spent with her father's relatives in the north of Mali, were helpful in understanding the crucial question of water.</p><p>Although she says her memories were extremely positive, she was always aware the lack of resources had the power to pull families and communities apart.</p><p>Gender imbalance</p><p>There are no figures mentioned in the film, but the repetitive nature of the well trips and the long dry season\u00a0hint at the shocking statistics behind\u00a0accessing clean water.</p><p>Unesco figures show that in Sub-Saharan Africa only 24 percent\u00a0of the population has\u00a0access to safe drinking water, and 28 percent\u00a0has basic sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households.</p><p>The burden of collecting water lies with women and girls, many of whom spend more than 30 minutes on each journey to fetch water\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a situation that prevents them from attending school.</p><p>Keeping these facts in mind, Ma\u00efga presents a singularly humane vision, bringing into focus the strong women in the village, their desire to keep the local school running and their courageous trips carrying bundles of homemade medicines to sell.</p><p>The film is full of surprising moments of humour and tenderness, amid\u00a0a backdrop of breathtaking scenery.</p><p>There are uplifting scenes when the rain finally comes and the landscape is utterly transformed. Children shriek happily as they splash in mini lakes and cattle graze contentedly in the marshes that were once dust bowls. A father takes the time to wash his little boy.</p><p>Sustainable solutions</p><p>This abundance of water is tied to another important narrative in the film, which is the official quest for a communal well to be drilled near Tatiste. The local government is prompted into action by a letter written with the help of the school teacher.</p><p>The project comes to fruition with the help of an NGO Amman Imman (Water Is Life), bringing much joy to the village.</p><p>Ma\u00efga knows\u00a0building wells cannot be a solution for every village across Africa, but by using cinema\u00a0she is able to open up a universal dialogue on the crucial issue of access to water.</p><p>\"We can't drill holes everywhere, even if there is a significant source of ground water which has been there for centuries,\" she says.</p><p>\"We need to find sustainable solutions for regreening, replanting, irrigation with rain water catchments. Agroforestry requires means:\u00a0for logistics, technical aspects and funding \u2013 only this will allow a cycle of water, to find sustainable solutions.\"</p><p>Above Water (Marcher sur l'Eau) was released in French cinemas on 10 November, and\u00a012 November in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>More videos available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr\">http://www.english.rfi.fr</url>/</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-261064486</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6434-S5R1-F11P-X1Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1020\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

This would be taken from \"marginal land\" which is currently not productive, the IEA said, an assumption that leaves environmentalists sceptical.</p><p>\"We need forests and land to capture carbon, not to release it into the atmosphere and accelerate global warming,\" said Dr. Mary S. Booth, director at the Partnership for Policy Integrity, a US-based research group.</p><p>\"The IEA needs to go back to the drawing board and rethink the bioenergy part of this Net Zero scenario,\" she said in a statement.</p><p>Scientists have drawn attention to forests and soils as a crucial \"carbon sink\" to regulate the climate because they absorb more CO2 than they emit. However, their capacity to suck carbon is coming under growing strain due to intensive agriculture and deforestation.</p><p>In a \u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/a-closer-look-at-the-modelling-behind-our-global-roadmap-to-net-zero-emissions-by-2050\">blogpost</url>, IEA modellers explained that the NZE Scenario assumes no overall increase in cropland use for bioenergy production, saying no bioenergy crops are expected to be developed on forested land.</p><p>But critics say it remains to be seen how policymakers are going to square the circle of increasing bioenergy use without increasing land use.</p><p>\"The IEA's Net Zero Emissions scenario and other proposals that advocate for continuing the use of land for bioenergy production - even with a move away from conventional biofuels like corn ethanol and palm biodiesel - will inevitably compete with the food needs of a global population of more than 9 billion and the need to conserve and restore land to reverse the current biodiversity crisis,\" said Erle C.

Bioenergy consumption in Europe grew more than 69% between 2005 and 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming decades as the EU strengthens its climate goals.</p><p>The European Commission expects bioenergy demand to grow \"by 65-80%\" between 2030 and 2050, a projection campaigners say needs to be revised in view of potential climate risks.</p><p>\"The EU's bioenergy targets are even more unrealistic than the IEA's one, projecting a 80% increase. It's high time the European Commission wakes up to the stark reality that we can't keep burning forests for energy and limit global warming,\" said Hannah Mowat from Fern, a Brussels-based NGO campaigning to protect forests and people.</p><p>The EU executive has acknowledged the role of forests in regulating the climate, saying Europe needs \"a growing sink in order for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050\".</p><p>The capacity of forests to absorb CO2 is decreasing and needs to be reversed, the Commission said in its 2030 climate plan, calling for improved forest management as well as \"re- and afforestation\" initiatives to restore degraded land and preserve biodiversity.</p><p>Environmentalists say burning wood immediately releases CO2 which took years or even decades to accumulate during the tree's growth phase. This, they argue, creates a \"carbon debt\" for future generations until new trees can grow back and suck an equivalent amount of CO2.</p><p>But the bioenergy industry says forest cover in the EU increased by 5.8% in 1995-2015 while bioenergy consumption \"more than doubled\" during the same period.</p><p>\"The increase in bioenergy has been possible thanks to a better use of residues from the forest-based industries and increased synergies with the wood-based industry,\" said Jean-Marc Jossart, secretary-general of Bioenergy Europe.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/eu-climate-plan-blows-hot-and-cold-on-forestry-biomass/\">EU climate plan blows hot and cold on forestry, biomass</url></h><p>While recognising the positive role of forests in mitigating global warming, the European Commission has riled the agroforestry and biomass industries by stating its intention of limiting growth in the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Benjamin Fox]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1605727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62PK-3NV1-DYXB-V32B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 18, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>bioenergy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>deforestation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>wood fuel</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRNU</classCode><className>BIOENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000183</classCode><className>BIOMASS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Because of that, BUND is demanding that regulations be introduced to ensure a year-round soil cover and diverse crop rotations - practices already in place in the organic farming sector.</p><p>Soil cultivation by heavy machinery must also be reduced so as not to compact the soil, Meissner continued.</p><p>\"In my eyes, there is a clear lack of focus on soil protection in the CAP reform that has just been adopted,\" he said.</p><p>The heavy rainfall has been exacerbated by misguided land use policies, according to the president of the European Agroforestry Association (EURAF), Patrick Worms.</p><p>To contain the water, hedgerow and tree structures are needed on farmland, otherwise it would flow into the landscape.</p><p>\"Large bare fields are far more prone to erosion in a storm that those surrounded by windbreaks, hedges, other permanently planted features, or divided into alleys by tree lines,\" he told EURACTIV.</p><p>\"The truly sorry thing about this is that much of destruction could easily have been avoided at no or little cost to farmers,\" Worms added.</p><p>But according to Meissner, the disaster, which hit the western German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North-Rhine Westphalia could not have been prevented if farming practices had been changed.</p><h><url

role in post-2020 CAP</url></h><p>Despite being taken into consideration only slightly in the EU's current farming subsidies programme, Conservation Agriculture is set to play a central role in the green architecture of the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strengthening water meadows and forests</emphasis></p><p>NGO Deutsche Umwelthilfe, meanwhile, is calling for more consistent reinforcement of the existing law on the observance of buffer strips along water courses and protected areas, for example with regard to the \"observance of good professional practice and soil protection in the cultivation of agricultural land.\"</p><p>The organisation is also calling for the mandatory designation of so-called development corridors along all watercourses.</p><p>Within these areas, arable land must be converted to grassland and at least 50% of the area must be used for the re-wetting of floodplains.</p><p>\"Floodplain forests can serve as floodplains that keep water in the landscape,\" Meissner said, noting that a financially reinforced nationwide water meadow programme is needed.</p><p>Forests can also help protect the environment from floods, he said, since unexploited natural forests have the potential to act as a \"sponge\" and absorb water.</p><p>\"BUND demands that at least 10% of the forest area be permanently designated as natural forests,\" Meissner added.</p><p>The German Federal Hunting Act must also be adapted to ensure a near-natural \"conversion\" of forests and enable forest-friendly wildlife management, he added.</p><p>At the EU level, the Commission adopted on 16 July a new EU Forest Strategy, a flagship initiative under the European Green Deal.</p><p>The strategy contains a package of measures to increase the quality and quantity of European forests, which, according to the Commission, provide \"vital ecosystem services\" to society - including \"protection against severe floods\" and a \"reduction in the impact of droughts.\"</p><p>\"In view of the current heavy rain and severe weather events, we are clearly reminded of how important healthy forests are,\" said Olaf Tschimpke, the president of Germany nature conservation association Naturschutzbund (NABU) at the presentation of the strategy.</p><p>EU countries have watered down the Commission's proposals made as part of the forest strategy too much, he added.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/our-forests-are-sick-germanys-agriculture-ministry-says/\">'Our forests are

flood protection for farmers since climate change \"pretty much ensures that we will have more and more years of droughts and floods.\"</p><p>According to Meissner, agriculture may have to adjust its crop rotation in order to better adapt agriculture to weather extremes.</p><p>\"Where crops that are better able to cope with drought have poor marketing channels, we need to build pathways here,\" he said.</p><p>Making agricultural production more resilient to crises is also a priority of Slovenian Agriculture Minister Joze Podgorsek, who currently chairs the EU Council of Ministers.</p><p>In a

After rising sharply from very favorable prior-year comparatives in the first half, global demand declined by 5% in the third quarter, reflecting more normal bases of comparison and the highly adverse impact of the global semiconductor shortage on the OE segment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Original Equipment</emphasis></p><p>After expanding quickly in the first half due to low comparatives (caused by automotive plant shutdowns in first-half 2020), Original Equipment tire demand was severely dampened in the third quarter by the worsening global shortage of auto semiconductors. As a result, the market dropped a steep 21% compared with the prior-year period, which was down only 3% year on year thanks to the sharp upturn in business.</p><p>During the quarter, constricted chip supply had an impact on demand in every region, driving declines of 30% in Western and Central Europe, 24% in North America, 20% in China and 18% in Asia excluding China.</p><p>In all, the global OE tire market ended the first nine months down 17% year on year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Replacement</emphasis></p><p>After surging 26% off of very favorable comparatives in the first half, global Replacement tire demand was stable year on year in the third quarter, while remaining down a slight 4% on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 third-quarter 2019.</p><p>Demand in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western and Central Europe</emphasis>eased back 1% in the third quarter following on from a brisk 22% rebound in the first half. Declines in Italy (down 6%), the United Kingdom (down 4%) and, to a lesser extent, France and Germany (down 2%) were partially offset by gains of 4% in the Iberian Peninsula and 3% in the Nordic countries. Over the full nine months, the Western European market was down just 2% on the same period in 2019.</p><p>In the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CIS</emphasis>, demand rose by 5% in the third quarter, building on the strong 21% rebound in the first half and bringing the market back in line with 2019 for the full nine months.</p><p>Replacement tire demand remained high in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">North and Central America,</emphasis>lifted by the partial rebuilding of dealer inventories. After the first-half's strong 38% upturn, the third quarter saw a 1% increase from very high prior-year comparatives. Over the full nine months, Replacement demand was 7% higher than in the same period in 2019.</p><p>The<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South American</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">market</emphasis>rose by 29% in the third quarter from low 2020 comparatives, when demand was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 epidemic. Over the full nine months, tire demand was 6% higher than in the same period in 2019.</p><p>Demand in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis>declined by 9% from very high prior-year comparatives in the third quarter, after gaining 15% in the first half due to a very favorable basis of comparison in the first quarter and inventory rebuilding. In the third quarter, the market was in line with third-quarter 2019.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Asia (excluding China and India)</emphasis>, third-quarter demand was severely impacted by declines in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, which were hard hit by Covid-19 during the period. Over the full nine months, the Replacement market remained a deep 12% lower than in the same period in 2019.</p><p>In the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Africa/India/Middle East</emphasis>region, demand rose by 6% in the third quarter, as robust gains in India and the Middle East offset steep declines in the African markets over the period. Over the full nine months, demand was stable compared with the same period in 2019.</p><p>Truck tires (radial and bias)</p><p>* Including Turkey</p><p>The number of new Truck tires sold worldwide declined by 8% in the third quarter of 2021, after climbing a sharp 25% in the first half on the back of the global economic recovery and the upturn in freight demand (-27% for Original Equipment, -3% for Replacement).</p><p>Growth varied widely by region, with strong 13% momentum in North America and a 2% increase in Europe failing to offset the 30% drop in China, which mainly reflected extremely high prior-year comparatives.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Original Equipment</emphasis></p><p>The global Original Equipment Truck tire market, as measured by the number of new tires sold, declined by 27% in the third quarter, dragged down by the steep 49% fall in Chinese demand.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western and Central Europe</emphasis>, Original Equipment demand rose by 6%, but was still 3% down on third-quarter 2019.</p><p>Demand remained strong in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">North and Central America</emphasis>, with a 9% gain for the quarter, but the full nine-month performance fell 14% short of the very high levels reached in the same period in 2019.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis>, demand plunged 49% in the third quarter, primarily due to comparison with the extremely high 75% year-on-year gain in third-quarter 2020, which was propelled by truck fleet upgrades ahead of implementation of the China 6 emissions standard.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the rest of the world</emphasis>, demand for Original Equipment truck tires continued to expand at a fast pace in the third quarter, rising 32% in South America, 19% in Asia excluding China and 56% in the Africa/India/Middle East region.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Replacement</emphasis></p><p>The global Replacement tire market contracted by 3% in the third quarter, as an 18% decline in Chinese demand overshadowed robust gains in North America (up 14%) and South America (up\u00a018%).</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Western and Central Europe</emphasis>, the market edged up by 1% over the period. Demand was brisk in the Northern European countries, with gains of 9% in Germany and 14% in the United Kingdom, and up slightly in France (1%), Italy (1%) and the Iberian Peninsula (2%), but down 9% in Central Europe with, in particular, a sharp 17% decline in Turkey.Over the full nine months, the number of new tires sold was 8% higher than in the same period in 2019.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">North and Central America</emphasis>, the market dynamic is still being driven by the economic upturn, delivering a 14% increase in the third quarter and lifting demand 18% to well above pre-crisis levels by the end of September.</p><p>Markets in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South America</emphasis>expanded by 18% overall during the third quarter of 2021, led by a 16% gain in Brazil. Over the full nine months, the regional market was 9% over its pre-crisis level.</p><p>Following a 28% increase in the first half, Replacement tire demand in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis>declined by 18% in the third quarter, impacted by slowing economic growth and extensive truck fleet upgrades in 2020 ahead of implementation of the China 6 emissions standard.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the rest of the world</emphasis>, markets rose by a slight 3% in the third quarter in Asia and contracted by 4% in the Africa/India/Middle East region.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Specialty businesses</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mining tires</emphasis>: Surface mining tire markets ended the first nine months up slightly on the prior-year period, lifted by generally expanding ore markets. Overall demand, however, is being dampened by the pervasive disruption in global supply chains.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agricultural and Construction tires</emphasis>: Farm machinery tire markets are trending upwards compared to 2020, with very strong growth in Original Equipment sales driven by rising grain prices and farm incomes.</p><p>The Construction and Infrastructure segments are benefiting from the strong upturn in demand, particularly for OE tires, supported by the very fast growth in the construction industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Two-wheel tires</emphasis>: With two-wheel vehicles offering an increasingly popular alternative to public transportation, demand for their tires remains buoyant. However, growth is being held back by the resurgence of the Delta variant in Southeast Asia, parts shortages (which are weighing on OE motorcycle tire demand) and the supply chain constrictions experienced by tiremakers across the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aircraft tires</emphasis>: Over the first nine months of 2021, aircraft tire markets enjoyed double-digit growth year on year, thanks to extremely favorable comparatives, but remained sharply down on 2019. The forthcoming reopening of commercial air routes from Europe to North America points to a slight market improvement by year-end. Demand in the Military and General Aviation segments continued to hold up well over the period.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conveyor belts</emphasis>: The mining conveyor belt market turned in a mixed performance. Demand in Australia stabilized due to coal export restrictions, while the services and engineering segments were adversely impacted by Covid-19. In North America, industrial demand is recovering, but business is still suffering from buyer hesitation in a turbulent operating environment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michelin sales</emphasis></p><p>Consolidated sales</p><p>* In tonnes</p><p>Sales for the first nine months of 2021 totaled (EURO)17,204 million, an increase of 15.6% from the year-earlier period that was attributable to the net impact of the following factors:</p><p>- A 14.8% or (EURO)2,204 million increase from very strong growth in tire volumes as markets rebounded on the robust recovery in global economic activity. Volume growth eased to 1.3% in the third quarter, reflecting the return to more normal bases of comparison.</p><p>- A 4.1% increase from the favorable tire price-mix effect, of which (i) a 2.8% gain from the price increases introduced by the Group to offset rising raw materials, logistics and energy costs and (ii) a 1.3% increase from the positive mix effect, reflecting the sustained up-market shift in the product mix and the favorable OE/Replacement business mix in the Automotive segment.</p><p>- A 0.3% increase from the 5.8% growth in non-tire sales.</p><p>- A 3.5% decrease from the currency effect, which remained negative over the first nine months.</p><p>- A slight decrease from changes in the scope of consolidation, with the removal of the printing, publishing and marketing businesses associated with Maps &amp; Guides for France, effective February 1, 2021, and of Solesis on May 28, 2021.</p><p>Sales by reporting segment</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Automotive and</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">related</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">distribution:</emphasis></p><p>Sales in the Automotive segment rose by 18.9% year-on-year to (EURO)8,603\u00a0million in the first nine months of 2021.After rebounding sharply in the first half, the Passenger car and Light truck tire market contracted by 5% in the third quarter, hard hit by the 21% drop in OE demand caused by the global auto semiconductor shortage.In this environment, the segment reported a 16.3% increase in tire volumes sold in the first nine months, with a slight 1.7% decline in the third quarter.Sales were also lifted by a very favorable price-mix effect combining (i)\u00a0the impact of price increases deployed in 2021 in the Replacement business to offset rising costs; (ii)\u00a0the favorable impact of the relative weighting of the OE and Replacement segments in the business mix; and (iii)\u00a0the sustained up-market shift in the product mix, with market share gains in MICHELIN-brand 18-inch and larger tires. The Segment was also impacted by a change in the scope of consolidation following the removal of the printing, publishing and marketing businesses associated with Maps &amp; Guides for France, effective February 1, 2021.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Road transportation and related distribution:</emphasis></p><p>Sales for the first nine months amounted to (EURO)4,503 million, up 16.4% year on year.After rebounding 25% in the first half, demand for new truck tires fell back 8% in the third quarter, impacted by the decline in the Chinese market. In this environment, segment tire sales volumes rose by 16% over the first nine months and by 3.8% in the third quarter alone. The tire price-mix effect was robust for the period, reflecting the segment's selective focus on creating value and the price increases introduced to offset rising raw materials, logistics and production costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Specialty businesses and related distribution:</emphasis></p><p>Sales in the Specialty businesses segment rose by 8.4% year on year to (EURO)4,098 million in the first nine months of 2021.Segment volumes rose by 10.2% over the first nine months, of which 6.2% in the third quarter. Sales were lifted by the rebound in demand for Agricultural tires and tracks and Construction tires, which was especially strong in the OE segment, and by the sustained strong growth in Two-wheel tire markets. In the mining tire operations, severe supply chain disruptions are still preventing the Group from fully meeting customer demand, which remains robust. The conveyor belt and specialty polymers businesses continued to expand over the period. The price effect was positive, but to a lesser extent than in the other two segments due to the time lag in applying raw materials clauses and the slightly negative business mix due to supply chain issues in mining tire operations.</p><p>The deconsolidation of Solesis reduced segment sales by 0.3% over the first nine months and by 1.3% in the third quarter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"All Sustainable\" Michelin - third-quarter 2021</emphasis></p><p>In line with the \"All Sustainable\" commitment embedded deep in its strategic vision, Michelin has undertaken a number of results-oriented initiatives:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Race to Zero</emphasis>- Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C: In July 2021, the Group joined the global Race to Zero\u00a0campaign to rally support from businesses for the Paris Agreement's net zero emissions target by engaging them in \"Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C,\" a call to action led by the international Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the United Nations Global Compact, We Mean Business and several other organizations.Michelin's initial CO2emissions reduction targets were validated by the SBTi in 2020. In response to the growing climate emergency, however, even more ambitious targets for lower CO2emissions were announced in April 2021 at the Group's Capital Markets Day event. The new roadmap, specifying targets for 2030, is compatible with the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C commitment, and will be resubmitted to the SBTi for approval in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Open letter from businesses to G20 leaders</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">at the COP26 summit</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">to get involved in limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C</emphasis>: In September 2021, Michelin signed the open letter, drafted by the We Mean Business coalition, urging G20 leaders to keep within reach of the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biodiversity commitments for 2030</emphasis>: In 2021, the Group reaffirmed its commitment to attenuating the impact of its operations across the value chain by setting new<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0dAZLZrbU8VBLFPtYqucqOFr70JMITd-ESpbpoYeaVxf_p8bN9R8w61XsoLFs6PjKhOZwYqXBaaznV1i0Zta17I2jeLnl8OSnxmBTvio-OeZQJpqlx15SY7L2Af0e3LQ\">biodiversity targets for 2030</url>as part of the Act4nature international initiative.

It builds on Nescaf\u00e9's decade-long sustainability work. The brand will invest over one billion Swiss francs into the Plan by 2030 - an investment that is supported by Nestl\u00e9's regenerative agriculture financing.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will work with coffee farmers to make the transition to regenerative agriculture by providing them with training, financial support and high-yielding coffee plantlets. Some of the regenerative practices that will be encouraged include:</p><p>planting cover cropsoptimizing fertilization, including the use of organic fertilizersincreasing the use of agroforestry and intercropping andpruning or replacing existing trees with disease and climate-change resistant varieties.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will test, learn and assess the effectiveness of multiple regenerative agriculture practices, prioritizing the seven countries from which it sources 90% of its coffee: Brazil, Vietnam, Mexico, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Indonesia and Honduras. Its goal, in line with the Nestl\u00e9 Group's ambition for all key agricultural ingredients, is to source 20% of its coffee from regenerative agricultural methods by 2025 and 50% by 2030.</p><p>Regenerative farming will improve soil health and fertility. Healthier soil holds more water and captures more carbon from the atmosphere. This will help Nescaf\u00e9 reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, in line with the Nestl\u00e9 Group commitment.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will simultaneously help boost the income of farmers who make the transition to regenerative agriculture. It will pilot a financial support program in selected countries to test the best approach according to local conditions. Some of the measures that may be used include: conditional cash incentives for the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices, income protection through weather insurance and greater access to credit lines for farmers.</p><p>Nescaf\u00e9 will track the progress and assess the results of its field programs through its Monitoring and Evaluation partnership with the Rainforest Alliance. It is also partnering with Sustainable Food Lab, among others, for topics related to coffee farmers' income assessment, strategy and progress tracking.</p><p>With this extensive Plan, Nescaf\u00e9 aims to help make coffee farming globally more sustainable.</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Full-year 2022 outlook updated</emphasis>: we now expect organic sales growth around 8%.

What are the main achievements since the first strategy was launched in 2012? And what did the Commission learn in those ten years about the potential and limitations of the bioeconomy? </emphasis></p><p>Indeed, the EU\u2019s bioeconomy strategy is now 10 years old. And through that time it has gone through significant developments: while it started as a \u2018knowledge-based\u2019 bioeconomy, focusing on Research and Innovation and improving the efficiency in the use of renewable resources, it has evolved with the updated Bioeconomy Strategy adopted in 2018 to a policy framework to speed up \u2013 and in a certain way make possible \u2013 the transformation to climate-neutral economy that no longer relies on fossil fuels and other unsustainable non-renewable resources.</p><p>Achieving a climate positive effect through substitution of harmful products and through storage of carbon in bio-based products has been in the focus, though the holistic character of the bioeconomy policy was also emphasised: looking at social, economic, and environmental sustainability aspects.</p><p>Another focus was the cooperation with countries and regions to support the development of bioeconomy strategies. This is one of the big successes: today, we have 10 Member states with dedicated bioeconomy strategies at national level in the EU-27 (AT, DE, ES, FI, FR, IE, IT, LV, NL, PT) and 7 Member States in the process of developing their respective dedicated national strategies (CZ, HR, HU, LT, PL, SK, SE). We have also made substantial progress in macro-regions such as the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bioeast.eu/\">BIOEAST Initiative</url> countries and 68 EU regions have already adopted policies where bioeconomy is a key element.</p><p>We have learned tremendously about the potential of bioeconomy solutions \u2013 there is virtually nothing that could not be substituted by bio-based processes or products. And we have accumulated precious knowledge about how bioeconomy works, how it can be measured, how win-wins are possible, and how to make it more a \u2018norm\u2019 than a \u2018niche\u2019 across our societies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are there new products now available to European consumers which didn\u2019t exist ten years ago? Or are we still talking mainly about research and innovation projects?</emphasis></p><p>Indeed, we saw that the progress in the last ten year was enormous, both thanks to unprecedented scientific advances, but also thanks to policy focus.</p><p>For instance, sustainable and innovative biorefineries today are turning food waste into useful and safe ingredients for food, feed and fertilisers with insects. We can upcycle biological waste or plastic waste with enzymes and other smart technologies. Seaweed cultivation does not require land, fertilisers and freshwater to produce low carbon and high nutritional value food and non-food products.</p><p>We see an <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2021.107146\">increasing number of novel food applications</url> and Europe\u2019s global market share for bio-based chemicals and materials was about 31% which is twice the one of the fossil-based sectors (16 %).</p><p>So, progress has been huge, and the EU has given significant support. For example, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbi.europa.eu/about/about-bbi\">Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking</url> (BBI JU) \u2013 a partnership between the European Commission and the Bio-based Industry Consortium \u2013 had a total budget of \u20ac3.6 billion.</p><p>The main aim of the partnership was in particular to demonstrate technologies that enable new chemical building blocks, new materials and consumer products from European biomass, which replace the need for fossil-based inputs. The objective of BBI JU and of its members was to contribute to the development of sustainable and competitive bio-based industries in Europe, based on advanced biorefineries that source their biomass sustainably. And we are on a similar track for its successor, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbe.europa.eu/\">Circular Bio-Based Europe Joint Undertaking</url> (CBE JU) that is already in full motion. This partnership will run until 2027 and will dedicate \u20ac2 billion to fund projects advancing competitive circular bio-based industries. It has just very successfully closed its first call for projects, with an indicative budget of \u20ac120 million.</p><p>Regarding new bio-based consumer products such as such as cosmetics, food applications, automotive parts, fertilisers or adhesives<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis> the BBI JU reported the expected creation of 152 such products by 2024.</p><p>Packaging constitutes one of the main applications delivered by BBI JU projects which bring new bio-based plastics, composites and films, lacquers and coatings, as well as bio-based adhesives to bond materials for multi-layer packaging applications. BIOBARR and Refucoat are examples of projects which are preparing functionalised 100% bio-based materials for packaging with antimicrobial and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/antioxidant-activity\">antioxidant activity</url>\u00a0or improved mechanical and barrier properties.</p><p>New bio-based consumer products (such as cosmetics, food applications, automotive parts, fertilisers, adhesives, etc.) are expected to be more sustainable than current fossil-based alternatives. This can be achieved by improved material efficiency, reduced GHG emissions, higher biodegradability, recyclability or other effects during use or reuse.</p><p>Moreover, the bio-based \u2018consumer products\u2019 have to meet a clear market demand and fulfil specific technical requirements, be economically viable and match all relevant sustainability criteria.</p><p>Examples of new consumer products developed by BBI JU in 2020 include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Reported by project ALEHOOP, which aims to produce animal feed, food additives and nutritional products such as healthy snack bars, sports drinks or meat analogues/veggie products through the upcycling of low-cost proteins recovered from macroalgal and vegetal residues.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Reported by project DEEP PURPLE, which targets the production of a range of bio-based products including: encapsuled fertilisers, biodegradable bio-based plastics, self-repairing construction materials and cosmetics products.

How many of them can be considered to be operating at industrial scale? And how many does the Commission believe should be in place by 2030 and 2050?</emphasis></p><p>The answer to this important question depends on precise definitions and criteria. To start, biorefineries may have different size, use very different biological feedstocks and may produce different end-products or intermediates, so all those factors should be considered.</p><p>The 2018 Research brief developed by the European Commission JRC \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC113216\">Biorefineries distribution in the EU</url>\u201d identified as many as 803 biorefineries in the EU, of which 507 produce bio-based chemicals, 363 liquid biofuels and 141 bio-based composites and fibres (multi-product facilities are counted more than once). Of those facilities, 177 are reported as integrated biorefineries that combine the production of bio-based products and energy.</p><p>More recently, the European Commission contracted a study \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/7223cd2e-bf5b-11eb-a925-01aa75ed71a1\">EU Biorefinery Outlook to 2030</url>\u201d, which was published in May 2021. It was developed specifically in support of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy\u2019s action to facilitate the development and deployment of new sustainable biorefineries and to estimate the potential deployment of different types of biorefineries. As background, the Bioeconomy Strategy states the goal of developing 300 new sustainable biorefineries by 2030.</p><p>The focus of the Biorefinery Outlook study was specifically on chemical and material driven biorefineries which include the production of innovative high value bio-based products. This includes integrated biorefineries that produce chemical and materials as major products, but could also co-produce food and feed as well as bioenergy. The study excluded bioenergy and biofuel driven biorefineries and conventional biomass processing facilities focused on traditional bio-based products, such as paper and board. Applying such criteria, around 300 chemical and material driven biorefineries at commercial or demonstration scale have been identified in the EU</p><p>Two scenarios to 2030 for the demand for bio-based chemicals and materials in the EU have been developed. The high growth scenario assumes: a favourable macro-economic environment and policy for bio-based products, including a strong recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, a high oil price (increasing the competitiveness of bio-based products in some applications), a market pull policy put in place for bio-based chemicals and materials and widespread financial support for various types of biorefinery investments.</p><p>The study revealed that the potential demand in 2030 could grow significantly in the high growth scenario to ~16 million tonnes per year (Mtpa) growing at about 9.9% per year until 2030, but could reach approximately only half this amount in the low growth scenario growing at about 3.0% per year.</p><p>The current bio-based chemicals and materials supply from EU biorefineries is estimated at 4.6 million tonnes. It is estimated that supply from new or expanded biorefineries could grow by an additional 3.1 million tonnes in the EU in 2030 in the high growth scenario, whilst in the low growth scenario this could be limited to an additional 1.1 million tonnes.</p><p>The above-mentioned assumptions underscore, yet again, the sustainable supply of biomass as one of the critical issues for bioeconomy, and suggests that further policy and research efforts may be needed to address the expected \u2018biomass availability gap\u2019, taking into account the trade-offs and ecological limits related to supply of biomass and its various uses.</p><p>To conclude, it is difficult to give a concrete \u2018desired\u2019 number of necessary biorefineries in the EU. We should keep in mind that a just looking on the number of biorefineries does not give a full picture, as what matters is also the resource efficiency (smaller number of more efficient plants may be sufficient). In the current EU Horizon Europe Framework Programme (2021-2027) significant budget is available to tackle biorefinery related technical barriers, including on resource efficiency, and full use of biomass, such as for example within Pillar 2 \u201cGlobal Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness\u201d \u2013 Cluster 6 \u201cFood, Bioeconomy, natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment\u201d.</p><p>Also Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI-JU) has funded 14 large scale (flagship) projects, and many demonstration projects, developing various biorefinery solutions. Its current successor, the EU Partnership on Circular Bio-based Europe (CBE), will continue supporting such biorefinery technology development, demonstration and market introduction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The report also highlighted the existence of \u201ctrade-offs\u201d between competing uses of land, sea and biomass. Can you outline the main trade-offs? Can these trade-offs be overcome or do they also draw the limits of the bioeconomy\u2019s potential? </emphasis></p><p>The 2018 Bioeconomy Strategy already recognised the underlying need for the bioeconomy to respect environmental boundaries.</p><p>One of the most obvious areas where these limits are or will be manifesting is the issue of land availability to produce sufficient quantities of biomass for various uses while meeting all the other crucial policy objectives such as biodiversity protection, zero pollution and maintaining our land and ocean carbon sink.</p><p>Various projections are informing us that demand for biomass is only going to be increasing, be it for bio-materials or bioenergy. On the other hand, there is only so much sustainable increase in biomass production that we can achieve through innovative agronomic and forestry techniques without exacerbating existing problems linked to intensive land management such as soil erosion, loss of biodiversity or nutrient pollution.</p><p>Studies suggest that the gap between the potential demand for biomass and its sustainable supply can be as big as 40-70%. This is a real issue that can only be addressed through a holistic approach.</p><p>Sustainable bioeconomy policy can provide exactly that type of a framework for thinking about these issues. Several principles can help with reducing the demand and consumption on the one hand (example, reducing food loses, sustainable consumer practices etc), but also increase the resource efficiency through the application of the cascading principle, which ensures that biomass stays in the system for as long as possible by prioritising long-term material uses over energy uses wherever possible.</p><p>On the other hand, sustainable supply and ecological co-benefits can be increased through management practices such as agroforestry or using adapted crop varieties. Main use of biomass is for food, and here predominantly for feed.</p><p>Dietary habit changes would greatly help in this transition as this would free up large areas of land currently used for the production of animal feed \u2013 this land could instead be used for land restoration purposes or for cultivation of industrial crops, or recreation purposes (agro-tourism, reforestation etc).</p><p>The Commission is currently launching activities together with the Joint research Centre on the Integrated bioeconomy assessment of land and biomass use that will shed light on exactly this type of trade-offs and possible policies and management practices that could alleviate them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In its progress report, the European Commission highlighted the renewed importance of the bioeconomy to ensure Europe\u2019s energy independence and food security in the context of the Ukraine war. What are the biggest opportunities which haven\u2019t yet been exploited in these two areas?</emphasis></p><p>There is a clear opportunity to alleviate the immediate shortages of imported gas and fuels and high electricity prices in the short term by ramping up the supply of domestically produced bioenergy.</p><p>This can take the form of biomethane, whose production is planned to be significantly increased as outlined in our RePowerEU Communication. Forest bioenergy, if obtained under sustainable management practices, can moreover reduce our reliance on imported coal.</p><p>With biofuels, the approach is more complicated as the first-generation biofuels create a direct competition with food crops for human consumption, and ensuring food security is an objective that should always take a precedence.</p><p>For this reason, only advanced biofuels should be prioritised. Needless to say that any increase in bioenergy production has to be in line with the sustainability criteria defined in the Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>On the other hand, this temporary increase in bioenergy production has to eventually be aligned with the resource efficiency principles I outlined previously and, in the medium and long-term, bioenergy should be restricted to areas where no other alternatives are economically or technologically feasible.</p><p>There are furthermore other interlinkages between bioeconomy and food and energy security, such as the role of bio-based fertilisers and bio-pesticides, some of which we have supported through our bio-based partnerships (BBI JU and now CBE JU). These products can contribute to increasing sustainable supplies of biomass in the time when prices of fertilisers are prohibitively high.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A recurring issue seems to be scale: whether looking at biofuels, bioenergy, or bio-based plastics, it seems any attempt to reach industrial scale is confronted with ecological limitations. Does this mean the bioeconomy is bound to remain a niche?</emphasis></p><p>While we are certainly aware of the ecological limitations, it has to be understood that in order to bring down fossil emissions drastically, all the sectors that currently rely on fossil energy and fossil fuels as feedstock will eventually have to replace these, and bio-based applications will often be part of the solution.</p><p>If we handle the demand for biomass sensibly on the policy side and we ensure high circularity and resource efficiency of the biological resources, bioeconomy has a great potential to provide the much needed answer for industrial transformation of certain sectors such as the chemical sector while fully respecting the ecological boundaries.</p><p>In the progress report we found that technological solutions alone won\u2019t be sufficient to guarantee environmental integrity. Therefore, we also need to make consumption patterns more sustainable. That regards the diets mentioned already, but also other bio-based value chains. New business models must concentrate on added value rather than quantity of products.</p><p>Furthermore, those sectors that rely on fossil carbon as their feedstock will obviously need to find also other sources of non-fossil carbon, such as carbon captured from industrial process or carbon retrieved through recycling of current fossil-based products.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How can the cascading use of biomass be translated into policy while avoiding over-regulation and bureaucracy?</emphasis></p><p>There are several ways to achieve this. With last year\u2019s proposal for the revision of the renewable Energy Directive, the Commission is trying to create a framework with some rules that will at least prevent perverse financial incentives for burning of such forest biomass whose quality would justify its use elsewhere. Such subsidies tend to distort the feedstock market and risk putting bio-based industries at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis bioenergy operators.</p><p>It is of course in the interest of Member States to use their biological resources efficiently and therefore most regulation and policy incentives should happen on their level.</p><p>As the first step, supporting capital investments in regions to build robust bio-based supply chains that can actually turn this biomass into useful bio-based products with a high added value is crucial. Without it, turning the biomass into energy will remain the only feasible option for many countries and regions.</p><p>Removal of subsidies from the least efficient use of biomass and creation of a functioning market for bio-based products should in itself redirect biomass use along the cascading principle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionbiomassintervieweuofficialfurthereffortsneededtoaddressecologicallimitsofbiomass</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66KP-B3N1-F03F-K3DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3351\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

We have dumped our waste into water without being aware of the consequences on aquatic life.\u00a0</p><p>We have seen the beauty of creation, but we have used it as an object for our well-being.</p><p>In the permaculture process, we don't talk about contemplating, but of observing nature, listening to it in order to learn, from it, how it works.\u00a0</p><p>Starting from the principle that nature has its own functioning, we are led to consider it as something other than an object that we own.</p><p>We engage our attention and we take a respectful look at the living.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Isn't this an idealized vision of nature? In the collective memory, it is also death, epidemics, drought or floods, or those \"ungrateful\" lands that our ancestors had so much difficulty cultivating.</emphasis></p><p>Indeed, we do not totally control nature...</p><p>And it has always been a source of tragedy for humankind: the rise in water levels in many parts of the planet, the recurring drought situation, etc.</p><p>And even on a daily basis, I think that the changes to which we are called are not always irenic, far from it.</p><p>Those who begin organic farming face a loss of production in the first few years. They must find new reference points. Starting a vegetable garden is one thing, making it last is another...</p><p>It is not enough to sow or plant. You also have to deal with weeds, insects that feast on your plants, moles that love the soil that you have enriched and that is now full of earthworms, and so on.\u00a0</p><p>It is sometimes also a complex balance to be found between people and nature, the animal; I am thinking of the protection of wolves or bears.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What does it take to put this ecological conversion into action?</emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>It requires, without a doubt, an awareness that takes us off center.</p><p>Faced with the current catastrophic situation, we are forced to do so.</p><p>Many of us understand that we cannot continue in our comfort zone at this rate. \"To sin\" originally meant \"to miss the mark\".</p><p>We become aware of our mistakes. It is our own life that is at stake. Nature, perhaps, will be able to adapt.\u00a0</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Et Lentement Tout Bascule</emphasis> (And Slowly, Everything Changes; L'Escargot), the book he wrote with his wife Blandine, Arthur de Lassus uses these words for his own path of conversion: \"First I marvel at nature and I welcome it. Then I do everything I can to avoid harming it. Finally, I use technology to repair nature if it is damaged, but never to replace or augment nature itself.\"</p><p>For us Christians, it is also a matter of respecting what the Lord has entrusted to us.</p><p>In St. Paul's letter to the Romans (Chapter 8), it is the whole of creation that yearns for renewal, to be in the light of God: \"Creation is waiting with eagerness for the children of God to be revealed.\"</p><p>We sometimes forget that salvation is promised to the whole of creation: humanity, nature, animals, various species.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Following awareness comes the idea of repairing. How can we do this?</emphasis></p><p>The first step in permaculture is to think about the design, that is to say the way in which I am going to arrange the ground around my house, for example.</p><p>We invite you to leave a somewhat remote piece of land fallow so that nature can regenerate itself.</p><p>If we leave it like that, plants will appear, but also insects and birds will come back.</p><p>To repair is to accept to leave a wild space where nature can do its own work.\u00a0</p><p>I am also thinking of agroforestry. For a long time, hedges were cut down. Today, organic farmers are replanting trees. It is a form of repair.</p><p>Again, it is based on observation and a return to a certain wisdom. In the Bible, reparation comes through forgiveness.\u00a0</p><p>Under God's loving gaze, we acknowledge our fault and our desire, with God's grace, to change. In our faith, there is always this hope for a possibility.\u00a0</p><p>We are going towards a new land which, with Christ, has already begun. It is up to us to work, already today, through our choices, so that it happens.</p><p>Do I take my car or public transportation to work? Do I take the plane or the train to go on vacation? For how many kilometers? Is what is fastest, most convenient and cheapest the most ethical? What do I buy and how? How do I live in the time given to me?</p><p>Pope Francis tells us that everything is connected.</p><p>This means that the conversion to be experienced is situated at all levels: in our relationship to space, time, nature, ourselves, others and the All-Other that is God.</p><p>In our daily lives, we probably do things automatically.</p><p>We are invited to exercise discernment: what consequences will my choices have?</p><p>This process of questioning is part of the life and spiritual struggle of every Christian.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/uploads/news/2021/07/comment-vivre-la-conversion-cologique-14658-86.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A permaculture garden.

Commission president Ursula von der Leyen gave agriculture little weight during her State of the Union speech last week (16 September).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We wrote <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/agrifood-brief-the-agri-side-of-europes-man-on-the-moon-moment/\">on this space</url> that, although not directly mentioned, a reference to agriculture was implicit in the renewed ambition to reach climate neutrality by 2050, which needs much effort from farmers to be delivered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/EUAgri/status/1307680916437970947\">In a tweet</url>, the Commission's Directorate-General for Agriculture (DG AGRI) also relaunched von der Leyen's only bit of the discourse loosely referable to agriculture, as she highlighted the need to bring rural broadband in rural areas.</p><p>But it was not enough and von der Leyen's slip-up went undigested.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/eu-farmers-boss-farm-to-fork-to-be-revised-if-negative-impact-was-proved/\">an exclusive interview with EURACTIV.com</url>, the newly elected president of the European farmers association COPA, Christiane Lambert, said she was \"very disappointed\" about this forgetfulness.</p><p>\"How can a former minister of an agricultural country and now Commissioner of a large agricultural continent, whose first policy has been the Common agricultural policy (CAP) since 1960, make a speech as the head of the Union without talking about agriculture?\"</p><p>According to Lambert, the lack of recognition of the agricultural sector was\u00a0particularly galling in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, which she said has made everyone recognise the important role of agriculture.</p><p>For this reason, she revived the idea of taking stock of the current situation in European farming.</p><p>\"[A point in] my agenda is to make a State of the Agricultural Union and to say everything that agriculture brings to the EU: food, food security, health through food,\" she said.</p><p>It does not sound like a bad idea.</p><p>Over recent years, lots of words have been spent setting out plans to rethink farming as we know it.</p><p>In Spring, the Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/commission-upholds-highly-ambitious-targets-to-transform-eu-food-system/\">unveiled its pivotal food policy strategy</url>, the Farm to Fork (F2F), with the intention to anticipate - and shape - trends in the agri-food world that still have to come.</p><p>However, there is no \"what we need to be\" moment without a preliminary \"what we are now\" one.</p><p>Many have complained about the lack of an impact assessment behind the F2F that would have taken into account not only the finish line for European farming but the starting position as well.</p><p>A state-of-the-art today in the agri-food sector could also be useful in dispelling any doubt <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/video/unpacking-the-cap-exploring-the-most-common-concerns/\">on whether the main EU's farming subsidies programme is still a necessity</url> since NGOs are increasingly questioning its very existence - which is, however, heavily defended by farmers and the industry.</p><p>Perhaps one of the forthcoming EU presidencies - upcoming ones are Portugal, Slovenia and France - could get the fruit of opportunity and endorse the idea to shedding light on the actual contributions and damages of farming to Europe.</p><p>Taking into account, it goes without saying, any aspect in which agriculture can have an impact: not only from the environmental side but also from the social, economic and cultural point of view.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(G.F.)</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agrifood news this week</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU farmers boss: Farm to Fork to be

Now it is kicking down the door.</p><p>\u201cFire weather\u201d, the combination of heat, drought and wind that drives wildfires, is increasing in probability and will continue to do so in the Mediterranean, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/factsheets/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Regional_Fact_Sheet_Europe.pdf\">according to the IPCC</url>, leading to larger, more intense fires that threaten life, livelihood and ecosystems.</p><p>Increasing temperatures, tourism growth and urbanisation have pushed people and assets closer to high fire risk areas, warns a new report on the root causes of disasters. This, combined with fire suppression, where all fires are put out, including those that might prevent larger ones, has increased the risk of \u201cmega-fires\u201d.</p><p>Fires are a natural part of life in the Mediterranean, but Europe needs to work to make them less intense and more manageable, Doctor Zita Sebesvari, lead author of the Interconnected Disaster Risks Report, told EURACTIV.</p><p>The current fires are \u201cnot the fire we can live with\u201d, she added. So as well as cutting emissions, Europe needs to change how fires are seen, dealt with and built into land management.</p><p>Fighting fire with fire is a way to do this. It harks back to old land management techniques, using small, controlled fires to clear the underbrush without burning the trees. If this doesn\u2019t happen, underbrush can build up and create fuel for more intense mega-fires. Grazing sheep and goats is also a way to prevent this.</p><p>Other solutions include improving communication between agencies, like forestry and fire authorities, involving the private sector, civil society and communities in fire management planning and designing communities to ensure there is space between fire risk areas and homes.</p><p>And, as fire weather is driven up into northern and central Europe by climate change, even more countries will need to learn how to deal with fire, said Sebesvari.</p><p>The EU has put forward several proposals when it comes to managing land sustainably. According to the European Commission, the nature restoration law proposal \u201cis a key tool for adaptation and mitigation efforts as nature lessens the impact of natural disasters such as floods, droughts and heat waves\u201d.</p><p>\u201cRestored forests are less vulnerable to forest fires and droughts, due to a more diverse distribution of tree species, agroforestry measures make better use of soil moisture and reduce evaporation, restored forest and watersheds better regulate water flow and large-scale reforestation could increase global rainfall,\u201d a Commission spokesperson told EURACTIV.</p><p>The fires are here and they\u2019re here to stay. The question is whether we can live with them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u2013 Kira Taylor</emphasis></p><p>Welcome back!\u00a0</p><p>The Green Brief is back after the summer break!

nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite being taken into consideration only slightly in the EU's current farming subsidies programme, Conservation Agriculture is set to play a central role in the green architecture of the post-2020 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservation Agriculture (CA) lends itself easily to misinterpretations, as the term 'conservation' often indicates activities involving the preservation and restoration of degraded natural habitats to improve biodiversity.</p><p>However, although CA also promotes biodiversity, it mostly addresses issues referring to a different phenomenon: soil degradation.</p><p>Soil organic matter has been increasingly depleted thanks to land-use intensification and mono-cultures, while the use of heavy machinery stresses the soil by causing ground compaction.</p><p>CA works to address this via a suite of farming practices designed to avoid physical degradation, such as\u00a0growing a permanent protective plant cover on the soil and advocating for an agricultural production system based on a total or partial reduction of ploughing and tilling.</p><p>According to the European Conservation Agriculture Federation (ECAF), agronomic practices included in CA are based on three core principles to be fulfilled concomitantly: minimum soil disturbance, maintenance of permanent soil covers and cropping system diversity.</p><p>Advocators argue that these practices can bring economic savings for farmers in terms of energy efficiency, while also contributing to decreasing greenhouse gases emissions and building resilience of the agricultural system to climate change.</p><h><url

fundamental role to play in fighting climate change, says French socialist MEP</url></h><p>In an interview with EURACTIV's partner Le Journal de l'environnement, French socialist MEP \u00c9ric Andrieu (S&amp;D) said that climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic make it necessary to put agriculture back at the heart of the debate and to change the agricultural model with targeted tools and resources.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No-tillage and soil cover</emphasis></p><p>Among the CA's practices, no-tillage and groundcovers are the most widely known.</p><p>No-till, or reduced-till, agriculture is the practice of planting crops without tilling the soil, which is the conventional way of preparing the soil for planting by digging, stirring, and turning it over.</p><p>Although no-tillage and reduced tillage can help prevent run-off and erosion, the practices have been slow to take off in Europe.</p><p>According to the European Commission, reduced tillage or conservation tillage is practised on around 21.6% of the arable land in EU, while no-tillage is applied to only 4% of arable land.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-9-2020-001222_EN.html\">parliamentary question</url> filed last March, the Bulgarian MEP Atidzhe Alieva-Veli asked the EU executive whether it is going to promote the implementation of 'no-till technology' by including it as a green measure in the post-2020 CAP.</p><p>For the liberal lawmaker, \"no-till technology is an approach that should be encouraged as a regenerative form of agriculture that ensures not only high agricultural productivity but also soil regeneration.\"</p><p>Replying to Alieva-Velli, the Commission recognised the environmental and climate-related benefits of reducing mechanical disturbance of the soil, adding that the CAP already supports specific practices aimed to protect soil against degradation, including minimum or zero tillage, conservation of crop residues and green covers.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/no-till-farming-traditional-ideas-with-new-technologies-to-tackle-current-challenges/\">No-till farming: traditional ideas with new technologies to tackle current challenges</url></h><p>With soil health high on the EU policy agenda, EURACTIV spoke with US-based farmer Trey Hill, whose innovative approach to farming explores the potential of no-till agriculture, a practice that can contribute to the EU's sustainability goals although some dismiss it as \"technologically backward\".</p><p>As for ground-covers, they refer to the periods of the year when the soil is covered by residues or crops, including catch or cover crops.</p><p>Cover crops are efficient in reducing soil and nutrient loss by keeping the land continuously covered with vegetation during the whole year.</p><p>In the EU-28 during winter of 2010, 44% of the arable area was covered with normal winter crops, 5% with cover or intermediate crops and 9% with plant residues, while 25% was left as bare soil and 16 % of the arable area soil cover was not recorded.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Putting the 'CA' in CAP</emphasis></p><p>In the EU's current farming subsidies programme, a number of measures relevant to CA were included in the rural development policy, known as the CAP's second pillar.</p><p>Member states and regions can include these measures in their rural development programmes according to their specific needs and priorities.</p><p>Some aspects related to the main principles of conservation agriculture were also supported under Horizon2020, the EU's funding for research, and the European Innovation Partnership on agriculture productivity and sustainability.</p><p>However, the real step forward for CA's uptake is expected in the post-2020 CAP reform, as conservation agriculture practices can be promoted under the new system of eco-schemes, the 'green architecture' of the programme.</p><p>Eco-schemes are available under the direct payments framework, which constitutes the biggest chunk of EU farming funds.</p><p>CA practices are listed in three out of ten 'Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions' (GAECs) of the new eco-scheme and include rotation, no ploughing, soil cover, winter crops and crop rotation.</p><p>The eco-schemes aim to reward farmers for going even further in the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices, beyond the mandatory requirements set by conditionality.</p><p>As proposed by the Commission in the future CAP, these types of practices can contribute to meeting the enhanced environmental and climate ambitions of the agricultural policy.</p><p>As in the previous programme, CA practices could be promoted through environmental and climate management commitments available under the rural development framework.</p><h><url

drive for sustainability has seen the emergence of a number of new terminologies, including agroecology, agroforestry and urban farming.</p><p>The adoption of these new notions into the sustainability discourse has been rapid and has sometimes made new concepts difficult ...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Natasha Foote/Zoran

The EU needs to reform its biomass policies as quickly as possible,\" said Dr Louise Vet, former director of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW).</p><p>However, the Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) refrained from suggesting tougher bioenergy policies at the EU level. While some scientists have called on the European Union to stop considering bioenergy as carbon-neutral, the JRC report said this was a decision left to the member states.</p><p>\"The assumption of 'carbon neutrality' of wood bioenergy does not apply to the EU when the whole EU climate and energy framework is considered because the carbon impact of any change in forest management or wood use is reflected in each country's climate accounts,\" explains Giacomo Grassi, the JRC's leading expert on Europe's climate legislation.</p><p>\"The risk of excessive use of wood by bioenergy operators, leading to forest accounting debits and the need of additional emissions reduction in other sectors, may be managed at member states level through balanced national policies and incentives,\" Giacomo said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Review in 2026</emphasis></p><p>The Commission itself remained vague as to how it intends to follow up on the study, saying the JRC research \"will be a valuable contribution to the Commission's ongoing review of the Renewable Energy Directive\" and other climate laws that are coming up for revision in June.</p><p>The EU's renewable energy directive \"already includes strengthened sustainability criteria covering not only biofuels but also biomass for heat and power,\" the Commission spokesperson remarked, adding the legislation has to be implemented by member states \"at the latest by June 2021\".</p><p>These criteria \"will considerably strengthen the legislative framework in place to ensure the sustainable production and use of bioenergy,\" the spokesperson continued, pointing out that a review of these criteria is due \"in 2026\" under the directive.</p><p>\"This does not pre-judge the right of initiative of the Commission, if additional EU action is needed earlier,\" the spokesperson added, however.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/eu-climate-plan-blows-hot-and-cold-on-forestry-biomass/\">EU climate plan blows hot and cold on forestry, biomass</url></h><p>While recognising the positive role of forests in mitigating global warming, the European Commission has riled the agroforestry and biomass industries by stating its intention of limiting growth in the sector.</p><p>In the meantime, the EU executive will table \"operational guidance\" for national governments on how to apply the directive's forest biomass sustainability criteria. A so-called implementing act will be tabled in the first quarter of 2021, with a view \"to ensure a harmonised and robust implementation\" of the new rules, the spokesperson told EURACTIV.</p><p>For environmental activists, however, this falls way short of what is needed.</p><p>\"The Commission is shirking its responsibility. It basically admits in this report that EU bioenergy policies are accelerating climate change, then lobs the ball into the court of member states to fix the problem. We urgently need biomass rules to be tightened in the EU Renewable Energy Directive before any more damage is done,\" said Alex Mason from the WWF's European Policy Office.</p><p>The bioenergy industry, for its part, has urged the EU executive to focus on the enforcement of the existing renewable energy directive, which was last amended in 2018 and has not yet fully been implemented at the national level.</p><p>\"The study underlines that a swift and robust implementation of [the directive's] sustainability criteria will effectively minimise negative impacts associated with the use of woody biomass for energy,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://bioenergyeurope.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=281\">said Bioenergy Europe</url>, a trade association.</p><p>Outside Europe, the US pellet producers association (USIPA) drew attention to forestry certification schemes such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://sbp-cert.org/\">Sustainable Biomass Program</url>, saying the EU's union-wide sustainability criteria \"will underpin the sustainability of all biomass used in the EU,\" including wood pellets imported from abroad.</p><p>Sustainability risks caused by bioenergy use \"are currently mitigated through various independent globally recognised certifications, including SBP,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://theusipa.org/releases-%26-statements\">USIPA said</url>, adding those risks will be further mitigated with the implementation of the directive's sustainability criteria later this year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Commission launched an\u00a0<url

new EU Forest Strategy, which will be formally adopted later this year.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/news/commission-consults-new-eu-forest-strategy-2021-01-29_en\">statement</url>, the Commission said the strategy will \"aim at ensuring healthy and

normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">EU biodiversity strategy for 2030</url>, presented in May last year.</p><p>The public consultation is open until 19 April 2021.</p><p>\"To reach climate neutrality and reverse biodiversity loss, we need to protect and restore forests everywhere, including in the EU,\" said Frans Timmermans, the EU's climate chief. \"Our forests now are in a dire state and we must take urgent action to reverse the decline,\" he said.</p><h><url

Citing figures from cattle farming, he said the number of cows per 100 hectares of agricultural land reaches 43, 47, 59 and 67 on average in Poland, Italy, Denmark and France.</p><p>But in Belgium and the Netherlands, the numbers exceed 170, he pointed out.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mixed reactions in Parliament</emphasis></p><p>Wojciechowski's comments were well received at home.

Those, he said, can easily be misinterpreted and cause unnecessary tensions with farmers.</p><p>\"The issue deserves more explanation and an opportunity to discuss these figures openly with actors in the sector,\" he said, adding that European farmers will continue to make more efforts on animal welfare, as they have already done in the past.</p><h/><p>A new report commissioned by the Dutch True Animal Protein Price Coalition (TAPP) suggests that retail price of meat does not reflect the environmental costs associated with its production, and calls for a \"sustainability charge\" on meat.</p><p>Wojciechowski's comments on animal farming prompted criticisms from Copa-Cogeca, the EU farmer's organisation.</p><p>\"Agriculture production is complex and reflects many different local, national and historical aspects. It cannot be summarised or judged in a few tweets,\" said Copa-Cogeca Secretary-general Pekka Pesonen.</p><p>He also pointed out that all production sector and methods can make a positive impact on the environment and society, adding that the diversity of European farming reflects the diversity of the EU, \"which we believe is its strength.\"</p><p>In contrast, Wojciechowski's comments were well received by animal welfare groups. The EU ought to minimise suffering and protect farm animals, said Olga Kikou, head of EU office at Compassion in World Farming, an NGO.</p><p>Pigs, she said, are often raised in indoor systems and are routinely tail-docked, in violation of the EU Pigs Directive. EU member states have often failed to enforce this rule, despite the fact that mutilations are quite painful for animals, she added.</p><p>Roxane Feller, Secretary-General of AnimalhealthEurope, a group representing the European animal medicines industry, defended intensive livestock production practices, saying farmers already apply high standards when it comes to animal health and welfare.</p><p>According to her, innovations applied to large intensive farms have allowed farmers to deliver food with higher efficiency, without compromising on animal health and welfare.</p><p>\"We need to move away from this misconception that large-scale, modern farming will not contribute positively to a sustainable Europe,\" she said.</p><h/><p>A lively but polarised debate between farmers and an environmental organisation has exposed barely-concealed tensions between stakeholders over livestock farming, which could colour the political agenda of the next legislative term.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A matter dear to him</emphasis></p><p>Contacted by EURACTIV, Commission sources said the figures cited by Wojciechowsi were taken from the 2018 Statistical Yearbook of Poland's agriculture department and the Polish national statistical bureau.</p><p>Published on Wojciechowsi's personal twitter account, both tweets are to be regarded as his personal opinion on a matter particularly dear to him.</p><p>Before joining the Commission, Wojciechowski was chairman of the Animal Welfare Intergroup in the European Parliament. And before that, he was in charge of a report on animal welfare in livestock farming at the European Court of Auditors (ECA).</p><p>Commission sources also clarified that the EU executive will ensure that national strategic plans for agriculture are assessed against robust climate and environmental criteria. Those will encourage the use of sustainable practices such as precision agriculture, organic farming, agroecology, agroforestry as well as stricter animal welfare standards.</p><p>Some member states have more intensive farming systems than others, with varying impacts on climate change and the environment, the officials said.</p><p>\"We need to keep that in mind and support those most in need,\" the source added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon.

The ROCE is calculated after tax, at a standard rate of 25%.<sup>4</sup>At period-end.<sup>5</sup>Dividend to be submitted to shareholder approval at the Annual Shareholders Meeting of May 13, 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of Covid-19 on the Group's business in 2021</emphasis></p><p>In 2021, the world transitioned from a state of sudden shock and an economy on life support from governments and central banks to a possible \"new normal,\" to which the Michelin Group successfully adapted thanks to the strength of its assets and the unflagging commitment of its teams.</p><p>Following on from the initiatives undertaken in 2020, the Group continued to focus on its two core priorities: protecting the health and safety of its employees and partners and doing everything necessary to ensure business continuity.</p><p>The Group also took care to ensure strict compliance with national or local work-from-home directives, guaranteeing that every employee concerned had the resources required to perform his or her tasks remotely. Beside these Covid-related arrangements, Michelin has signed multi-year agreements with the unions that would offer employees in compatible jobs, and in compliance with local legislation, the opportunity of contractualizing, over time, their working from home either occasionally or on a regular basis.</p><p>In addition to the sales lost to the temporary restrictions on mobility during the year, the Covid-19 crisis had a significantly adverse impact on the Group's business in 2021.Supply chains were disrupted, primarily due to severe constraints in the maritime shipping industry. The robust upturn in global demand, combined with a shortage of cargo space (many shipowners had taken advantage of the 2020 decline in business to start upgrading their fleets) and the closure of certain ports due to Covid-19, caused extensive slowdowns across the supply chain, tightening raw material supplies and crimping the Group's ability to ship from some of its plants.The year was also shaped by labor shortages that impacted the manufacturing operations of both the Group and its suppliers. While government financial support may have temporarily delayed the return to work, it is also possible that, in a more structural way, these hiring difficulties arise from certain Covid-related social changes that have created a new relationship to work.In the face of these severe disruptions, Michelin never ceased operating throughout the year, attesting to the soundness and efficiency of its business continuity procedures, particularly those concerning business interruption risks in the production plants and supply continuity risks.Lastly, the strong rebound in global demand in 2021 spurred a sharp run-up in raw material and energy costs, in addition to the steep increase in supply chain costs. Over the full year, the Group was faced with approximately (EURO)1.2 billion in additional costs, which it successfully offset with productivity gains, assertive pricing management and a higher value product mix.</p><p>These spiraling costs and supply chain disruptions have not undermined Michelin's strategic objectives nor the resources deployed to meet them. Convinced of the validity of its strategic model, the Group has gained in strength during the crisis and reaffirms that its \"All Sustainable\" vision represents the keystone of its future performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Market Review</emphasis></p><p>Passenger car and Light truck tires</p><p>*Including Turkey</p><p>The global Original Equipment and Replacement Passenger car and Light truck tire market rose by 9% in number of tires sold in 2021, but ended the year 4% lower than in 2019.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Original Equipment</emphasis></p><p>After expanding a strong 28% in the first half due to low comparatives (caused by OEM plant shutdowns in first-half 2020), Original Equipment tire demand was heavily impacted in the second half by the worsening global shortage of semiconductors, which led to a 17% decline for the period. By quarter, demand fell a steep 19% in the third before recovering slightly to a 14% contraction in the fourth, following a relative easing of chip shortages in North America and China.</p><p>In all, the global Original Equipment tire market ended 2021 down 15% on 2019.</p><p>In every region, market growth was lifted by favorable comparatives in the first half and impacted by global semiconductor shortages in the second. By end-2021, only the Chinese market had returned more or less to 2019 levels, with just a 1% decline for the year. Elsewhere, markets contracted by 17% in the rest of Asia, 21% in North America and 27% in Western Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Replacement</emphasis></p><p>After surging 27% off of very favorable comparatives in the first half, global Replacement tire demand was stable year-on-year in the second six-month period and ended the year on a par with 2019.</p><p>After rebounding a sharp 22% in the first half and declining by a slight 2% in the third quarter, tire demand in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe (excluding the CIS)</emphasis>rose by 3% in the fourth quarter to end the year up 10% on 2020. The fourth quarter saw strong market growth in France (up 8%), Germany (up 6%) and Central Europe. Demand in the United Kingdom fell 10% from the prior-year period, which had been buoyed by the massive buildup of dealer inventory in fourth-quarter 2020 ahead of Brexit on January 1, 2021. The Spanish and Italian markets slipped 2% and 3% respectively over the period. In all, the market ended the year at close to 2019 levels in most countries, except Turkey (up 19%) and Italy (down 10%).</p><p>In the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CIS</emphasis>, demand surged 21% in the first half and remained on an upward trend, delivering a 10% gain in the second. By year-end, the market was up 15% on 2020 and a slight 2% ahead of 2019.</p><p>In<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">North and Central America</emphasis>, demand remained very high in the first nine months, ending the period up 23% on 2020 and 7% on 2019, supported by favorable comparatives and dealer inventory rebuilding. It turned down in the final three months, losing 7% in comparison with the prior-year period, when dealer inventories rose on speculative buying ahead of possible new US duties on tires imported from South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan. In all, the market ended the year up 14% on 2020 and 4% ahead of 2019.</p><p>Demand in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South America</emphasis>climbed a steep 39% over the first nine months, reflecting the impact of Covid-19 on the first three quarters of 2020. The market then flattened out over the final three months to end the year up 27% on 2020 and a slight 2% ahead of 2019.</p><p>After rebounding 15% in the first half thanks to very favorable first-quarter comparatives, demand in<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">China</emphasis>moved back in line with 2019 in the second six months of the year. However, it declined 7% compared with second-half 2020, which had seen a particularly robust 8% rebound as the country emerged from lockdown.

The Group is continuing to deploy its growth strategy in new ecosystems around and beyond tires. In 2021, this expansion was driven primarily by sales of precision polymers and fleet management solutions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Continuously create value:</emphasis></p><p>The Group is committed to achieving at least three points of value creation each year from 2023 onwards. Based on a weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%, this implies at least a 10.5% annual return on capital employed. In 2021, the Group revised the definition of its ROCE indicator by adding back goodwill, acquired intangible assets and investments in and loans to equity-accounted companies to economic assets. Consolidated ROCE stood at 10.3% in 2021, compared to 6% in 2020 (which is not material due to the disruptions caused by the emergence of Covid-19) and 10.0% in 2019. The gain since 2019, which reflects the improvements in both the Group's profitability and its optimization of capital employed, is perfectly in line with the target of 10.5% in 2023.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maintain the strength of the MICHELIN brand:</emphasis></p><p>The brand vitality indicator rose sharply in 2021, reflecting the rollout of the MICHELIN brand campaign and a weaker performance by the other brands tracked in the panel.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maintain the sustained pace of product and service innovation:</emphasis></p><p>In line with objectives, the Group maintained its product/service vitality indicator above 30% in 2021, with 31% of its products and services marketed during the year having been introduced in the last three years.

It will make these impacts easier to understand by focusing on five priority areas: energy use, CO2emissions, organic solvent use, water withdrawals, and waste production. The i-MEP is described in more detail in the methodological note in section 4 of the 2020 URD.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Achieve carbon neutrality in manufacturing and energy use by 2050:</emphasis></p><p>The 2021 i-MEP score indicates a sustained reduction in CO2emissions, supported by the robustness of the energy efficiency improvement initiatives that have restored performance to 2019 levels despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and the inclusion of the third synthetic rubber production plant. In addition, the percentage of renewable energy in the Group's total use rose to 18% from 13% in 2019, reflecting the installation of photovoltaic panels at several plants and the purchase of electricity from certified renewable sources in Brazil and Serbia. The Group's medium-term objectives will be supported by a larger capital expenditure budget averaging (EURO)60 million a year. By 2030, all the technological levers identified in the roadmap will make it possible to meet the objective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Help achieve carbon neutrality in use</emphasis></p><p>A number of new tires introduced in 2021 deliver significant gains in energy efficiency, such as the MICHELIN E-Primacy and the MICHELIN CrossClimate 2 for Passenger cars and the MICHELIN X Multi Energy D for trucks and the 275/70R22.5 MICHELIN X Incity EV Z for electric buses. The projects now under way have put the roadmap on track to meet the target of a 10% gain in energy efficiency by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Set the global standard for the environmental footprint of manufacturing facilities:</emphasis></p><p>The first year of the Group's new environmental indicator revealed better-than-expected improvements in all five of its components, even as output rose over the period. Water withdrawals, for example, were reduced by 7%, notably by deploying water recycling and reuse solutions at a number of plants across the Group. These results show that the indicator has got off to a good start in meeting the target of a one-third reduction by 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ensure that tires are made entirely of sustainable materials:</emphasis></p><p>Michelin's indicator for the year was in line with the roadmap to reach 40% sustainable materials in Group tires by 2030. Due to the nature of the issues addressed, growth in this percentage has not been nor will be linear over the indicator's time frame.In 2021, improvements were delivered on schedule in the maturity of specific technologies in Group R&amp;D projects and in the traceability of certain supply chains with our suppliers. These initiatives did not yet have a material impact on tonnages used in 2021, as measured by the indicator.</p><p>Valuing the cost of negative externalities</p><p>In 2020, as part of its All Sustainable strategy, Michelin began translating its environmental impacts into euros by valuing (i) its CO2emissions from all of Scopes 1 and 2 and part of Scope\u00a03 (upstream and downstream transportation and distribution); (ii) its volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; and (iii) its water withdrawals. This process is designed to facilitate the representation of environmental issues, enhance transparency and provide a valuation method for use in assessing the performance of Group units or during acquisitions. The levers to reduce these impacts have been clearly identified.</p><p>A reduction from around (EURO)330 million in 2019 to around (EURO)300 million in 2023 was announced at the Capital Markets Day on April 8, 2021.</p><p>In response to the sharp run-up in carbon quota prices on the European market in late 2021, Michelin raised the cost per ton of CO2used to value its emissions to (EURO)100. As a result, the total cost of externalities in 2019 is now valued at (EURO)506 million. In 2021, the total cost of valued externalities stood at (EURO)508 million, up just 0.4% on the revised 2019 figure. In response to supply chain disruptions, the Group occasionally had to resort to more costly workarounds on an as-needed basis, which had an adverse impact on CO2 emissions for the year.

But this time promises to be different. Last year's international headlines caught Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his allies by surprise. We can expect their response to the next fire season to contain more smoke and mirrors. It is crucial to focus on their actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deforestation is increasing at an alarming pace. It has grown by 94 percent since August 2019, compared with the previous year's rate, which had been the highest in a decade. Unlike drier areas in Australia or California, the rainforest can't catch on fire unless humans cut trees down. The Amazon is being devastated on an industrial scale, and for what? Criminal groups are targeting public lands for low-productivity cattle ranching and mining. Illegal land-grabbing schemes destroy biodiversity and the potentials of bioeconomies, enriching well-connected individuals. Mr. Bolsonaro and his administration encourage it.</p><p>Many in Brazil's elites accepted a Faustian bargain: So long as the government's economic agenda remains friendly, they look the other way. Now, with all eyes on the pandemic crises, the Amazon and its Indigenous groups face existential threats, while criminals act as if they have permission to plunder.</p><p>Oversight and fines for infractions have declined substantially. Last month, Ricardo Salles, the environment minister, fired a director in an enforcement role after he carried out an operation to dismantle illegal mining. The federal government has kept key positions vacant and proposed huge budget cuts to environmental agencies, undermining fire prevention, monitoring and control. The president and his allies support a bill that provides further incentives to deforestation, allowing land grabbers to gain ownership of public lands, including Indigenous territories.</p><p>Earlier this year Mr. Bolsonaro announced an Amazon Council headed by the vice president, composed of military and cabinet members. One of its luminaries, Paulo Guedes, the University of Chicago-trained economy minister, prefers populist tropes to an evidence-based approach. At Davos he claimed that poor people destroy the forest because they have to eat. Deforestation relies on the labor of the poor, but it requires large sums of money and leaves behind desolation and social conflict. There is no evidence that it remedies poverty. Mr. Salles has a history of cozying up to infractors, shunning specialists and trolling environmentalists. In public, he often speaks in platitudes and increasingly pays lip service to environmental concerns. In a recently released video of a cabinet meeting, he encouraged weakening environmental protections while the press is distracted by the pandemic.</p><p>The vice president, Gen. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, has been particularly sensitive to the perception of foreign investors. Recently, in an online event hosted by a major bank, he promised that troops would be mobilized to combat fires and deforestation in the Amazon. On May 6, a federal decree gave the armed forces jurisdiction over those efforts, a measure with potential to sideline independent experts.</p><p>We cannot settle for photo opportunities. Mr. Mour\u00e3o's Amazon Council does not include representatives from Brazil's world-class scientific community, nor from the Indigenous and civil society organizations engaged in safeguarding the forest. The vice president toes the party line in his support of the legislative proposal known as \"the land-grabbers' bill,\" against the recommendations of specialists, including prosecutors.</p><p>Scientists agree that we are nearing a tipping point in deforestation that will lead to the Amazon's \"savannization.\" This would have dire consequences not only for the forest, but also for Brazil's agriculture, urban water and energy supplies, and global temperatures. The ecological and socio-economic impacts are unfathomable, and they include the threat of zoonotic diseases. There is already evidence connecting the destruction of wetlands and rainforest to drought in the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan region, halfway across the continent.</p><p>If we lose the Amazon, it won't be for a lack of alternatives. Brazil has the know-how to turn this around. Marina Silva, the minister of the environment between 2003 and 2008, worked to drastically reduce the rate deforestation, which at the time was even higher.</p><p>International organizations and investors need to use their leverage and pressure counterparts in Brazil. The bill allowing land grabbers to gain legal title, a boon to deforestation, could come up for a vote anytime. Brazil's congressional leaders have been responsive to threats of sanctions, boycotts and divestment. If our current crises do not instill a sense of responsibility and calls to action, then we can expect what feels like a slow-burn apocalypse to get much worse.</p><p>The future of the forest's biodiversity depends on its human diversity. Demarcated Indigenous lands and extractive reserves, where local communities engage in sustainable and often traditional economic activities, have proved to be effective against the illegal destruction of the forest. That is one reason Mr. Bolsonaro and his allies are working so hard to erode Indigenous rights.</p><p>And contrary to what many might think, the forest has sustained complex societies without being destroyed. Millions of people inhabited the Amazonian basin before Europeans arrived. Some archaeologists and ethnobotanists now think of the forest as an engineered landscape, a great garden, resulting from tens of thousands of years of human interactions with fauna and flora. Talking about a return to the \"virgin\" forest never made much sense. Instead, we need to recognize that shamans can be more grounded than C.E.O.s. There is nothing practical-minded about enabling the degradation of ecosystems on which the stability of the planet depends.</p><p>The prescription is straightforward: Allow research institutions and environmental agencies to do their jobs, instead of dismantling them. Only then can discussions about bioeconomies move forward. A number of initiatives already integrate local peoples and knowledge with responsible partners. Cosmetics, ecotourism and agroforestry (from a\u00e7ai to incipient cocoa production), for example, all tend to be more lucrative than cattle ranching.</p><p>The present moment should serve as an alert to the fragility of so much of what we take for granted. No matter what, the Amazon will burn again. But we should avoid at all costs having to find out what it would be like to live in a planet without it. If we maintain course, it is a matter of time. Working to avoid the destruction of the world's greatest rainforest by criminals and the ideologues that empower them should be low-hanging fruit.

It may take us just a few decades to destroy them, unless we change course.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rainforests are unique ecosystems of immense complexity that nurture an incredible diversity of plants, animals and micro-organisms. Bulldozers and chain saws don't care about that.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some people think of rainforests as faraway places that have little to do with their day-to-day existence. But millions of people live in cities and settlements throughout the Amazon. Many endure precarious conditions and become sources of cheap labor. The forest is sometimes destroyed in their name, with the justification that it develops and improves the economy. In Brazil, deforestation rates are breaking records. And if we continue to destroy the forest, we can expect dire consequences - not just for the region, but for the planet.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the past 50 years, human intervention has been increasingly disrupting the ecological balance of the Amazon. Climate change has led to an increase in temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius across the basin, and to more frequent severe droughts. The droughts of 2005, 2010 and 2015-16 were among the worst in more than 100 years. Since 1980, there's been an increase in the duration of dry seasons by three to four weeks in the more degraded areas of the Amazon.       </p><p>Rainforests also increase evaporation and keep surfaces cool. Deforestation could cause temperatures in the basin to increase by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius by 2050. It reduces rainfall, because trees cycle moisture back into the atmosphere.       </p><p>This combination of higher temperatures, more extreme droughts and the continued use of fires to clear land for farming or cattle is turning the previously fire-resilient forest into a more vulnerable ecosystem. And we are seeing forests burn.       </p><p>As a result, the Amazon may be not far from the tipping point when large portions of the forest turn into tropical savannas.       </p><p>A study that one of us published in the journal Science Advances estimates that if deforestation rates over the entire basin exceed 20 to 25 percent of the forest area, it would lead to an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">irreversible</emphasis> process of savannization. Today roughly 17 percent of the forests have already been clear-cut and deforestation rates have increased since 2015 in most Amazonian countries. In Brazil's Amazon, more than 5,000 square miles of forest (the size of the state of Connecticut) will likely be destroyed this year alone. At this rate, we could hit the tipping point within 20 to 30 years.       </p><p>The effects of this process won't be limited to the basin alone. Warmer temperatures would be spread southward by the hotter air, affecting the large agriculture region south of the Amazon.       </p><p>The moist air that normally flows south out of the Amazon - known as aerial rivers - would be reduced, very likely affecting rainfall in the La Plata river basin in southeastern South America.       </p><p>Savannization of large portions of the Amazon would induce a massive loss of species of plants and animals, and be devastating to Indigenous cultures. Savannization of more than 50 percent of the Amazon would also result in emissions of more than 200 billion tons of carbon and, at the same time, lead to a dramatic reduction in the forest's crucial role as a carbon sink for the planet.       </p><p>Last but not least, the disturbance of this ecological balance could generate a spillover of viruses, bacteria and parasites, posing even higher risks of future pandemics.       </p><p>How can we develop sustainable pathways that would allow us to avoid this tipping point in the Amazon?       </p><p>Amazonian inhabitants can lead the process of making deep socioeconomic transformations, fostering more responsible development and conservation strategies for the region.       </p><p>In the last decades, the policy debate on the development of the Amazon has been dominated by two irreconcilable views. On the one hand, there is a vision for conserving natural areas as Indigenous territories and public lands. On the other, there is a push to develop the land and use its natural resources for agriculture, energy and mining, which causes rapid cycles of degradation.       </p><p>The first model could work from an ecological standpoint, but the region's challenges are now also of an urban nature. More than 30 million people live in the Amazon, a vast majority in cities and towns marked by poverty. These people need livelihoods.       </p><p>There are new initiatives adhering to the principles of an innovative, decentralized bioeconomy rooted in the Amazon, in contrast to treatment of the forest only as a producer of commodities for industries based elsewhere. The region can be a home to humans and biodiversity.       </p><p>That means investing in crops that can be sustainably grown in the forest, like Brazil nuts, cocoa and acai berry, instead of soy and cattle. It also means making sure the profits stay with local people who act as guardians of the forest.       </p><p>Locals are already active in the early stages of processing products extracted from forests and rivers or cultivated in agroforestry or aquaculture systems. In Mato Grosso, for example, Indigenous communities harvest Brazil nuts that they sell for 50 cents a pound to a local cooperative. After being processed and packaged, the same nuts are sold at $4 a pound, while a consumer in a major city is likely to pay around $13 - about 26 times the value of the sale of the raw material.       </p><p>One forest product - the a\u00e7ai berry - has reached global markets and is more profitable than crops like soy or cattle that require destroying the forest. It generates over $1 billion a year to the Amazon economy and has improved the livelihoods of more than 300,000 producers in the region.       </p><p>Yet to change the economic dynamics more significantly, you also need to develop bioindustries in the Amazon - and we now have technologies to create mobile, compact and ecologically sound factories in the rainforest.       </p><p>You might call it Amazon 4.0, harnessing the technologies of the fourth Industrial Revolution. The main objective is to unleash new economic, and inclusive, opportunities for the protection of ecosystems and communities throughout the region, including Indigenous and traditional forest peoples, who are its guardians, as well as urban populations.       </p><p>One of us is working on a project that brings together nongovernmental organizations, investors, public universities and Amabela, the Women's Association of Rural Workers of Belterra, in Par\u00e1, Brazil. The idea is for this group to produce artisanal chocolates using cupua\u00e7u, an Amazonian fruit. They won't just harvest the ingredients, but also process and package them. The group is building a \"biofactory\" in their community, with equipment like three-dimensional food printers, solar cookers and computers.       </p><p>Cheaper solar power and digital communications will make it possible for minifactories like these to operate in remote areas. An app can provide access to global markets, and traceability software that is being developed can ensure that production complies with environmental standards. Locals can be taught how to operate these technologies in just a few weeks.       </p><p>Other \"biofactories\" in the works involve gourmet oils and Brazil nuts, a multimillion-dollar industry. Local harvesters could produce Brazil nut flour, vacuum-sealed roasted nuts and cold-pressed nut oil, for example. There is also potential for mobile genomics labs, with portable genome sequencers, which can be of inestimable value to science and medicine. Forest communities can learn to sequence the genome of plants, animals, and even microorganisms, based on their knowledge of species with particular properties, which they could then register through blockchain systems. A genetic library of microorganisms would be key to tackling pathogens out of the Amazon.       </p><p>We cannot take the rain forest's resilience for granted. We are on path to destroying the Amazon. Turning it into a savanna would get us closer to an uninhabitable Earth. Instead, we can create a standing-forest, flowing-river bioeconomy that fuses scientific and traditional knowledge, preserving biodiversity and improving livelihoods for generations to come.       </p><p>Bruno Carvalho is a professor and co-director of the Harvard Mellon Urban Initiative and the Brazil Studies Program at Harvard University.

Growth was supported by continued momentum in retail sales, steady recovery of out-of-home channels, increased pricing and market share gains.Total reported sales increased by 3.3% to CHF 87.1 billion (2020: CHF 84.3 billion). Foreign exchange reduced sales by 1.3%. Net divestitures had a negative impact of 2.9%.The underlying trading operating profit (UTOP) margin was 17.4%, decreasing by 30 basis points. The trading operating profit (TOP) margin decreased by 290 basis points to 14.0% on a reported basis, largely reflecting impairments related to the Wyeth business.Underlying earnings per share increased by 5.8% in constant currency and by 5.1% on a reported basis to CHF 4.42. Earnings per share increased by 41.1% to CHF 6.06 on a reported basis, mainly reflecting the gain on the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares.Free cash flow decreased by 14.9% to CHF 8.7 billion, reflecting temporarily higher capital expenditure and inventory levels.Board proposes a dividend of CHF 2.80 per share, an increase of 5 centimes, marking 27 consecutive years of dividend growth. In total, CHF 13.9 billion were returned to shareholders in 2021 through a combination of dividend and share buybacks.Continued progress in portfolio management.

Continued moderate underlying trading operating profit margin improvements.

Our organic growth was strong, with broad-based market share gains, following disciplined execution, rapid innovation and increased digitalization. We limited the impact of exceptional cost inflation through diligent cost management and responsible pricing. Our robust underlying earnings per share growth shows the resilience of our value creation model. The entire Nestl\u00e9 team demonstrated exemplary perseverance and agility in a challenging environment.</p><p>The evolution of our portfolio continued, focusing on categories with attractive growth opportunities and differentiated offerings. Recent examples include the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company and the divestiture of the mainstream water brands in North America.</p><p>Our sustainability agenda further progressed as we enhance the well-being of our consumers, help regenerate the environment and strengthen the farming communities in our supply chains.</p><p>We continued to create value for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation, steadily increasing dividends and significant share buybacks. Going forward, we are confident in the strength of our value creation model.\"</p><p>Group Results</p><p>* 2020 figures restated following the disclosure of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nespresso as standalone segments from 2021 onwards (previously combined and presented in Other businesses).</p><p>Group sales</p><p>Organic growth was 7.5%, with RIG of 5.5%. Pricing increased to 2.0%, reaching 3.1% in the fourth quarter, to offset significant cost inflation.</p><p>Growth was broad-based across most geographies and categories. Organic growth reached 7.2% in developed markets, the highest level in more than a decade, based mostly on RIG with positive pricing. Organic growth in emerging markets was 7.8%, with robust RIG and positive pricing.</p><p>By product category, the largest contributor to organic growth was coffee, fueled by strong momentum for the three main brands Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and Starbucks. Sales of Starbucks products grew by 17.1% to reach CHF 3.1 billion, generating over CHF 1 billion of incremental sales compared with 2018. Purina PetCare posted double-digit growth, led by science-based and premium brands Purina Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and Purina ONE, as well as veterinary products. Prepared dishes and cooking aids reported high single-digit growth, based on strong sales developments for Maggi, Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine. Sales in vegetarian and plant-based food grew at a double-digit rate, reaching around CHF 800 million. Nestl\u00e9 Health Science recorded double-digit growth, reflecting strong demand for vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as healthy-aging products. Dairy saw mid single-digit growth, based on strong demand for premium and fortified milks, coffee creamers and ice cream. Sales in confectionery grew at a high single-digit rate, supported by a strong sales development for KitKat and gifting products. Water posted high single-digit growth, driven by premium brands and a recovery in out-of-home channels. Infant Nutrition reported negative growth, impacted by a sales decline in China and lower birth rates globally. Sales of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) products continued to see robust growth, reaching CHF 1.2 billion.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 6.4%. E-commerce sales grew by 15.1%, reaching 14.3% of total Group sales, with strong momentum in most categories, particularly Purina PetCare, coffee and Nestl\u00e9 Health Science. Organic growth in out-of-home channels reached 24.5%, helped by a low base of comparison due to the pandemic.</p><p>Net divestitures decreased sales by 2.9%, largely related to the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Yinlu and Herta transactions. Divestitures were partially offset by acquisitions, including the core brands of The Bountiful Company and Freshly. The negative impact on sales from foreign exchange moderated to 1.3%. Total reported sales increased by 3.3% to CHF 87.1 billion.</p><p>Underlying Trading Operating Profit</p><p>Underlying trading operating profit increased by 1.4% to CHF 15.1 billion. The underlying trading operating profit margin decreased by 30 basis points to 17.4% in constant currency and on a reported basis, reflecting time delays between cost inflation and pricing actions. The one-off integration costs related to the acquisition of The Bountiful Company's core brands had a negative impact of around 10 basis points.</p><p>Gross margin decreased by 130 basis points to 47.8%, reflecting significant broad-based inflation for commodity, packaging, freight and energy costs. The impact of cost inflation, which increased strongly in the second half, was partly offset by price increases, operating leverage and efficiencies.</p><p>Distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 20 basis points, mainly as a result of the disposal of the Nestl\u00e9 Water brands in North America.</p><p>Marketing and administration expenses decreased as a percentage of sales by 80 basis points, based on strong operating leverage and efficiencies. At the same time, the Group continued to invest for growth and increased its consumer-facing marketing expenses in constant currency.</p><p>Restructuring expenses and net other trading items increased by CHF 2.3 billion to CHF 3.0 billion, largely reflecting impairments related to the Wyeth business. As a result, trading operating profit decreased by 14.6% to CHF 12.2 billion and the trading operating profit margin decreased by 290 basis points on a reported basis to 14.0%.</p><p>Net Financial Expenses and Income Tax</p><p>Net financial expenses were unchanged at CHF 873 million, as a lower cost of debt offset higher average net debt.</p><p>The Group reported tax rate decreased by 330 basis points to 20.9%, mainly as a result of one-off items in 2020, including the divestment of the U.S. ice cream business. The underlying tax rate decreased by 40 basis points to 20.7%, mainly due to the geographic and business mix.</p><p>Reduction of L'Or\u00e9al stake</p><p>On December 15, 2021, Nestl\u00e9 sold 22.26 million of L'Or\u00e9al shares for a total consideration of CHF 9.3 billion. Following the transaction, Nestl\u00e9 owns 20.1% of L'Or\u00e9al and remains fully supportive of the company's value creation strategy.</p><p>Net Profit and Earnings Per Share</p><p>Net profit grew by 38.2% to CHF 16.9 billion. Net profit margin increased by 490 basis points to 19.4%. The gain on the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares more than offset higher asset impairments and other one-off items.</p><p>Underlying earnings per share increased by 5.8% in constant currency and by 5.1% on a reported basis to CHF 4.42. Sales growth was the main contributor to the increase. Nestl\u00e9's share buyback program contributed 1.3% to the underlying earnings per share increase, net of finance costs. Earnings per share increased by 41.1% to CHF 6.06 on a reported basis.</p><p>Cash Flow</p><p>Cash generated from operations decreased from CHF 17.2 billion to CHF 16.6 billion, mainly due to slightly higher working capital at year-end. In the context of significant supply chain disruptions, the Group increased its inventory levels temporarily. Free cash flow decreased from CHF 10.2 billion to CHF 8.7 billion, mainly due to a temporary increase in capital expenditure to meet strong volume demand, particularly for Purina PetCare and coffee.</p><p>Dividend</p><p>At the Annual General Meeting on April 7, 2022, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 2.80 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. If approved, this will be the company's 27th consecutive annual dividend increase. The company has maintained or increased its dividend in Swiss francs over the last 62 years. Nestl\u00e9 is committed to maintaining this long-held practice to increase the dividend in Swiss francs every year.</p><p>The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 8, 2022. The net dividend will be payable as from April 13, 2022.</p><p>Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on March 31, 2022 at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights.</p><p>Share Buyback Programs</p><p>During 2021, the Group repurchased CHF 6.3 billion of Nestl\u00e9 shares.</p><p>On December 30, 2021, Nestl\u00e9 terminated its existing CHF 20 billion share buyback program initiated on January 3, 2020. Between January 3, 2020 and December 30, 2021, the Group repurchased 123.1 million of its shares for a total consideration of CHF 13.1 billion at an average price of CHF 106.08 per share.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 initiated a new share buyback program of up to CHF 20 billion on January 3, 2022. The company expects to buy around CHF 10 billion of shares in the first twelve months. The new share buyback program shall be completed by the end of December 2024.</p><p>Net Debt</p><p>Net debt increased by CHF 1.6 billion to reach CHF 32.9 billion as at December 31, 2021. The dividend payment, share buybacks and the net cash outflow from acquisitions and divestitures more than offset proceeds from the disposal of L'Or\u00e9al shares and free cash flow generation.</p><p>Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)</p><p>The Group's ROIC decreased by 250 basis points to 12.2%, as a result of impairments related to the Wyeth business. Excluding Wyeth business impairments, the Group's ROIC was 14.2%.</p><p>Portfolio Management</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 completed acquisitions and divestments with a total value of around CHF 9.9 billion in 2021.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is transforming its global water business, sharpening its focus on international premium and mineral water brands and healthy hydration products. In March, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of Essentia Water, a premium functional water brand in the U.S., and the sale of its regional spring water brands, purified water business and beverage delivery service in the U.S. and Canada.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science continues to focus on building the leading global nutrition and health platform. In July, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of Nuun, a leading company in the fast-growing functional hydration market, and entered into an agreement with Seres Therapeutics to jointly commercialize SER-109, an investigational oral microbiome therapeutic in the U.S. and Canada. In August, Nestl\u00e9 completed the acquisition of the core brands of The Bountiful Company for USD 5.75 billion. The Bountiful Company is the number one pure-play company in the highly attractive global nutrition and supplement category.</p><p>Building on the successful global coffee alliance, Nestl\u00e9 continues to expand the reach of Starbucks branded coffee and tea products outside Starbucks retail stores. In July, Nestl\u00e9 and Starbucks announced a new collaboration to bring Starbucks ready-to-drink coffee beverages to select markets across South-East Asia, Oceania and Latin America.</p><p>New Zone structure</p><p>As of January 1, 2022, the company is organized into five Zones: Zone North America, Zone Latin America, Zone Europe, Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa, and Zone Greater China. Nestl\u00e9 will report the sales and growth numbers of the new Zone structure for the first time on April 21, 2022.</p><p>The new structure will strengthen the company's market-led approach and enhance Nestl\u00e9's ability to win in a rapidly changing environment. It also underscores the company's deep commitment to succeeding in all parts of the world, including its two top markets North America and Greater China.</p><p>Zone Americas (AMS)</p><p>8.5% organic growth: 4.8% RIG; 3.7% pricing.North America posted high single-digit organic growth, with robust RIG and positive pricing.Latin America reported double-digit organic growth, with both strong RIG and pricing.The underlying trading operating profit margin increased by 30 basis points to 20.8%, mainly due to the divestment of the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America brands.</p><p>Organic growth was 8.5%, with strong RIG of 4.8%. Pricing increased to 3.7%, reaching 5.2% in the fourth quarter. Net divestitures reduced sales by 6.6%, as the divestment of the Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America brands more than offset the acquisitions of Freshly and Essentia Water. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2.5%. Reported sales in Zone AMS decreased by 0.7% to CHF 33.8 billion.</p><p>Zone AMS reported high single-digit organic growth, building on a strong sales development in 2020.

Foreign exchange negatively impacted sales by 1.8%. Reported sales in Nestl\u00e9 Health Science increased by 45.0% to CHF 4.8 billion.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science posted double-digit organic growth, building on a strong sales development in 2020, with broad-based market share gains across channels and markets. Growth was supported by e-commerce momentum, innovation, geographic expansion and strong execution in the supply chain.</p><p>Consumer Care posted double-digit growth. Vitamins, minerals and supplements that support health and the immune system continued to see strong demand. Vital Proteins almost doubled its sales. Garden of Life saw continued strength, driven by new product launches such as Dr. Formulated MD Protein for improved heart health and immunity. Sales for the newly acquired core brands of The Bountiful Company grew at a high single-digit rate, led by Nature's Bounty and Solgar. Healthy-aging products recorded double-digit growth, supported by Boost in North America.</p><p>Medical Nutrition reported high single-digit growth, with robust demand for pediatric care products Alth\u00e9ra, Alfar\u00e9 and Alfamino, as well as for Compleat, a comprehensive nutritional tube-feeding formula. The rollout of Palforzia, the peanut allergy treatment, was impacted by the pandemic. In the fourth quarter, the product started to see increased adoption in the U.S. and was also launched in the United Kingdom and Germany.</p><p>By geography, the Americas and AOA posted double-digit growth. Sales in EMENA grew at a high single-digit rate.</p><p>The underlying trading operating profit margin of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science decreased by 290 basis points, mainly due to investments in Palforzia, increased consumer-facing marketing expenses and one-off integration costs related to the acquisition of The Bountiful Company's core brands.</p><p>Business as a force for good: innovative plan to tackle child labor risks and achieve full traceability in cocoa</p><p>On January 27, 2022, Nestl\u00e9 unveiled an innovative plan building on its longstanding efforts to tackle child labor risks in cocoa production. The company plans to invest a total of CHF 1.3 billion by 2030, more than tripling its current annual investment. A novel incentive program aims to help farmers and their families steadily and sustainably build social and economic stability. This new program focuses on complex root causes of child labor, including poverty, school enrollment and agricultural practices.</p><p>The program, which builds on the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan, rewards practices that increase crop productivity and help secure additional sources of income. By engaging in these practices, families can earn up to CHF 500 in additional annual income for the first two years of the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UrE6SDiOG93jCmB4VK6BfpMtXtxCmP2CBQ6vnvl1R-0oR1NHKwYisyc_I4ChAcJTmmBPgtGG1bRXp_TEnm3FvslR1svejZ75umipjfOzD5FvhD0dZ9F_8U7slUhEDzs6zKow8i3sO6d6RTDTmvB28fPsfLE-lDy6VmBv2g-zj4cf6Wo_9Ah1eSagXWErh8rVIZBbgykO_tAuhRn3Z7HwLw==\">program (pdf, 10Mb)</url>leveled at CHF 250 as the program starts delivering tangible results.</p><p>As the incentive is not paid based on volume of cocoa sold, it also provides smaller farmers meaningful support, leaving no one behind. These payments are on top of support provided by the government of producing countries and the premiums Nestl\u00e9 pays for certified cocoa, independently audited against the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard.</p><p>The program divides the payments between the traditionally male farmer and his female spouse, typically responsible for the household and childcare, thereby helping to empower women and improve gender equality.</p><p>Practices that Nestl\u00e9 is incentivizing through the program include:</p><p>Enrolling all children in the household aged 6-16 in school.Implementing good agricultural practices, such as pruning, which increase crop productivity.Performing agroforestry activities to increase climate resilience, like planting shade trees.Generating diversified incomes, for example through growing other crops, raising livestock such as chickens, beekeeping or processing other products like cassava.</p><p>In line with Nestl\u00e9's Creating Shared Value approach, the company will help ensure farmers have the resources, training, and social and financial structures to make lasting changes.</p><p>Building on the positive results of an initial pilot in 2020 Nestl\u00e9 conducted with 1\u00a0000 farmers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the company will run a sizeable test program with 10\u00a0000 families in the country starting this year. The aim is to reach approximately 160\u00a0000 cocoa-farming families in Nestl\u00e9's global cocoa supply chain by 2030.</p><p>As part of the program, Nestl\u00e9 will transform the sourcing of cocoa to achieve full traceability and segregation of its cocoa products from origin to factory. This new effort will help drive accountability and transparency across Nestl\u00e9's supply chain and the broader industry at a time when customers, employees and communities increasingly expect companies to deliver on their shared values.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 will introduce a range of products with cocoa sourced from this innovative program, offering consumers the opportunity to support improvement in farmer family livelihoods and protection of children. This will start with a selection of KitKat products in 2023.</p><p>Outlook</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2022 outlook:</emphasis>we expect organic sales growth around 5% and underlying trading operating profit margin between 17.0% and 17.5%.

Judging by the Commission's 2030 climate plan, presented last week, this is now looking like a distinct possibility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The capacity of forests to act as a \"carbon sink\" - absorbing more CO2 than they emit - is decreasing and needs to be reversed, the Commission said in its new climate plan for 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The EU executive argues that \"we need a growing sink in order for the EU to achieve climate neutrality by 2050\" and calls for improved forest management as well as \"re- and afforestation\" initiatives to restore degraded land and preserve biodiversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We really have to take care of our forests,\" said Frans Timmermans, the EU executive vice-president in charge of climate action. \"We need to make sure our forests stay healthy and this is going to be a momentous task,\" he told journalists.</p><p>Forest owners wouldn't contradict the Commission on this point. Time and again, they have highlighted the role of \"sustainable forest management practices\" in environmental conservation and how those can support the EU's biodiversity and climate objectives.</p><p>However, they say the Commission's 2030 climate plan places too much emphasis on the role of forests as carbon sinks.</p><p>\"This approach is rather unfortunate as it omits two other major climate benefits provided by forests: carbon storage in EU forests and wood products and carbon substitution with wood replacing fossil-based products and energy,\" said Fanny-Pomme Langue, secretary-general of the Confederation of European Forest Owners (CEPF).</p><p>For forest owners, the key is to maintain forests as \"productive\" economic tools providing them with the revenues necessary to take care of their land. And that implies planting, thinning, harvesting and replanting trees as part of \"active\" management of forests.</p><p>\"Forest owners are custodians of forests' future and their focus is to maintain productive, healthy and vital ecosystems,\" said Sven-Erik Hammar, board member of CEPF.</p><p>This was the view espoused by the European Parliament's agriculture committee, which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200831IPR86011/eu-forest-strategy-ensuring-high-quality-management-of-eu-forests-and-woodlands\">backed a report earlier this month</url> charting \"the way forward\" for the EU's upcoming forest strategy, expected to be published in the coming months.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Carbon sink and carbon stock</emphasis></p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, seemed to acknowledge the role forests can play for the climate. In her state of the union speech last week, she said Europe's buildings could be turned \"from a carbon source into a carbon sink if organic materials like wood\" are being used.</p><p>Because trees absorb CO2 as they grow, harvesting them to make wood products is indeed considered as a \"climate positive\" economic activity which sequesters carbon in the form of furniture or building materials.</p><p>More controversial however is when wood is burned in biomass plants to produce electricity, or as a way of heating people's homes.</p><p>Critics say burning wood immediately releases CO2 which took years or even decades to accumulate during the tree's growth phase. This, they argue, creates a \"carbon debt\" for future generations until new trees can grow back and suck an equivalent amount of CO2.</p><p>And since time is running out to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C, they argue that urgent action must be taken now to prevent a further increase in biomass burning for energy generation.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/emissions-trading-scheme/news/scientists-call-on-eu-to-correct-biomass-carbon-accounting-rules/\">Scientists call on EU to 'correct' biomass carbon accounting rules</url></h><p>Europe's academies of science have called on EU lawmakers to introduce a \"radically new standard\" in the bloc's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to ensure net carbon emissions from biomass power stations are \"properly accounted for and declared\".</p><p>The European Commission seemed to pay heed to those concerns when it placed the emphasis on the need to restore carbon sinks in Europe.</p><p>\"Projected increases in bioenergy use by 2030 are limited compared to today,\" the Commission pointed out in its <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/eu-climate-action/docs/com_2030_ctp_en.pdf\">2030 climate plan</url>, guarding against any \"further increases in harvesting\" that could see the EU's carbon sink decline further.</p><p>\"Any unsustainable intensification of forest harvesting for bioenergy purposes should be avoided,\" the EU executive warned, saying \"the use of whole trees and food and feed crops for energy production - produced in the EU or imported - should be minimised\" in order to limit the impact on climate and biodiversity.</p><p>Bioenergy producers dispute this, saying \"active forest management\" practices \"will optimise the carbon flow\" and promote carbon sinks in addition to providing much-needed jobs and economic activity for rural areas.</p><p>\"It is important to stress that bioenergy is not a driving force of forest harvesting,\" said Bioenergy Europe, a trade association. In fact, forest cover in the EU increased by 5.8% in 1995-2015 while bioenergy consumption \"more than doubled\" during the same period, it points out.</p><p>\"The increase in bioenergy has been possible thanks to a better use of residues from the forest-based industries and increased synergies with the wood-based industry,\" said Jean-Marc Jossart, secretary-general of Bioenergy Europe.</p><p>Importantly, Jossart said a distinction should be made between \"carbon sinks\" - the capacity of forests to capture carbon - and the \"carbon stock\", which is the total amount of carbon stored in the forest at a certain moment in time.</p><p>\"A forest management based on maximising the carbon stock will not deliver efficiently against climate change because of maturation of trees and carbon losses\" due to fires and insects, which are becoming more frequent because of climate change, he argued.</p><p>In reality, \"a better managed forest reduces the risks of forest fires as there will be less dead wood on the ground helping the propagation of fire,\" Jossart told EURACTIV in emailed comments, saying landowners need to be incentivised to take care of their land.</p><p>\"Planting, thinning, harvesting and replanting are part of virtuous operations of climate-friendly forests, as well as taking infected trees out of the forests,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Incentives for 'sustainable' biomass</emphasis></p><p>The Commission does not dispute this, saying \"the promotion of sustainable forest management\" combined with strict enforcement of EU green criteria for biomass will help make the sector more sustainable.</p><p>And it keeps the door open to bioenergies in general, saying \"a shift towards growing woody biomass on cropland in a sustainable manner, including as a feedstock for advanced biogas and biofuels, could alleviate the situation\" and help restore healthy forests.</p><p>\"Bioenergy production should come from better use of biomass wastes and residues and sustainable cultivation of energy crops, rather replacing the production of first-generation food-crop-based biofuels,\" the EU executive says.</p><p>If those solutions are implemented swiftly in the coming years, \"this could already reverse the current trend of a diminishing EU land carbon sink by 2030, increasing it again to levels above 300 million tons CO2eq,\" the Commission says.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/eu-plans-sweeping-bioenergy-review-by-end-2020/\">EU plans sweeping bioenergy review by end 2020</url></h><p>The European Commission intends to push a \"transformative approach\" to all forms of bioenergy - including biofuels and woody biomass - as part of a biodiversity strategy due to be unveiled on Wednesday (20 May).</p><p>By the end of the year, the Commission is expected to publish an extensive review of biomass policies. And much of the debate from now on is expected to focus on the incentives that are needed to support sustainable forestry practices and carbon removals.</p><p>\"Definitely, we want to recognise the removals that are being done in agriculture and forestry more strongly than what we did in the past,\" said a senior EU official who was briefing journalists after the Commission presented its 2030 climate plan last week.</p><p>\"That will require incentives for those who are responsible - and that's the farmers and the foresters,\" the official said.</p><p>In Germany, the government is currently debating a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/berlin-and-brussels-mull-forest-protection-as-climate-change-takes-its-toll/\">tree premium</url>\" of (EURO)125 per hectare as a way to reward forest owners for reducing carbon emissions. The premiums would be linked to the EU carbon market, meaning that if CO2 prices rise, the tree premium would also increase.</p><p>Another option is to bring agriculture under an EU regulation dealing with land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF).</p><p>\"For somebody who is responsible for agriculture and forestry, it's probably much easier to handle that as a policy field and to make the right trade-offs within the sector,\" the official explained, saying any EU proposal on the matter would need to be backed by a cost-benefit analysis and fall in line with the Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p>For the bioenergy sector, incentives are fine as long as they allow foresters to \"actively manage their forests through planting, thinning, harvesting and replanting\".</p><p>\"If conversely, these subsidies are there to leave the forests untouched, this will have the adverse effects of reducing their resilience,\" it argues.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/berlin-and-brussels-mull-forest-protection-as-climate-change-takes-its-toll/\">Berlin and Brussels mull forest protection as climate change takes its toll</url></h><p>The German Forest Days, which started on Friday (18 September), are intended to draw attention to the fact that forests are threatened by climate change.

But finding a middle ground between these diverse farming profiles will definitely be easier said than done.Certainly food for thought.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(N.F.)</emphasis></p><h><emphasis

In particular, the Commission said the capacity of forests to act as \"carbon sinks\" has been decreasing over the years and needs to be reversed. So how does the Commission intend to achieve this?</emphasis></p><p>Since 2013, the carbon sink decreased in Europe and that is worrying. Farmers and foresters have incentives to do many other lucrative things with their land than keeping the capacity of forests and soils to act as carbon sinks.</p><p>On top of this comes climate change itself, which is taking its toll in terms of droughts, diseases and pests that are encroaching on European forests and land. Therefore, a way needs to be found to encourage farmers and foresters to do address these adverse effects - to reforest areas, which might no longer be adapted to the future climate.</p><p>And first, forests need to be counted better - every tonne of carbon dioxide in the forest has to be counted. Under the Kyoto Protocol, not all forest was accounted for, there were specific rules and limitations.</p><p>So, the first thing is to count the forest. And this is something the Commission outlined clearly already in the long-term climate strategy for 2050, by which time remaining emissions need to be balanced with carbon removals. And after 2050, this balance will have to go net-negative.</p><p>Hence, carbon removals are going to play an important role, which is why it is important to accurately count and report them. This is being done today in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The way it is being reported to the UNFCCC takes the full sink into account. And in order to get to climate neutrality by 2050, we want to start counting in the same way in the year 2030.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Europe wasn't counting carbon removals until now?</emphasis></p><p>Today, carbon removals are only partly accounted for. As long as they are not fully counted, it risks not being adequately reflected in the decision making. And that means the incentives are difficult to get right.</p><p>Secondly, we want to help in terms of afforestation in Europe and to plant 3 billion trees in the coming decade. This is something that the Commission will work on in the context of the upcoming forest strategy.</p><p>A third important initiative is what is called \"carbon farming\" to see how Member State governments can incentivise the uptake of carbon in soils or vegetation, and to make sure that these are also permanent removals.</p><p>A sink is not <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">per se</emphasis> irreversible, it can be reversed. So one always has to carefully monitor in order to get the numbers right in terms of removals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Commission's stated objective is to stop carbon sinks from decreasing and start growing them again. Does this mean the Commission will somehow put a limit on the number of trees that can be harvested in Europe? Is that something that will inevitably come at some point?</emphasis></p><p>I don't think this is going to be necessary. Looking at the projections for 2050, and in particular at the balance between removals and remaining emissions, some greenhouse gas emissions will be inevitable - for instance cows will continue to emit methane. In order to find a way to balance these residual emissions, there will be a demand for carbon removals.</p><p>In principle, carbon removals can be achieved in different ways than through forest and soils - there are also technical solutions like carbon capture and storage. However, there are limitations to CCS in terms of cost, storage capacity and public acceptance.</p><p>At the end of the day, there will have to be a balance between demand and supply for such carbon removals. This will provide an incentive for forestry activities or soil conservation. In this way, limits would not have to be set.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/news/eu-climate-plan-blows-hot-and-cold-on-forestry-biomass/\">EU climate plan blows hot and cold on forestry, biomass</url></h><p>While recognising the positive role of forests in mitigating global warming, the European Commission has riled the agroforestry and biomass industries by stating its intention of limiting growth in the sector.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What metrics is the Commission going to use to monitor the evolution of the carbon sink in Europe? How are you going to measure that?</emphasis></p><p>We will follow the metrics and guidelines that have been developed by the IPCC. Since 2008, the beginning of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, land use, land use change and forestry have been monitored and reported.</p><p>These measurements have improved a lot in those twelve years with the help of the UNFCCC peer-reviews. International peers regularly looked at the different parts of the national inventories. Looking back at the early years of the UN carbon accounting system, there were many suggestions to improve LULUCF monitoring, and these can be further improved in the future.</p><p>One of the avenues to be explored is to use remote sensors through satellite observation. Doing inventories for land use and forestry is very expensive because the areas are so vast and so heterogeneous. In some cases, forest inventories are done only every 5 to 10 years. This can possibly be improved using Europe's Copernicus earth observation satellites by comparing these numbers with the inventories.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And the base year will be 1990?</emphasis></p><p>Yes, 1990 is always the base year when it comes to Europe's climate commitments. There are estimates of the size of the forest sink back in 1990.</p><p>In the beginning, it might not be 100% accurate, as one will start at a certain point. What is important is that measurement becomes better over time, so that we can detect whether the trend is going in the right direction or not.</p><p>On certain categories, we will have to become more granular over time, for example when it comes to harvested wood products. At the moment, default values are used for how long these wood products are going to be there, but if we want to look after that stock more carefully, then we need to better understand the stock and how exactly it is changing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Does that then require some additional reporting maybe on the part of the foresters or the farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)?</emphasis></p><p>This is something that will have to be investigated in the coming years. But one must be cautious not to create red tape. It will have to be done in a measured and reasonable way and it is one of the reasons to explore using satellite imaging, because it might be something that can be automated. One needs to get a robust proxy that is going to be good enough to monitor accurately what is happening to the sinks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forestry can be positive or negative for the climate depending on the uses. Wood for instance has different carbon footprints depending on what you do with it - whether it's used to produce paper, building materials or furniture or whether you burn it in a biomass plant. So how can those different uses of wood be accounted for in a way that reflects their true carbon footprint?</emphasis></p><p>In terms of carbon accounting one needs to monitor where the CO2 actually is and goes: in the atmosphere, stocked in a tree or in a table, or being burned in a power plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can that be measured at all?</emphasis></p><p>One can measure what is standing in terms of CO2 in the forest. And the way those stocks are changing from year to year can be observed. If something is harvested, then it is recorded in the inventory as a negative.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But then you don't know how it ends up - in a table, in paper production or in a biomass plant.</emphasis></p><p>At the moment, this is often done in a simple way. We assume for example what amount goes into harvested products because there are industry statistics for that. The harvested product is given a certain lifetime and then it is going back into the atmosphere after an average period of time. This is how the accounting works at the moment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's based on industry reporting then?</emphasis></p><p>It is based on reporting that goes through the statistical systems of the member states. At the moment, it is done relatively roughly so in the future, this might need refinement. This reporting can become more granular.</p><p>In a similar way, there are estimates for how much biomass is being burned in power plants. The emission of this biomass is already reported when the tree is cut. So, it does not have to be counted again when it is burned in the power plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some are calling for a kind of certification scheme to account for carbon removals, whether in agriculture, or forestry. Is that something the commission is looking into? And how could it work?</emphasis></p><p>In the circular economy action plan, the Commission announced that a certification system for removals should be developed by 2023. This will be worked on in the coming years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are there any particular difficulties? What are you trying to achieve?</emphasis></p><p>In the end, a robust system needs to ensure that a tonne of carbon dioxide is a tonne of carbon dioxide. One challenge for the land sink will be the potential \"reversibility\" of the carbon removals.</p><p>For instance, what happens if a certified forest sink goes up in flames? The legislation will have to be able to deal with such a situation in order to make sure that, at the end of the day, there is a physical removal for each certificate - or currency - that has been issued.</p><p>Another question: what if the forest goes up in flames but somebody has used this certificate to balance an emission? Who is going to be liable in such a situation? The same holds for a geological carbon storage. If there is a leak, what does it mean for the certificates that have been issued?</p><p>These are tricky questions that will need responses to ensure we have an environmentally robust system in place at the end of the day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">When you talk about a \"currency\" are you referring to allowances that can be traded on the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)?</emphasis></p><p>If the standard is good enough and one can be sure that a tonne is tonne, then we might be able to recognise them like an emission allowance under the ETS. Therefore, it is important to get the certification right to make sure it is robust.</p><p>In the past, some experience has been made with the clean development mechanism at the UN level, which is also certifying certain emission reductions. So, the questions are quite similar: How can the emissions reductions or removals be established? On what basis? What does it need to be compared with? How many certificates can be issued at the end of the day? All these steps will have to be defined in the certification process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">That means effectively bringing agriculture and forestry under the ETS?</emphasis></p><p>This can only be discussed once a good certification system is up and running. At the moment, there is no link between land use and the EU's Emissions Trading System, for good reasons.</p><p>Conversely, there is a link at the moment between land use and the effort sharing regulation, which is capped to a certain amount. This might be a subject for the next round of impact assessments that will be done for the June 2021 package.</p><p>The reference point, in the long-term, will be 2050 and the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target. By then, remaining emissions will have to be balanced with carbon removals. And that might not leave room for any auctioning under the ETS. Between now and 2050 there is a 30-year time period, and the question is how best to manage the transition from here to there.</p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/biomass/opinion/the-hyping-of-negative-emissions/\">The hyping of negative emissions</url></h><p>EU lawmaker Jytte Guteland has proposed ambitious EU climate targets, but a cornerstone for reaching them remains shaky, says Kelsey Perlman.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emissions from agricultural and forestry are currently regulated by different sets of rules at EU level: forestry falls under the LULUCF regulation, while biomass falls under the ETS and agriculture falls under the burden sharing regulation, together with transport and buildings. Does the European Commission aim to have a more streamlined system to deal with forestry and agriculture emissions in the future? </emphasis></p><p>Different options are discussed in the 2030 Climate Target Plan. One option could be to bring together Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) with the non-CO2 emissions from agriculture. This sector also falls under the Common Agricultural Policy. And that might make it easier for policymakers at the national level to deal with those sectors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Let's talk about incentives now. At the end of the day, forest owners and farmers need incentives to grow the capacity of their land or forests to act as carbon sinks. So what ideas do you have at the Commission to encourage them to do it?</emphasis></p><p>What is happening already now are voluntary markets, which issue certificates in exchange for carbon capture or carbon removal projects. Some supermarket chains for example are using this to offset their emissions. These voluntary offset markets are growing in number and are also expanding in terms of the types of carbon removals that they certify.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So they need to be regulated at some point?</emphasis></p><p>The Commission intends to establish an EU certification system. There is growing interest in so-called 'carbon farming'. In Northern Germany for instance, there is a project called 'Moor Futures'. We are currently studying these kind of systems to learn from them.</p><p>The Commission supports pilot projects, for instance, to test new methodologies for the measurement of carbon removals. Last year, the European Parliament voted for an additional (EURO)2 million in the budget for pilot projects. A Finnish project is exploring robust measurement systems. This experience will enrich the debate.</p><p>In the discussions with agriculture ministers in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy it is also encouraged to use eco schemes to reward farmers if they do more, in terms of storing carbon in the soils, or foresters storing carbon through afforestation and reforestation. There are different ways of encouraging learning by doing.</p><p>Then the next step will be to look at developing a robust regulatory framework. And in the longer term, one might look at whether and how this could be brought to the ETS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In Germany, policymakers are debating a \"tree premium\" of (EURO)125 per hectare that would basically reward land owners for keeping their forests untouched. Is that something the Commission is looking into?</emphasis></p><p>These are part of the incentive systems that should be studied. From a climate viewpoint, it needs to be established how much CO2 is stored at the end of the day.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Foresters say that if they're being paid to leave the trees standing, they won't have any incentives to do regular forest maintenance - like thinning or harvesting dead wood for example - which brings benefits like preventing fires. Do you see a tradeoff here?</emphasis></p><p>There can be trade-offs. However, when it comes to carbon storage, one also needs to make sure that the carbon stock is protected. If the forest goes up in flames, then a certificate should also go up in flames. Preventing fires is one risk that foresters will need to manage.</p><p>Other questions are: can timber be stored in a way that it does not deteriorate? This is what is done when wood is put into tables and walls, which becomes part of the carbon stock. How far can this stock be increased?

It shows how we\u00a0will navigate the transition profitably and in\u00a0line with our purpose - to power progress together with more and\u00a0cleaner\u00a0energy solutions.</p><p>We have prepared this Energy Transition Strategy publication for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting of Royal Dutch Shell, on May 18, 2021. It follows detailed conversations with shareholders and describes Shell's energy transition strategy, including our emissions targets.</p><p>Your Directors recognise their responsibility to set the company's strategy. This is unchanged. We consider this publication, and the strategy it summarises, to be aligned with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the increase in the average global temperature to\u00a01.5\u00a0degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Shell is the first energy company to submit its energy transition strategy to\u00a0shareholders for an advisory vote. We will publish an update every three years until 2050. Every year, starting in 2022, we will also seek an\u00a0advisory vote on our progress towards our plans and targets.</p><p>The vote is purely advisory and will not be binding on shareholders. We\u00a0are not asking shareholders to take responsibility for formally approving or\u00a0objecting to Shell's energy transition strategy. That legal\u00a0responsibility lies with the Board and Executive Committee.</p><p>While the energy transition brings risks to the company, it also brings opportunities for us to prosper and to build on our positive contribution to\u00a0society. Our strategy, as outlined in this report, is designed to minimise those risks while enhancing our ability to profitably lead as the world transitions to an energy system that is aligned with the goal of the Paris\u00a0Agreement.</p><p>It is important for shareholders to have a clear understanding of the company's strategy as we work together to meet the goal of Paris. The Board and management also believe it is important for all shareholders to\u00a0have a vehicle to express their views on whether our strategy is reasonable in the current environment. This advisory vote is designed to\u00a0be that vehicle. It does not shield or abdicate the Board's or management's legal obligations under the UK Companies Act.</p><p>The support of our shareholders is critical for us to achieve our target to\u00a0become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We hope to gain your support for the approach described in this publication. In addition to\u00a0your vote, we invite your continued feedback ahead of the publication of our next Energy Transition Strategy which will\u00a0be presented to shareholders before the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02024.</p><p>The Board recommends that you vote in favour of resolution 20, in support\u00a0of the energy transition strategy described in this publication.</p><p>CHAD HOLLIDAYChair</p><p>CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S INTRODUCTIONTackling climate change is the biggest challenge the world faces today. Our Powering Progress strategy, which we launched in February 2021, sets out how Shell can and must play a leading role in helping society to meet that challenge.</p><p>As we transform our business, it is more important than ever for our shareholders to understand and support our approach. That is why we are\u00a0publishing details of our energy transition strategy and, for the first time, submitting it to shareholders for an advisory vote at our Annual General Meeting this year.</p><p>Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in\u00a0step with society's progress towards the goal of the Paris Agreement on\u00a0climate change, is at the heart of our energy transition strategy. That\u00a0means continuing to reduce our total absolute emissions to net\u00a0zero\u00a0by 2050.</p><p>We have set our net-zero target, and our short- and medium-term carbon intensity targets, so that they are fully consistent with the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. And our targets cover the full range of our emissions, Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of all the energy we sell, not just the energy we produce.</p><p>We are asking our shareholders to vote for an energy transition strategy that is designed to bring our energy products, our services, and our investments in line with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and the global drive to combat climate change. It is a strategy that we believe creates value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society.</p><p>WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERSMost of our emissions come from the use of our fuels and the other energy products we sell. So it makes sense to place our customers at the centre of our energy transition strategy. It is where we can make the biggest difference. We will work with our customers to change and grow demand for low-carbon energy products and services, sector by sector, using the strength of our business relationships, knowledge and expertise.</p><p>We will increasingly offer low-carbon products and solutions, such as biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, hydrogen and renewable power, as well as carbon capture and storage and nature-based offsets. In this way, we expect to build low-carbon businesses of significant scale over the coming decade. In addition, we will drive down emissions from our own operations as we continue to provide the oil and gas products our customers need today, while at the same time helping them move to\u00a0a\u00a0low- and zero-carbon future.</p><p>To be clear, the best way for Shell to contribute to the energy transition is to work with our customers to help shape demand for low-carbon energy products and services. In turn, the increasing need to supply low-carbon energy products and services will accelerate Shell's transition to net zero. Ending our activities in oil and gas too early when they are vital to meeting\u00a0today's energy demand would not help our customers, or our\u00a0shareholders.</p><p>SEEKING SHAREHOLDER SUPPORTThe decision to seek an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy follows our continuing engagement with shareholders, including with Climate Action 100+, which represents investors with assets of around $54 trillion. This vote does not replace the responsibilities of our Directors in setting the company's strategy. We have based the structure of this publication around the net-zero disclosure standard developed by Climate\u00a0Action 100+ for the oil and gas industry.</p><p>In the following pages we set out our short-, medium- and long-term targets, our decarbonisation strategy and how we intend to allocate capital across our three business pillars of Growth, Transition and Upstream in the years ahead. We also explain our approach to climate-related policy and advocacy, an important part of how we are working with governments and others to accelerate the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy.</p><p>As the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19, companies also play an important role in powering lives. In this publication, we describe how we will support livelihoods and communities\u00a0as we transform our business.</p><p>We also outline our strong governance and a commitment to transparency. As we continue to implement the recommendations of\u00a0the\u00a0Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, we show how\u00a0we\u00a0are managing the risks and opportunities of climate change.</p><p>I would like to thank the investor groups we have worked with as we have\u00a0developed our energy transition strategy, including the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Climate Action 100+. We must continue our dialogue with investors as Shell continues to evolve. We will be transparent so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress to that of other companies.</p><p>This is a critical time in the world's efforts to tackle climate change. It\u00a0is\u00a0also a time of tremendous opportunity for Shell. By transforming our\u00a0business in line with our energy transition strategy, we will contribute to achieving a net-zero emissions energy system, help society reach its\u00a0climate goals and create a compelling investment case for our shareholders, today and in the future. We ask our shareholders to vote for resolution 20 and support the execution of our energy transition strategy.</p><p>BEN VAN BEURDENCEO</p><p>SHELL'S PATH TO NET-ZERO EMISSIONSThis is the first time that Shell has offered investors an advisory vote on our energy transition strategy.

It requires a fundamental transformation of the global economy, and the energy system, so that society stops adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieving what is\u00a0known as net-zero emissions.</p><p>That is why Shell has set a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress in achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change. We believe our target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the\u00a0average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>It is aligned with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which concluded that the world must reach net-zero carbon emissions by around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and\u00a0avoid the\u00a0worst effects of climate change.</p><p>Becoming a net-zero emissions energy business means that we are reducing emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and other energy products such as electricity that we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology or\u00a0balancing them with offsets.</p><p>COLLABORATIONIncreasing numbers of countries and companies have announced targets to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century, and we are starting to see some changes in the demand and supply of energy.</p><p>Achieving the 1.5\u00b0C goal will be challenging but it is technically possible. The extent of global collaboration required will be unprecedented. The pace of change will also be different around the world. The wealthier, more developed countries and regions must move faster. If they do not, then those countries and regions that cannot move so quickly will not have\u00a0the time they need. The European Union (EU), for example, must achieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050 if the world is to succeed\u00a0in\u00a0limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>Shell has built a scenario looking at what the EU might need to do to decarbonise which gives some insight into the scale of the significant challenge involved. The scenario identified nine areas for action.</p><p>THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGEAs an illustration, achieving net-zero emissions in the EU in the next 30 years could mean:</p><p>ACCELERATING CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>Double the generation of electricity, triple its share of final energyShift the electricity mix to 75% renewables, no coalTarget 10% hydrogen in final energy, including as a fuel for heating, industry and heavy transportTriple the use of biofuels, with a shift to advanced forms</p><p>TARGETING BEHAVIOURAL INCENTIVES</p><p>Invest in infrastructure to improve energy efficiency per unit of GDP by almost 45%Incentivise green consumer and business choices in support of the green economyProgressively raise the government-led carbon price in the EU to more than (EURO)200/tonne of CO2equivalent in 2050</p><p>REMOVING EMISSIONS</p><p>Build at least two major carbon capture and utilisation facilities every month (more than 1 million tonnes each)Reforest at least 220,000 square kilometres in the EU (about half the area of Spain) to remove the remaining 300 million tonnes of CO2in 2050</p><p>Source: Shell Scenarios Sketch: A climate-neutral EU by 2050</p><p>Achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement will require simultaneous growth in supply and demand for low-carbon energy. Crucially, it will also\u00a0require significant changes to the way our customers use energy, whether they are motorists, households or businesses.</p><p>All parts of society including energy producers, consumers and policymakers will need to take action. That is why our strategy is based on working with our customers and others to accelerate the transition of the energy system. This includes supporting government policies that\u00a0will help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>We will build on our strengths, our global scale and deep knowledge of energy markets to help grow demand for low-carbon energy. In this way, we will continue to build a strong business while playing an important role in the transition to low-carbon energy.</p><p>NET ZERO FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTSOur net-zero target includes emissions from our operations, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and the life-cycle emissions, including from the end use, from all the energy products we sell, our Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>We will reduce emissions from our own operations, including the production of oil and gas, by increasing energy efficiency and capturing or offsetting any remaining emissions.</p><p>More than 90% of our emissions come from the use of the fuels and other\u00a0energy products we sell, so we must also work with our customers to\u00a0reduce their emissions when that energy is used [B]. That means offering them the low-carbon products and services they need such as\u00a0renewable electricity, biofuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage\u00a0and nature-based offsets.</p><p>Importantly, our target includes emissions not only from the energy we produce and process ourselves, including oil and gas, but also from all the\u00a0energy products that other companies produce and we sell [C]. This\u00a0is\u00a0significant because we sell more than three times the energy we\u00a0produce ourselves.</p><p>In summary, our targets include all emissions from the energy we sell, and the majority of the emissions we include in our targets are not related to our own oil and gas production.</p><p>[B] This includes emissions from the use of energy produced and sold by Shell as well as full life-cycle emissions from energy produced by others and sold by Shell. Combined, these are\u00a0reported under relevant categories of Scope 3 emissions (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/\">https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2020/</url>).</emphasis>[C] Sales from retail stations that use the Shell brand but are not operated or supplied by Shell are excluded.</p><p>WE ADDRESS THE EMISSIONS FROM ALL THE ENERGY WE SELL</p><p>OUR TARGETS: SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERMWe believe our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 gigatonnes and our climate target means we will have to bring that down to absolute net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>As we work to achieve that target, and to measure our progress over the\u00a0next three decades, we have set short-, medium- and long-term targets to\u00a0reduce the carbon intensity [D] of the energy products we sell. Carbon intensity is the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions associated with\u00a0each unit of energy that we sell, and that is used by our customers.</p><p>We use carbon intensity targets to measure our progress because we think they are the clearest way to demonstrate changes to our mix of energy products over time, as we add and then shift to low-carbon energy products and services.</p><p>We have set specific carbon intensity reduction targets for the following years. These targets are compared with 2016 and linked to the\u00a0remuneration of around 16,500 Shell employees:</p><p>2-3% by 2021 3-4% by 2022 6-8% by 2023</p><p>We also have medium- and long-term carbon intensity targets, in step with society:</p><p>20% by 2030 45% by 2035*100% by 2050*</p><p>REDUCING THE CARBON INTENSITY OF ALL ENERGY SOLDgCO2e/MJ</p><p>2016 baseline2023: -6-8% (Carbon intensity incl. mitigation by Shell (Net Carbon Footprint))2030: -20% (Carbon intensity incl. mitigation by Shell (Net Carbon Footprint))2035: -45% (Carbon intensity incl. all mitigation actions (Shell &amp; customers))2050: -100% (Carbon intensity incl. all mitigation actions (Shell &amp; customers))</p><p>We measure our carbon intensity with our Net Carbon Footprint methodology [E] which calculates the carbon intensity of the portfolio of\u00a0energy products sold by Shell expressed as grams of CO2equivalent (gCO2e) per megajoule (MJ) of energy delivered to, and consumed by, our customers.</p><p>*\u00a0\u00a0 These targets include mitigation actions by our customers such as carbon capture and storage and nature-based offsets.[D]Carbon intensity as used in this report refers to net carbon intensity, which includes offsets and is measured by our Net Carbon Footprint methodology.[E] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/ncfmethodologyPetrochemicals\">https://www.shell.com/ncfmethodologyPetrochemicals</url> and other products such as lubricants are not included in our short- and medium-term targets because they are not burnt and do not produce Scope 3 emissions. Their production and processing produce emissions, and we include these within our target to achieve net-zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from our operations by 2050.</p><p>ALIGNING OUR TARGETS WITH PARISShell's target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our carbon intensity, measured by our Net Carbon Footprint methodology. We believe these targets are aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C (SR 1.5), most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero between 2040 and 2060.</p><p>There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we developed our own approach to demonstrate Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets using a pathway derived from the IPCC\u00a0scenarios aligned with the Paris goal.</p><p>We determined our targets using scenarios taken from a database developed for the IPCC SR 1.5 [F]. We filtered out certain outlying IPCC scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action, and low-overshoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies on sinks to compensate for the excess emissions.</p><p>We then take the following steps:</p><p>1. The total energy in each of the scenarios is calculated at the point of delivered energy (energy that is processed by refining or liquefaction, for example, but before it is used for electricity generation) using a fossil fuel equivalence approach for electricity. This more accurately reflects the energy delivered by an energy supplier like Shell to the market.</p><p>2. The total net emissions of each scenario are calculated taking into account emissions stored using carbon capture and storage and offset using natural sinks.</p><p>3. The carbon intensity for each scenario is calculated by dividing the net emissions by the total delivered energy. The range of carbon intensities of the scenarios allows for the construction of a benchmark range after removing any outliers.</p><p>By using the benchmark range produced by this approach to set our targets, we aligned them with the necessary reduction in carbon intensity shown in the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. This is illustrated in the graphic on the right that demonstrates how Shell's targets are positioned within the range of 1.5\u00b0C pathways. The upper and lower lines represent the upper and lower boundaries of the benchmark range derived from the IPCC scenarios.</p><p>Until 2035, our calculation of the total net emissions of each scenario includes only the expected mitigation actions by Shell such as carbon capture and storage and offsetting using natural sinks, including any use of offsets included in the carbon-neutral energy products we offer our customers. After that date, we also include mitigation actions taken separately by our customers.</p><p>Today, we do not include any mitigation steps taken separately by our\u00a0customers. That is because the accounting standards to include those actions do not exist. Under existing protocols, energy suppliers report the Scope 3 emissions from the use of their products, which are\u00a0equivalent to the Scope 1 emissions reported by the users of those\u00a0products.</p><p>However, when users of energy mitigate their Scope 1 emissions by use\u00a0of carbon capture and storage or offsets, there is no accounting protocol for reflecting the corresponding reduction in the Scope 3 emissions reporting by the energy supplier.</p><p>To account for reductions in emissions across full energy value chains it is necessary to build on the existing greenhouse gas reporting and accounting protocols to include mitigation actions by both energy suppliers and users. Shell is in discussions with standard-setting bodies such as Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the World Resources Institute and CDP to develop the accounting protocols and frameworks to include mitigation actions by energy suppliers and energy users.</p><p>Reporting and accounting for mitigations in this way will also need new\u00a0systems for the exchange of data between suppliers and users of\u00a0energy. We expect these developments will take three to five years. Our carbon intensity targets for 2035 and 2050 reflect this expected change in accounting approach.</p><p>[F] These scenarios do not include Shell's Sky 1.5 scenario.</p><p>SHELL'S CARBON INTENSITY TARGETSgCO2e/MJ</p><p>OUR APPROACHWe have set our targets to be in line with climate science and in step with society's progress as it works towards the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>This progress will depend on whether governments and businesses, including Shell, provide the right conditions and incentives for low- and zero-carbon choices, and on whether consumers embrace these changes.</p><p>We must work towards our long-term target of net-zero emissions immediately. That is why we have set a series of short-term targets that are\u00a0reflected in the remuneration of 16,500 employees. These short-term targets are not conditional on whether society progresses towards the goal of net-zero emissions; and while extremely challenging, they are aligned with our current operating plans.</p><p>If we moved too far ahead of society, it is likely that we would be making products that our customers are unable or unwilling to buy. That is why we\u00a0wish to work together with customers, governments and across sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. Shell cannot get to net zero without society also being net zero.</p><p>For example, if we invested in producing sustainable aviation fuel, and made it available on commercial terms at all the airports Shell serves today, the investment would not significantly lower our or society's carbon\u00a0emissions. Most aircraft are not yet certified to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel and the cost of the fuel is considerably more than\u00a0traditional jet fuel, making it an uncompetitive choice for the airlines.</p><p>Our strategy instead is to work with partners - including aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, major airline users and governments -\u00a0to\u00a0stimulate and accelerate demand for sustainable aviation fuel. As\u00a0demand grows, we will increase our investments.</p><p>WORKING TO MEET OUR TARGETSThe transport sector is a good illustration of how the energy transition is likely to unfold. As in other sectors, the reductions in carbon intensity will be slow at first, reflecting the challenge of switching today's forms of transport to new technologies. The IPCC Special Report shows that the energy intensity of fuels in the transport sector has fallen only slightly in the past 10 years, through the blending of biofuels with traditional fuels, the increased use of liquefied natural gas as a transport fuel, and the growth in electric vehicles. But as the cost of low-carbon vehicles comes down, for\u00a0example, they will replace vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. The IPCC scenarios show the tipping point to be somewhere between now and 2030, leading to net-zero transport after 2050.</p><p>Shell will reduce the carbon intensity of our energy products by working with our customers, sector by sector, to help them navigate the energy transition. As we do so, we intend to build even deeper relationships with\u00a0our customers and meet more of their energy needs. We will start by\u00a0adding more low-carbon products, such as biofuels and electricity, to the\u00a0mix of energy products we sell. Eventually, low-carbon products will replace the higher carbon products that we sell today. This transformation of our business will require a fundamental change to energy-related infrastructure and assets across economies (see box Structural change on\u00a0page 14).</p><p>We are working with partners - including aircraft manufacturers, airlines, airports, major\u00a0airline users and governments - to stimulate and accelerate demand for sustainable aviation fuel. As demand grows, we will increase our investments.</p><p>For example, in the road freight sector, we are working with transport companies, truck manufacturers and policymakers to identify pathways to decarbonisation. In the near term, we will continue to increase production of low-carbon biofuels. And we will offer biogas and LNG for trucks to customers in Europe, China and the USA. In the longer term, we intend to increase our sales of hydrogen for transport. We are also part of the H2Accelerate consortium, which looks at ways to create infrastructure for generating and supplying clean hydrogen to hydrogen trucks as they become available across Europe.</p><p>CARBON INTENSITY RANGE FOR THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN THE IPCC 1.5\u00b0C SCENARIOSgCO2e/MJ</p><p>OUR PLANSShell's operating plans, outlooks and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and how we can reasonably expect our business to develop over the next 10 years. Our short-term targets are aligned with our current operating plans.</p><p>However, our operating plans do not yet reflect our long-term 2050 net-zero emissions target, as it is not feasible to make a 30-year detailed operating plan. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans, outlooks, budgets and pricing assumptions to reflect this movement and continue to be in step with society. This movement will also be reflected over time in our energy transition strategy that we are offering for an advisory vote.</p><p>OUR SHORT-TERM PERFORMANCEShell's carbon intensity in 2020 was 75 gCO2e/MJ, a 4% reduction from the previous year and a 5% reduction from the 2016 reference year. In 2020, one of the major causes of this reduction was lower demand for energy. Demand for oil products experienced the most significant reduction, followed by natural gas and LNG. Another important factor contributing to the reduction of our carbon intensity was the increase in our power sales in absolute terms as well as in their share of the energy mix sold by Shell. The power we sold also had a lower average emissions intensity than in previous years, which further contributed to the overall reduction.</p><p>OUR DECARBONISATION STRATEGYAs a leading energy company, we serve the transport, industry, built environment and power generation sectors. Each has different needs. Some sectors are global while others are highly centralised and local. Some have assets that are designed to last more than 50 years, others less than 10 years. Our deep understanding of these sectors and our customers, and of the opportunities and challenges they face, will help us transform demand for our products.</p><p>Transforming energy demand is the focus of our decarbonisation strategy. To transform demand, we will work sector by sector across the energy system. We will change the mix of energy products we sell to our customers as their needs for energy change.</p><p>This is where we can make the greatest contribution to the energy transition, by increasing sales of low-carbon energy products and services. Today, we sell around 4.6% of final energy consumed in the\u00a0world and produce around 1.4% of total primary energy. Our share of\u00a0energy production may decline over the coming decades, but we intend to grow\u00a0our share of low-carbon energy sales.</p><p>We are restructuring our company so that we can better identify opportunities and the role that we can play in each sector to help transform demand. We are moving from an approach focused on\u00a0types\u00a0of\u00a0products to one where our customer and account management\u00a0is\u00a0focused on sectors.</p><p>We are introducing sector-based businesses accountable for driving the decarbonisation of the sectors they cover such as aviation, commercial road transport, passenger transport, shipping, technology and industry. We will build on our existing relationships across each sector, with consumers, infrastructure owners, other suppliers and policymakers to help to accelerate change.</p><p>TRANSFORMATION OF THE ENERGY SYSTEMThe transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will require simultaneous action in three areas - an unprecedented improvement in the efficiency with which energy is used, a sharp reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix and the mitigation of\u00a0residual emissions using technology and natural sinks. While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that will deliver the\u00a0net-zero goal, scenarios help us to understand the direction and pace of the transition needed.</p><p>The diagrams on the next page use data from the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA ETP 2020). They\u00a0show how the energy mix and carbon dioxide emissions could\u00a0change between 2019 and 2050.</p><p>A fundamental shift is needed in the way energy is used and produced. For example, it will require a deep electrification of most energy end-uses and decarbonisation of that electricity. By 2050, most of the residual emissions come from energy use, while in comparison energy supply is far more decarbonised. Low- and zero-carbon energy, including hydrogen and biofuels as well as CCUS, will be needed to\u00a0mitigate most emissions in hard-to-abate sectors, such as parts of\u00a0transport and industry.</p><p>While the Sustainable Development Scenario is a well-below 2\u00b0C scenario reaching net-zero emissions by 2070, it helps to show the\u00a0scale of the transformation of the energy system needed. The\u00a0IEA's Faster Innovation Case, which builds on the Sustainable Development Scenario, demonstrates how the transformation can\u00a0be accelerated to\u00a0achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. For example, compared to the\u00a0Sustainable Development Scenario, it would need a 55% increase in hydrogen use, 25% more energy from electricity and 20% more bio-energy use. The use of CCUS will also need to be 50% higher, reaching 8 gigatonnes a year by 2050.</p><p>GLOBAL ENERGY EMISSIONS: 2019-2050</p><p>STRUCTURAL CHANGEAs well as changes to the supply of energy products, decarbonising the energy system requires structural change in the end use of energy as well. It requires energy users to improve, update or replace equipment so that they can use carbon-based energy more efficiently, or switch to low- and zero-carbon energy. For example, in\u00a0the transport sector, decarbonisation includes replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric and hydrogen vehicles.</p><p>In industry, replacing oil- and coal-fired furnaces with electrical furnaces would be one solution, carbon capture and storage is another. And in buildings, replacing gas heating systems with electric heating systems would also contribute to decarbonisation.</p><p>Such structural changes will help to trigger transitions along the supply chain of individual sectors and across sectors, including the production of energy and emissions over time. The International Energy Agency suggests that these changes in the end use of energy will require substantial investment. Of the more than $1.5\u00a0trillion extra annual spending on energy-sector investment which is required under the IEA's Paris-aligned Sustainable Development Scenario, 55% will need to be spent on end use or\u00a0what is more commonly known as demand-side investment.</p><p>RENEWABLE POWEROur sector-based business model reinforces the place of customers at the heart of our strategy. It allows us to work together to identify opportunities for immediate carbon reductions, including low-carbon fuels, as well as for longer-term solutions that will help customers get to net zero. For example, in the Netherlands we have entered into an agreement to provide renewable power to Amazon from an offshore wind farm being constructed off the coast of the Netherlands, enabling Amazon to\u00a0power\u00a0more of its business with clean energy.</p><p>The guaranteed demand from Amazon helps us to invest further in the production of green hydrogen and CCS through the creation of a green energy hub in the port of Rotterdam. Shell aims to produce green hydrogen there using electricity generated by wind power, hydrogen that will be used at the Shell refinery in Pernis to decarbonise the production of fuels.</p><p>Through its air cargo fleet, Amazon also has a growing interest in aviation. Shell has one of the world's most extensive aircraft refuelling networks. We have agreed to supply Amazon with up to six million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel for its cargo aircraft. This biofuel, produced by the company World Energy using agricultural waste fats and\u00a0oils, has lower life-cycle carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel. In December 2020, Shell and Amazon also announced minority investments in ZeroAvia, a company in the USA with ambitions to decarbonise aviation with hydrogen-powered planes.</p><p>OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COMPANIESSTRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH MICROSOFTWe have formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft which includes us working together on digital technologies that help Shell and our customers manage and reduce our carbon footprints. Shell is also supplying Microsoft with low-carbon energy products and services, including renewable energy.</p><p>ROLLS-ROYCERolls-Royce and Shell have collaborated for more than 100 years, pioneering technology, fuels and infrastructure that have shaped commercial aviation. Today, Shell and Rolls-Royce are working together to test Rolls-Royce engines to show they can run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>CLEAN SKIES FOR TOMORROWIn the aviation sector, Shell is a founding partner of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, an initiative with the Mission Possible Platform. This platform was launched by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century from a group of traditionally hard-to-abate industry sectors.</p><p>The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition consists of airlines, airports, fuel providers and engine manufacturers. It is working to reduce emissions from the aviation sector by making sustainable aviation fuel more widely used and available. The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition has jointly developed and published policy proposals which it has put to the European Union to promote debate on how to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and increase the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels [G].</p><p>[G]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/joint-policy-proposal-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-sustainable-aviation-fuels-in-europe-a-clean-skies-for-tomorrow-publication\">https://www.weforum.org/reports/joint-policy-proposal-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-sustainable-aviation-fuels-in-europe-a-clean-skies-for-tomorrow-publication</url></p><p>SHARING INSIGHTS INTO THE TRANSITIONOur strategy includes participating in coalitions of companies and organisations to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions. We will help to develop paths to low-carbon energy in different sectors, identify opportunities for low-carbon solutions, and advocate government policies and financial market regulations that support the transition.</p><p>In the shipping and road freight sectors, for example, we have partnered with Deloitte to explore paths to reducing emissions [H].</p><p>[H]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-shipping.html;\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-shipping.html;</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-road-freight.html\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/decarbonising-road-freight.html</url></p><p>SIX LEVERS TO HELP DECARBONISE ENERGYAs Shell works with our customers to identify the best paths to decarbonisation, we seek to avoid, reduce and only then mitigateany remaining emissions.</p><p>We have six levers to help Shell and our customers decarbonise energy in\u00a0the short, medium and long term:</p><p>Pursuing operational efficiency in our assets;Shifting to natural gas;Growing our low-carbon power business;Providing low-carbon fuels such as biofuels and hydrogen;Developing carbon capture and storage; andUsing natural sinks.</p><p>ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN OUR OPERATIONSOur production sites are increasingly using lower-carbon energy sources. For example, we are installing eight new cracker furnaces at our Moerdijk petrochemicals complex in the Netherlands, replacing 16 older units. This is expected to reduce the site's energy\u00a0consumption, and to lower greenhouse gas emissions by\u00a0around 10% compared with 2019.</p><p>In the USA, we are building a 250 MW co-generation plant at our Pennsylvania chemicals facility that will also supply electricity\u00a0to local homes. The chemicals plant has been designed\u00a0with an energy-efficient gas cracker that will also use hydrogen as a fuel source.</p><p>As we implement our strategy, we are aiming for milestones which are\u00a0supported by our business plans and planned capital investment.</p><p>EXAMPLES OF ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES BY 2030</p><p>Milestones for 2030 unless otherwise stated. This chart is illustrative of the potential impact across these levers.</p><p>1\u00a0\u00a0 For assets we operate EV charge points include charge points at Shell forecourts and new locations as well as operated charge points owned by customers and third parties.</p><p>INVESTING IN NATUREThe protection and restoration of natural ecosystems could play an important role in limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C, while bringing additional environmental and social benefits, according to the IPCC [I].</p><p>Nature-based solutions, or natural climate solutions, are projects that protect, transform or restore land. In this way, CO2emissions from the natural environment are reduced and more CO2emissions from the atmosphere are absorbed. These projects can lead to the marketing, trading and sale of carbon credits. Each carbon credit represents the avoidance or removal of 1 tonne of CO2.</p><p>The market for nature-based solutions and the number and type of projects which are being developed to meet this market demand is growing rapidly. McKinsey Nature Analytics estimates that there is the potential for nature-based projects to store an additional 6.7 gigatonnes of CO2every year by 2030. Based on current net-zero commitments from more than 700 of the world's largest companies, there have already been commitments of carbon credits of around 0.2 gigatonnes of CO2by 2030 [J].</p><p>The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM), sponsored by the Institute of International Finance (IIF), estimates that the market for carbon credits could be worth more than $50\u00a0billion in 2030 [K].</p><p>[I] IPCC, 2019: Summary for Policymakers.

In line with our approach of avoid, reduce and only then mitigate, we expect to offer our customers nature-based solutions to offset around 120 million tonnes per annum of our Scope 3 emissions by 2030.</p><p>Today, for example, we offer customers carbon-neutral driving using\u00a0nature-based carbon offsets in seven countries. We also offer\u00a0carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas cargoes, which use nature-based carbon credits to offset full life-cycle emissions, including methane.</p><p>BUILDING OUR PORTFOLIOIn 2020, we invested around $90 million in the future development and purchase of nature-based offsets, and we expect to invest around $100 million a year.</p><p>In 2020, we acquired Select Carbon in Australia, which runs more\u00a0than 70 carbon farming projects that span an area of around 10\u00a0million hectares. We are also working with project developers to\u00a0invest in and develop new projects based on reforestation, agroforestry and mangroves.</p><p>In 2030, we expect our own portfolio of nature-based projects to supply most of the credits for our customers. Our trading business will purchase the rest from project developers that we screen to ensure the credits meet the same independently verified high standards. In\u00a02020, we purchased more than 4 million tonnes of credits on behalf of our customers sourced from projects around the world.</p><p>CAPTURING CARBONMost climate scientists are clear that using technology to store carbon plays an important role in the transition of the energy system. The IPCC 1.5\u00b0C scenarios show that even when the energy system reaches net-zero emissions, there will be residual emissions because some sectors and end users will not be able to eliminate the use of hydrocarbons. Some of these residual emissions will need\u00a0to be stored.</p><p>Today, carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities around the world can capture and store around 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO2. Accelerating the pace of CCS deployment requires continued collaboration between governments, industry and investors, among others, to help unlock financing capacity, accelerate technology development and encourage public support.\u00a0We recognise the scale of the challenge in developing CCS globally as quickly and as widely as needed.</p><p>Today, Shell is involved in seven of the 51 large-scale CCS projects globally, listed in 2019 by the Global CCS Institute. These seven projects store around 5 mtpa of CO2, or around 12.5% of global CCS capacity. By the end of 2020, for example, our Quest CCS project in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 5.5 million tonnes of CO2since it began operating\u00a0in 2015.</p><p>In Norway, Shell, our project partners and the Norwegian government have taken the final investment decision on the Northern Lights CCS project. This transformative project aims to become the first carbon storage facility with capacity to transport and store CO2from industrial facilities in Norway and potentially from across Europe.</p><p>In 2020, Shell invested around $70 million in CCS. This included progressing opportunities and operating costs for CCS assets in which Shell has an interest. We seek to have access to 25 mtpa of CCS capacity by 2035 - equal to 25 CCS facilities the size of our Quest project, or around 20% of the capacity of all CCS projects being studied around the world today.</p><p>STRUCTURING OUR BUSINESS TO MEET DEMANDOur business has three pillars: Growth, Transition and Upstream. Within\u00a0each pillar, we expect the underlying businesses to evolve and\u00a0transform as demand for our products changes, driven through our\u00a0sector-based businesses.</p><p>Our Upstream pillar delivers the cash and returns needed to fund our shareholder distributions and the transformation of our company, and provides vital supplies of oil and natural gas which the world needs today.</p><p>Our Transition pillar comprises Integrated Gas, and our Chemicals and Products business, and it makes the products needed to enable the energy transition. It produces sustainable cash flow and gives us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our Growth business.</p><p>Our Growth pillar includes our service stations, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. It focuses on\u00a0working with our customers to accelerate the transition to net zero and\u00a0is the foundation for the future businesses in Shell.</p><p>In our Upstream pillar:We will focus our portfolio on nine core positions that generate more than 80% of Upstream's cash flow from operations. These core positions will attract around 80% of Upstream's capital spending. They are positions where we have superior capabilities, the potential for growth and access to strong integration with our Integrated Gas and Trading activities.</p><p>The rest of our positions will be run on a leaner operating model. They will\u00a0be tasked with either maximising cash generation or becoming core positions. In some cases, such as onshore Egypt and the Philippines, we will simply divest. We will reduce annual spending on exploration from around $2.2 billion in 2015 to around $1.5 billion between 2021 and 2025. We have attractive exploration opportunities in the first half of\u00a0this\u00a0decade. But after 2025, we do not anticipate entries into new\u00a0frontier\u00a0exploration positions.</p><p>In our Transition pillar:We intend to extend our leadership in LNG volumes and markets, with selective investments in competitive LNG assets to deliver more than 7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new capacity on-stream by the middle of the decade. We will continue to support customers with their own net-zero ambitions, with offers such as carbon-neutral LNG, which uses\u00a0nature-based carbon credits to offset full life-cycle emissions, including methane. Our petrochemical business will continue to grow and provide products that enhance the efficiency of energy use.</p><p>We intend to reduce the number of refineries from 13 sites today to six\u00a0high-value chemicals and energy parks, and reduce production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030, from around 100 mtpa to 45 mtpa. We\u00a0intend to grow volumes from our chemicals portfolio and increase cash generation from Chemicals by $1-2 billion a year by 2030. We\u00a0will\u00a0produce chemicals from recycled waste, and by 2025 aim\u00a0to\u00a0process\u00a01 million tonnes a year of plastic waste.</p><p>LNG DEMAND TO GROW AS GAS PROVIDES MORE AND CLEANER ENERGYREDUCE CO2AND IMPROVE AIR QUALITY</p><p>Natural gas emits between 45% and 55% less GHG than coal when used to generate electricity and less than one-tenth of the air pollutantsMore than 750 million tonnes of CO2savings as a result of coal-to-gas switching over the last decadeIn 2020, for the first time on record, the number of coal-fired power stations decreased</p><p>LNG NEEDED TO CONNECT NATURAL GAS SUPPLY AND DEMAND GROWTHEstimated LNG trade volume in 2040, million tonnes</p><p>In our Growth pillar:Our Marketing business is our single largest customer-facing business. In\u00a02020, Marketing delivered more than $4.5 billion in net earnings and, by 2025, we expect it to generate more than $6 billion. We will achieve this by improving the market-leading position of our lubricants business, and by increasing the number of retail sites and daily customers we serve from\u00a046,000 and 30 million respectively today, to 55,000 and 40 million by 2025. We will also achieve this by growing non-fuel sales at our retail sites and sales of electricity.</p><p>This growing number of customers, made up of large and small businesses as well as individual consumers, will be looking to decarbonise their energy consumption over the coming decades. We intend to provide them\u00a0with the options to do this, from low-carbon solutions such as clean\u00a0electricity, hydrogen and biofuels, to carbon sinks or offsets for\u00a0any\u00a0remaining carbon emissions.</p><p>Shell is increasing the number of electric vehicle charging points globally - for homeowners and businesses and for use on our forecourts - from more than 60,000 today to more than 500,000 by 2025 and to\u00a02.5\u00a0million by 2030. By comparison, that is around 7% of the total number\u00a0of public and private charge points expected in Europe alone\u00a0by\u00a02030, according to research by Bloomberg.</p><p>As the need for biofuels grows, in line with customer demand and policies to reduce transport-related emissions, we expect to extend our leading biofuels production and distribution business, which in 2020 sold 9.5\u00a0billion litres of biofuels. Our joint venture Ra\u00edzen, which produces low-carbon biofuels from sugar cane in Brazil, recently announced the\u00a0acquisition of Biosev. This is set to increase Ra\u00edzen's bioethanol production capacity by 50%, to 3.75 billion litres a year, around 3%\u00a0of\u00a0global production.</p><p>We aim for our power business to sell around 560 terawatt hours of electricity a year by 2030, which is twice as much electricity as we sell today, and for the electricity we sell to have lower carbon intensity than the grid average within the markets where we operate. We are growing\u00a0our power businesses with a focus on Europe, the USA, Australia\u00a0and Asia.</p><p>CLEAN HYDROGEN GLOBAL DEMAND PROJECTIONSMillion tonnes per annum</p><p>Source: Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Economy Outlook (2020), IEA low-carbon hydrogen production data, IEA Sustainable development scenario 2030, Shell analysis</p><p>Building clean hydrogenWe intend to build on Shell's leading position in hydrogen by developing integrated hydrogen hubs initially to serve industry and heavy-duty transport. We will begin by producing and supplying hydrogen for our\u00a0own manufacturing sites, especially refineries. For example, we are developing a hydrogen electrolyser at our refinery in Rheinland, Germany, which produces hydrogen from renewable sources. We will also continue to extend our network of hydrogen retail stations, with an increasing focus on heavy-duty transport.</p><p>The clean hydrogen market is still in the early stages and the volumes are\u00a0still modest [L]. But we see strong potential for growth especially in hard-to-abate sectors of the economy. We aim to achieve a double-digit market share of global clean hydrogen sales by 2030.</p><p>[L] Shell's definition of clean hydrogen includes hydrogen made from renewable sources (usually referred to as green hydrogen) and hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture and storage (usually referred to as blue hydrogen).</p><p>RENEWABLES AND ENERGY SOLUTIONS: INTEGRATED POWER STRATEGY FOCUSED ON REGIONAL LEADERSHIPEUROPE</p><p>In top three electric vehicle charging operators by volume</p><p>Energy solutions</p><p>Around 1 million customers of integrated home energy solutions (Shell Energy Retail)More than 80,000 operated electric vehicle charge points (primarily through NewMotion)Intelligent home battery energy storage (60,000 sonnen battery customers worldwide)Sustained growth of the commercial and industrial portfolio with more than 10,000 customers across key markets</p><p>Trading and optimisation</p><p>Growing power trading business across EuropeA leading player in the UK distributed energy market (Limejump)</p><p>Renewable assets</p><p>The Netherlands: 160 MW of renewable generation capacity in operation and 1.6 GW in development across solar and wind*Germany: 10 MW hydrogen electrolyser (RefHyne) expected to start\u00a0production in the summer of 2021Ireland: 300 MW floating wind farm (Emerald) in early-stage development, Shell share 51%</p><p>Shell is increasing the number of electric vehicle charging points globally for homeowners and businesses.</p><p>* Renewable generation capacity figures are gross.

They also allow us\u00a0to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets. This strong financial framework is\u00a0based on sector-leading cash flow, continued capital discipline, capital flexibility and a strong balance sheet.</p><p>THE FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK THAT SUPPORTS OUR STRATEGYWe look to achieve the right balance between shareholder distributions and investing for the future, laying the foundation for both increased distributions and share price appreciation.</p><p>While our net debt is above the level of $65 billion, we plan to invest $19-22 billion a year across our portfolio. This will sustain our core businesses while funding moderate growth.</p><p>Once we have reduced net debt to $65 billion, we will look to further increase total shareholder distributions. Through progressive dividend and share buybacks, we are targeting total distributions to shareholders of 20-30% of our cash flow from operations. We will also seek to increase capital spending in a disciplined way. With this approach we expect that we will:</p><p>1) Limit our investments in Upstream. Our oil production peaked in 2019\u00a0and we expect that it will gradually decline by 1-2% a year through to\u00a02030.</p><p>2) Maintain our investments in our Transition businesses. We expect to\u00a0see the share of gas rise to 55% of our hydrocarbon production in\u00a02030.</p><p>3) Increase investments in our Growth businesses to build material low-carbon businesses of significant scale by the early 2030s.</p><p>As Shell progresses towards being a net-zero emissions energy business our cash\u00a0flows will increasingly come from our Growth pillar, becoming less exposed to oil and gas prices with a stronger link to broader economic growth. As one of the largest commodity traders in the world, we expect additional opportunities to enhance cash delivery through integration and\u00a0optimisation.</p><p>The characteristics of our Growth pillar mean that levels of capital investment are likely to be a poor proxy for the scale of the transformation of our business. Instead, we believe the best way to measure our progress towards our targets is through the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, and the cash flows delivered by our business pillars. This is because our Growth pillar is likely to be less capital intensive than our\u00a0Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.</p><p>OUR CARBON FRAMEWORKWe will take the same approach to managing and reducing our emissions as we have done for managing our financial framework, that is by setting constraints, or budgets.</p><p>We will be setting carbon budgets for all our businesses and these will\u00a0help to drive investment decisions which will in turn drive down our\u00a0emissions. In this way, we will decouple our business growth from carbon, transforming what we sell and what we produce.</p><p>By assessing our investments and resources on the basis of our financial performance, and on the carbon intensity of our revenues, we will decide what changes to make to our business portfolio.</p><p>The carbon emissions constraints we place on our businesses will tighten over time, in line with our carbon intensity targets and as demand for low-carbon products increases.</p><p>We are setting carbon budgets for all our businesses and these will help to drive investment decisions which will in turn drive down our emissions.</p><p>TRACK RECORD OF SECTOR-LEADING CFFO$ billion</p><p>Peer range comprises ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Total, CFFO for</p><p>SHELL CORRECTED FOR INTEREST RECEIVED (IN CFFI) AND INTEREST PAID (CFFF).</p><p>FUTURE-PROOFING OUR CASH FLOWS%</p><p>CASH CAPEX EVOLUTION</p><p>CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH THE ENERGY TRANSITIONWe are shifting capital from our Upstream business to our Transition and Growth businesses as the energy transition accelerates and we sell more\u00a0low-carbon energy products.</p><p>We aim to find the right balance between managing our Upstream assets - which will produce the returns needed to help us fund the transition - and investing in our Transition and Growth businesses. These businesses are essential to identify, build and scale up profitable projects that offer\u00a0low-carbon energy solutions for our customers. Our investments in our three business pillars are characterised by several factors including:</p><p>GROWTH:</p><p>Compared with our conventional Upstream assets, investments in\u00a0low- and zero-carbon solutions can require lower amounts of\u00a0capital.The levels of capital investment needed to maintain a renewable energy business are also likely to be lower than in capital-intensive complex engineering projects common in the oil and\u00a0gas industry, with their ongoing need for asset renewal and\u00a0resource replenishment.We can grow our sales of low-carbon energy without necessarily\u00a0investing in producing it ourselves by buying it from third parties and selling it to our customers. This model is part of\u00a0our business today, we sell more than three times the energy we produce ourselves.We can enter into different types of financial arrangements that\u00a0enable renewable generation capacity to be built, without bearing the full capital cost of the project. For example, developing renewable production as part of joint ventures allows\u00a0us to reduce the capital investment needed, while giving us access to valuable expertise from other partners. It also gives us the opportunity to secure a substantial portion of the energy produced, allowing us to grow customer sales (See box Offshore\u00a0wind).Our investments in our Marketing business will help decarbonise the energy system by increasing the provision of charging for electric vehicles and increasing the use of biofuels and low- and\u00a0zero-carbon lubricants.</p><p>TRANSITION:</p><p>Our investments in natural gas can help to decarbonise energy\u00a0use when it replaces energy with a higher carbon intensity such as coal and fuel for shipping.Restructuring our refinery business into energy parks will transform our business away from our traditional oil-based energy products.</p><p>UPSTREAM:</p><p>Most of our investments in our Upstream business are in maintaining assets and sustaining the value of the portfolio.Our existing Upstream assets are critical to delivering near-term cash flow and to enabling moderate growth. Our investments to improve the efficiency of our oil and gas\u00a0facilities can help reduce our operational emissions.</p><p>INVESTING IN OIL AND GASA natural decline in production happens in oil and gas reservoirs at a\u00a0rate of around 5% a year across the oil and gas industry. It takes constant reinvestment to sustain production and extract resources.</p><p>Our planned capital investment of $8 billion in our Upstream business in the near term is well below the investment level required to offset the natural decline in production of our oil and gas reservoirs, and will not sustain current levels of production.</p><p>As a result of this planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to\u00a02030, including divestments.</p><p>Powering lives by providing energy to homes.</p><p>OFFSHORE WINDShell is part of the Blauwwind Consortium that was awarded the right to develop, construct and operate the Borssele III and IV wind farm off the Dutch coast. Shell entered with a 40% share in 2016 and\u00a0Shell Energy Europe Limited secured a contract to sell 50% of the power produced. We sold half of our joint venture partnership in\u00a02018 when we brought on board an additional partner. The wind farm is now fully operational and has a total installed capacity of 731.5 MW, equivalent to powering 825,000 Dutch households. We\u00a0still sell 50% of the power produced.</p><p>Shell is part of a consortium that has developed a wind farm off the Dutch coast. We\u00a0sell 50% of the power produced.</p><p>CLIMATE POLICY ENGAGEMENTRobust and sustainable government policies will be critical to help the world achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions by 2050. These must include policies that accelerate the move to low-carbon energy in industries that are hard to\u00a0decarbonise, sector by\u00a0sector.</p><p>Shell's Powering Progress strategy includes working with governments to\u00a0support the policies and regulatory frameworks to accelerate the\u00a0transition to net zero.</p><p>We are seeing a growing number of countries aiming for net-zero emissions and enhancing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The USA has recently rejoined the Paris Agreement, for example, China has set out its plans to reach net zero by 2060, and the European Union (EU) has committed to climate neutrality, or net-zero emissions, in\u00a02050.</p><p>ENGAGING WITH GOVERNMENTSOur expertise in providing energy can help to shape effective policy, legislation and regulation, and we engage with governments, regulators and policymakers directly and indirectly, including through industry associations. We are also working with other companies, governments and investors through coalitions to identify the policies needed in sectors such as aviation, shipping and road freight to help change demand and\u00a0enable faster decarbonisation.</p><p>We are members of the Mission Possible Partnership sectoral coalitions for\u00a0aviation, shipping, road freight and steel. Each of these coalitions works to help accelerate decarbonisation pathways, including through policy engagement. For example, we are a member of the Clean Skies for\u00a0Tomorrow initiative, which has developed a joint policy proposal for\u00a0a\u00a0sustainable aviation fuel mandate in the EU which would require airlines to\u00a0use an increasing ratio of sustainable aviation fuel.</p><p>Shell is also a member of the Jet Zero Council (JZC) in the UK, a partnership between industry and government. JZC aims to deliver zero-emission transatlantic flight within a generation, and to drive new technologies and\u00a0innovative ways to cut aviation emissions. Shell is also a member of the\u00a0European Round Table for Industry (ERT) which has called on the EU institutions to introduce sectoral roadmaps to net-zero emissions [M].</p><p>GREATER TRANSPARENCYWe aim to be at the forefront of the drive for greater transparency around political engagement. We set out our approach, including our principles for responsible lobbying, in our statement on corporate political engagement which is published on our website [N].</p><p>Our principles for participation in industry associations govern how we manage our relationships with industry associations on climate-related policy. They build on the Shell General Business Principles and the Shell Code of Conduct, and have been incorporated in the Shell Control Framework, which sets the requirements for how all Shell entities operate. The principles aim to ensure our memberships of industry associations do not undermine our support for the Paris Agreement and that they support the development of government policies that could help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>In 2019, we published our first Industry Associations Climate Review, and\u00a0were one of the first companies to report this information [O]. The\u00a0review\u00a0assessed our climate-related policy alignment with 19\u00a0industry\u00a0associations against our 2019 climate-related policy positions.\u00a0The\u00a0following year we published an update to our review.</p><p>In 2020, we updated Shell's climate-related policy positions and published them on our website [P]. These positions include support for the\u00a0goal of the Paris Agreement and for the development of policies to help the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. They also include support for carbon pricing, carbon capture utilisation and\u00a0storage and\u00a0nature-based offsets.</p><p>In the newly published 2021 Industry Associations Climate Review, we\u00a0have reviewed 36 associations. We plan to publish our next update\u00a0in\u00a02022.</p><p>We will continue to work with governments, other companies, investors, non-governmental organisations, coalitions and industry associations to\u00a0help society achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement and net-zero emissions. We will also continue to work towards greater transparency around climate lobbying and reporting.</p><p>[M]<url normalizedValue=\"https://ert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-25-Statement-on-Sectoral-Approaches.pdf\">https://ert.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-25-Statement-on-Sectoral-Approaches.pdf</url>[N]<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>[O]2019 Industry Associations Climate Review <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/advocacy\">www.shell.com/advocacy</url>[P] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/advocacy-and-political-activity.html\">https://www.shell.com/sustainability/transparency/advocacy-and-political-activity.html</url></p><p>A JUST TRANSITIONThe energy transition will create employment and opportunities for people to learn new skills. It may also adversely affect workers and communities, for example in areas where traditional products, business activities or jobs are\u00a0phased out.The Paris Agreement refers to the importance of a just transition, recognising that governments must take into account the workers affected by the shift to a low-carbon economy, and create \"decent work and quality jobs\". The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the parent treaty of the Paris Agreement, has defined decent work as \"jobs that provide adequate incomes and social protection, safe working conditions, respect for rights at work and effective social dialogues\".</p><p>Our Powering Progress strategy seeks to support livelihoods, communities and an inclusive society as we transform our business to meet our target of\u00a0becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with\u00a0society.</p><p>One of the strategy's four main goals is powering lives, which sets out how we support livelihoods and communities. As we transform, we will continue to provide jobs, encourage local businesses to be part of our supply chain, promote entrepreneurship and offer skills training in communities where we operate.</p><p>We are working to help find viable ways to provide low-carbon energy that can support successful local economies. To do this we will work with governments, local communities, customers, employees, employee representative bodies, suppliers and industry groups.</p><p>We seek to work with contractors and suppliers who contribute to sustainable development and are economically, environmentally and socially responsible.</p><p>Our employees and their well-being are critical to the success of our business. During the energy transition, Shell will continue to respect workers' rights in line with the 1998 Declaration of the Fundamental Principles of Rights at Work published by the UN's International Labour Organization (ILO). We will continue to comply with ILO occupational health and safety standards and applicable laws and practices.</p><p>As portfolio changes affect our assets during the energy transition, we\u00a0will\u00a0seek to:</p><p>continue to engage with employees, employee representative bodies and relevant government bodies at a local level, keeping them informed about our plans and listening to any concerns;provide wages and benefits that meet or exceed the national legal standards; andprovide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and rewards.</p><p>DEVELOPING SKILLS FOR THE FUTUREAs our portfolio changes, we will seek to help employees develop skills for the future. This will strengthen their long-term employment prospects and enable them to seize opportunities created by the energy transition.</p><p>For example, the Pulau Bukom manufacturing site in Singapore will be affected by organisational changes and job reductions as it becomes one\u00a0of our energy and chemicals parks. We aim to significantly reduce Bukom's carbon dioxide emissions as the site produces fewer crude-oil, fuels-based products, instead favouring lower-carbon alternatives that may include biofuels. But over the course of three years, staff numbers will\u00a0go from the current level of around 1,300 to around 800.</p><p>We have partnered with the Singapore Shell Employees' Union to launch a Joint Capability Council (JCC) to help staff acquire new skills that will enable them to succeed in future roles. The JCC will help develop courses for employees in areas such as digital literacy and data analytics.</p><p>The JCC builds upon the UpSkill ShellSG initiative for all staff in Singapore. The UpSkill initiative allows our Singapore staff to access training in a wide range of subjects including digital skills, tech-enabled services, advanced manufacturing, leadership and project management. The initiative was developed in collaboration with local authorities who shared the aim of helping workers acquire skills that will enable them to succeed in the economy of the future.</p><p>SUPPORTING THE UNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE\u00a0DEVELOPMENT GOALSThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to address the\u00a0world's biggest challenges, including ending poverty, improving health\u00a0and education, and tackling climate change. Governments are responsible for implementing approaches that meet the SDGs, but success\u00a0will require unprecedented collaboration and collective action involving businesses and civil society.</p><p>As a leading energy company, we will play our part in supporting the SDGs. Energy plays a critical role in enabling economic and social development and improving people's livelihoods. The supply of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for addressing global challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality. That\u00a0is why we are working to provide energy to those who do not have\u00a0it\u00a0today.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, in 2019 there were around\u00a0770 million people in the world who lacked access to electricity. Hundreds of millions more are estimated to have an unreliable energy supply. One of our ambitions is that by 2030 we will provide reliable electricity to 100 million people in Africa and Asia who do not yet have it.</p><p>To help achieve this, we are developing market-based programmes that provide access to clean and affordable energy for some of the world's most remote and vulnerable people. We are investing in companies that specialise in solar home systems, mini-grids, and other innovations that improve access to energy. As well as managing our existing portfolio, we\u00a0are also seeking to develop large-scale power projects in key markets\u00a0and to use our global partnerships to improve access to energy.</p><p>POWERING LIVES THROUGH OUR ACTIVITIESManaging the impact of our activities on people living near our operations is essential to being a responsible organisation. Many of our operations are located close to communities, and we work with them to understand their priorities and concerns. In doing this we use international standards as our benchmark, including the International Finance Corporation's Environmental and Social Performance Standards - as well as our own rigorous standards.</p><p>We employ people in more than 70 countries, providing income and benefits such as health care and pensions. Every year, we spend tens of\u00a0billions of dollars on goods and services in the communities where we\u00a0operate. Our activities generate revenues for governments through the\u00a0taxes and royalties we pay and the sales taxes we collect on their behalf. This helps fund health care, education, transport and other essential services.</p><p>We strengthen local economies and employment opportunities through enterprise development programmes such as Shell LiveWIRE. The overall goal of these programmes is to enable communities to participate in and benefit from the stimulation of social and economic development. In 2020, 19,319 people participated in our programmes, which also supported 1,017 businesses. This helped create 1,805 jobs. In 2020, 99 businesses supported by Shell LiveWIRE entered our supply chain.</p><p>CLIMATE GOVERNANCEClimate change and risks resulting from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a significant risk factor for Shell. They are managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and\u00a0the Executive Committee.The Board committees play an important role in assisting the Board with regard to governance and oversight of management of climate change risks and opportunities, as described in the Annual Report. The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) assists the Board in\u00a0reviewing the practices and the performance of the Shell Group of companies, primarily with respect to safety, environment including climate\u00a0change, and sustainability.</p><p>When reviewing these areas and deciding how to advise the Board, SESCo takes into account the Shell General Business Principles, Code of\u00a0Conduct, and HSSE &amp; SP Control Framework. SESCo's duties include reviewing Shell's progress towards meeting our climate targets and the energy transition. SESCo also advises the Remuneration Committee (REMCO) on metrics relating to sustainable development and energy\u00a0transition.</p><p>INCENTIVES AND REMUNERATIONThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Directors' Remuneration Policy, in alignment with our business strategy.</p><p>Starting in 2021, we are increasing the weight associated with GHG emissions management in the annual scorecard, which helps determine the annual bonus levels for all our employees, including members of the Executive Committee. The GHG emissions intensity metric and its weight (10%) will remain unaltered, but we will add a new metric that measures the execution of GHG-abatement projects with a weight of 5%.</p><p>Performance Share Plan and Long-term Incentive Plan [Q]For 2021 awards made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the\u00a0weighting of the energy transition condition has doubled from 5% to\u00a010%. For 2021, the weighting of the energy transition condition in the\u00a0Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) will also double from 10% to 20%. The\u00a0target range is\u00a0a 6-8% reduction in net carbon intensity by 2023 against the 2016 baseline NCF of 79 grams of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) equivalent per megajoule.</p><p>The other targets linked to our strategic ambitions will also evolve, with the\u00a0metric connected to commercialising advanced biofuel technology broadening to a measure of growing new cleaner energy product offerings. The targets for the leading energy transition measures are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed retrospectively. The energy transition condition was included again in the 2020 LTIP awards for Executive Directors and Senior Executives and was also incorporated into\u00a0the Performance Share Plan awards made to around 16,500 employees globally.</p><p>\u00a0[Q]Executive Directors and Executive Committee members participate in the LTIP. Around 150 Senior Executives participate in the same plan. The measures and metrics for that plan also apply to 50% of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) awarded to around 16,500 employees.</p><p>TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES (TCFD)This publication and the description of our\u00a0energy transition strategy are part of\u00a0our continuing work to implement the\u00a0recommendations of the Task Force\u00a0on\u00a0Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</p><p>We assess our portfolio decisions, including investments and divestments, against the risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the energy transition. These include for example, policy actions such as higher regulatory costs linked to carbon emissions and demand changes which lower demand for oil and gas.</p><p>MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIESOur approach to assessing and managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change includes considering different time horizons. The time horizons and their relevance to risks, opportunities and business planning are as follows:</p><p>Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial projections and use them to manage performance and expectations on a three-year cycle. Medium term (generally three to 10 years): most of our expected production and earnings in this period come from our existing assets. Long term (generally beyond 10 years): for this period, it is expected that the current Shell portfolio will change and evolve with the energy transition. Decision-making and risk identification on the thematic structure of the future portfolio are guided by the pace of society's progress and the aim of being in step with society as it moves towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>The overall climate change risk consists of four components, based on the nature of our exposure and the options for our mitigation responses. The four components are regulatory risks, commercial risks, physical risks and societal risks. We provide more details about how we manage these in our Annual Report.</p><p>SCENARIOSOur portfolio and strategy have been assessed against a wide range of\u00a0outlooks. These include the potential impacts of various possible energy\u00a0transition pathways, and changes in societal expectations around\u00a0climate change. Our latest set of Shell scenarios [R] was one of\u00a0the\u00a0many variables used in guiding our updated strategy which we\u00a0announced in February 2021.</p><p>SENSITIVITY TO OIL PRICESWe estimate that a $10 per barrel change in oil prices would have an impact of roughly $6 billion per year on our cash flow from operations. Of\u00a0this, $4 billion would come from Upstream and $2 billion from our Integrated Gas business. Cash flows from our Growth pillar and Chemicals and Products businesses have limited exposure to commodity prices and so are not included in this calculation. This is an indicative estimate and not a prediction.</p><p>Based on this assumption, if the oil price sustainably increased by around $15 per barrel, as it did in January and February 2021, that would be expected to create an additional $9 billion in medium-term cash flow per year from operations from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. Similarly, a $15 fall in the oil price would be expected to result in a $9 billion reduction in cash flow from operations per year in the medium term.</p><p>[R] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-transformation-scenarios\">https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/scenarios/the-energy-transformation-scenarios</url></p><p>SENSITIVITY TO GOVERNMENT-LED CO2PRICESShell views carbon pricing as a key policy tool for meeting the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement as it helps to increase demand\u00a0for low-carbon energy and creates incentives for investment in\u00a0low-carbon technologies and infrastructure.</p><p>Shell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to increase over the next decade because of evolving carbon regulations. This expected increase is based on forecasts of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and non-operated assets, and real-terms carbon cost estimates which range from $5 to $110 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2030. This exposure also takes into account the estimated impact of free allowances as relevant to assets based on their location. The regulatory carbon cost estimate is refreshed on an annual basis as part of the development of our business plan.</p><p>RISK OF STRANDED ASSETSEvery year we test our portfolio under different scenarios, including prolonged low oil prices. In addition, we rank the break-even prices of our assets in the Upstream business to assess their resilience against low oil and gas prices. At December 31, 2020, we estimate that around 75% of\u00a0our current proved oil and gas reserves will be produced by 2030 and\u00a0only around 3% after 2040. We also estimate that around 70% of\u00a0our proved plus probable oil and gas reserves, known as 2P, will be\u00a0produced\u00a0by 2030, and only 5% after 2040.</p><p>EVOLVING REGULATORY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTSDisclosure requirements related to climate-related risks and opportunities are evolving and may result in more stringent disclosure mandates. Several regulatory bodies, including in the EU, the UK and the USA, are exploring frameworks and guidance for increased disclosure and creating uniform criteria for how economic activities score on environmental sustainability. Shell continues to monitor regulatory developments in this area, including progress on the EU Taxonomy and the adoption of the EU Delegated Acts\u00a0for the technical screening criteria and disclosure methodology. We\u00a0will develop responses as appropriate.</p><p>INCREASING TRANSPARENCYWe are implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in our reporting. We are also engaging with others including the investor group Climate Action 100+ and the Science Based Targets initiative as they develop new reporting, accounting and target-setting frameworks for the oil and gas industry. The Science Based Targets initiative is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature.</p><p>The structure of this report outlining our energy transition strategy is based on our continued engagement with Climate Action 100+ and on the net-zero disclosure standard developed by that group for the oil and gas industry.</p><p>The table below shows where to find Shell's disclosures that respond to the recommendations by the TCFD in our 2020 reports, publications and websites.</p><p>OUR STRATEGY TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSITION TO A NET-ZERO ENERGY BUSINESS<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OUR GOAL:</emphasis>Net zero by 2050, in step with society, aligned with Paris</p><p>OUR CLIMATE TARGETS:</p><p>ALL ENERGY SOLD SCOPES 1, 2 &amp; 3REDUCING NET CARBON INTENSITYABSOLUTE EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM\u00a01.7\u00a0GTPA TO\u00a0NET ZERO</p><p>ALIGNING OUR BUSINESS WITH PARIS:CHANGING HOW WE WORK</p><p>WHAT WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS</p><p>Low- and zero-carbon products and solutions to avoid, reduce and mitigate emissions from energy useIntroducing sector-based businesses accountable for driving decarbonisation</p><p>HOW WE OPERATE</p><p>Reducing Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions to net zero by 2050Operational efficiency: methane intensity target and eliminating routine flaring</p><p>HOW WE INVEST</p><p>Limit investment in Upstream, maintain investment in Transition, increase investment in\u00a0GrowthBuild material low-carbon businesses of significant scale by the early 2030s</p><p>HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS</p><p>Carbon budgets to steer business decisionsCarbon targets tied to staff and executive incentive structuresThe Board and Executive Committee have accountability for energy transition strategy</p><p>IN STEP WITH SOCIETY</p><p>CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS ACROSS SECTORS</p><p>Partner with customers to identify and pilot decarbonisation solutionsParticipate in sectoral coalitions to accelerate decarbonisation pathways</p><p>INDUSTRY PEERS</p><p>Working with Science Based Target initiative, Climate Action 100+ and Transition Pathways Initiative on industry standardsTransition Principles developed with other energy companies</p><p>GOVERNMENTS &amp; POLICYMAKERS</p><p>Responsible lobbyingDisclose climate-related policy positionsIndustry Associations Climate Review</p><p>INVESTORS</p><p>Support consistency in disclosures including\u00a0TCFD and WEF standards Transparency through Annual Report, Sustainability Report and advisory vote on\u00a0energy transition strategy and progress</p><p>POWERING LIVES\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0RESPECTING NATURE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GENERATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE</p><p>DISCLAIMER</p><p>CAUTIONARY NOTEThe companies in which Royal Dutch Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and\u00a0\"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Royal Dutch Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but\u00a0neither control nor joint control are referred to as \"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.</p><p>This report contains certain following forward-looking Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these\u00a0forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is\u00a0dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and\u00a0could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Royal Dutch Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.</p><p>As used in this report, \"Accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the\u00a0Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies.</p><p>This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S.\u00a0Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell.

According to a press release, the company's long-term goal is to facilitate \"an owned 100% field to jar production.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"As a scientist, I am very vigilant about the quality of natural ingredients and the way these ingredients are extracted,\" said Dr. Olivier Courtin-Clarins, Managing Director of Groupe Clarins, in a statement. \"Le Domaine Clarins gives us a chance to obtain the best ingredients while preserving the environment.\"</p><p>Le Domaine Clarins will also feature a \u2018Collection Garden,' a space dedicated to new plant experimentation, where scientists will endeavor to find new properties to enrich the brand's beauty offerings. Research findings will be added to the Clarins Herbarium, which already contains 250 plants.</p><p>Clarins has its roots in the natural world -- the brand was founded in 1954 by Jacques Courtin-Clarins with a line of 100% pure plant extract oils.

This month, the natural beauty label Lush rolled out its vegan, packaging- and plastic-free \u2018Naked' skincare line in Europe, while REN Clean Skincare has pledged to become completely \"zero waste\" by 2021, and last year saw Eminence Organic Skin Care became the first skincare brand to have planted a total 10 million trees, as part of its \"Forests for the Future\" program.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCK-CB91-JDVB-63JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"321\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>WELL-BEING</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The L'Or\u00e9al USA-owned brand has also promised that by the end of 2019, all shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner bottles from its top-selling hair care range, \u2018Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine', will be made from 100% post-consumer recycled waste. Fructis hair care products are currently produced in a zero waste facility and use packaging containing 50% post-consumer recycled waste.</p><p>\"Garnier's mission is to develop beauty products that are both good for you and good for the planet,\" said Anncy Rowe, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Garnier, in a statement. \"The announcement of our new signature, 100% PCR initiative for Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine and the Greenhouse Tour serves as a commitment to our customers that we continue to aspire to bring the highest quality, most efficacious naturally-inspired formulas in the most sustainable quality packaging to the masses at a price point that's attainable.\"<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BvKsRqpAdGs/embed\">https://www.instagram.com/p/BvKsRqpAdGs/embed</url></p><p>The \u2018Greenhouse Tour' refers to an educational roadtrip the company is undertaking throughout the US, which will kick off on March 17 in Miami and end on April 22 in New York. The tour, which will call in to retail locations in 22 cities, will allow audiences to discover the world of \u2018By Garnier, Naturally' via product and recycling demonstrations and interactive experiences. It will also highlight the brand's long-standing partnership with waste management company TerraCycle, and let visitors recycle their beauty empties on site.</p><p>Garnier and TerraCycle have been working together since 2011 to raise awareness of the importance of responsible recycling, but the beauty giant has noticeably ramped up its efforts to improve its eco-friendly credibility across the board recently. Since the start of this year, the French division of the brand has launched a new \u2018Garnier Bio' organic skincare line in France, and teamed up with the ecological NGO Fondation GoodPlanet to work with French farmers on developing agroforestry in tandem with the French Agroforestry Association.<br/>Mainstream beauty brands appear to be increasingly aware of the importance of responsible packaging: this month, the Procter &amp; Gamble hair care brand Herbal Essences also joined forces with TerraCycle to launch a series of bottles comprising 25% beach plastic, while Lush Cosmetics kicked off the year by taking its new \u2018Naked', plastic-free skincare line live across Europe. REN Clean Skincare has also pledged to become completely \"zero waste\" by the year 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNX-7F81-F19C-X3GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>WELL-BEING</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With just a few months to go until the crucial UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, agricultural and environmental experts agree that all forms of land use should be included in a post-Kyoto climate regime.  </p><p>According to a UNEP report, the agricultural sector could be largely carbon neutral by 2030 and produce enough food for a population estimated to grow to nine billion by 2050, if proven methods aimed at reducing emissions from agriculture were widely adopted today. Key among these methods are agroforestry, reduced cultivation of the soil, and the use of natural nutrients such as fertilizer trees.  </p><p>A study by World Agroforestry Centre scientists, for example, on fertilizer trees that capture nitrogen from the air and transfer it to the soil indicates that their use can reduce the need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers by up to 75 per cent while doubling or tripling crop yields. \"These results should make agroforestry appealing to farmers\" noted Dennis Garrity, Director General of the World Agroforestry Centre and Co-Chair of the Congress Global Organizing Committee.  </p><p>UN Under-Secretary-General and UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner said: \"Addressing the range of current and future challenges - from the food, fuel and economic crises to the climate change and natural resource scarcity ones - requires an accelerated transition to a low carbon, resource efficient Green Economy for the 21st century. Farming will be either part of the problem or a big part of the solution. The choice is straight forward: continuing to mine and degrade productive land and the planet's multi-trillion dollar ecosystems or widely adopting creative and climate-friendly management systems of which agroforestry is fast emerging as a key shining example.\"  </p><p>\"If implemented over the next fifty years, agroforestry could result in 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide being removed from the atmosphere, about a third of the world's total carbon reduction challenge,\" Dr Garrity said.  </p><p>Researchers suggest that integrating agroforestry in farming systems on a massive scale would create a vital carbon bank. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates no less than a billion hectares of developing country farmland is suitable for conversion to carbon agroforestry projects.  </p><p>\"Nations must seal the deal on a comprehensive and scientifically-credible new climate agreement in Copenhagen - there is a lot at stake, not least the future of agriculture and farmers' livelihoods. One key step will be for nations to agree to a scheme for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD) which will pave the way for preserving forests and other key ecosystems, as well as closing the gap in global demand for sustainable timber by shifting production from forest to farm,\" Mr. Steiner stated.  </p><p>According to a UNEP report released in June, the farm sector has the largest readily achievable gains in carbon storage, if best management practices were widely adopted. Up to 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent, or up to 2 Gt of carbon, could be sequestered each year by 2030, which is comparable to the current emissions from agriculture. Many of the agricultural practices that store more carbon can be implemented at little or no cost. The majority of this potential - 70 per cent - can be realized in developing countries.  </p><p>While farmers in developing countries are one of the world's largest, most efficient producers of sequestered carbon, to date it has not been possible to calculate or verify how much they are removing from the atmosphere. The World Agroforestry Centre and UNEP are partners in a project that promises to provide the basis for widespread adoption of agroforestry and other sustainable forms of agriculture.  </p><p>The Carbon Benefits Project, launched in May 2009, is developing a standard and reliable method for accurately measuring, monitoring, reporting, and projecting how much carbon each kind of land use is storing. This global project makes use of the latest remote sensing technology and analysis, soil carbon modeling, ground-based measurements, and statistical analysis.  </p><p>Garrity noted that if nations agree to a scheme for REDD in Copenhagen, the work of the Carbon Benefits Project will provide a more credible basis for smallholders to receive payments for conserving forests, practicing conservation agriculture and increasing tree cover on their farms that sequesters carbon.  </p><p>\"Saving carbon is not a priority for smallholder farmers. But, supporting them to expand their agroforestry systems provides income generation and service benefits to farmers that also have the co-benefit of sequestering carbon\" Garrity said. \"For example, by using fertilizer trees and other conservation agriculture techniques, farmers have increased their maize yields from an average of 1 tonne per hectare to 3 or even 4 tonnes per hectare while greatly improving exhausted soils. Food security is enhanced while farmers' production systems become better adapted to climate change.\"  </p><p>Garrity also cited an agroforestry project underway in Malawi, where smallholder farmers are being supported with knowledge about how to plant trees for fertilizer, fruit and fuelwood benefits. The addition of fuelwood and fruit trees on these farms releases women from having to take timber from the forest, and their children are receiving more vitamins and minerals in their diet.  </p><p>The theme of the Congress is Agroforestry - the future of global land use. It will assess opportunities to leverage scientific agroforestry in promoting sustainable land use worldwide. Over 1,000 researchers, practitioners, farmers, and policy makers from all corners of the globe are expected to attend, including Wangari Maathai, Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and renowned environmental activist, and M. S. Swaminathan, World Food Prize laureate and \"Father of the Green Revolution in India\".  </p><p>Tree geneticists will explain successful processes for domesticating tree species such as rubber, coffee and indigenous fruits.

To convert such areas, which theoretically are not suitable for cocoa, into productive, sustainable cocoa plantings, they successively intercrop cocoa with food crops and several fruit and forest tree species. Based on the ecosystem services rendered by such associations, this agroforestry technique could prove profitable for cocoa-producing countries in the current context of climate change. </p><p>Cocoa growing is generally seen as one of the factors in the deforestation of humid tropical zones . However, in central Cameroon , on the contrary, it is helping with reforestation : in the region, many farmers set up their cocoa plantings on grasslands. To be able to do this, they have invented complex agroforestry systems in which food and fruit crops, forest trees, palms and cocoa trees are combined and succeed each other. This was demonstrated by a recent study of farmer practices by a team from CIRAD and IRAD in the Bokito region, where almost half the cocoa plantations were set up on grasslands. </p><p>To achieve this result, farmers have to overcome several constraints. One, Imperata , is an invasive weed that competes with crops, and which farmers therefore have to eradicate. To do so, they plant oil palms or annual crops. These plantings allow them to eradicate Imperata rapidly and prevent its regrowth. Farmers subsequently plant cocoa trees along with fruit and forest trees, keeping a few oil palms. This has the dual advantage of providing the cocoa trees with shade, which is vital to buffer the effects of the dry season, and improving the fertility of the region's soils, which lack nutrients. </p><p>Such agroforestry systems allow farmers to produce, without fertilizers and in the long term, 320 kg of raw cocoa per hectare, as much as in plantings set up in gallery forests, while at the same time restoring degraded grassland soils. These practices could be a valid response to the threats related to climate change faced by the main African cocoa-producing countries. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN268924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58YJ-C4X1-F12G-X2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 23, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Three decades later, it has more than doubled its forest cover to an impressive 52% \u2013 one of the best postings globally \u2013 and is still pushing towards a target of at least 60% over the next few years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This reversal \u2013 without an army (since 1948) to forcefully implement its radical reforms \u2013 was possible because of purposeful leadership and strategic actions, as I learnt last week at the Good Growth Partnership conference in Peru.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government began an aggressive policy of generating government-protected areas that it was strict in implementing, Kifah Sasa, the United Nations Development Programme's sustainable development and resilience officer in Costa Rica told me in the town of El Sauce, in the heart of the PeruvianAmazon.</p><p> \"In 1996, it issued a forestry law that makes land-use change illegal. So landowners cannot clear their land if it has forest,\" he explained. \"If a bare land regenerates and has dense vegetation loosely considered to be a forest, it cannot be chopped down.\"</p><p> It also instituted a tax on hydrocarbons. The tax revenue in turn is used to enable five-year payments to farmers to keep forest cover or to take on agroforestry systems.</p><p> In addition, instead of having conventional coffee plantation without shade, farmers were encouraged to switch to agroforestry systems and so get improved quality of coffee as well as payments for the shade \u2013 a surefire way to propel farmers into being protectors of the environment. It successfully reversed deforestation.</p><p>The Americas, particularly the range of countries that house the Amazon forest and Andean mountains, have been particularly susceptible to climate change as mankind continues to exploit more and more of nature's resources.</p><p>Across the Atlantic, vast parts of West Africa and the Sahel region are also victims of massive deforestation, despite claims to the contrary by climate-science deniers.</p><p> According to the World Economic Forum, almost 90% of the area's coastal rainforest has already been destroyed and deforestation has doubled in the Congo Basin since 1990.</p><p> This is unwittingly playing a huge role in other related conflicts including pastoralist crises from central Nigeria towards Mauritania \u2013that arise as sedentary populations and nomads battle for diminishing resources \u2013 and insurgencies from northern Nigeria towards Central African Republic.</p><p> With forests in Asia fast diminishing, corporations and loggers have moved focus to South America and parts of Africa, engaging in illegal logging practices.</p><p> Reports also show that the destruction of tropical forests in West and Central Africa leads to a corresponding decrease in rainfall in southern Europe and parts of the US.</p><p>But unlike in Costa Rica, for example, there is little political willpower to make a positive difference.</p><p> In December 2015, a total of 195 countries signed the historic Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p><p> A year later, 143 countries \u2013 33 of which are in Africa \u2013 ratified the agreement in Marrakesh. Seven countries in West and Central Africa (representing 13% of the world's total tropical rainforest area) also pledged a shift to sustainable production in oil palm. Nigeria was conspicuously missing.</p><p> Last May, I was present in Lagos as eight African cities further pledged to reduce carbon emissions in the same timeframe; but signing and trumpeting agreements are one thing and implementing them is another. Since then, I have been in Lagos, Abidjan, Accra and there are no clear signs of progression towards this goal in these cities. Perhaps it is time to learn from our brothers across the Atlantic?</p><p>Copycats for change?</p><p>Peru \u2013 Latin America's fastest-growing economy last year, with a 4% GDP increase \u2013 is also taking steps to copy the good work Costa Rica has done.</p><p> President Martin President Martin Vizcarra was present at the opening ceremony of the Good Growth Conference and also took time out to fly into the heart of the Amazonian jungle to meet us in Chuzatca, a community that just two decades ago was drowning under a reign of violence from the Shining Path Maoist movement, the homebred Marxist-leaning MRTA and narco traffickers from all across the Americas.</p><p> Vizcarra's ministers of environment and agriculture \u2013 I was pleasantly surprised to see that they are both women \u2013 told myself and other journalists in a press conference later that the Peruvian government was increasingly involving indigenous people in its policymaking and also using sophisticated software in tracking illegal land use.</p><p>Costa Rica, which managed to reduce its carbon footprint while growing the economy and boosting ecotourism as well, has also taken the daring step of pledging a total de-carbonisation of its economy by 2050.</p><p> Approximately 95% of its energy matrix is already renewable \u2013 hydroelectrics, geothermal power, etc. \u2013 and fossil fuels are only used sparingly if dam water levels are very low.</p><p> For 300 days last year, Costa Rica was 100% powered by renewable energy only.</p><p>Since 20% of total government revenue comes from hydrocarbons, it now has to find a fifth of its income in the next coming years from another revenue source. This is extremely interesting that it is risking its income to develop a sustainable economy that ensures healthier lives for its citizens.</p><p>Can African countries, especially those with plentiful natural resources and huge potentials for solar and hydroelectric power generation, do this, rather than focus on seeking rents that are eventually misappropriated? Can they copy the modus operandi of a small country like Costa Rica, which has few mineral resources but earns forex from agricultural exports and ecotourism?</p><p>C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and landlocked Ethiopia might be close to copying from that handbook. Between 2016 and now, officials from both countries have visited Costa Rica and Guatemala on visits fostered by the UNDP and a coalition of other groups like Conservation International, studying with policymakers and research agencies about how to improve crop quality and forest protection.</p><p>It is the way forward and African governments must now embrace this concerted approach, embracing strategies from abroad.</p><p>A healthy partnership and long-lasting solutions</p><p>\"You need political will from presidential level to ministerial level and then everyone else to want to make those changes so that the agroforestry sector becomes sustainable [\u2026] that's not always there,\" Andrew Bovarnick, head of the Green Commodities Programme, which organised the conference, told me.</p><p>To build trust, mechanisms that can go on in spite of political change are needed. Also important is realising that companies, governments and civil servants have different cultures of work and different priorities. While governments are focused on elections, votes and public policies, companies are focused on profit, brand reputation and markets. Companies often work on a quarterly basis because they have to report to their shareholders and they are used to making changes much quicker while government takes a lot longer so theres often a real issue in difference in expectations. Both have to align, says Bovarnick.</p><p>This is key in West and Central Africa, where there are more tropical rainforests. It is therefore important that governments there must be willing to engage the private sector more and be broad-minded enough to work out technical solutions that outlast leadership changes.</p><p>A few years ago, Bovarnick and his colleagues set up a cocoa trading platform in Ghana and it was running for two years involving farmers, stakeholders. \"It was beginning to create the space for multi-stakeholder collaboration, and then a new government came in,\", he recalled. \"They had a new director of the cocoa board who's not interested in an inclusive multi-stakeholder dialogue and he basically put the platform on hold. So for four years whilst he was in power, that was it. Then he changed and a new person came in and now they are more collaborative again.\"</p><p>This is again why Costa Rica is the example to follow. Since 1994 when it amended its constitution to include the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental human right, it has had six presidents. All of them have pursued the same vision with a single sense of purpose prioritised over selfish political legacies and that, dear African leaders, is the way to go.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT3105201900013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W78-3KV1-F00C-62YD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1445\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 31, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

An estimated 2.6 billion people rely on fuelwood, including charcoal, for cooking their food.</p><p>Incentives for small-scale forest producers</p><p>The conference participants agreed that small-scale forest producers should be encouraged to strengthen their involvement in agroforestry, tree-growing, small-scale wood processing and the provision of ecosystem services.</p><p>Microfinance loans to small and medium-sized forest enterprises in many cases have resulted in gains  in family incomes and better health, nutrition and quality of life in rural areas, especially when microloans are given to women.</p><p>Improved access to trees and land</p><p>The potential economic and environmental gains from secure land tenure are substantial, and tree tenure can also lead to fundamental improvements in land management. The conference stressed the need for improving access rights to trees and land to create significant incentives for farmers to engage in agroforestry, for example, by applying the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests, which were recently adopted by the Committee on World Food Security.</p><p>Forest ecosystem services foster food production</p><p>The conference highlighted the essential role of ecosystem services provided by forests and trees to agricultural production, which include protecting water and soil resources, contributing to soil development processes, including increasing soil fertility, regulating climate and providing habitat for wild pollinators and predators of agricultural pests.</p><p>Forested wetlands and mangrove forests help protect coastal areas from flooding, thereby increasing the stability of food production in coastal lands. Forests also play vital roles in riverine and coastal fisheries, which are often particularly important to poor communities. Mountain forests provide vital ecosystem services, particularly \"blue\" fresh water for downstream forests and dependent communities.</p><p>Intersectoral cooperation<br/>According to the conference recommendations, it is essential to ensure that relevant sector policies, including those on agriculture, forests and trees, as well as food security and nutrition, are coordinated across sectors, and that all stakeholders, from forest-dependent communities to ministries, are actively involved in their development and implementation.</p><p>More than 400 participants attended the conference, including governments, civil-society organizations, local communities, donors and international agencies from more than 100 countries. </p><p><br/>Conference participants further encouraged FAO to promote the conference recommendations to the next sessions of the Committee on World Food Security and the Committee on Forestry, as well as to the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) to be held at FAO headquarters in Rome on 19-21 November 2014.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN266235</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58G8-VCD1-JDKF-61MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"605\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>May 22, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But now the need for resilient measures was becoming increasingly urgent as the drylands struggled to cope with climate change, he added.</p><p>At a donor conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Tuesday, the EU pledged \u00a350 million to support an African-led peace operation in Mali on top of earlier commitments of .</p><p>While humanitarian crises in the sub-Saharan regions are often linked to ethnic and religious tensions, Garrity said the principle causes were droughts, food insecurity, and poverty.</p><p>\"The pattern for terrorism overlaps perfectly with the drylands. These regions are bottom of the human development index, bottom of the hydrological index\", he said. \"There is extreme food insecurity in Mali, Niger and the Horn of Africa\".</p><p>He added it was \"perhaps no coincidence\" that sub-Saharan literacy levels were also extremely low. He said a lack of education translated into a \"lack of agility to cope with change\", which in extreme circumstances such as droughts could lead to radicalisation.</p><p>In some areas of the drylands, the average amount of time a girl or woman has spent in school is under one year.  have found a spatial relationship between higher adult female illiteracy and higher levels of land degradation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tree of life</emphasis></p><p>Garrity said the sub-Saharan regions should be a development priority, and that agroforestry could present an effective and holistic solution.</p><p>\"We face a perfect storm of challenges. Holistic, comprehensive solutions are needed. The drylands must be the particular focus\", he said.</p><p>\"We have to deal with the drylands crises. [Its people] are being overwhelmed, not coming out of them\", he added. \"Violence is upsetting the development processes.\"</p><p>The evidence suggests that planting trees can contribute significantly towards land stability in the drylands and sub-humid regions. Reij said in southern Niger farmers had improved some five million hectares of land through \"regenerating and multiplying valuable trees whose roots already lay underneath their land\". This had led to more than 500,000 additional tonnes of food per year. One community trained in these techniques saw its income rise by nearly \u00a321,000 in one year, the vice-chairman of the International Tree Foundation, Roger Leakey, told EurActiv.</p><p>Reij said water harvesting could drive local growth, with \u00a31 more earned by each farmer translating into \u00a31.6 in non-farmed areas.</p><p>African ministers are also endorsing initiatives such as the EU co-funded which promotes practices such as placing stone bunds in crop land and harvesting rainwater.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Resilience</emphasis></p><p>Development experts stressed the need for sub-Saharan farmers to adopt resilient measures, based on indigenous practices.</p><p>Reij told the conference that locally-used species such as baobab trees could provide farmers with just the seasonal durability they are looking for.</p><p>The leaves of the  are high in protein and vitamins A and C, and contain a wild spectrum of amino acids. The trunk can also be used to store as much as 10,000 litres of water for a number of months, essential in drought-prone climates. What is more, Reij said, the shade of leaves could provide vital protection from the sun for other crops.</p><p>Other indigenous plants, such as the Moringa, are also being deployed in sub-Saharan agricultural land. The International Tree Foundation is looking into the domestication of local plants, combining local knowledge with science to tease out the most beneficial breeds, Leakey said.</p><p>Officials from the European Commission's development directorate general expressed their backing for these measures, which are in line with their plan for \"resilient development\".</p><p>\"We are convinced agroforestry is the future\", said Kristian Schmidt, Commission director of human and society development.
