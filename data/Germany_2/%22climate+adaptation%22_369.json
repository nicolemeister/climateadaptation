In a joint declaration, the EU also promised Ukraine the delivery of additional power generators and mobile heating stations as Russia's war against Ukraine enters its second winter.  \"The European Union will continue to provide strong financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes,\" the declaration read.  EU leaders also backed a legislative proposal on the use of revenues from the management of Russian assets frozen in the bloc for the reconstruction of Ukraine, and on strengthening EU sanctions on Moscow.  The new pledges come amid concerns that the war between Israel and Hamas could divert attention from the war in Ukraine.  Additional EU aid worth billions of euros for Ukraine however remained caught up in a dispute over the bloc's long-term budget after the end of a two-day summit in Brussels.  The European Commission aims to support Kiev's economy with a total of ?50 billion ($52.7 billion) between 2024 and 2027.  Additionally, EU top diplomat Josep Borrell had proposed to provide up to ?20 billion for military support for the same period.  While most EU states are ready to support Ukraine for the long haul, some countries, like Hungary and Slovakia, have so far been reluctant to make new financing commitments for Kiev.  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban stressed again in Brussels that he is not ready to agree to new money for Ukraine.  \"We must show endurance on support for Ukraine because we have to ... fulfil promises that we have given before,\" Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said, urging fellow leaders to act.  European Council President Charles Michel said it will be \"an exercise of collective intelligence\" to get all 27 EU countries to agree by the end of the year, when the current aid programme runs out.  Concerns are rising in Brussels that Orban's persistent veto might not only be rooted in his warm ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but also fuelled by his own financial interests.  Last year the commission froze ?13 billion in EU funds for Budapest over the deterioration of the rule of law under Orban's government.  Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on Friday accused Orban of trying to blackmail the EU, implying that Orban would not agree to financial support for Ukraine until Budapest itself receives a multi-billion payment from Brussels.  Getting up 27 EU member states to agree to new support for Kiev is made even more difficult by the fact that continued financial aid for Ukraine had been tied to a legislative proposal for a sweeping revision of the EU's long-term budget.  The commission had asked member states to contribute an additional ?66 billion to the common budget to the discontent of some national governments, which are dealing with stagnating economies and tightened budgets at home.  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday that existing money should be better used before more contributions are required from member states.  Next to Ukraine, leaders also discussed the contested reform of the joint debt and deficit rules for EU countries using the euro as a common currency.  The usually strict spending rules were suspended to allow national governments to counter the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine.  EU countries however now have to decide in the coming months on how to return to budget discipline while taking multiple economic challenges into account such as dwindling competitiveness and the cost of climate adaptation.

According to KfW's projections, total municipal investment needs amount to around ?5.8 billion ($6.4 billion) annually.  A survey conducted by the state bank found that local governments themselves expect higher climate-related expenditure. But more than half assume that they will only be able to finance a small fraction of the additional investments from their existing funds.  In their financial planning for the next five years, the municipalities have earmarked only about ?3.5 billion annually for climate protection and adaptation.   In order to be able to invest more, according to KfW, they want new and simplified funding programmes as well as more financial resources.  In 2021, according to the results of the survey of communities with more than 2,000 residents, around ?4 billion worth of investments were made in climate protection measures.  The largest investment project for municipalities in the past three years was the refurbishment of buildings to make them more energy efficient.  High-cost projects also included the installation of photovoltaic systems and the conversion of lighting to LED.

The announcement came as her week-long trip to Africa comes to an end on Saturday.The United States is committed to these types of innovative solutions to support climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience, she said during a press conference with Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema on Friday.Harris added that the US would also provide more federal funding to improve access to climate information services.The private funding will comprise investments by a mix of 27 companies and organizations. The funding is to be used for the promotion of climate-smart agriculture and to tackle the effects of climate change on Africa&amp;#39;s food security.Some of the funds will be used for projects in sustainability, clean energy and clean transportation.Harris&amp;#39; trip marks the fifth high-level visit from the United States to the continent in a short span of a few months.Climate politics in AfricaNumerous studies have established that even though African countries add relatively less towards the climate crisis, the repercussions faced in the continent are substantial.African countries emit far less greenhouse gasses than developed countries like the United States.At a press conference in Ghana, Harris was asked how the West could ask Africa to go green and stop using its natural resources. </p><p>She was also questioned about the commitment of $100 billion in aid from wealthy nations to impoverished countries under the Paris climate accord.Harris said it is critically important that, as global leaders, we all speak truth about the disparities that exist in terms of cause and effect and that we address those disparities.mf/sms (AP, dpa) </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/harris-pledges-billions-in-private-climate-funds-for-africa/a-65202556?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL1099881680340848757258793000233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67YB-3251-F03R-N15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"334\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

These global partners offer distinct expertise and resources to coordinate strategies for the private sector to help address the annual financing gap of over USD 3 trillion necessary for achieving net-zero emissions, reversing nature loss, and restoring biodiversity. This signifies a new era of collaborative climate action guided by the COP28 Action Agenda, which includes fast-tracking a just and orderly energy transition; fixing climate finance; putting nature, lives, and livelihoods at the heart of climate action; and underpinning everything with full inclusivity.</p><p>COP28 President Dr. Sultan Al Jaber said, \"Businesses and philanthropists must play leading roles in meeting net zero pathways and delivering sustainable development, and through the Business &amp; Philanthropy Climate Forum at COP28, they will have a platform to do so. The BPCF is a key part of our Presidency's agenda to help deliver concrete outcomes from the private and philanthropic sectors. We are committed to hosting a fully inclusive COP, and it would be impossible to do this without the vital input of our business and philanthropy communities.\"</p><p>COP28 Special Representative for Business &amp; Philanthropy , Badr Jafar commented, \"Working together to create a truly inclusive action platform, the Forum's partners will be instrumental in collectively turning our aspirations into actionable outcomes for climate and nature. Their broad expertise, resources, and unwavering commitment is what is required to harness the true potential of both business and philanthropy, working alongside an enabling policy environment, to generate a multiplier effect on impact towards increasingly urgent climate and nature goals.\"</p><p>Collaborating across the Forum's transformative agenda, the Forum's strategic partner Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) will help bring together global leaders to align industry, investment, and country roadmaps to showcase the progress achieved and chart the path for expediting and expanding these efforts.</p><p>Highlighting the importance of the Forum, SMI CEO, Jennifer Jordan-Saifi , added, \"Building on the foundations of the SMI's Terra Carta Action Forums this platform will ensure, for the first time, meaningful integration of the private sector into the official world leaders' program at the UNFCCC COP. As we accelerate action to 2030, this Forum sets a bold new standard for future COPs with a commitment to monitoring and showcasing global private sector progress. This Forum will be the 'must attend' event at COP28.\"</p><p>The Forum's partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) , the private sector arm of the World Bank Group , underscores the development finance sector's commitment to green investments. Makhtar Diop, IFC Managing Director stated, \"IFC is the leading global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector. We create investable climate project pipelines and mobilize institutional capital at scale to accelerate a resilient and inclusive transition in emerging markets. We're delighted to serve as a delivery partner in the Forum.\"</p><p>Commenting on the partnership with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , which works with over 100 countries, Head of the OECD's Networks, Partnerships and Gender Division, Bathylle Missika added, \"The OECD is committed to raising international awareness around philanthropy's contribution to climate adaptation and mitigation. That's why we are honored to be named as a delivery partner of the COP28 Business &amp; Philanthropy Climate Forum, where we will continue the work started at the New Global Financing Pact and position the collective voice of philanthropy.\"</p><p>Since 1971, the World Economic Forum has been promoting and driving multi-stakeholder engagement across all sectors. B\u00f8rge Brende, President of WEF commented, \"The World Economic Forum launched its Giving to Amplify Earth Action (GAEA) initiative to turbocharge corporate and public action across climate and nature by bringing the catalytic tools of philanthropy into the conversation. We are honored to be an official delivery partner of COP28's Business &amp; Philanthropy Climate and look forward to working together to unlock ambition and action for people and planet\".</p><p>\"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to enhancing collaboration between philanthropy, business and the public sector in order to enhance climate action across Asia and the Pacific,\" said Woochong Um, Managing Director General of ADB . \"We are excited about being a delivery partner to the COP28 Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum. Partnerships are critical for ADB to deliver on our USD 100 billion climate finance ambition by 2030.\"</p><p>The African Finance Corporation emphasizes the importance of climate resilience across particularly vulnerable regions within the Global South. Samaila Zubairu, President &amp; CEO of AFC, added, \"Our collaboration must advance often-overlooked natural capital solutions emerging from Africa, which hold the key to sustainable, environmentally conscious development not only for our region, but also for progressing global efforts to net zero. This Forum is critical to galvanizing the urgent action needed if we are to transform our global economy in a way that ensures a balanced coexistence with nature, building a promising future for generations to come.\"</p><p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation stated that \"the business and philanthropic community is uniquely positioned to catalyze innovation and find solutions to address climate change, including mitigation and adaptation. We believe that the COP28's Business &amp; Philanthropy Climate Forum will inspire and encourage bold action to overcome the climate challenges for the most vulnerable communities that are already feeling the impacts, especially smallholder farmers.\"</p><p>XPRIZE , an established global leader in incentivizing crowd-sourced, scientifically viable solutions to humanity's greatest challenges, injects the spirit of competition, inspiring breakthrough solutions that can reshape the climate narrative.

Following the climate protection offensive that has already been running since 2017, the new HDE-Adapt project has now been launched with a wide range of workshops and informative materials on climate change adaptation. </p><p>The project provides retailers with targeted support in preparing themselves for increasingly frequent extreme weather events and becoming more resilient. Recent heatwave events in summer have highlighted the direct impact of climate change on the German retail industry: High temperatures lead to lower foot traffic in city centers. In the event of high heat, energy costs can also be expected to rise, as more air-conditioning of sales areas becomes necessary. Increased energy consumption has a counterproductive effect on energy-saving efforts and climate protection concepts. Early adaptation of the product range, structural changes such as shading, insulation, environmentally friendly cooling or a suitable choice of location from a climate point of view would be suitable measures and can also bring advantages over competitors. HDE-Adapt will run for two years and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection. Until the end of 2024, informative materials will be produced on an ongoing basis and workshops, and seminars will be held for retail companies to raise awareness of possible competitive advantages and to enable retailers to identify and exploit climate adaptation potential throughout the company - at their own premises and in their supply chain.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGIEU-100746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGIEU2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67MG-R0W1-JC9B-1195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">477069</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 EDM Publications GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SGI Europe</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30679\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 34</volume><issueNumber>Issue 3-4</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 26, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLON</classCode><className>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N813910MM</classCode><className>BUSINESS &amp;

They need to be empowered so they become more resilient. Better land tenure serves that purpose because it enables them to adapt to the changing climate in ways that suit their specific needs:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Secure tenure gives rural communities a long-term stake in the health of their land and thus creates incentives to invest in sustainable land-management practices. Land ownership also ensures they have resources for doing so.</p><p>Experience shows that rural communities with secure land tenure are indeed more likely to adopt practices that prevent soil erosion, promote agroforestry and conserve water resources. These measures serve resilience against climate change-induced disasters.</p><p>Land tenure enables communities to engage in efforts to conserve biodiversity. When communities have control over their land, they are more likely to establish protected areas, implement wildlife corridors and apply traditional ecological knowledge in ways that safeguard local biodiversity. Diverse ecosystems, in turn, are more resilient to climate disruptions.</p><p>Rural communities intimately understand the unique climate challenges they face. With secure land tenure, they will develop local adaptation strategies that suit their needs, including crop diversification, soil improvement and sustainable water management.</p><p>At the same time, secure land tenure serves climate-change mitigation too:</p><p>Trees take many years to grow, and rural families who know they will benefit from long-term investments are more likely to engage in afforestation and reforestation. Trees are carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions. To some extent, international funding is available for afforestation and reforestation. However, secure tenure rights are often a precondition for participating in projects related to REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).</p><p>Tenure security allows communities to invest in agroecology and organic farming. These environment-friendly methods reduce the need for chemical inputs, ultimately lowering carbon emissions from the agricultural sector.</p><p>People with land-tenure rights can participate in generation of solar and wind power. By diversifying sources of revenue and contributing to clean energy generation, these initiatives help to reduce the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Advocacy matters</p><p>The empowerment of local rural communities through secure land-tenure rights requires concerted efforts on multiple fronts. Too many rural people have no rights - or only rather shaky rights - to the land they depend on. Women in particular are often denied what they should be entitled to.</p><p>Advocacy plays a pivotal role in ensuring that policymakers recognise the intrinsic links between land tenure on the one hand and climate adaptation and mitigation on the other. Advocacy groups will obviously benefit from solid data and scientific evidence. It is important to highlight success stories. Such examples can inspire others and encourage policymakers to promote change. On the other hand, case studies and evidence documenting disasters can help to avoid repeating mistakes.</p><p>A positive example is the promotion of mangrove co-management approaches in Bangladesh. A key component was the allocation of clear tenure rights to local communities. Land tenure allows them to use and manage mangroves in ways that increase their resilience to flooding resulting from sea-level rise.</p><p>It is important to push for reforms and policy initiatives to enhance local people's land tenure. It also makes sense to promote collective land use planning, involving rural communities in climate action. Relevant policy measures include:</p><p>the legal recognition of customary land rights,</p><p>streamlined land-registration processes and</p><p>protection against land grabbing.</p><p>Collective action</p><p>Advocacy is more effective when diverse stakeholders collaborate. Civil-society organisations, community-based initiatives, research institutions and government agencies should cooperate on amplifying the message. So far, however, there is a lack of grassroots involvement. All too often, local voices are not heard. Community-based organisations must be empowered, not least because they are essential for reaching out to rural people and convincing them of new approaches.</p><p>The Global Forum on Agricultural Research and Innovation is a multi-stakeholder membership-based platform. To emphasise inclusiveness, it will soon change its acronym from GFAR to GFAiR. Its mission includes focusing on small farmers' empowerment. Among other things, it engages in what it calls Collective Actions. One of them is called 'Mainstreaming land rights of the rural poor in the climate discourse'. In this context, a diverse set of stakeholders is exploring common interests and identifying priorities for addressing the extreme vulnerability of landless or almost landless poor in regard to the fast growing risks of climate-induced disasters. Core objectives are to:</p><p>raise awareness for the relevance of land tenure,</p><p>promote the involvement of local communities,</p><p>ensure open access to relevant data and</p><p>share best practices.</p><p>This Collective Action is coordinated by ANGOC (the Asian NGO Coalition for Agrarian Reform and Rural Development). This GFAR member also laid the foundations for the Collective Action. Other partners include the Netherlands-based Land Portal Foundation, the Association for Land Reform and Development (ALRD) in Bangladesh, the multisectoral and international Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI).</p><p>The empowerment of local communities is necessary both for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Where people have secure land tenure, they become stewards of the environment. Their rights must be ensured accordingly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0811202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69K8-WMY1-F00C-61VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 8, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The funding from public sources aims \"to support developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change,\" a press release read.  The announcement comes ahead of the UN's COP27 climate change conference which is taking place in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6.  The funds included ?2.50 billion from the EU budget and the European Development Fund as well as ?2.56 billion from the European Investment Bank.  54% of the funds were earmarked either for climate adaptation or actions tackling both adaptation and climate change mitigation, the statement read citing European Commission figures.  Almost half of the total amount was committed in the form of grants.  \"The EU and its member states are determined to continue delivering on their international climate finance commitments towards the developed countries' collective goal of mobilising USD 100 billion per year,\" the press release read.  International public climate finance aims at supporting countries in the global south to implement the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Wealthy nations say they'll do more to help African nations cope with climate shocks.Wealthy nations said they would spend about $25 billion (\u20ac25 billion) by 2025 to boost Africa's efforts to adapt to climate change, according to officials at a climate summit in Rotterdam, Netherlands, held Monday. </p><p><br/>The summit was the first ever to bring together leaders from across many governments and institutions, like the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund, to discuss climate adaption techniques for Africa. <br/>The amount pledged was billed as the largest ever climate adaptation effort globally. <br/>Akinwumi A. Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, told DW that Africa was not just affected by climate change, but \"distressed\" by it. <br/>Africa and the climate crisis <br/>Africa is the world's most climate-vulnerable continent, according to the latest UN assessment. <br/>The summit gains importance because it comes before the 27th annual summit of the Conference of the Parties (COP27) in Egypt, to be held in November. <br/>It was at COP26 in Glasgow that leaders revisited 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. They also made a new commitment to bring more international funding for rapid climate adaption measures. <br/>The African Adaptation Summit takes place just weeks after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that rich countries had failed to deliver on their 2009 promise to spend $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries adapt to global warming. <br/>The OECD said richer nations gave $83.3 billion to poorer nations in 2020, the highest ever sum, but still short of the original amount. <br/>African nations generate less than 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions but they're suffering \"a deluge of problems,\" Adesina told DW. <br/>Adesina added that Africa loses anywhere between \"$7 billion and $15 billion a year as a result of climate change.\" <br/>How can Africa tackle climate change? <br/>Adesina told the summit that Africa does not have the financial resources to tackle climate change since it only receives \"3% of the total climate financing.\" <br/>Africa will need between $1.3 and $1.6 trillion this decade to implement itss commitments to Paris climate agreement, an annual cost between $140 and $300 billion, Adesina said. <br/>He told DW he is not too concerned whether African can balance the needs of its economy as well as commit to climate adaption techniques. <br/>He maintains African nations have vast gas reserves, and given the crisis in Europe, may even be able to help European countries to secure gas supplies in the future. <br/>Still, despite the presence of leaders and four African presidents at the summit, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Amina Jane Mohammed, said it was important to take note of those who weren't there. <br/>She told DW that the struggle was to \"continue to see this [climate change] as an existential threat for everyone and not just for one side of the world.\" <br/>Mohammed said a major problem was that while money was available for climate finance, very little of it found its way to Africa. <br/>\"The truth of the matter is that the resources that we need, need to be leveraged. They\u2002need\u2002to\u2002be\u2002de-risked\u2002that's not happening. And it needs to happen yesterday.\" <br/>Mohammed added it was crucial for climate adaptation techniques to take effect. <br/>\"This is an implementation COP.\u2002It's happening in Africa. If we can't demonstrate\u2002commitments to Africa at this time, then really the promises are broken,\" she told DW. <br/>Associated Press material contributed to the report <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988166243083439125976100231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66B1-27C1-JCMN-Y2B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"627\"/><timeReceived>2:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 6, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0007LOR</classCode><className>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CU</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000549</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CT</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS &amp;

The gist of his message? There is absolutely no excuse for failing to ensure consistent African representation in the world's key decision-making bodies.  \"It is time to overcome the reticence and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles,\" said Sall, who also is the president of Senegal.  Sall's speech was about the need to give Africa permanent seats at the UN Security Council so, as he put it, \"Africa can finally be represented where decisions that affect 1.4 billion Africans are being taken.\"  But that was far from the first time he has called upon the global community to seek and consider African perspectives. From the beginning of his one-year term as the African Union's chairman last February, Sall said he wanted to see fair, equitable international partnerships that welcomed African contributions instead of dismissing African priorities.  \"Our continent cannot be a field which is the feast of others,\" Sall said during his inaugural speech.  He also has spoken up for greater African representation in the G20, which as of yet only has one African member (South Africa). Multilateralism must \"serve the interests of all,\" Sall argued in October, or it will suffer \"loss of legitimacy and authority.\"  I commend Chairman Sall for his tireless work, not only to insist that the global community listens to and respects African issues, but also to build awareness of just what those issues are.  He has put African needs and priorities - including infrastructure development, greater access to COVID-19 vaccinations, food security, and an end to energy poverty - in front of world leaders ranging from Chinese President Xi Jinping to U.S. President Joe Biden. He has done the same at global events, including the 2022 G20 summit and the COP27 climate conference.  Sall has been particularly outspoken about Africa's energy needs and the rights of African countries to continue extracting and capitalizing upon their oil and gas resources, even in the face of tremendous global pressure for Africa to make a rapid switch to renewable energy sources. Sall has firmly stated that, when it comes to the global march toward net zero emissions, Africa will not be in lockstep with the rest of the world at the expense of our countries' well-being.  We are in an era when Africa needs fierce advocates. Nations and international partnerships are fighting for their respective priorities, and unless African leaders are willing to stand up for what our continent needs, our objectives will be pushed aside. Sall has, indeed, taken a stand.  We will not accept that polluting countries, responsible for the situation of the planet, tell us that we are no longer going to finance fossil fuels  An Unwavering Voice for a Just Energy Transition  African energy was not Sall's only priority as chairman of the African Union, but he did, rightfully, use his platform to expand global awareness of Africa's unique energy needs in 2022. He pointed out the hypocrisy of wealthy countries that harnessed fossil fuels to industrialize and grow their economies telling developing African countries that the world's zero-emission goals trumped their right to do the same.  \"We will not accept that polluting countries, responsible for the situation of the planet, tell us that we are no longer going to finance fossil fuels,\" Sall said in September.  He made similar remarks when he opened the MSGBC Oil, Gas &amp; Power 2022 conference and exhibition, held Sept. 1-2 this year in Dakar. The MSGBC region comprises Mauritania, Senegal, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Guinea-Conakry.  \"In this new configuration of the world, energy resources are major assets for Africa. Therefore, we must not accept that our continent is an object of world geopolitics, but an actor, aware of its natural wealth of interests, which acts on the competition instead of suffering it,\" Sall said, adding that made no sense for African countries to stop exploiting their oil and gas resources while more than 600 million Africans lacked electricity. \"While remaining committed to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement, we must continue to defend the interests of our countries in the run-up to COP27 next November in Egypt.\"  And that's exactly what happened. Sall and other African leaders fiercely defended Africa's energy interests before and during COP27. The result? As multiple news outlets reported, African natural gas took center stage at the conference.  A Strong Collaborator  As I tweeted in November, Africa was fortunate to have Sall at COP27. He understands both sides of the African energy transition debate: the need for Africa to set the timing for its shift to renewables and the world's need to address climate change. Sall advocated for ongoing natural gas production in Africa, which allows us to minimize carbon dioxide emissions while providing much-needed gas to generate electricity domestically, build our economies, and move toward industrialization. Sall also has pushed for the international community to help fund the renewable energy infrastructure Africa needs for a just transition and to provide financial support for African climate adaptation.  Climate adaptation measures have particularly been a priority for Sall. In his capacity as president of Senegal, he and the CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), Patrick Verkooijen, partnered in 2022 to unlock $1 billion in climate finance for Senegal under the Africa Adaptation Accelerator Program (AAAP). The AAAP, Africa-led and Africa-owned, is working to bolster adaptation in agriculture, digital services, infrastructure, entrepreneurship, and jobs for young people. It was developed by the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) in collaboration with the African Union.  Sall was among the trailblazers to convene the Africa Adaptation Leaders' Event during COP27. He also co-wrote, with French President Emmanuel Macron and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, an opinion piece for the Guardian about the AAAP. It emphasized the critical importance of increased funding from developed countries for climate adaptation initiatives in developing countries, particularly those in Africa.  What we've seen is a pragmatic approach from Sall, one that recognizes the need for Africa to continue harnessing its oil and gas reserves while working diligently to move toward the transition to renewables - and to build climate resiliency into Africa's economy.  When Sall's one-year term at the helm of the African Union concludes February 5, the many challenges facing Africa will hardly be behind us. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that Sall has been making a vital difference in his role. Sall has said, loudly and clearly, that African voices will not be silenced. Thanks to Sall, it appears that the global community is starting to hear that message. That is a step in the right direction.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

It emphasized the critical importance of increased funding from developed countries for climate adaptation initiatives in developing countries, particularly those in Africa. What we?ve seen is a pragmatic approach from Sall, one that recognizes the need for Africa to continue harnessing its oil and gas reserves while working diligently to move toward the transition to renewables ? and to build climate resiliency into Africa?s economy. When Sall?s one-year term at the helm of the African Union concludes February 5, the many challenges facing Africa will hardly be behind us. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that Sall has been making a vital difference in his role. Sall has said, loudly and clearly, that African voices will not be silenced. Thanks to Sall, it appears that the global community is starting to hear that message. That is a step in the right direction. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

But which funds are the most promising, what do they actually cover, and why is it all so contentious?Fossil fuels powered the industrial revolution and the economic success of many countries. But burning oil, gas and coal produces greenhouse gases that warm the atmosphere and warp the climate.Advanced industrialized nations have historically contributed most to the human-induced climate crisis because they've burned fossil fuels for so long to grow their economies.And many analysts, activists and heads of state in low-income countries argue big historical emitters like the United States and Europe should largely foot the bill for climate change.But what does that mean exactly? What is climate finance?</p><p>One of the ideas behind climate financing is to support developing countries in steering their economies clear of climate-wrecking fossil fuels. Another is that wealthy nations should help poorer ones hit hardest by global heating to adapt to the changing climate. These ideas have been central to global climate negotiations in some form or another since the 1992 World Climate Summit in Rio de Janeiro.But climate financing is perhaps most commonly associated with the pledge made by industralized countries at the 2009 Copenhagen UN Climate Summit to raise $100 billion (\u20ac95 billion) a year by 2020. In 2015 in Paris, delegates agreed to keep paying this amount annually until 2025 and then set a new figure.How climate financing will be implementedTo implement the $100 billion pledge, industrialized countries are primarily committing public funds, but increasingly they want to raise cash through private investment.Public funds from donor countries account for the largest share of climate financing. About half of this flows bilaterally from donor to recipient state, largely in the form of development aid. The other portion is multilateral money, meaning that multiple states give money to multiple other states.This money either comes from climate programs run via multilateral banks, like the World Bank and the African and Asian Development Banks. Or the money is allocated through multilateral climate funds.The Green Climate FundThe most prominent of the multilateral money pots is the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Its resources are intended both for measures to slow climate change, such as the expansion of renewable energy, and for adapting to extreme weather and other impacts of planetary heating. To date, donor countries have pledged about $20 billion. So far, $12.8 billion of has been approved for projects and $3.6 billion has already been spent on specific programs.Most of the projects are in Africa and Asia, but there are also some in Latin America, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe. Every four years, donor countries are expected to replenish the fund.Just under half of the money is given in the form of favorable loans, and the second half as direct grants that recipient states do not have to repay.The Adaptation FundAnother fund that receives money from the $100 billion pledge is the Adaptation Fund. It is a relatively small pot of money with no fixed replenishment cycles - donor countries pay whenever they can or wish to.Its goal is to support projects that help countries adapt to the consequences of the climate crisis. These could be measures against flooding, for example, or planting heat-resistant crops.Developing countries receive the money as a subsidy rather than a loan. This is advantageous as action on adaptation doesn't usually generate any profit, unlike climate protection measures, such as building wind turbines or solar panels which generate electricity that can be sold.Least Developed Countries FundThis Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) covers the world's 46 poorest nations. Operating solely on grants, which do not have to be repaid, it is intended to finance emergency climate adaptation.So far, the LDCF has financed more than 360 projects, totaling about $1.7 billion.Is the $100 billion climate finance promise being met?No. Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) show that only around $83 billion flowed into international climate financing in 2020.At first, $83 billion sounds like an enormous sum of money, but the needs of poorer countries in the Global South go well beyond that, said Jan Kowalzig, climate change and climate policy officer at Oxfam Germany.We know from studies that the cost of just adapting to climate change in these countries will exceed $300 billion a year by 2030. And that doesn't include the costs of climate mitigation in those countries, he said.Even this $83 billion figure has been embellished, according to international development organizations. Oxfam calculates that a maximum of about $24.5 billion in real climate aid was provided in 2020.This is because many officially listed projects would have had little climate impact, Oxfam says.Moreover, industrialized countries have credited many loans to their $100-billion promise, said Sabine Minninger from German aid organization Bread for the World. Developing countries would have to repay these loans.That's a sham, she said.The repayments increase the debt burden of poorer countries in the Global South, added Oxfam's Kowalzig - all for a crisis to which they have contributed little or nothing.Loss and damage: A sticking point in climate financingFor decades, developing, newly industrializing and industrialized countries have argued about who should pay for loss and damage caused by the climate crisis - including the heatwaves and droughts destroying crops or making areas of land uninhabitable. Developing countries want additional funds for this purpose.Donor countries fear that they could be sued for damages beyond the scope of international climate financing, said Kowalzig. They want economically strong emerging economies, such as world's biggest CO2 polluter China, to pay up as well. So far, many questions remain unanswered when it comes to loss and damage, added Kowalzig.Global Shield against Climate RisksThe Global Shield against Climate Risks was launched in 2022 at COP27 by the G7 industrialized nations and the V20, a group of around 70 countries particularly at risk from climate change. The shield allocates a predetermined sum of money to be disbursed quickly in the wake of a climate catastrophe. So far, more than \u20ac210 million has flowed into the fund, with Germany providing around \u20ac170 million.The shield can step in when there is no other help, said Kowalzig. It also finances climate risk insurance, which small farmers can use to insure themselves against crop failure, for example.However, development organizations have argued that climate-risk insurance is not always the right tool for tackling climate disaster. That's because insurance policies generally cover relatively unlikely events that cause major damage. But such damage is not unlikely in a warming world. It will definitely occur, said Kowalzig.For example, the slow drying up of an entire area of land, which can be predicted, or the rise in sea level, he said, adding that no regular insurance would cover such foreseeable damage.This article was originally written in German</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/who-pays-for-climate-change-and-where-does-the-money-go/a-67089630?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988170021887841025876100092</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69N7-KX21-JCMN-Y4FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1233\"/><timeReceived>11:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 17, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

At a series of events across COP28, Tony Elumelu delivered a single message to world leaders:\u00a0 Africa needs to be heard, Africa?s future is the world?s future and the continent that is most impacted by and the least contributor to climate change, needs our attention.\u00a0 With African youth set to make up one third of global population later this century, the future of Africa?s youth, entrepreneurial, ambitious, resilient, needs to be given the highest priority. Elumelu offered the infrastructure and experience of his own Foundation?s 10 year $100m entrepreneurship programme to partners, to catalyse a further generation of African entrepreneurs; entrepreneurs who can address climate change and drive the broader wealth creation that Africa requires.\u00a0 Reaching and funding young entrepreneurs in every African country, the Elumelu approach of sector agnostic seed funding, mentoring, and networking has delivered robust impact. The annual COP UN Climate Change Conferences unites the world to assess progress in combatting climate change.\u00a0 Elumelu is one of Africa?s leading advocates for an equitable agenda for climate action and through the Tony Elumelu Foundation has empowered thousands of green entrepreneurs, shaping a more sustainable future for Africa. The Tony Elumelu Foundation, in partnership with the United Bank for Africa (UBA), hosted a high-level session, bringing together Africans, and key players in the Gulf, Europe, and Americas, where UBA operates, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation, while fostering sustainable development, and bringing attention to Africa?s unique position. Speakers included Dr. Okonjo Iweala, Director General, World Trade Organization; Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP, Kevin Frey, CEO, UNICEF Generation Unlimited; Sergio Pimenta, VP Africa, IFC; Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative, World Bank; Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate; Joseph Nganga, Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, Rockefeller Foundation; Hassan Al Hashemi, VP International Relations, Dubai Chambers; Serge Eku\u00e9, Chairman, West African Development Bank (BOAD); Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy Group Managing Director, United Bank for Africa; and Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of Delegation, UNFCCC. ?Addressing climate change is the paramount challenge of our era.\u00a0 The urgency is unmistakable.?\u00a0 Elumelu stated. \u00a0?It is critical that Africa, as a continent, and African voices, play a key role in global climate conversations, as meaningful participants, and no longer as bystanders.\u00a0 Africa is least responsible and is disproportionately impacted by climate change.\u00a0 I am investing in a generation of green entrepreneurs, and we are extending the hand of partnership, so that others can benefit and use the infrastructure and platform we have created to reach entrepreneurs across Africa.? Elumelu represented the African private sector at the 2023 New Global Financing Pact in Paris at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, and the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum in London, at the invitation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom and U.S. President Biden.\u00a0 At the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) in New York, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) launched a first-of-its-kind Green Entrepreneurship Programme, the #BeGreenAfrica Initiative, in partnership with the IKEA Foundation, Dutch Government and UNICEF GenU, to support green entrepreneurship and youth development. Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur from Madagascar in the green economy, Marie-Christiana Kola, shared a compelling impact story.\u00a0 ?As a beneficiary of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship programme, I was able to create a recycled and 100% biodegradable hand soap made with waste cooked oil - the number one water polluter of water in African urban cities.\u00a0 These soaps do not only protect the environment, but they are also solidarity soaps.\u00a0 I was also able to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt, where I won the Innovation Prize.\u00a0 Today, I have employed over 30 people because of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.? Speaking at the TEF #COP28 high-level event, Dr. Okonjo Iweala, DG, World Trade Organisation stated, ?I am proud of what my brother, Tony Elumelu, has done in empowering and inspiring so many young entrepreneurs.\u00a0 We have no choice; the future is green.\u00a0 The future of growth is two things ? it is green, and it must be inclusive. I am very interested in partnerships with organisations like TEF.? Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP added, ?The reason why UNDP associated itself with the Tony Elumelu Foundation years ago is because of the leadership and courage of the Foundation to trust and invest in young Africans.\u00a0 It was one of the first organisation to do so at that scale.? The Foundation partnered with the UNDP to empower thousands in the Sahel, with an ambitious project to impact the lives one million young Africans. Sergio Pimenta, VP, Africa at the IFC, also stated, ?Tony, I salute you and your Foundation for what you have been doing to support young entrepreneurs in Africa. The IFC has deployed $2billion in funding for African SMEs in the last fiscal year and we are very excited to be able to do more, working with you.? Kevin Frey, CEO UNICEF Generation Unlimited added, ?With TEF, we have moved in a concerted way into the entrepreneurial space. Generation Unlimited now have a flagship programme with the Tony Elumelu Foundation called #BeGreenAfrica, launched in Kenya, and now with the support of the IKEA Foundation and the Dutch Government, we have scaled to Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa, and Senegal. We will train and seed 500 green entrepreneurs this year in the pilot project across those countries.\u00a0 So Tony, thank you so much, you are right it is all about partnerships.? Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative at the World Bank, announced, ?Our women-focused initiative has been able to secure $3.6 billion to finance women entrepreneurs in 67 countries across the world, and is set to launch a new programme focused on financing African women entrepreneurs to drive the continent?s green energy transition, and we are keen to work with the Tony Elumelu Foundation.? Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of UNFCCC Delegation stated, ?My Government and I commend the Tony Elumelu Foundation?s incredible impact across Africa, and will facilitate connections between the Tony Elumelu Foundation, and the Swedish embassies across Africa to drive innovation, digitalisation, and green-energy transition, which promises to bring about new jobs and growth.? Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate, added? Before coming to the United States Treasury, I was working in venture capital, and I know first-hand that it is incredibly important what the Tony Elumelu Foundation is doing. I have seen two pillars of their work ? financing and the mentorship ? just as I have seen with Silicon Valley, which helps to drive innovation and jobs creation. We are excited to begin partnership conversations.? Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy GMD, United Bank for Africa, announced, ?For us, UBA, we give market access into 20 geographies in Africa.\u00a0 Everything that we do is around Africa, and that is why we have partnered with the Afrexim Bank to launch the $6billion fund for SMEs with a focus on import substitution, working in four key areas including climate emission reduction.? Earlier in the day, Tony Elumelu joined Ajay Banga, President of World Bank Group; Brian Moynihan, Chair of the Board and CEO of Bank of America; Ms. Ruth Porat, President, Alphabet and Google; and Ms. Laurene Powell Jobs, Founder &amp; President of Emerson Collective as a panelist in a session titled ?Big, Audacious and Green: A Convergence of Visionaries?, moderated by B\u00f8rge Brende, President of World Economic Forum. On Sunday December 3 Mr. Tony Elumelu, also participated in a fireside conversation with Ms. Teresa Ribera, Vice President of the Government of Spain and Minister for Ecological Transition and Demographic Change, moderated by Sec. Hillary Rodham Clinton, and with closing remarks from Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The Tony Elumelu Foundation.

However, their communities often remain overlooked and chronically underfunded, especially in the rural areas of low- and lower middle-income countries (LICs and LMICs) where poverty and hunger are most entrenched. These areas have been side-lined for decades and are home to 80 % of the world's poorest. Making just six cents for every dollar worth of food they produce, many see no other option but to migrate in pursuit of better opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Felipe Nazar, a farmer from the Philippines, puts it straight in an interview with The New Humanitarian: 'We don't earn anything during harvests. We just survive. We're practically giving away our crops.' To make matters worse, these communities are also the most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>Investing in rural communities can alleviate poverty and fight hunger effectively. However, international assistance still falls short of addressing the increasing demands. According to OECD data, only $ 9.4 billion was allocated for agriculture, forestry and fishing in 2021, representing only four percent of the global official development assistance (ODA), the flow of financial resources from developed to developing countries to finance their socioeconomic development. The lack of adequate funding hampers the transformative potential of rural communities to end hunger and poverty by 2030, as demanded by the UN's 2nd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2). But there is hope.</p><p>How IFAD works</p><p>The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN specialised agency and international financial institution, works to eliminate poverty and hunger in rural areas of developing countries by investing in rural people. IFAD provides low-interest and highly concessional loans and grants through effective financial strategies. The UN Fund has 177 member states and was established in the 1970s in response to an energy and food crisis akin to what we are witnessing today. Since then, IFAD has been channelling investments to rural communities to boost food security, nutrition and incomes. Currently, IFAD is undergoing its triennial consultation to replenish the fund and agree on priorities for the future.</p><p>IFAD aims to assemble and catalyse finance going to rural areas, including cooperating with the private sector for this purpose. Measures include pooling resources, derisking operations and providing expert support to address intertwined topics like food security, migration, climate adaptation, private sector engagement and gender equality. Investing in long-term rural development through organisations like IFAD reduces emergency costs and promotes sustainable growth. Every dollar spent on resilience can save up to $ 10 in emergency aid. According to its own data, IFAD transforms every unit of investment into six-fold returns.</p><p>IFAD partners with governments for customised solutions. In Malawi, for example, a project improved market access for small-scale farmers and brought about multiple value-chains benefits through sustainable agricultural practices, intensified production and natural resource management. IFAD also strengthened local institutions and participated in policy dialogues to promote market-led agricultural growth and consistent policy implementation.</p><p>Beyond funding, IFAD ensures access to knowledge and decision-making processes, notably for women, youth and persons with disabilities. For example, the UN Fund features the so-called household methodologies (HHMs) approach which aims to support family members in working together to achieve a fairer workload. This targets patterns of gender inequality, thereby increasing agricultural productivity, improving nutrition and fostering overall social development.</p><p>IFAD also provides cushion to imminent crises. For example, it responded to the Covid-19 pandemic through the Rural Poor Stimulus Facility, a multi-donor initiative to ensure rural small-scale farmers had timely access to inputs, information, markets and finance. Moreover, IFAD tackled the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine with its Crisis Response Initiative which supported rural communities' resilience and capacity to mitigate the impact of shocks. This includes access to seeds, fuel and fertiliser as well as investing in small-scale infrastructure to improve productive capacity and reduce post-harvest losses.</p><p>IFAD is not just a fund; it is a strategic partner for sustainable development. One of IFAD's main concerns is finding the right balance between immediate aid and long-term investment. It is high time we invest to combat the root causes of hunger and poverty, rather than simply reacting to recurrent crises.</p><p>Agricultural solutions and private-sector engagement</p><p>One example of IFAD's approach is the Rural Adelante (RA) initiative in El Salvador: it developed rural areas and agriculture, providing opportunities for women and youth - and alternatives to migration - while adapting to new climatic patterns. For instance, it doubled production and allowed year-round cultivation by introducing hydroponics, where plants are grown without soil and nourished with a nutrient-rich solution. As one female farmer participating in RA puts it: 'With hydroponics, we have a great advantage; we better control pests, plant quality seeds and use qualified varieties.'</p><p>The initiative encouraged young rural populations' participation in value chains through financial support while recognising the unique challenges faced by women, who make up 40 % of its active participants. The project also targeted traditionally excluded and vulnerable groups like indigenous peoples, children and the elderly. Beyond the main activities, the project conducted applied policy-research.</p><p>IFAD strongly advocates for financial inclusion using digital technologies, value-chain financing, credit cooperatives, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). In rural development, PPPs link small scale farmers, as private operators, to the wider market. Climate change is unpredictable to a certain degree, which makes it necessary for these farmers to have access to resources and technology. IFAD's strategy goes beyond derisking and regulatory reforms and emphasises private sector engagement, aligning private investments with the SDGs, the Paris Agreement and a vision for a sustainable global food system.</p><p>IFAD is pioneering a financial framework promoting collaboration and partnerships, leading food-systems financing with the World Bank and the UN Food Systems Coordination Hub. Events in 2023, like the SDG Summit and COP28, amplify these efforts. Food-system transformation pillars - coordination, finance, governance and innovation - must be prioritised as elements of a critical pathway to achieve the SDGs. IFAD's current replenishment offers a blueprint for addressing these challenges and boosting financial commitment to rural food system transformation.</p><p>PPP in Mali</p><p>One of these PPPs is the partnership with Mali Biocarburant SA (MBSA), which manufactures eco-friendly biodiesel using the energy plant jatropha. MBSA supports farmers in leveraging carbon credits. Farmers cultivate jatropha, and their cooperatives sell the nuts to MBSA for oil extraction. IFAD supports these partnerships via joint ventures and contract farming. Smallholder farmers partake in pricing and other decisions and, as shareholders, gain from share appreciation and dividends.</p><p>Additionally, intercropping with jatropha enhances food crop yields, providing a financial safety net. The broader community also benefits, notably from jatropha's role in land rehabilitation. The extraction's residue enriches soil and is used in soap production, empowering women through soap factory ownership.</p><p>Raising additional funds</p><p>In order to respond to increased needs due to the war in Ukraine, the aftermaths of slow Covid-19 recovery and the energy crisis, IFAD is making a concerted effort to raise more funds to serve rural people. Scaled up support of donor countries is vital, as is finding new ways to bring in new financing. In addition to its current replenishment process with member states, IFAD is raising an additional $ 500 million through private placements. The money will be used for proactive measures to tackle climate displacement, social instability and gender inequality.</p><p>Germany is one of the countries boosting IFAD's engagement with the private sector and endorsing sustainable financial strategies. KfW, a pioneer lender for IFAD since 2014, recently extended a pound  400 million promotional loan for IFAD's $ 3.5 billion programme in 2022-2024.</p><p>Rural development transcends the boundaries of rural areas - its implications ripple through global issues like migration, women's empowerment, climate change and food security. Therefore, supporting IFAD is about addressing immediate challenges for humanity, as well as investing in medium to long-term solutions. By doing so, global commitment to the most vulnerable people in the world can be reaffirmed.</p><p>Germany's support has been instrumental in driving positive change in rural communities worldwide. We hope it will continue standing with IFAD, championing the cause of those who feed the world and ensuring a resilient future for the generations to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0211202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69J1-2JY1-JCH9-G4Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 2, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

At the same time, food production contributes to climate change, causing about 30?% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. This multifaceted problem needs a multifaceted solution. The global community, and countries in their contexts, must modify food systems in ways that overcome current food insecurity and ensure food security long term. All issues must be addressed head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Food security' is defined as access to sufficient quantities of food in appropriate quality. It obviously depends on an adequate and affordable supply of all ingredients required for a nutritious diet. Today, about 735 million people around the world do not get sufficient food and are undernourished as a result. About 3 billion, moreover, do not consume healthy diets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unless comprehensive action is taken, the climate crisis will make matters worse. A holistic agri-food system perspective must consider the entire range of actors involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products. It must also take account of agriculture (including livestock), forestry, fisheries and food industries, as well as the broader economy, social disparities and the natural environment.</p><p>A sustainable food system must achieve good nutrition for all in a way that preserves the foundations of future generations' food security. This challenge has economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It is crucial to preventing further loss of biodiversity and to stabilising the climate.</p><p>Mitigation, adaptation, transformation</p><p>Many national food systems, as well as the global food system, are losing resilience. 'Resilience' is the capability to cope with shocks without significant loss of livelihood, health and nutrition. Food-system resilience can be understood as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. It is therefore essential to limit the climate-related hazards that affect food supply, reduce food systems' vulnerability and lower people's exposure to risks. Three policy approaches serve this triple purpose:</p><p>Mitigation of climate change. Radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is indispensable for sustainable food security. Global heating is leading to extreme weather events, which affect production as well as farm workers' health. Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests. And this is not just a terrestrial agenda, because climate change affects oceans, which also have a bearing on food systems. Nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, coupled with sustainable land and soil management, serve mitigation. However, mitigation in itself is no longer enough to safeguard food security.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change. People can protect themselves by increasing their chances to cope. Important issues include affordable access to clean energy, water and healthcare. All of them have a bearing on good nutrition. Long-term adaptation, however, will be impossible unless mitigation puts an end to further heating.</p><p>Transformation. Socio-ecological systems, including the lifestyles of wealthy nations, must change to become sustainable. In particular, people in high-income countries must reduce their consumption and assume responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p><p>The climate crisis negatively affects food security in several ways. For example, access to safe drinking water is becoming more precarious. Climate events like floods often disrupt it. Diarrhoeal diseases, however, affect humans' intake of micronutrients. These illnesses have a strong correlation with rising temperatures. At the same time, heat waves make it more difficult to handle food safely.</p><p>The climate crisis also affects market dynamics and causes price volatility. Price hikes are happening more frequently. Several issues can exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shortfalls in food production. They include poor market transparency, financial speculation in commodity markets as well as export restrictions. The current grain-market disruptions resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine show how important unrestricted exports are.</p><p>Crucial policy areas</p><p>Policymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones. Cross-cutting action is necessary. In particular, progress is needed in seven policy areas:</p><p>Sustainable land management (SLM): Relevant aspects include sustainable water management, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as the protection of biodiversity. SLM incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) are necessary. Crop cultivation and livestock production must be practiced in economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways. Social protection. Poverty often undermines families' food security. Nutrition interventions like school meal programmes are helpful. So are cash-transfer schemes or job creation. Countries with low and middle incomes deserve support for improving social protection. Access to healthcare and education are essential. Where related polices are not in place, they should be adopted. Food security hinges on the reduction of inequality. Diversification. Diversifying agriculture and supply chains strengthens food-system resilience. However, diversification has costs as it reduces opportunities for economies of scale and specialisation. Transaction costs tend to rise accordingly. Another challenge is that resilience is not just about withstanding current shocks, but also about maintaining the capacity for future development. If diversification hampers the latter, it is not fully conducive to resilience building.</p><p>International trade. Ensuring free and open global food trade will require a reinvigoration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Panic-induced border closures lead to international price spikes. Transparent information on production, stocks and government interventions around the world is critical and must be made publicly available (e.g., through the Agricultural Market Information System - AMIS). Trade facilitation in terms of investments in infrastructure - including particularly the digitisation of customs systems - matters too.</p><p>Insurance is a promising tool to strengthen food-system resilience. It spreads both the risks and the costs of negative shocks among a large pool of people, enhancing resilience at the level of individuals. However, it does not prevent or reduce climate risks. Insurance may thus prove counterproductive if it motivates people to continue unsustainable activities. Though this kind of financial service is quite effective in terms of managing individual shocks, it is less useful when many people experience shock impacts at once, as is typically the case in extreme weather events. Migration. In response to the climate crisis, people are leaving their homes. In some cases, migration is basically a form of livelihood diversification. Remittances from migrant workers contribute to their families' resilience after all. However, entire areas are likely to become uninhabitable, for example, as the rising sea level inundates islands. Migration processes and policies need to be coordinated, and both sending and receiving countries must act in ways that make migration strengthen the resilience of individuals and systems. Climate refugees from countries that are becoming uninhabitable must get an internationally recognised climate refugee passport.</p><p>Science-based innovation. Science is facilitating key innovations in food systems, including efforts to reduce risks and to enhance productivity. Bioscience and digital technology are important. Scientific research also helps to find new ways to maintain and, if necessary, renew productive soils, water resources and even entire landscapes. Science is also needed to protect biodiversity, including agricultural genetic diversity. Research can help to reduce inequality too. More funding is needed for research on food systems.</p><p>We live in the Anthropocene, the age in which humanity is shaping the Earth's geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. Action to enhance food security must be embedded in a broad strategic agenda of transformation. The global community must shift to a sustainable bioeconomy. It also needs a coherent governance structure to safeguard both food security and the global environment. The SDGs provide the concept, but not the policy framework for such joint action.</p><p>Long-term food security is intricately linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biodiversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sustainable Development Goals. So far, appropriate funding has not been made available for any of the above-mentioned global agreements. That must change for the sake of humanity's common future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2510202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69G9-97J1-F00C-60R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 25, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The heavy rain comes after an unbearable heat wave.Intense monsoon rains have lashed parts of northern India over the past few days, leaving a trail of death and destruction, as well as rendering many areas inaccessible. The state of Himachal Pradesh has been the hardest hit.Television footage showed landslides and flash floods, washing away vehicles, destroying buildings and ripping down bridges.India&amp;#39;s meteorological department (IMD) said that torrential rains across the South Asian country in the first week of July have already produced about 2% more rainfall than normal.The agency has forecast more rain across large parts of northern India in the coming days.The region, which is usually one of the driest, has received disproportionately high rains, an IMD official told DW.Climate change and environmental catastrophesThe summer, or southwest, monsoon brings India around 70% of its annual rainfall.It is crucial for the nation&amp;#39;s agriculture, which accounts for just 11% of India&amp;#39;s total economic output, but employs over 40% of its labor force. The rains also often cause widespread devastation and death due to flooding and landslides.Scientists say the rainfall is hard to forecast and varies considerably, but climate change is making the monsoon stronger and more erratic, increasing the frequency and ferocity of the floods.Human-induced climate change is already intensifying hydrological extremes in India, and the recent floods in parts of northern India are yet another example of how extreme events can be more disastrous in hilly regions than in plains, Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the UK&amp;#39;s National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology, told DW.Deoras pointed out that extreme weather events are set to intensify as the planet continues to become warmer due to growing emissions of greenhouse gases. </p><p>This does not necessarily mean that high-impact events would occur every year, but whenever they occur, there would be a greater chance of them being more impactful than previous such events, he added.How many extreme weather events last year?Last year, the Center for Science and Environment (CSE), a New Delhi-based public interest research and advocacy organization, tracked extreme weather events in India.It found out that the country, on the whole, experienced extreme weather events on 314 out of the 365 days, meaning that at least one extreme weather event was reported in some part of India on each of these days. The report concluded that these events caused over 3,000 deaths in 2022, affected some 2 million hectares of crop area, killed more than 69,000 livestock and destroyed around 420,000 houses.The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also released a report last year painting a bleak picture for India.It warned that the country could face multiple climate change-induced disasters in the next two decades.Unless greenhouse gas emissions are drastically reduced by 2030, it will become impossible for Indian authorities to reverse an imminent climate catastrophe, it said.Heavy rains follow sizzling heat waveClimate change is accelerating at a fast pace, throwing off extreme weather events one after the other. This is faster than what we thought earlier, said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune.South Asia has become the poster child of climate change. The entire region, not just India, is witnessing a clear trend in rising heatwaves, floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones. This is already affecting the food, water, and energy security of the region, Koll told DW.The heavy rains come after a blistering heat wave that caused temperatures to soar to as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in large parts of the country, taking a toll on people&amp;#39;s lives.Even though the main summer months - from April to June - are always hot in India, temperatures have become more intense in the past decade.And around 80% of the population also live in regions highly vulnerable to extreme disasters like heat waves or severe flooding.What needs to be done?As part of India&amp;#39;s efforts to tackle global climate change, Prime Minister Narendra Modi&amp;#39;s administration has vowed to cut the nation&amp;#39;s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2070.But against the backdrop of increasing extreme weather events, experts say the government needs to also focus on adaptation measures.More needs to be done for climate adaptation to prevent economic losses and food insecurity, CSE director Sunita Narain said.We need to relearn land and water management strategies. India has much to learn, from not building habitations in flood-vulnerable areas to channeling river water instead of taming rivers within embankments that invariably break or just do not work, she told DW.The moot question is, how fast can we learn in a climate variable world? The answers will determine our future. The window of opportunity to deal with the crisis is closing.Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/india-how-climate-change-is-causing-an-environmental-crisis/a-66190451?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988168908913024625876100243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NS-B6G1-JCMN-Y4W3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"877\"/><timeReceived>3:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

At a series of events across COP28, Tony Elumelu delivered a single message to world leaders: Africa needs to be heard, Africa's future is the world's future and the continent that is most impacted by and the least contributor to climate change, needs our attention. With African youth set to make up one third of global population later this century, the future of Africa's youth, entrepreneurial, ambitious, resilient, needs to be given the highest priority.  Elumelu offered the infrastructure and experience of his own Foundation's 10 year $100m entrepreneurship programme to partners, to catalyse a further generation of African entrepreneurs; entrepreneurs who can address climate change and drive the broader wealth creation that Africa requires. Reaching and funding young entrepreneurs in every African country, the Elumelu approach of sector agnostic seed funding, mentoring, and networking has delivered robust impact.  The annual COP UN Climate Change Conferences unites the world to assess progress in combatting climate change. Elumelu is one of Africa's leading advocates for an equitable agenda for climate action and through the Tony Elumelu Foundation has empowered thousands of green entrepreneurs, shaping a more sustainable future for Africa.  The Tony Elumelu Foundation, in partnership with the United Bank for Africa (UBA), hosted a high-level session, bringing together Africans, and key players in the Gulf, Europe, and Americas, where UBA operates, underscoring the urgent need for innovative approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation, while fostering sustainable development, and bringing attention to Africa's unique position.  Speakers included Dr. Okonjo Iweala, Director General, World Trade Organization; Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP, Kevin Frey, CEO, UNICEF Generation Unlimited; Sergio Pimenta, VP Africa, IFC; Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative, World Bank; Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate; Joseph Nganga, Vice President, Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, Rockefeller Foundation; Hassan Al Hashemi, VP International Relations, Dubai Chambers; Serge Eku\\xE9, Chairman, West African Development Bank (BOAD); Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy Group Managing Director, United Bank for Africa; and Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of Delegation, UNFCCC.  \"Addressing climate change is the paramount challenge of our era. The urgency is unmistakable.\" Elumelu stated. \"It is critical that Africa, as a continent, and African voices, play a key role in global climate conversations, as meaningful participants, and no longer as bystanders. Africa is least responsible and is disproportionately impacted by climate change. I am investing in a generation of green entrepreneurs, and we are extending the hand of partnership, so that others can benefit and use the infrastructure and platform we have created to reach entrepreneurs across Africa.\"  Elumelu represented the African private sector at the 2023 New Global Financing Pact in Paris at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, and the Climate Finance Mobilisation Forum in London, at the invitation of King Charles III of the United Kingdom and U.S. President Biden. At the 78th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA78) in New York, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) launched a first-of-its-kind Green Entrepreneurship Programme, the #BeGreenAfrica Initiative, in partnership with the IKEA Foundation, Dutch Government and UNICEF GenU, to support green entrepreneurship and youth development.  Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur from Madagascar in the green economy, Marie-Christiana Kola, shared a compelling impact story. \"As a beneficiary of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship programme, I was able to create a recycled and 100% biodegradable hand soap made with waste cooked oil - the number one water polluter of water in African urban cities. These soaps do not only protect the environment, but they are also solidarity soaps. I was also able to attend the COP27 conference in Egypt, where I won the Innovation Prize. Today, I have employed over 30 people because of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\"  Speaking at the TEF #COP28 high-level event, Dr. Okonjo Iweala, DG, World Trade Organisation stated, \"I am proud of what my brother, Tony Elumelu, has done in empowering and inspiring so many young entrepreneurs. We have no choice; the future is green. The future of growth is two things - it is green, and it must be inclusive. I am very interested in partnerships with organisations like TEF.\"  Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant Administrator and Regional Director for Africa, UNDP added, \"The reason why UNDP associated itself with the Tony Elumelu Foundation years ago is because of the leadership and courage of the Foundation to trust and invest in young Africans. It was one of the first organisation to do so at that scale.\"  The Foundation partnered with the UNDP to empower thousands in the Sahel, with an ambitious project to impact the lives one million young Africans.  Sergio Pimenta, VP, Africa at the IFC, also stated, \"Tony, I salute you and your Foundation for what you have been doing to support young entrepreneurs in Africa. The IFC has deployed $2billion in funding for African SMEs in the last fiscal year and we are very excited to be able to do more, working with you.\"  Kevin Frey, CEO UNICEF Generation Unlimited added, \"With TEF, we have moved in a concerted way into the entrepreneurial space. Generation Unlimited now have a flagship programme with the Tony Elumelu Foundation called #BeGreenAfrica, launched in Kenya, and now with the support of the IKEA Foundation and the Dutch Government, we have scaled to Nigeria, Morocco, South Africa, and Senegal. We will train and seed 500 green entrepreneurs this year in the pilot project across those countries. So Tony, thank you so much, you are right it is all about partnerships.\"  Wendy Teleki, Head of the Women Entrepreneurs Financial Initiative at the World Bank, announced, \"Our women-focused initiative has been able to secure $3.6 billion to finance women entrepreneurs in 67 countries across the world, and is set to launch a new programme focused on financing African women entrepreneurs to drive the continent's green energy transition, and we are keen to work with the Tony Elumelu Foundation.\"  Mattias Frumerie, Swedish Climate Ambassador and Head of UNFCCC Delegation stated, \"My Government and I commend the Tony Elumelu Foundation's incredible impact across Africa, and will facilitate connections between the Tony Elumelu Foundation, and the Swedish embassies across Africa to drive innovation, digitalisation, and green-energy transition, which promises to bring about new jobs and growth.\"  Adam Wang-Levine, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Climate, added\" Before coming to the United States Treasury, I was working in venture capital, and I know first-hand that it is incredibly important what the Tony Elumelu Foundation is doing. I have seen two pillars of their work - financing and the mentorship - just as I have seen with Silicon Valley, which helps to drive innovation and jobs creation. We are excited to begin partnership conversations.\"  Muyiwa Akinyemi, Deputy GMD, United Bank for Africa, announced, \"For us, UBA, we give market access into 20 geographies in Africa. Everything that we do is around Africa, and that is why we have partnered with the Afrexim Bank to launch the $6billion fund for SMEs with a focus on import substitution, working in four key areas including climate emission reduction.\"  Earlier in the day, Tony Elumelu joined Ajay Banga, President of World Bank Group; Brian Moynihan, Chair of the Board and CEO of Bank of America; Ms. Ruth Porat, President, Alphabet and Google; and Ms. Laurene Powell Jobs, Founder &amp; President of Emerson Collective as a panelist in a session titled \"Big, Audacious and Green: A Convergence of Visionaries\", moderated by B\\xF8rge Brende, President of World Economic Forum.  On Sunday December 3 Mr. Tony Elumelu, also participated in a fireside conversation with Ms. Teresa Ribera, Vice President of the Government of Spain and Minister for Ecological Transition and Demographic Change, moderated by Sec. Hillary Rodham Clinton, and with closing remarks from Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, World Health Organization.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The Tony Elumelu Foundation.

Thirty years later, it is still in question whether and to what extent related promises are being fulfilled. Climate-related finance is a broad term. Generally speaking, it means funding (either public or private) for reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions or adapting to the impacts of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that governments only have indirect discretion over private finance flows, we will focus on public finance in this essay. Public climate finance follows different avenues:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It can be delivered through mechanisms established alongside the climate regime, such as the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), which then allocate funding to climate-related activities.</p><p>Money can also be allocated via other multilateral institutions, especially multilateral development banks, which then fund efforts in developing countries.</p><p>Finally, it can be delivered bilaterally, according to agreements between high-\u00adincome and developing countries.</p><p>Tackling global environmental challenges</p><p>Climate finance is thus directly related to climate-change mitigation, climate adaptation or both. However, it may also target broader objectives, for example, nature-based solutions for infrastructure purposes in line with the objectives of the three so-called Rio conventions. Apart from the \u00adUNFCCC, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification were on the agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Global environmental objectives include:</p><p>limiting global warming to less than 2?oC compared to pre-industrial levels,</p><p>halting further loss of biodiversity,</p><p>protecting land and marine ecosystems and</p><p>stopping land degradation.</p><p>Biodiversity finance aims specifically to stop or reverse nature loss in order to protect human health and prosperity. Progress on this front was recently made at the 2022 UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming-Montr\u00e9al. For example, the summit foresaw an annual $?20 billion of biodiversity funding from 2025, rising to $?30 billion from 2030.</p><p>The climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh in 2022, moreover, decided to establish another form of climate finance. Loss and damage funding is supposed to compensate vulnerable countries for harm already caused by climate change. However, UNFCCC members did not reach an agreement on how loss and damages will work in practice, so progress cannot be evaluated yet.</p><p>Three caveats should be made before looking at the progress high-income countries have made in providing public finance:</p><p>A political commitment is different from a legally binding goal.</p><p>Committed and disbursed funding are not synonyms.</p><p>Actual results depend on disbursed money being used for tangible purposes. Assessing whether that is the case is extremely important, but beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>$?100 billion a year</p><p>At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, developed countries pledged to jointly mobilise $?100 billion per year by 2020 to address climate change in developing countries. The decision was a rare example of a quantified climate-related finance target. The pledge was formalised one year later. The Paris climate summit decided that $?100 billion per year should be seen as a minimum, not a goal. The pledge included public, private, bilateral, multilateral and alternative funding.</p><p>So far, the pledge remains unfulfilled. Its reiteration along with the promise to live up to it soon have become an awkward ritual of the UN's annual climate summits. The gap seems to be closing, but progress has been painfully slow.</p><p>In 2022, the OECD published data on climate finance for the years 2013 to 2020. In that time span, disbursements increased by almost 60?%, from $?52 billion in 2013 to $?83?billion in 2020. Public finance (both bilateral and multilateral) played the largest role. Its share in total increased, from 73?% ($?38 billion) in 2013 to 82?% ($?68 billion) in 2020.</p><p>Assessments from WRI and ODI</p><p>The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., also analysed finance for the period from 2013 to 2018. Adjusting data to eliminate double counting, it presented smaller numbers than the OECD. According to the WRI, bilateral and multilateral climate finance from high-income to developing countries amounted to only $?22 billion in 2013 and $?33 billion in 2018. Including outflows from multilateral development banks, the figures rose to $?34 billion in 2013 and $?55 billion in 2018.</p><p>According to either data set, high-income countries did not collectively meet their pledges. Attempts to break down responsibility country by country show that very few are contributing enough. The failure fits a pattern. In 1970, high-income countries pledged to spend an annual 0.7?% of their gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA). Collectively, they only disburse about 0.33?% of their joint GNI.</p><p>The WRI's analysis assessed how much each developed country should contribute towards the $?100 billion/year goal considering their GNI and population, which are proxies for responsibility and capacity for climate action. The authors calculated countries' fair share based on two different scenarios. The first was that at least $?70 billion of the total should be public finance. The second was that public finance would cover $?100 billion, given that this amount is a floor, not a target. The WRI concluded that, in 2018, only Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden paid their fair share under the first scenario, and only France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden did so under the second.</p><p>Britain's Overseas Development Institute (ODI) similarly concluded that in 2017/2018, only Norway, Sweden and Germany provided their fair share, with France and Japan coming close. The USA was at the bottom, providing a mere four percent of its fair share.</p><p>Why countries fail to comply</p><p>There are several reasons why developed countries fail to fulfil their pledges. First of all, there is no sanction for non-compliance. Most climate commitments are toothless, even if they are considered legally binding. Removing the threat of sanctions makes negotiations easier, but the price is a lack of incentives for countries to comply.</p><p>The collective nature of the pledge is another factor. At first glance, a collective pledge is easier to make since individual partners do not commit to a specific sum. In the longer run, of course, it is difficult to hold individual countries accountable for collective failure if there never was a clear agreement on burden sharing.</p><p>In addition, there is still a lot of debate about how to implement the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) within the UNFCCC. According to this principle, high-income countries should provide climate-related finance to developing countries. Yet countries disagree about how they should be held accountable for past emissions, and how current emissions should be addressed. These arguments generate more heat than light. As a matter of fact, no country is a monolithic entity, so governments pay attention to a variety of interests. Moreover, country groups are very heterogeneous too.</p><p>Growing polarisation</p><p>Finally, the international system is changing, and those changes have impacts on climate negotiations. Strategic competition of the USA and China is increasingly polarising the multilateral scenario, with countries taking sides on political, economic and technological issues. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have further deepened the divide.</p><p>It also matters that the US has a long history of slowing down climate action. In 2001, President George Bush Jr. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that it created an unfair trade advantage for China. In 2017, President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Although President Joe Biden has reinstated climate change as a key issue, the current fragmentation in American politics makes it less likely that the US will assume its fair share of responsibility. Tensions between the two countries affect prospects for international cooperation in general. Like the rest of the world, both the USA and China have a rational interest in tackling climate change. Yet it remains to be seen if they will be able to collaborate in this area as competition on other issues increases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1710202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69DK-HGR1-F00C-60KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 17, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The country is both geographically hostile and ecologically fragile, two factors that hamper efforts to feed the growing population. For example, the dry climate and unpredictable weather patterns make it hard for farmers to grow crops. The lack of proper infrastructure, moreover, means they struggle to transport produce to markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imran Mukhtar</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">22.05.2022</p><p>How the climate crisis affects cotton production in Pakistan</p><p>The 2022 Global Hunger Index ranks Pakistan a dismal 99th out of 121 countries. The looming water crisis threatens to exacerbate food insecurity. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. Devastating flooding ravaged the country in 2022.</p><p>Pakistan is also vulnerable to disasters such as earthquakes and droughts. In the aftermath of such events, hundreds of thousands of people are normally in need of emergency water and sanitation assistance. Climate and conflict-driven internal migration and displacement add to the difficulties. What's more, Pakistan is experiencing an economic crisis that has left the government overwhelmed. Authorities are struggling to manage food scarcity, restore livelihoods and control spiralling inflation. The World Bank's 2022 Country and Climate Development Report paints a dire picture of Pakistan's future unless immediate action is taken to address climate change and environmental degradation. The report predicts that, if the country fails to act, it could see its annual GDP plummet by a shocking 18 to 20 % per year by 2050. Water shortages in agriculture alone could make up over 4.6 % of GDP losses. As of 2020, Pakistan had the lowest water productivity in southern Asia. Yet the livelihoods of the poorest critically depend on access to water services, and shortages affect them badly.</p><p>Sundus Saleemi</p><p>02.05.2023</p><p>Why Pakistan's economy is in deep crisis</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE</p><p>The mismatch that compounds Pakistan's governance problems</p><p>Contaminated water puts children at risk</p><p>Access to safe water and sanitation is limited, with climate change and rapid urbanisation making matters worse. Even some health centres and schools lack proper water and sanitation infrastructure. That poses problems especially for girls, who need adequate facilities to manage their menstruation.</p><p>According to UNICEF, 25 million people in the country still practice open defecation, a leading cause of waterborne diseases. UNICEF estimates that 70 % rely on bacterially contaminated water. As a result, around 53,000 Pakistani children under the age of five die from diarrhoea every year. Education outcomes are affected as well: children who experience repeated bouts of diarrhoea are likely to fall behind in school or even drop out entirely. Diarrhoeal disease can also cause stunting, which currently affects almost 44 % of children in Pakistan. Stunting prevents children from growing and developing as they should.</p><p>Pakistan's National Water Policy, which was approved in 2018, faces several significant implementation challenges. Relevant issues are water infrastructure, institutional capacity and political will. One of the most pressing topics is the lack of adequate water-storage capacity, which leads to a shortage of water both in times of drought and floods. The shortage is exacerbated by inefficient and outdated irrigation systems, which waste a significant amount of water.</p><p>The country's institutional capacities are too weak to implement the National Water Policy. The policy calls for the creation of a National Water Council and a National Water Regulatory Authority to oversee water management and ensure compliance with the policy's guidelines. However, the government has been slow to establish these institutions. It has also failed to properly define their future responsibilities and roles.</p><p>Political will is also a major challenge. The National Water Policy calls for significant reforms in the management of water resources, including the regulation of groundwater extraction and the promotion of water conservation measures. However, these reforms may prove unpopular, particularly among influential agricultural and industrial lobbies, and may thus face political resistance.</p><p>In light of these challenges, the Pakistani government has launched several initiatives to improve food security and address the country's water crisis. These include investments in irrigation infrastructure, support for smallholder farmers, and the construction of new dams and reservoirs. However, much more needs to be done if Pakistan is to meet the challenges of its rapidly growing population, hostile geography, and climate vulnerability.</p><p>Transparency and accountability</p><p>One of the key issues in Pakistan's water governance is the lack of transparency and accountability. Corruption and favouritism in water distribution have been reported in several parts of the country, particularly in the context of large-scale irrigation schemes. These practices not only undermine the efficient use of water resources, but also exacerbate social and economic disparities. Small farmers and marginalised communities are often left without adequate access to water.</p><p>Another challenge in Pakistan's water governance is the lack of effective regulation and enforcement of water laws and policies. Despite the existence of the National Water Policy and various provincial water management frameworks, implementation has been weak and inconsistent. This has resulted in a fragmented and often conflicting regulatory environment, with multiple agencies and stakeholders that lack clear roles and responsibilities.</p><p>Overall, addressing the challenges of weak water governance in Pakistan will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including the government, civil society organisations and the private sector. These stakeholders should focus on investing in the development of institutional capacity, promoting transparency and accountability in water management and ensuring the effective regulation and enforcement of water laws and policies.</p><p>In Pakistan, the climate crisis is primarily a water crisis. It cannot be avoided, but timely adaptation measures can help Pakistan reduce the extent of harm. The clock is ticking, and the longer we wait, the worse it will get.</p><p>Imran Mukhtar</p><p>22.09.2022</p><p>Pakistan is paying price for neglect of climate adaptation</p><p>The way forward</p><p>Experts who participated in the Pakistan Water Week 2022 in Islamabad made five key recommendations to improve water governance in Pakistan:</p><p>Policymakers should focus on strengthening the institutions responsible for water governance by providing them with the necessary resources and training to carry out their responsibilities effectively. A renewed focus on investing in water infrastructure, including sanitation, is needed as well. Public investments should complement civil society efforts.</p><p>Effective devolution is essential. Pakistan's province governments should take the lead in implementing initiatives to improve water storage, conservation, recycling and reuse as best suited to their needs.</p><p>Technology should be used to build trust and ensure transparency. Provinces should share water-flow data automatically. Data-based evidence should guide decisions regarding water allocation, use and management.</p><p>Journalism that addresses water and climate-related issues should be better funded. Powerful and resourceful media owners must be made aware of the severity of the water and climate crises.</p><p>Women and youth must be involved in debates concerning the water sector at the national and province levels. Both groups have an important role to play in shaping water use, now and in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, Pakistan needs to go beyond rhetoric and address water as national security issue in 2023, which can also be an election year. If citizens treat water security as an integral part of economic security and insist that political parties promise water sector reforms and investments in their slogans, it could create an opportunity to hold those parties accountable once they come to power. If institutions and policymakers cooperate effectively, they can reduce water-related impacts on Pakistan's people and economy.</p><p>Pakistan's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than one percent, so its vulnerability to climate impacts is disproportionately high. Access to adequate climate finance and support would help Pakistan to address these challenges effectively, enhance its resilience and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change and its adverse effects.</p><p>Abdur Rehman Cheema holds a PhD from Massey University, New Zealand, and has been a Chevening post-doctoral fellow at the University of Oxford.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1110202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69C9-PFV1-F00C-60NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 11, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Even though other crises might seem more important than climate change right now, we can't delay climate action.\" <br/>In addition to debates about reducing emissions and climate adaptation, the Petersberg agenda placed a special focus on how to secure climate risk financing as well as how to respond to damages and losses. <br/>What did Germany say? <br/>The German foreign ministry stated that the aim of the conference was to build trust in multilateral climate negotiations.  <br/>It presented a so-called \"global protective umbrella\" against climate risks at the conference, aiming to strengthen and develop the global architecture of climate risk financing and insurance for the most vulnerable people and countries.  <br/>Speaking at the dialogue in Berlin on Monday, Scholz said: \"No one can be happy with the fact that the share of coal-fired electricity generation is rising, with us as well.\" <br/>Due to the drastic reduction of gas from Russia, Germany recently approved the use of more coal-fired power plants. <br/>\"This is a strictly limited temporary emergency measure that will not be at the expense of our climate targets,\" Scholz continued.  <br/>Baerbock called the climate catastrophe the \"greatest security challenge of our time.\"  <br/>She said that Germany would in any case \"not deviate an inch from our climate targets - on the contrary, we will exit fossil fuels even faster.\"  <br/>Her appeal was to accelerate the energy transition by reducing dependencies on fossil fuels and helping poorer countries switch to sustainable energy sources. It was fundamental to stay in line with the target of 1.5 degrees (34.7 Fahrenheit), she stressed.  <br/>For her own country, this meant staying committed to \"the goal of climate neutrality by 2045,\" Baerbock went on to say.  <br/>What did Egypt say?  <br/>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said at a joint press conference with Baerbock that the Petersberg talks were about finding \"areas of agreement and possible disagreement\" on climate issues that needed to be worked out in more detail in the months leading up to COP 27.  <br/>He said progress was needed in climate adaptation and mitigation as well as in how to respond to loss and damages. Regions that were the most affected by climate change should be supported more, Zhukri stressed in the press conference.  <br/>He said it was important to \"keep the international climate goals alive\" while \"leaving no one behind.\" A failure of the climate conference was \"not an option\" for the global community. <br/>los/aw (Reuters, dpa, AFP) <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

For example, when new species are discovered in Africa, it is usually by foreigners. Even if a species is native to Africa, it is often a person from the global north who is considered an expert on it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such parachute science hinders African countries from developing the expertise to collect, organise and retain scientific information. This results in limited utilisation of valuable knowledge. For example, changes in certain species have not been tracked over time, since there is a lack of permanent research on the ground. Today, a lot of relevant scientific knowledge is scattered, lost or non-existent.</p><p>Parachute science also extends to biodiversity conservation and climate adaptation strategies. Many strategies are designed by development partners in the global north. They possess the financial resources to collaborate with African governments to tweak strategies that may have been successful somewhere else. This can be likened to a cookie-cutter approach, whereby consultants apply the same strategy with slight modifications to different ecological regions.</p><p>Why do you criticise that?</p><p>In the case of biodiversity conservation, this approach misses out on valuable local knowledge and the opportunity to build agency and stewardship. It neglects building abilities among African scientists and fails to foster forward-thinking individuals and innovators who can develop culturally embedded solutions.</p><p>Africa's capacity must be strengthened, however. We need to start relying on people from the continent who speak the local language and know the culture well to generate holistic and local solutions. Overcoming parachute science is crucial for this purpose.</p><p>What solutions has your team been working on?</p><p>At the Center for Excellence in Biodiversity and Natural Resource Management at the University of Rwanda, we are training young researchers in Rwanda and the region at large. We equip them with skills to analyse biodiversity, identify species and explain why they are important. This includes studying biological indicators - species that can be used to monitor environmental changes. For example, if a certain species of pollution-sensitive frog is absent from a wetland, that is an indicator of an unhealthy wetland ecosystem. The same holds true for certain plants and dragonflies.</p><p>Enabling local experts who can identify species and understand ecosystem dynamics is crucial. This also closes the circle to agriculture. After all, quite a few newly discovered species are important for soil fertility and crop productivity, on which productive farming depends.</p><p>What are the imminent threats to biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa?</p><p>Demand for agricultural land is a major threat. Poverty and rapid population growth increase the need for land for agriculture and housing. In Africa, this has led to the conversion of forests into farmland, resulting in significant impacts on biodiversity.</p><p>The main biodiversity issues in Africa stem from the conflict between biodiversity and agriculture. Farming dominates land use in most African countries, including in Rwanda. Ideally, food security and biodiversity should go hand in hand. However, forests are being cleared at an unprecedented rate for agriculture. National agriculture policies in many countries prioritise intensifying agriculture to feed the population. But we need to prioritise nature-positive food production as well. Additionally, international demand for agricultural produce from Africa leads to monocropping and a focus on commercial crops.</p><p>The massive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, often undocumented and unregulated, is a problem too. We do not know enough about how these chemicals are being used and where. What we do know, however, is that they pollute freshwater ecosystems and negatively affect pollinators. While African countries need higher productivity, agricultural intensification clearly has negative impacts on human health and biodiversity if not well planned.</p><p>What other threats are there to biodiversity?</p><p>The expansion of infrastructure like networks of roads result in loss of habitat, human-wildlife conflicts and deaths of animals. A related aspect, and also a big issue, is urbanisation. It currently has less immediate impact than agriculture, however, since most urban areas have a long history of human settlement. When urbanisation is planned properly, it allows for green growth and has positive potential for biodiversity.</p><p>Finally, illegal wildlife trade is a major problem. The huge demand for various bird, mammal and fish species, especially in wealthy world regions, is driving this trade. It is pushing species like pangolins, elephants and rhinos towards extinction.</p><p>Is there a particular issue that concerns you the most as a biologist, scientist and teacher?</p><p>I am alarmed by the extent to which people are moving away from nature. In many African countries, as in many parts of the world today, people are not able to identify native trees or animals in their immediate surroundings. For example, eucalyptus dominates the landscape in many countries in Africa, yet many people are unaware that it originates from Australia. Similarly, bamboo used for restoration plantings often comes from China.</p><p>Young people often don't encounter a lot of native species, except in protected areas, which are often exclusively accessible to tourists. This holds true for Rwanda, for example. In the Central African Republic, some forest cover exists, but wildlife is scarce in many of these areas. The growing disconnection between humans and nature leads to a lack of concern, resulting in a vicious circle of rapid biodiversity loss.</p><p>In fact, we do not even know what species or varieties are going extinct, since we lack a comprehensive list of African species. As interest wanes, valuable oral and indigenous knowledge disappears. US and European institutions do have valuable knowledge regarding African biodiversity, but this information is needed in Africa too. Our understanding remains insufficient, particularly at the local level. It is obvious that we cannot effectively protect what we do not know.</p><p>What solutions do you consider feasible?</p><p>At the policy-level, more needs to be done to explore innovative ways to enhance biodiversity. In order to reach food-security goals, we need to explore how to create a patchwork of connected landscapes that support both biodiversity and human needs.</p><p>At the individual level, people should be inspired to reconnect to the nature around them. One method of doing so - and at the same time generating scientific knowledge - is cataloguing and building a database of the amazing species that can be found in different African countries. Highlighting unique species and their significance can arouse people's interest and passion.</p><p>Research shows that effective conservation requires the support of local citizens. They need to know about biodiversity in their region, have the capability to track it and know when change is happening. Policymakers should include this information in their planning.

Beyond the 5,000 homes, 17 roads and 26 bridges destroyed, a whole hospital was lost amid torrential rain that followed an extended drought. The small, mountainous, landlocked African nation - often called the land of a thousand hills - is one of the most densely-populated countries in the region, note researchers. More and more usable land is being eroded and degraded to service a growing agricultural-based economy that employs 65% of the population, reported the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). As a result, its inherent vulnerability to climate shocks is increasing.Climate the likely culpritGlobally, there has been a 134% increase in climate-fueled, flood-related disasters between 2000-2023, according to the UNDP. </p><p>And Rwanda, which is naturally vulnerable to floods, has become a flashpoint. The whole region looks like a tornado went through, Simone Schlindwein, a journalist located in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, told DW in early May. Literally whole villages were washed away. It is quite a dire, disastrous situation.Richard Munang, deputy regional director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Africa office, believes that temperature rise is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events.While the globe has warmed to 1.1C, he notes that Africa is warming up at twice the global average, and that extreme events will only get worse.East Africa has seen temperature increases of up to 1.7C, Munang said. This means the consequences of a warming globe, that includes such as extreme precipitation will continue to escalate.Flooding impact on agriculture could lead to famineIn 2021, Rwandan president Paul Kagame promised to respond to worsening extreme weather - devastating rains and windstorms later that year also sparked mudslides. In Rwanda, the changing climate is already making itself felt in unusually heavy rainfall and flooding, Kagame said. Changing weather patterns also affect agriculture. We are responding by investing in water resources management, restoring catchment areas and wetlands.Reforestation and forest conservation are important means to combat the rapid soil erosion and landslides that follow heavy rain, according to Damascene Gashumba, the country director of Rwandan environment NGO, the Rural Environment and Development Organisation (REDO). Flooding and landslides not only destroy the built environment and biodiversity but also badly erode the soil that sustains crops. Nearly 600 million tons of soil is lost annually in Rwanda as a result of torrential rain, with sloping croplands losing the most, noted the UNDP. The loss of harvest due to heavy rains means communities could experience a famine, said Gashumba.The Rwandan government has focused strongly on adaptation and resilience to climate change, but this is not enough, Gashumba said, pointing out that developed countries are the primary source climate-inducing emissions and beyond their own climate mitigation must help Rwanda improve resilience. Working together to build resilienceThe Green Gicumbi Project in the highlands of Northern Rwanda is working to make hilltop farming both flood and drought resistant. Much of the land was so eroded that it has been left fallow. But the building of terraces and run off channels along with water storage for irrigation during the dry months is rapidly transforming the landscape. The harvest that we are expecting this season is a miracle, said Jacqueline Nyirabikari, a Green Gicumbi Project farmer. This land was no longer usable. But since the arrival of Green Gicumbi, climate change is no longer stopping us from growing crops.The transformation of an arid wasteland into a productive and climate resilient agricultural region was mostly funded by the Green Climate Fund that emerged out of the Paris climate agreement, and has been implemented by the Rwandan government. Will it be enough?UNEP&amp;#39;s Munang notes that cities and towns in Rwanda and across the region continue to encroach on natural drainage areas such as swamps and wetlands that surround cities. But while priority needs to be given to preserving wetlands and forests, and to increase the efficiency of these drainage areas to limit flood damage, the other benefit will be to retain biodiversity and store more climate-killing carbon.We are positive for the future, said Gashumba. We have hope.Another dimension of this climate adaptation will also be to simply relocate vulnerable communities to safer, less flood prone areas, he added. But the solution is not ideal.When you shift from your home you lose everything.Edited by: Sarah Steffen </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/rwanda-floods-landslides-fueled-by-climate-change/a-65556250?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988168362432295725976100180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6869-1NW1-JCMN-Y52J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><timeReceived>9:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Development agencies have a unique opportunity to utilise feminist development policy as a foundation for comprehensive and profound change, addressing structural inequalities and dismantling oppressive power dynamics. After all, the BMZ has set the ambitious target of allocating 93 % of all of its project funds to measures to promote gender equality by 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Germany's feminist development policy aims for two guiding principles:</p><p>Intersectionality: it seeks to improve the situation for 'women and marginalised groups in all their diversity'. The strategy thus acknowledges that a person can be disadvantaged in several ways and due to a combination of their individual characteristics, such as ethnic or religious identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background or origin from rural, disadvantaged regions. For example, female refugees may be stigmatised for their gender and their migratory experience.</p><p>Postcolonialism: the strategy's postcolonial claim intends to critically reflect entrenched power structures and contribute to dismantling unequal treatment based on patriarchal or racist power gaps.</p><p>Key areas of the strategy are 'three Rs' and respective measures:</p><p>Rights of women and other marginalised groups must be protected by replacing discriminatory laws with gender-responsive laws and supporting their implementation. They include sexual and reproductive rights, prevention of violence, human rights, land rights or digital rights as well as rights to health services, education and economic opportunities.</p><p>Resources need to be equally accessible to and controlled by all genders. They comprise access to education, labour markets, financial systems, land, digital technologies, social protection, health, sanitation and funding as well as protection from climate risks and food insecurity.</p><p>Representation means the equal and meaningful participation of women and other marginalised groups in important social, political and economic decisionmaking processes at all levels. They range from planning and budgeting decisions in economic and tax systems to equal participation in peace processes and a stronger role for women in the development and use of digital technologies.</p><p>A tall order</p><p>The strategy is timely and much needed - but a tall order. Underlying power imbalances are difficult to identify let alone to reduce, and the 'three Rs' offer a list of good things that do not necessarily go together. Priority setting must be key. At the same time, there is no prioritisation that can consider all the diverse interests and local conditions.</p><p>The social contract framework offers a possible starting point to deal with this. It helps to understand how different groups in a society have rights and responsibilities, and how power dynamics and compromises play a role. It shows that the government provides goods and services to its citizens in return for their acceptance of its authority. Social contracts contribute to establishing stable relationships between the government and society by avoiding the need to constantly renegotiate the terms of their interaction.</p><p>Whether social contracts make the relationship between state and society more predictable, resilient and equitable, depends on who is entitled to which goods and services within state and society. According to researchers from the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), these goods and services can be categorised as the 'three Ps'. These 'three Ps' are similar to the 'three Rs' of the feminist policy and can help to prioritise between them:</p><p>Protection differentiates between collective security (e.g., against external threats), human security (e.g., against physical threats or criminal attacks) and legal security (e.g., enforcing human and civil rights, rule of law).</p><p>Provision means basic public services, especially access to resources, infrastructure, social services and economic opportunities.</p><p>Participation refers to the state's willingness to give its citizens a voice in political decisionmaking processes on different levels.</p><p>Governments fail their duties</p><p>Ideally, governments fulfil their responsibilities and provide all three Ps to every citizen. However, governments often fail to meet one or more of these duties. This may be due to budgetary constraints, for example if the cost of universal health care is too high. Political motivations are another reason. Authoritarian leaders may prioritise security and service delivery but expect citizens to give up their rights to participate in decision-making and legal protection. Sometimes rights are denied to all citizens, sometimes a policy of 'divide and rule' gives some groups more rights than others.</p><p>Women are particularly often disadvantaged. This was most recently demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic. They had to do the additional care work as schools and kindergartens were temporarily closed (that is, the state had to reduce provision). Moreover, women are often in less stable employment with fewer workers' rights and are more at risk of losing their jobs (that means they lack protection).</p><p>Helping stakeholders to implement truly gender sensitive policies</p><p>Considering state-society relations and changing social contracts helps stakeholders in the development context to identify which issues are most disputed in a given context and which rights, resources and representative positions are currently inaccessible to certain groups. It also helps policymakers to understand which development interventions are transformative and cannot simply be reversed later.</p><p>The development community can expand its influence in promoting gender-\u00adsensitive policies by paying attention to social contracts. For example, this approach helps to realise that simply increasing the number of female representatives in a country's decisionmaking bodies may not necessarily lead to transformative change. In some cases, it may even reinforce existing power imbalances if the chosen representatives are not only female but also part of a longstanding privileged elite.</p><p>Alliances not only with feminist organisations but also within society at large are necessary for more inclusive development. It is crucial to also include men, ethnic leaders or religious elites to understand their interests and reservations. Development actors should take this into account when selecting their cooperation partners and beneficiaries. Feminist policy calls for role models with whom women and other marginalised groups can truly identify.</p><p>In the face of crises as well as future challenges such as climate adaptation or digitalisation, feminist policies are more necessary than ever for truly transformative and inclusive development. While the formulation of feminist policies was a step in the right direction, it is now crucial to find innovative and effective approaches to implement them in an equitable and sustainable way.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2007202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68RM-4CS1-JCH9-G1CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1183\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 20, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Let's use our remaining time in Egypt to build the bridges needed to make progress on 1.5 [degrees Celsius target], adaptation, finance and loss &amp; damage,\" he added.</p><p>A contentious issue at the centre of the UN climate conference, known as COP27, is the payment of reparations for damage caused by climate change in poor regions.</p><p>Delegates of the conference, which runs\u00a0until Friday, have already agreed\u00a0to place the issue, known as\u00a0loss and damage funding, on the agenda for the first time.</p><p>Developing countries had long pressed for the creation of a financial mechanism for addressing\u00a0climate-induced harms\u00a0in poor countries.\u00a0</p><p>However, the international environment group, Greenpeace, said\u00a0 several wealthy\u00a0countries, including the US and Britain,\u00a0were blocking progress at COP27 on creating a loss and damage facility.</p><p>The blockers are \"consistently using delay tactics\" to ensure that no agreement is reached on the issue until at least 2024, it added.</p><p>UN chief Antonio Guterres had told world leaders earlier that\u00a0getting concrete results on the issue is a \"litmus test\" of governments' commitment to\u00a0COP27 success.</p><p>Representatives from around 200 countries are grappling at the COP27 event with the question of how global warming can still be contained and how climate damage can be financed.</p><p>The goal is to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shouky, the COP27 president, said parties were not yet able to reach substantial conclusions on some items including further cuts in emissions.</p><p>\"Parties need more time regarding mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage,\" Shoukry said.</p><p>According to him, there is still a lot of work if \"meaningful and tangible outcomes\" are to be achieved.\u00a0</p><p>\"We must now shift gears and complement the technical discussions with more political, high-level engagement,\" Shoukry added.</p><p>Shoukry\u00a0urged negotiators to make use of\u00a0all available means\u00a0to achieve\u00a0 progress.</p><p>\"Time is not on our side and the world is watching,\" he told delegates. \"Let us get down to work.\"</p><p>The UN aid agency meanwhile said the developed countries,\u00a0 responsible for 80% of the world's global emissions, must invest in climate adaptation and pay for resulting loss and damage in poorer countries.</p><p>\"This is a matter of solidarity and justice,\" added the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA.</p><p>The agency gave the example of\u00a0the Horn of Africa, saying while it is responsible for less than 0.1 % of global emissions, the region has\u00a0to \"pay the price of the climate crisis.\"</p><p>Pro-environment campaigners have ramped up pressure\u00a0on negotiators to take tangible steps to fight climate change, including a halt to\u00a0fossil fuel funding.</p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has, among other things, sent energy prices soaring, prompting several nations to reconsider their energy policies and reactivate coal-fired power plants.</p><p>Fossil\u00a0fuels - mainly coal, crude oil and gas - produce large amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide.</p><p>COP27\u00a0is taking place\u00a0following natural disasters including\u00a0floods, heatwaves and droughts,\u00a0which have taken a huge toll\u00a0on the lives and livelihoods\u00a0of individuals across the globe.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>Editorial contactsEditing by:\u00a0Thomas Cronenberg, &lt;<email

Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> During the 77th session of the UN General Assembly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate change were high on the agenda amid soaring energy and food prices.The Russian invasion of Ukraine and climate change dominated speeches at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City on Tuesday. </p><p><br/>The first day of the weeklong assembly saw leaders from across the world share their concerns about the shaking international order and global challenges such as hunger and climate change, exacerbated by the war's effect on inflation as well as food and energy prices.  <br/>Multiple leaders slam Russian invasion  <br/>Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, who appeared virtually from Ukraine, blamed Moscow for willingly causing the food crisis. <br/>\"Any state that provokes famine, that tries to make access to food a privilege, that tries to make the protection of nations from famine dependent on... the mercy of some dictator \u2014 such a state must get the toughest reaction from the world,\" Zelensky said. <br/>He blamed Russian blockades of Ukrainian ports and other \"immoral actions\" for disrupting exports from the country, which is a major agricultural producer under normal circumstances. <br/>\"Russia must bear responsibility for this,\" he said. <br/>Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called for reforms of the United Nations Security Council after expressing disappointment over the failure of the institution to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine because of Russia's right of veto as a permanent member.  <br/>In his speech, Kishida said \"the foundation of the international order is violently shaken right now,\" implying that the United Nations had lost part of its impact in maintaining world peace.  <br/>French President Emanuel Macron appealed to countries not to stay neutral about condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, declaring that the war amounted to a new type of imperialism.  <br/>Macron insisted that negotiations to end the war could only succeed \"if Ukraine's sovereignty is respected, its territory liberated and its security protected.'' <br/>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"trying to blackmail the international community with food\" through his invasion of Ukraine in February.  <br/>\"There is no peace with hunger and we cannot combat hunger without peace,\" Sanchez added.  <br/>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz heavily criticized Putin's invasion of Ukraine, calling it an act of \"imperialism plain and simple\" during his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.  <br/>Similar to Macron, he urged other leaders to not remain passive, highlighting Russia's nuclear weapons and war crimes committed in Ukraine.  <br/>Island states urge for more responsibility by industrialized nations  <br/>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Marshall Islands' president David Kabua both urged industrialized nations and the global community to take up more responsibility for countries already affected by climate change.  <br/>Marcos said \"the time for talk about 'if' and 'when' has long since passed\", calling on industrialized countries to fulfill their obligations to cut greenhouse gasses and to support developing countries.  <br/>\"The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect a historical injustice: Those who are least responsible suffer the most,'' Marcos said. \"This injustice must be corrected and those who need to do more must act now.'' <br/>\"The world's richest people have put its poorest at risk,\" he added. <br/>Kabua criticized that \"the world has failed to break our addiction to fossil fuels,\" stressing that not enough investments were made into climate adaptation, especially for small island states such as Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands.  <br/>\"Today, we renew our call to the world to declare total war on this century's greatest challenge, the climate change monster,'' he said. <br/>Kabua went on to urge world leaders to cut down on sectors that rely on fossil fuels while investing into renewable energies drastically.  <br/>los/aw (AFP, AP,

Dependence on dwindling resources, such as water, could exacerbate tensions on the ground, he said, but added that these problems could be counteracted through measures taken by the council and others.  \"Climate adaptation and peace-building can and should reinforce each other,\" he said.  Various members of the powerful UN body have taken up the issue in the past, for example by trying to implement an early warning system for conflicts caused by the climate crisis, among other actions.  However, there has so far not been enough support in the council.  Climate change is also causing crop failures in many places, Guterres added at a later event about combatting world hunger.   At the same time, food production systems worldwide contribute about one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions.  \"We must build a world where healthy and nutritious food is available and affordable for everyone, everywhere,\" he said.  The UN chief said three billion people worldwide could not afford healthy food and around 462 million people were underweight - while at the same time two billion people were overweight and nearly a third of all food was lost or thrown away.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection ? at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact ? are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent?s poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended. The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork ?for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.? Though summit attendees didn?t arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars: Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties, especially the most indebted countries.  Foster private sector development in low-income countries.  Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition in emerging and developing countries.  Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate change. The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It?s no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It?s not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it?s become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal. And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it ? and welcome it. It?s the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects. Valid Finance Concerns?Up to a Point To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation?s capital city. Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis. When Mottley ? an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas. Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank?s biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank?s then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass? leadership, the World Bank did too little to ?align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts? ? while it continues to fund oil and gas projects). Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world?s economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to ?mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.? And, again, that?s an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa?s gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa. To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that?s not what we?re seeing. Look at Afrieximbank?s Excellent Example In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa?s important domestic banks. For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to ?invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,? and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine ?our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.? As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies. Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that? At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in ?revitalizing Africa?s climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.? To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables. This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa?s economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What?s more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa?s much-needed industrialization, we all know that?s not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now. All of this requires money. As I?ve written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won?t work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN?s sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept. \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said. The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection - at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact - are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent's poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended.  The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork \"for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.\" Though summit attendees didn't arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars:    * Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties,     especially the most indebted countries.    * Foster private sector development in low-income countries.    * Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition     in emerging and developing countries.    * Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate     change.  The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It's no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It's not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it's become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal.  And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it - and welcome it.  It's the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects.  Valid Finance Concerns-Up to a Point  To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation's capital city.  Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis.  When Mottley - an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)- floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas.  Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank's biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank's then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass' leadership, the World Bank did too little to \"align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts\" - while it continues to fund oil and gas projects).  Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world's economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments.  The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to \"mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.\"  And, again, that's an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa's gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa.  To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that's not what we're seeing.  Look at Afrieximbank's Excellent Example  In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa's important domestic banks.  For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to \"invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,\" and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine \"our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.\"  As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies.  Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that?  At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in \"revitalizing Africa's climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.\"  To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables.  This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas  Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa's economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What's more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa's much-needed industrialization, we all know that's not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now.  All of this requires money.  As I've written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won't work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN's sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept.  \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said.  The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Innovations are needed that can both reduce the contribution of global agriculture to climate change, and adapt to its increasingly evident consequences while also supporting livelihoods, nutrition and equality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many smallholders reside in agriculture-dependent regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and face a rising tide of climate threats including increased drought, flooding and water scarcity. The climate crisis is exacerbating the degradation of food, land, and water systems, impacting productivity, viability and resilience.</p><p>The call comes as the United Kingdom pledged $55 million over two years to boost commitments to CGIAR research from a steadily growing global coalition to surpass $1 billion.

CGIAR will lead the 'innovation sprint' on Fast Tracking Climate Solutions from Global Germplasm Banks (https://foundati onfar.org/grants-funding/grants/fast-tracking-climate-solutions-from-global-germ plasm-banks/) as part of the new United States and United Arab Emirates Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate or AIM4C (<url normalizedValue=\"https://aimforclimate.org/\">https://aimforclimate.org/</url>) launched by President Biden at COP26.</p><p>The first week at COP26 delivered significant support for climate innovation for farmers across the developing world.

Together with on-going contributions, the Bank could potentially provide support in the order of $150 million over the next three years.</p><p>\"The investments secured at COP26 will accelerate this work, but much more is needed in the long run to fight global hunger and poverty. We must cultivate a global and truly multilateral effort to bridge the remaining investment gap, prioritize adaptation strategies and programs, and support the innovations to confront this unprecedented threat to food systems that feed billions,\" said Sadoff.</p><p>Some examples of where CGIAR will direct its efforts via partnerships in new initiatives include:</p><p>- Securing the Asian Mega-Deltas from Sea-Level Rise, Flooding, Salinization and   Water Insecurity : This initiative will develop climate adaptation measures   against sea-level rise, floods, water shortage, soil, and freshwater   salinization. Smallholders and policymakers will have access to timely,   relevant information and financial solutions supporting adoption of improved   coping strategies. - Building Systemic Resilience Against Climate Variability and Extremes :   Building on years of CGIAR climate research, this initiative will help 30   million smallholders adapt to climate change by 2030 by developing the   enabling environment to support climate adaptation interventions, at the   magnitude and speed necessary to achieve rapid and broad transformation. - Diversification for Resilient Agribusiness Ecosystems in East and Southern   Africa : This initiative will improve resilience to climate and shocks, and   adaptation across food, land, and water systems, for millions of small-scale   producers and vulnerable groups on cropland spanning 12 countries. - Mitigation and Transformation Initiative for GHG Reductions of Agrifood   Systems Related Emissions : This initiative will reduce food system emissions   across seven countries, representing a 7% reduction in global food system   emissions, in ways that support climate-resilient development. - From Fragility to Resilience in Central and West Asia and North Africa:   Transforming Responses to Drought and Climate Variability : Millions of value   chain actors will benefit from climate-adapted innovations, making their   livelihoods more resilient to drought and climate variability. Mitigation   co-benefits will contribute to a reduction of CO2 equivalent emissions by 20%   across value chains. - Accelerated Breeding: Meeting Farmers' Needs with Nutritious,   Climate-Resilient Crops : Crop variety development and trait discovery will   target adaptation to forecasted climate change impacts, such as drought, heat,   flooding, diseases, and pests, for specific crop-region combinations.

That analysis showed that there is a broad consensus on the need for such programmes and their benefits within the scientific community and at international organisations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Studies confirm that green programmes can be very effective drivers of economic recovery, sometimes even more effective than conventional measures. For example, investment in renewable energy pays off more in macroeconomic terms than state support for fossil fuels. Investment in nature conservation, too, can have a very high multiplier effect, meaning that it generates high impacts on demand and employment. Money spent on unsustainable land use, on the other hand, tends to have a negative impact on an economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Criteria for green measures</p><p>There is widespread agreement in the scientific community on the criteria that green stimulus measures should meet. It is important that they:</p><p>are feasible in the short run,</p><p>have a high impact on demand and employment (targeted),</p><p>place only a temporary strain on state budgets (temporary) and</p><p>make a positive contribution to socio-ecological transformation (see Sabine Balk's article on the need for a socio-ecological transformation on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Some economic areas are particularly suitable for sustainable recovery programmes. They include non-fossil energy production, energy-efficient building renovation, sustainable mobility and measures for the ecological transformation of industry. The last area mentioned encompasses, for example, the development of a hydrogen-based economy and the promotion of technologies to increase energy and material efficiency. Climate adaptation measures and nature-based solutions such as reforestation are also often rated very highly.</p><p>Which particular measures can be feasibly implemented depends partly on country-specific circumstances, such as economic structure and administrative, technical and financial capacities, and partly on the availability of projects that are already planned and can be swiftly implemented.</p><p>Evaluations of existing green recovery programmes show significant differences. In industrialised countries the range of support areas is very broad, whereas in emerging economies and developing countries the focus is often solely on the development of renewable energy - especially solar energy - and preservation of the natural capital stock, for example economically important ecosystem services such as forests or marine sanctuaries.</p><p>Just a flash in the pan</p><p>Studies on green economic recovery programmes launched during the 2008/2009 financial and economic crisis show that they might only have a momentary effect. For example, although global greenhouse gas emissions declined slightly in 2009, they rose sharply again in 2010. The main reasons for the upturn were low energy prices and high government spending on fossil fuel-based activities.</p><p>Therefore, it is necessary to check all economic stimulus measures for environmentally harmful and climate-damaging effects and to embed green recovery programmes in structural reforms. This includes dismantling environmentally harmful subsidies and implementing carbon pricing. In addition, regulatory barriers need to be removed and green investment targets set.</p><p>It is also important to promote green financial instruments, build green infrastructures such as charging points for electric vehicles, expand public transport networks and power grids, and launch training programmes so that the social and ecological transformation is not hampered by a shortage of skilled workers.</p><p>Policy-making is lagging behind</p><p>More than two years after the onset of the corona crisis, questions need to be addressed about the extent to which policy-makers heeded the recommendations of the scientific community and the scale on which green economic recovery programmes were implemented. The answer is sobering: from a global perspective, green recovery measures played a minor role to combat the corona crisis.</p><p>The Global Recovery Observatory - a platform created by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), IMF and GIZ to promote knowledge exchange and green fiscal policy - tracks countries' COVID-19 recovery spending. It estimates that total spending worldwide on measures to address the crisis amounted to around US$ 18 trillion (as of August 2022), most of which went on short-term rescue efforts. Only a little over US$ 3 trillion was longer-term recovery spending and less than a third of that was used to fund green programmes.</p><p>Even so, compared to the 2008/2009 financial crisis the importance of green economic recovery measures has increased significantly. Evidence of this can be seen, among other places, in many EU countries, partly as a result of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility earmarking considerable financial resources for green measures.</p><p>Green recovery spending has been confined to relatively few countries, most of them in the industrialised world. This is largely due to the fact that the financial resources of developing and emerging economies are much more limited. In 2020, per capita spending on recovery programmes in industrial countries was 17 times higher than in developing and emerging economies. This shows how important debt relief and targeted financial support by the industrialised world is. They empower developing and emerging nations, too, to implement green programmes.</p><p>Moreover, green programmes' positive impacts on the environment are often counteracted by negative impacts from other stimulus measures. The IMF found that in the Group of 20 leading economic nations (G20), 1.4% of corona spending in 2020 had a positive climate impact, while 1.7% was harmful to the climate. Analyses by the Global Recovery Observatory conclude that only 3% of expenditures on economic recovery have a positive effect on the natural capital stock but 17% of spending has a negative impact. With regard to the goal of air pollution control, the positive and negative impacts are more or less equal. These are shocking findings and underline the importance of applying environmental and sustainability checks to all stimulus measures.</p><p>Whether the world as a whole will emerge from the crisis greener as a result of the corona programmes that have been implemented is impossible to say at this stage. It is too early to make a final judgement because programmes are still ongoing and quantitative impact studies are hardly available.</p><p>Because of the war in Ukraine, the world is now once again in an economic crisis. And the measures taken in response to that crisis will again be decisive. If the sharp rise in fossil fuel prices is used as an opportunity to promote energy efficiency, green energy and post-fossil production technologies, the crisis could become a catalyst for sustainable development. Developing countries and emerging economies urgently need support in this regard because the constraints on their financial capacities have been even intensified by the current surge in energy and food prices and the economic crisis.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the response to sharply rising fossil fuel prices and gas supply shortages is to subsidise fossil fuels even more and to develop new sources of fossil fuels, the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement will hardly be achievable any more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2709202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66GH-89R1-JCH9-G3V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 27, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Examples underpinning this reputation are the EU's energy policy (Dupont, 2016), its Emission Trading System (Liu et al., 2019), its regulation of aircraft emissions (Bernauer et al., 2013), the Green Diplomacy Network (Bremberg et al., 2019) and the EU's funding of multilateral climate action (Dellmuth et al., 2020). Given this track record, it comes as no surprise that the EU has also extensively engaged in climate governance in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) region.1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This region is highly vulnerable to climate change. Especially the southern neighbourhood has experienced dramatically rising temperatures, more frequent droughts and increasing water scarcity (Rizzo, 2016). Existing vulnerabilities to climate change in the region could, in turn, adversely affect national security, human livelihoods and migration flows \u2013 all areas of strategic importance to the EU (European Commission, 2009). The region's strategic importance for the EU warrants an inquiry into the motivations underpinning the EU's climate governance in the ENP region, which is the focus of this article.</p><p>Climate change poses a complex transboundary policy challenge, as it cannot be handled unilaterally. In the absence of international cooperation among partner states, climate policies become uncoordinated and inefficient. To coordinate efforts to combat the threats posed by climate change for nature and societies, the EU uses various instruments. Unlike the instruments that the EU can apply unilaterally, such as conditionality attached to trade agreements or climate diplomacy, climate policy networks build on horizontal ties between the EU and third countries (Shyrokykh, 2022).</p><p>In this article, we shed new light on the EU's climate governance in regional policy networks. Toward this end, we build on network governance theory which yields important insights for this current study for two main reasons. First, network governance theory is uniquely suitable for studying the international governance of complex issues such as climate change, as this governance is often characterized by interdependent and interconnected sets of actors. To capture the dynamics in these forms of governance, network governance theory acknowledges the interdependence of actors in a network (e.g., Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; McGuire, 2002; Slaughter and Hale, 2013). Network governance is defined as decision-making in relation to cross-border challenges and situations when joint problems require policy solutions from interdependent actors (cf. Jones et al., 1997; McGuire, 2002). In this article, EU climate networks are well captured by the theoretical concept of policy networks, as the latter are issue-specific, focus on joint problem-solving and have the aspiration to improve climate cooperation. Second, we build on network governance theory as it provides insights into the functions served by policy networks. More specifically, it enables us to develop hypotheses that contribute to a better understanding of the role of climate networks in the EU's external climate governance and in climate policy networks more broadly.</p><p>In so doing, we advance on two related literatures that have studied EU climate governance in third countries, but that have paid insufficient attention to network governance. First, climate governance research has privileged the study of climate policy mainstreaming, analysing how the EU promotes policies on energy (Dupont, 2016; Shyrokykh, 2021b), security (Dellmuth et al., 2018), health, migration and economic affairs (Dellmuth and Gustafsson, 2021). Previous research has also examined the EU's involvement in international climate negotiations (e.g., B\u00e4ckstrand and Elgstr\u00f6m, 2013) and in bilateral climate cooperation (e.g., Liu et al., 2019).</p><p>Second, Europeanization research has predominantly focused on the ways in which the EU promotes democracy in the ENP region (e.g., Noutcheva, 2015, 2016). Little attention has been paid to EU climate governance. Although there are notable exceptions (B\u00f6rzel and Fagan, 2015; Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013; Shyrokykh, 2021b), these have not systematically distinguished between environmental and climate cooperation, or between cooperation on adaptation and mitigation. The network governance perspective is well suited to contribute to the investigation of EU networks on adaptation and mitigation, as well as to identify their key functions. Policy networks are by definition issue-specific and require clear objectives to be effective (McGuire, 2002), which suggests that it is useful to distinguish between networks on adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>In this article, we focus on the first generation of EU regional climate projects in the ENP region that aimed to support low-carbon development and to increase resilience to climate change: Clima East and Clima South.2 We ask: what are the determinants of the EU's resource allocation in EU climate networks? To address this question, this article develops different hypotheses about the specific functions of climate policy networks by drawing on the network governance literature. To test these hypotheses, we compiled a novel dataset including measures of the extent to which the EU allocates resources in climate policy networks in the ENP states within Clima East and Clima South, and the correlates of these measures.</p><p>A distinct strength of our empirical approach is that our dataset distinguishes between <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">adaptation</emphasis>, or the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mitigation</emphasis>, which refers to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2022). This distinction enables us to relate our analysis to both of these central pillars of climate policy in the Bali Action Plan of 2007 and in the 2015 Paris Agreement (Liberatore, 2013). Most studies on global climate governance and the EU's external climate governance in the ENP region foreground mitigation, while adaptation as a transboundary policy issue has only recently started attracting scholarly attention.</p><p>The results from a statistical analysis of this dataset suggest that the EU climate networks are both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cohesive</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fluid</emphasis> at the same time. On the one hand, both adaptation and mitigation networks are used to govern interdependencies and to enhance partner countries\u2019 institutional capacities. On the other hand, network resources are allocated in a fluid and flexible way that follows the pattern of the interdependencies between the EU and individual ENP countries. These findings contribute to EU climate governance research and to the literature on Europeanization and network governance, which we discuss by way of conclusion.</p><h>EU climate networks in the neighbourhood</h><p>The ENP was established in response to the Eastern enlargement in 2004. It aligned previously disparate foreign policy strategies vis-\u00e0-vis the neighbouring states in a single policy vision. Since then, the ENP has developed more nuanced approaches to the region by way of establishing the Eastern Partnership and the Mediterranean dimension of cooperation in 2009.</p><p>Two central projects were created to support the development of so-called \u201cecosystem-based\u201d approaches to climate change in the ENP region: Clima East and Clima South. An ecosystem-based approach is defined by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as the \u201cuse of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change as part of an overall adaptation strategy\u201d (CBD, 2009). The aim of the projects was to improve policies, strategies and market mechanisms relevant for adaptation and mitigation, by fostering regional cooperation and by improving access to information on EU climate policies, laws and expertise.3</p><p>The EU's aspiration with both regional projects was to appear as a climate actor and to help neighbouring countries to improve their climate governance standards (European Commission, 2009). Clima East and Clima South were designed to assist the ENP states in their transition to low-carbon economies and to climate resilience, by strengthening domestic capacity through expertise sharing and improved monitoring and verification methodologies for measuring and reporting emissions. The objectives of the cooperation were defined by the EU in line with international climate treaties and climate science (European Commission, 2009). Both Clima East and Clima South were active between 2013 and 2017 and individual activities lasted until 2018. The total cost of the Clima projects amounted to about \u20ac23m.4</p><p>More generally, policy networks established by regional projects like Clima East and Clima South tend to be technocratic and depoliticized, so as to facilitate joint governance of complex cross-border issues (Shyrokykh, 2021b). Such networks aim to share expertise with partner countries, mainly targeting related ministries and state agencies, technical units and the legislative bodies of partner countries (Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013; European Commission, 2004).5 Clima East and Clima South provided technical assistance in legislative drafting, as well as in the implementation and enforcement of previously signed international treaties.6 Clima East and Clima South did not direct any funding to the beneficiary countries, but their scope was rather limited to technical cooperation.</p><h>Theory and hypotheses</h><h>Conceptualizing network governance</h><p>Network governance is usually described as coordinated deliberation and decision-making with the aim to provide public goods and to address complex problems by way of cooperation rather than by relying on bureaucratic structures in formal institutions (cf. Jones et al., 1997). Network governance focuses on transboundary issues and can involve various interdependent stakeholders. Although policy networks are sometimes referred to as \u201ctrans-governmental\u201d and are primarily designed for government-affiliated actors, the EU's climate policy networks bring together stakeholders from various domains such as academia, business, and civil society.</p><p>There are a number of other types of governance, such as multi-level governance and private sector governance, which warrants a systematic conceptual discussion. Much climate governance takes a hybrid form or represents a mix of different types of governance. Hybrid climate governance models have been extensively studied in the literature and include <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">public non-profit governance</emphasis> across national, regional and local levels with some involvement of civil society, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">public for-profit governance</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">private sector governance</emphasis> (Young, 2005: 28\u201329; Pattberg and Stripple, 2008). This article focuses on the intersection between the three hybrid approaches \u2013 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">network governance</emphasis> \u2013 where state and non-state actors from different countries and levels of governance collaborate to address climate change.</p><p>Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, network governance also differs from multilevel governance. While both concepts refer to non-hierarchical and fluid cooperation settings, most multilevel governance research does not consider non-state actors to be part of governance processes and instead privileges state actors at the international, national, regional and local levels (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). The notion of network governance best captures the EU's climate policy networks, which are open to the participation of both state and non-state actors at different levels.</p><p>Similar to international organizations, policy networks reduce transaction costs and provide information that facilitates both effective monitoring and flexible problem-solving at the international level (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). Unlike the cooperation that takes place within international organizations, however, policy networks cannot take recourse to enforcement mechanisms (McGuire, 2013: 439).</p><p>Policy networks do not emerge spontaneously as self-sufficient and autonomous entities; both the operational and strategic character of networks depends on the actions of network managers (McGuire, 2002). Network management refers to activities intended to steer interactions between network participants to enhance collective efficiency (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999). While network managers drive governance processes in networks, they do so in ways that are different from command-and-control processes (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; O\u2019Toole, 1997). The primary activities of network managers involve selecting the appropriate partners and resources, shaping the operating context of the network, and developing ways to cope with strategic and operational complexity (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; McGuire, 2002).</p><p>In climate governance in the ENP region, the EU acts as a network manager. Unlike in other policy networks in which cooperation is demand-driven (Shyrokykh, 2022), priorities for cooperation in Clima East and Clima South were rather supply-side spearheaded by the EU's policies on neighbouring countries (European Commission, 2009). A particular emphasis was put on the areas of agriculture, biodiversity, forests, energy, health, disaster risks and water management.</p><p>The Clima East and Clima South projects invited eastern and southern neighbours to participate in capacity-building and information-exchange events in the areas of adaptation and mitigation. While cooperation was optional, state authorities or centralized institutions were not directly involved in these loosely structured peer-to-peer interactions. The two programs thus fit the description of network governance well, and the role of the EU in these programs is best described as the role of a network manager who defines cooperation objectives and arranges cooperation opportunities.</p><h>Hypotheses: matching resources and policy context</h><p>One of the main tasks of the network governance literature is to understand how resources are allocated in policy networks \u2013 in other words, how network managers match available resources to policy context. In this section, we develop hypotheses on contextual factors that might explain the extent to which the EU, as a network manager, allocates resources to climate networks in the areas of adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>The existing network governance literature has identified three main functions of policy networks: managing external dependencies, improving the institutional capacity of partner countries and providing support for less advanced partners (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). In the context of EU policy networks on adaptation and mitigation, we argue that these functions can co-occur but are analytically distinct. In the following, we discuss each function to elicit how resources are allocated in climate networks in the ENP countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Manage external dependencies.</emphasis> According to the network governance literature, managing external dependencies is one of the most important functions of policy networks. As \u201cinterdependent actors, by definition, cannot achieve their goals on their own\u201d, cooperation in such networks is essential (McGuire, 2013: 437). External dependency is typically understood in terms of actors\u2019 inability to resolve their own problems without cooperating and coordinating with others (Lavenex et al., 2021).</p><p>Although the defining feature of policy networks is that they are meant to be non-hierarchical in terms of a lack of demand-and-control type of relations, networks do have network managers (McGuire, 2002). In the context of the Clima projects, this role was assumed by the European Commission. As noted above, the European Commission funded these networks and defined their objectives, which raises the possibility of influencing the extent and focus of the cooperation.</p><p>There might be different types of interdependencies between the EU and its neighbours (Gleditsch and Ward, 2001; Lavenex et al., 2021). Three types of external dependencies are chiefly relevant here, namely: (a) interdependencies due to geographic proximity, (b) trade relations, and (c) energy interdependence. We will discuss each of these three types in more depth to develop a hypothesis about how the EU can be expected to use policy networks to address its external dependencies.</p><p>Geographic proximity fosters multiple complex dependencies. A case in point are resource dependencies between states. In the context of climate governance, EU member states and ENP countries draw on interconnected natural and environmental resource pools, including air, biodiversity, forestry and water. For example, sustainable forest management is a key objective in EU mitigation policies. The deforestation in the Carpathian mountain range, partially caused by illegal logging in Ukraine, has adversely affected biodiversity and ecosystems in the EU member states that share the mountain range. This is the case in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia (UNEP, 2020). As Carpathian ecosystems are interconnected, the damaging practices of a neighbouring country can affect EU member states. The European Commission has acknowledged the need for coordinated climate policies with neighbours due to mutual dependencies and shared climate risks (European Commission, 2009). The EU is thus likely to have an interest in climate governance in its closest neighbouring states as there is a greater shared dependency related to natural and environmental resources.</p><p>Similarly, interdependencies in trade and energy relations can shape the degree to which the EU as a network manager allocates resources to climate networks. Trade and energy relations between the EU and the ENP states can be affected by climate-related reforms, or the lack thereof. In turn, policy networks can be useful to promote such reforms. For example, the EU usually includes energy-related objectives in its climate projects as part of its cooperation with some neighbouring states. In doing so, the EU pursues its own energy security and trade interests as a network manager by allocating more resources to countries with which it has relevant interdependencies (Shyrokykh, 2021b).</p><p>Taken together, the EU's allocation of resources in adaptation and mitigation networks in the neighbourhood might at least partially be motivated by the EU's interest in managing interdependencies. Assuming that the function of EU adaptation and mitigation networks is to manage external dependencies, we expect that the EU allocates more resources to states with which it has more interdependencies.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a:</emphasis> The EU allocates more resources in climate networks to ENP countries with which it has more interdependencies.</p><p>At the same time, adaptation and mitigation networks have different policy foci. Mitigation policies address the issue of global greenhouse gas emissions by promoting decarbonization in areas such as energy, trade and economic development. These issue areas are of strategic importance to EU member states (European Commission, 2009). By contrast, adaptation policies tend to be highly localized as national and international policy-makers have only recently started to recognize the transnational dimension of adaptation challenges (Benzie and Persson, 2019; Dellmuth et al., 2020).</p><p>The varying nature of policy challenges related to adaptation and mitigation, respectively, might impact how the EU, as a network manager, uses climate networks to further its objectives in these two issue areas. More concretely, the EU might have incentives to prioritize mitigation over adaptation in cooperation with states with which it has more economic dependencies (such as on trade and energy).   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b:</emphasis> The relationship stated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a</emphasis> is more pronounced in mitigation networks than in adaptation networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Enhance institutional capacity.</emphasis> Another important function of policy networks is to address capacity gaps in partner countries (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). From this vantage point, developing an adequate and effective response to global challenges such as climate change requires functional state institutions. A lack of expertise or inability to retain in-house expertise, for example, are highlighted as the main factors that undermine the establishment of robust Measurement, Reporting and Verification systems in neighbourhood states (Rizzo, 2016). Similarly, a lack of institutional capacity has been pointed out as one of the main reasons why the ENP countries fail to make full use of existing climate finance mechanisms (Clima South, 2017). Against this background, the EU might allocate resources to climate networks to enhance the institutional capacity of neighbours in order to ultimately improve adaptation and mitigation governance.</p><p>More generally, institutional capacity is vital to the quality of governance, public service provision and problem-solving (Charasz and Vogler, 2021; Shyrokykh, 2022). Vice versa, weak institutional capacity can undermine policy implementation and the absorption of available funding (B\u00f6rzel and Fagan, 2015; Buzog\u00e1ny, 2009). Thus, it comes as no surprise that the EU has paid particular attention to capacity building in its own member states (e.g., Charasz and Vogler, 2021) and in third countries (Buzog\u00e1ny, 2009; Lavenex, 2008).</p><p>Given that adaptation and mitigation governance require appropriate policy responses, the ability of states to effectively achieve a chosen policy outcome is key. Climate policy networks are useful vehicles to improve institutional capacity, for example, by providing policymakers with guidance to design adequate adaptation and mitigation measures, by strengthening the administrative capacity of the public sector, and by disseminating knowledge about how to foster effective implementation and enforcement of climate policies.</p><p>In sum, the capacity building argument aligns well with the EU's approach to climate governance in the ENP. Recognizing the potential implications of low institutional capacity, policy networks in Clima East and Clima South were used to provide technical training for civil servants, to share best practices, and to advise on climate change resilience (e.g., Clima South, 2017). Assuming that the function of EU climate policy networks is to enhance the institutional capacity of partner countries, the EU is likely to use such networks to engage more with countries with relatively low levels of institutional capacity.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a:</emphasis> The EU allocates more resources in climate networks to ENP countries that have relatively low institutional capacity.</p><p>Similar to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b</emphasis>, we expect differences between adaptation and mitigation networks. Most of the neighbourhood states have a better understanding of the need for mitigation than adaptation. To date, many of these states have no adaptation plans (Shyrokykh, 2021b), indicating a lack of awareness or willingness of engaging in adaptation. Additionally, as noted earlier, cross-border adaptation is a more recent policy priority when compared to mitigation (European Commission, 2009), which might require particular attention and capacity.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2b:</emphasis> The relationship stated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis> is more pronounced in adaptation networks than in mitigation networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Supporting vulnerable states.</emphasis> The third function of policy networks is that policy networks are issue-specific in the sense that they are usually built to address a specific transboundary problem. Taking this perspective, we assume that the EU in part establishes climate policy networks with its neighbours to improve their responsiveness to adaptation and mitigation challenges.</p><p>Indeed, the EU's aspiration to support vulnerable states might not only be grounded in principled, but also in strategic considerations. To be sure, unmanaged climate vulnerabilities in the neighbourhood could adversely affect the security of EU member states (European Commission, 2009). Failure to address disaster risks can have adverse security implications and thereby destabilize regional security, economy and trade. The EU has long considered and framed climate change as a threat to national and human security (European Commission, 2009).</p><p>Climate change poses a security risk to the livelihoods of vulnerable societies in the neighbourhood, as conflicts could arise over scarce resources such as water or food (World Bank, 2020). This could affect the lives of millions of people. Policy networks can be used to transfer expertise to enable more effective management of joint problems, implying that this type of cooperation can also be used to alleviate pressing climate vulnerabilities. If the function of EU adaptation and mitigation networks is to address climate change vulnerabilities, we would expect the EU to strengthen climate networks in vulnerable countries.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a:</emphasis> The EU allocates more resources in climate networks to ENP countries that are more vulnerable to climate risks.</p><p>Again, we expect different effects for adaptation and mitigation. Mitigation-related policies are not designed to reduce vulnerabilities to climate risks. In contrast, adaptation policies typically seek to reduce climate-related risks for nature and human livelihoods, for example by supporting communities and infrastructures to become more resilient to the adverse effects of climate change. Adaptation is also typically geared at the areas of agriculture, water management, coastal protection, disaster risk reduction, migration and security (European Commission, 2009).   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3b:</emphasis> The relationship stated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a</emphasis> is more pronounced in adaptation networks than in mitigation networks.</p><h>Research design</h><p>To test the hypotheses, we compiled a longitudinal dataset for 14 ENP countries (2013\u20132017).7 The dataset includes measures of the EU's allocation of resources in adaptation and mitigation networks, several country-level indicators for the explanatory factors and a number of control variables. The structure of the data is time-series cross-sectional, whereby the unit of analysis is a country-year.</p><p>Two dependent variables were used to distinguish between mitigation and adaptation policy networks set up by the EU. The first dependent variable captures the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">resources allocated in mitigation networks</emphasis>, measured by the annual number of Clima East and Clima South mitigation-related activities in each ENP country. The second dependent variable, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">resources allocated in adaptation networks</emphasis>, expresses the annual number of Clima East and Clima South adaptation-related activities in each ENP country (see the Online appendix).</p><p>An \u201cactivity\u201d refers to a single instance of cooperation. Activities take different forms, such as seminars, workshops, study visits and expert missions. The data were coded manually from the Clima East and Clima South websites on each activity. There were 124 distinct activities in climate policy networks and multiple countries typically attend the same activity. In total, our data contains 440 country-activities.</p><p>Unlike other cooperation formats, cooperation in Clima East and Clima South built on adaptation and mitigation objectives that were defined by the European Commission, rather than being a reaction to beneficiary countries\u2019 requests. The European Commission (2009) stressed the importance of addressing both adaptation and mitigation in partner countries and defined policy areas that were to be addressed in cooperation with neighbours. As a consequence, partner countries were invited to participate in cooperation events arranged by the EU.</p><p>About 19% of the activities deal with adaptation and 21% deal with mitigation. About 60% of the activities in the climate networks in our dataset have no specific focus or were related to both mitigation or adaptation (see the Online appendix). The large proportion of unspecified and cross-cutting activities can be explained by the fact that Clima East and Clima South were the first generation of regional climate projects; many of their activities prioritized establishing ways of working and defining objectives of cooperation, raising awareness about climate risks, and sharing information about the potential consequences of these risks. This observation is in line with one of the propositions of the network governance literature that suggests that in policy networks without clear policy-specific objectives, network managers will direct most of their resources to framing the networks by defining operating rules, clarify foundational values, establishing objectives and arranging structures (McGuire, 2002; O\u2019Toole, 1997). Given that both Clima East and Clima South were the first EU climate networks in the ENP region, it is logical that most of the resources were directed to the framing of climate change.</p><p>In this study, we examine how the EU distributes scarce resources to improve climate governance in third countries. As elaborated earlier, policy networks tend to be most efficient when they have a concrete policy objective (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; McGuire, 2002). Consequently, we focus on those activities that have a concrete policy focus, either on adaptation or on mitigation, excluding activities that do not have such a specific focus. This design choice enables us to systematically examine our hypotheses on adaptation and mitigation \u2013 two central pillars in regional and global climate governance \u2013 which existing research on EU climate and environmental governance has not yet compared.</p><p>The dependent variables capture the frequency of climate cooperation activities and provide a good sense of the extent of the EU's resource allocation in climate change mitigation and adaptation to the region. These variables do not reflect the number of attendees from each country or the actual cost of each activity because this data was not available.</p><p>While other EU projects might be directly or only indirectly related to climate, we focus on Clima East and Clima South because they were the first regional projects to explicitly and exclusively focus on climate policies in the ENP region. Since both projects were completed in 2018, new formats of cooperation have been established \u2013 EU4Climate and ClimaMed \u2013 that continue and expand collaboration. We leave the analysis of these new regional climate projects to future research.</p><p>To operationalize <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b</emphasis>, we required a measure of external dependence between the EU and its ENP partners. Because it is a complex concept, we chose several measures that each capture a different aspect: interdependence generated by geographic proximity, interdependence generated by trade relations and energy interdependence. Interdependence generated by geographic proximity can be best captured by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">geographic distance</emphasis> (in log kilometres) between the EU and ENP countries, which is also the most common proxy for capturing interdependence between countries (see Gleditsch and Ward, 2001).</p><p>Although frequently used, measures of interdependence through geography do not capture other important aspects, such as economic and energy interdependence. To address this, we distinguish between different aspects of interdependence. Thus, to capture economic interdependence, we account for the effects of total <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">trade (log)</emphasis> between the EU and each of the ENP countries and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">energy interdependence</emphasis>. The latter is a measure of energy cooperation on natural gas and oil between the EU and neighbouring countries, coded to reflect whether a country exports energy to EU member states (=3), is an energy transit country to the EU (=2), has signed an agreement planning for future energy cooperation (=1) or has no energy cooperation (=0). Using these three measures of interdependence enables us to distinguish between trade dependency, energy dependency and dependency stemming from geographic distance.</p><p>To measure <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">institutional capacity</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2b</emphasis>), we used the Government Effectiveness Index (Kaufmann et al., 2010) as it captures the quality of policy formulation and implementation, as well as the credibility of a government's commitment to its policies. The index ranges between weak (= \u22122.5) and strong (= 2.5) governance performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3b</emphasis> are operationalized by a measure of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vulnerability</emphasis> to climate risks. We captured vulnerability using the Climate Risk Index (CRI) (Eckstein et al., 2020). This index reflects socio-economic losses in terms of the annual number of deaths and the amount of economic losses in US dollars that occurred due to extreme weather events in each country. The CRI scores for each country were coded from annual reports retrieved from the website.</p><p>Finally, we added a number of control variables to consider the influence of potential confounding factors on the EU's engagement in adaptation and mitigation policy networks. First, the models controlled for whether a country belonged to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eastern Partnership</emphasis> (0 = Southern neighbour; 1 = Eastern neighbour). Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine were coded 1, whereas all the other countries were coded 0. The ENP originated from deepening relations with the EU's Eastern neighbours, but later incorporated the Southern Mediterranean countries. This legacy can result in greater cooperation with the Eastern than with the Southern neighbours.</p><p>We also included the (log of) gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to account for the effects of economic development (World Bank, 2019). Lastly, we controlled for the effects of democracy because cooperation with the EU is conditional on a democratic record. It is also possible that representatives from non-democratic countries are less interested or are not allowed to participate in EU climate networks. We therefore used the Policy score to capture the level of democracy (Marshall and Gurr, 2020). We used a set of additional control variables as robustness checks. The Online appendix provides summary statistics and data sources for these variables.</p><h>Model specification</h><p>The outcome variables in our models capture the number of cooperation activities related to climate adaptation and mitigation, respectively, implying that they are count variables. We therefore opted for a model designed for count data, which is both skewed and discrete. To decide between Poisson, zero-inflated and negative binomial models, which are widely used for count data, we relied on several statistical tests. First, we plotted the distribution of the outcome variables to detect the frequency of zero-values in the data (see the Online appendix). The value of 0 was not over-represented, so we ruled out zero-inflated models. Next, we computed a likelihood-ratio test to decide between Poisson and negative binomial models. The results of the test suggested that the former was more appropriate for our data (detailed results are reported in the Online appendix).</p><p>In light of these considerations, we estimated a series of time-series cross-sectional population-average Poisson regression models with robust standard errors clustered at the panel level to account for the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (Wooldridge, 2002). A population-average model is preferred over a random-effects model because the number of events for countries are correlated \u2013 a few countries typically participate in cooperation events at the same time, which violates the independence assumptions inherent in random-effects models.</p><h>Results</h><p>The results reported in Table\u00a01 support <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis>. In Model 1 (Table\u00a01), the dependent variable is the extent of resources allocated in climate adaptation networks, whereas in Model 2 (Table\u00a01), the dependent variable is the extent of resources allocated in climate mitigation networks.</p><h>Table\u00a01.</h><p>Effects of interdependence, state capacity and vulnerability on climate cooperation.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Model 1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Model 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">DV: adaptation</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">DV: mitigation</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Interdependence (geographic distance in log km)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.530** (0.17)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.196** (0.07)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Energy interdependence</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.055 (0.10)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.177*** (0.05)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Trade interdependence (log)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.265 (0.15)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.055* (0.03)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Institutional capacity</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.281* (0.14)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.373*** (0.11)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Vulnerability (log)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.074 (0.29)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.568 (0.34)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">GDP per capita (log)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.247 (0.15)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.269*** (0.08)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Democracy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.000 (0.02)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.008 (0.01)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Eastern partnership region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22121.190*** (0.26)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.579*** (0.06)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.288*** (0.04)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.071 (0.06)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Constant</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u2212570.845*** (77.53)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u2212141.455 (125.20)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">N</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">70</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">70</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Note:</emphasis> Levels of statistical significance: * <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.05, ** <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.01, *** <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001. Unstandardized coefficients, with their robust standard errors in parentheses.</p><p>In both models, the coefficients of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">geographic distance</emphasis> are statistically significant in the expected direction, suggesting that the EU allocates more resources to climate networks in ENP countries that are geographically close to the EU. More precisely, on average, a 0.5% increase in the number of adaptation activities and a 0.2% increase in the number of mitigation activities in climate networks can be expected for every 1% decrease in geographic distance between the EU and the ENP country. Moreover, a 0.1% increase in the number of activities on mitigation is associated with every 1% increase in trade.</p><p>These results suggest that the EU allocates more resources in climate networks to countries where there are interdependencies stemming from geographic proximity and trade. This finding corroborates existing research emphasizing the importance of external dependencies in horizontal cooperation between the EU and third countries (Lavenex 2015; Lavenex et al., 2021; Shyrokykh, 2021a).</p><p>The findings also add to existing knowledge as we distinguish between different types of interdependencies. Thus, the effects of trade and energy interdependencies in Model 2 (Table\u00a01) are statistically significant, indicating that they are observed only in mitigation and not in adaptation networks. The positive effect of trade interdependence suggests that the EU is more likely to allocate resources to those countries with which it is more entangled in trade. The positive effects of trade interdependence on the allocation of resources in mitigation networks support <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b</emphasis>.</p><p>Additionally, the negative effect of energy interdependence in Model 2 (Table\u00a01) is a result worthy of discussion, as it suggests that the EU is less likely to allocate resources to those countries with which it has more intense energy cooperation. While counterintuitive at first, this finding aligns with existing research. Katsaris (2016) shows that mitigation networks tend to create antagonistic relations between the EU and neighbouring energy-exporting states. So, energy-exporting ENP countries are less likely to participate in mitigation networks as this might be at odds with their energy export policies. Future research could usefully examine the EU's climate cooperation with third countries in the presence of different energy relations.</p><p>Turning to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis>, the coefficient of institutional capacity is statistically significant and in the expected direction (Table\u00a01). This suggests that the EU establishes adaptation and mitigation cooperation with countries that have relatively low levels of institutional capacity. Holding other variables constant, for each one-unit decrease in institutional capacity (on a scale from \u22122.5 to 2.5), on average, countries receive 32% more adaptation activities and 45% more mitigation activities.8</p><p>Meanwhile, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2b</emphasis> is not confirmed \u2013 institutional capacity is negatively associated with resource allocation in both adaptation and mitigation networks. This result indicates that resources are allocated in climate networks to enhance the domestic institutional capacity of the ENP countries, which is line with network governance theory. Finally, the coefficients of vulnerability to climate risks are not statistically significant, which is not in line with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3b</emphasis>. In contrast to much of the network governance literature, these results suggest that not all EU climate policy networks are established to fulfil all three functions \u2013 manage interdependencies, enhance institutional capacity and address multijurisdictional challenges. In our view, the findings showcase the power of the EU as a network manager: the EU appears to allocate resources in climate networks to manage external dependencies with the ENP countries, while also assisting countries with lower institutional capacity.</p><p>Importantly, although we find <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cohesion</emphasis> in the way how the EU allocates resources in climate networks \u2013 both types of networks are allocated to address interdependencies and to improve partner states\u2019 institutional capacity \u2013 the results also indicate some degree of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fluidity</emphasis> in climate networks. Namely, the effects of the independent variables vary across the models with different dependent variables. The effects of interdependence as defined by geographic proximity are larger when we study resource allocation to adaptation compared to mitigation. Indeed, flawed adaptation could fail to prevent physical damage from extreme weather events to local areas. For example, if water dumps and related infrastructure in a neighbouring country are not climate-resilient, devastating cross-border effects can affect EU member states. In fact, adaptation is largely discussed in the contest of disaster risks and cross-border effects of climate change have been highlighted among other reasons to promote adaptation in neighbourhood countries (European Commission, 2009). Thus, the observed differences between cooperation on adaptation and mitigation further support our interpretation of the results as evidence for the EU's cohesive and strategic considerations and self-interest in climate networks in the ENP region.</p><p>Likewise, we detect differences in the effects of trade interdependence on resource allocation. The stronger trade interdependence, the more resources are allocated for climate change mitigation networks. These findings are in line with existing literature suggesting that more climate-related rules have to be followed by third countries the more advanced trade relations between the EU and third countries are (Shyrokykh, 2021b). These results underpin a common assumption made in network theory that policy networks are fluid and adaptive \u2013 in other words, they are established to address a particular structure of interdependencies. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that EU climate networks are both cohesive and fluid.</p><p>Finally, we wish to highlight that these results add to the existing literature as we examine adaptation and mitigation policy networks separately. Previous research has neither distinguished between climate and environmental cooperation, nor between mitigation and adaptation. Although more general assessments of EU-ENP cooperation on environmental and climate affairs have advanced understanding of the drivers of cooperation (Shyrokykh, 2021a), the issue areas of adaptation and mitigation, with their specific and distinct policy objectives and logics of cooperation, can be usefully distinguished.</p><h>Robustness checks</h><p>Before discussing the broader implications of these results, we document five robustness checks. First, we checked for the presence of endogeneity because institutional capacity could be affected by cooperation in earlier policy networks. We ran a two-stage least squares model that explicitly modelled institutional capacity as an outcome of earlier climate cooperation. We then performed a post-estimation test for endogeneity. The results suggest that state capacity is an exogenous variable.</p><p>Second, we checked the sensitivity of the results in models with additional control variables. To account for the fact that some countries might be more willing to establish cooperation with the EU in climate networks, we controlled for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EU membership aspirations</emphasis>. States that have more developed relations with the EU could be more likely to participate in policy networks, compared to states that are more reserved or even hostile towards the EU. Next, we controlled for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">level of political stability</emphasis> in countries, as unstable states might have limited ability to participate in, and be less likely to be invited to join, policy networks. To capture this possibility, we used the Political Stability and Violence Indicator (Kaufmann et al., 2010). As a result, institutional capacity loses its statistical significance, but this can be explained by the fact that the political stability index is moderately correlated with this variable (see the Online appendix).9</p><p>Third, we used an alternative operationalization of interdependencies generated by geographic proximity through a count variable expressing the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">number of shared borders</emphasis> with EU member states, ranging between 0 (no shared borders, e.g., in the case of the southern neighbours) and 4 (the number of shared borders between Ukraine and EU member states). When interdependence was operationalized through the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">number of shared borders</emphasis>, the effect of proximity loses its statistical significance. Thus, geographic distance seems to capture what shared borders do not. Actual distance rather than shared borders seems to define the EU's horizontal cooperation on climate. This makes sense as climate change is not limited by the physical borders of states \u2013 even localized climate risks can have cross-border impacts (cf. Benzie and Persson, 2019). Climate change is a transboundary policy challenge by nature \u2013 greenhouse gas emissions, loss of forests and the deteriorating effects of climate change do not depend on state boundaries, but rather distance. The negative effects of the degrading practices of neighbours can be felt more if the neighbour is close. Consequently, we interpret this finding in the sense that distance and shared borders capture different dimensions of interdependencies. Distance to the so-called centroid (Brussels) captures interdependence with the entire EU, while the variable of the number of shared borders captures interdependence with individual member states.</p><p>Lastly, we checked the results against models with time-fixed effects to account for the effects of potential time-specific exogenous shocks. The results of the robustness checks are documented in the Online appendix.</p><h>Discussion and conclusions</h><p>Horizontal cooperation that takes place in climate networks on adaptation and mitigation is a central hallmark of EU regional climate projects. This article has examined how the EU allocates resources to advance climate governance in the ENP region. To date, this remains an understudied topic of EU climate governance and Europeanization research. Thus, this study addresses an important limitation in earlier research and adds knowledge on the functions of adaptation and mitigation networks. The article makes three principal contributions.</p><p>First, we find that the EU's adaptation and mitigation networks in the ENP region serve the EU's interests in managing its external dependencies on the ENP countries. Our results suggest that the EU's policy networks might not just deal with \u201clow politics\u201d, as suggested in the existing literature (Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013). Climate networks appear to be at least partly \u201chigh politics\u201d, tackling external interdependencies and challenges arising from these interdependencies. These findings contribute to the network governance literature by showing that network managers can sometimes use policy networks for their strategic purposes.</p><p>Second, the results indicate that climate networks on adaptation and mitigation also serve to improve partner countries\u2019 institutional capacities. Using its power to decide on the scope of adaptation and mitigation policy networks, the EU tends to prioritize some cooperation foci and partners over others. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of the EU as a network manager driven by multiple motivations.</p><p>Third, our study is the first to examine the functions of adaptation and mitigation policy networks in EU regional climate projects separately, rather than focusing on climate or environmental policy networks in general, as done in previous research (B\u00f6rzel and Fagan, 2015; Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013; Shyrokykh, 2021b). We demonstrate that EU climate networks are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fluid</emphasis> in the sense that they allow for flexible resource allocation depending on context. Mitigation received more attention from the EU in the projects addressing a complex interdependence structure with the neighbours. Adaptation cooperation is more likely to target closely located countries, given the potentially devastating effects of insufficient adaptation or maladaptation (Schipper, 2020). We also show that EU network governance of climate change demonstrates <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cohesion</emphasis> across mitigation and adaptation cooperation, which helps the EU to pursue its policies.</p><p>To conclude, we sketch avenues for future research on the causes and consequences of EU external climate governance. To begin with, future research could examine EU climate governance in other geographic regions that are targeted by EU region-specific climate projects. Indeed, the regional approach to external climate governance is not limited to the ENP. For example, to help Latin American countries improve their climate governance, the EU has established two climate policy networks \u2013 EUROCLIMA and EUROCLIMA+. Similar networks address climate cooperation with the Western Balkan region.</p><p>Moreover, future research in European studies could explore the influence of EU external climate governance on third countries\u2019 climate legislation and climate practices. We still know little about the conditions under which the EU's external climate governance is likely to trigger change towards deep adaptation and decarbonization, and our study has indicated that the distinction between these issue areas is consequential.</p><p>Finally, our results from the context of the EU speak to broader issues related to climate policy networks. Climate policy networks, be they managed by international organizations or domestic authorities, remain an understudied tool in global governance. Our findings show how a network manager can navigate different issue areas in relation to the same policy networks, and under what conditions different priorities are likely to be made, with implications for policy outcomes. As climate risks pose pressing challenges, understanding how climate policy networks are governed becomes even more important.</p><h>Supplemental Material</h><h>sj-pdf-1-eup-10.1177_14651165231152836 - Supplemental material for Managing networks: Cohesion and fluidity in EU climate cooperation with European neighbours</h><p>Supplemental material, sj-pdf-1-eup-10.1177_14651165231152836 for Managing networks: Cohesion and fluidity in EU climate cooperation with European neighbours by Karina Shyrokykh, Lisa Dellmuth and Elisa Funk in European Union Politics</p><h>Supplemental Material</h><h>sj-do-2-eup-10.1177_14651165231152836 - Supplemental material for Managing networks: Cohesion and fluidity in EU climate cooperation with European neighbours</h><p>Supplemental material, sj-do-2-eup-10.1177_14651165231152836 for Managing networks: Cohesion and fluidity in EU climate cooperation with European neighbours by Karina Shyrokykh, Lisa Dellmuth and Elisa Funk in European Union Politics</p><h>Supplemental Material</h><h>sj-dta-3-eup-10.1177_14651165231152836 - Supplemental material for Managing networks: Cohesion and fluidity in EU climate cooperation with European neighbours</h><p>Supplemental material, sj-dta-3-eup-10.1177_14651165231152836 for Managing networks: Cohesion and fluidity in EU climate cooperation with European neighbours by Karina Shyrokykh, Lisa Dellmuth and Elisa Funk in European Union Politics</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><h>REFERENCES</h><p>Agranoff R, McGuire M,  (1999) Managing in network settings.

The investment will support further development of the e[datascientist](TM) 2 platform and will continue to drive expansion into global markets and the deepening of client impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The round is being led by abrdn plc, with continued participation from existing investors Environmental Technologies Fund, and a consortium of investors headed by Granpool Innovative Investments. The current funding round will remain open for a further period to enable additional participation up to a further USD 10 million.</p><p>Eagle Genomics continues to mature and expand as the leading TechBio company pioneering the application of network science to biological discovery and innovation, across the Food and Nutrition, AgBio, Beauty and Personal Care, and Biopharma industries. The e[datascientist] platform enables enterprise customers to trace digital journeys in data, driving transformative innovations, exploiting leading-edge scientific discovery in silico and supporting differentiated product claims.</p><p>Eagle Genomics' purpose is to accelerate the Bioeconomy through the digital reinvention of life sciences R&amp;D, and the Company is increasingly focussed on supporting its customers' aspirations as they address 'One Health' challenges towards more sustainable and impact-oriented innovation and product outcomes. The concept of 'One Health' recognises that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are intimately interconnected, and that the application of technologies to solve in one domain can inspire and enable advances in others. Addressing the 'One Health' opportunity requires a focus on, and a deep understanding of, microbiome3 and host-microbiome interactions as the common denominator across these domains.</p><p>Eagle Genomics is the pre-eminent platform business using next-generation graph technology and network science to drive the Bioeconomy. The business problem that the platform solves for its customers is to network their scientific data to support step-change innovation - e.g., understanding new key bio-active ingredients that could deliver health benefits, or targeting a particular health benefit and working backwards through data to identify key ingredients. The technical challenge that Eagle Genomics is solving is to bridge the 'translation gap,' so that scientific knowledge from a range of disparate sources and studies across industries can be applied to deliver robust, scientifically underpinned product claims.</p><p>Particular innovation journeys that enable differentiated products and product claims include:</p><p>Food and Nutrition : Personalised and functional nutrition; e.g., energy balance, feed efficiency, growth rate, botanicals, food as medicine, precision fermentation, alternative proteins and ingredient design and differentiation.</p><p>Beauty and Personal Care : Personalised/stratified cosmetics; e.g., skin, oral, scalp, pre/pro/postbiotics, ingredient manufacturing, cosmeceuticals, and genital health/personal hygiene products.</p><p>AgBio : Biofertilizers, microbiome engineering, bioavailability, crops (yield increase, protection, fertility, productivity, climate adaptation/change mitigation), soil treatment, and smart agriculture.</p><p>BioPharma : Microbiome therapeutics, anti-microbial resistance, personalised/stratified medicine, therapeutics for gastrointestinal and infectious diseases, immuno-oncology/autoimmune disease and metabolic health.</p><p>Anthony Finbow, CEO, Eagle Genomics, said:</p><p>\"We are the pre-eminent platform business using next-generation graph technology and network science to drive the Bioeconomy. We are seeking to support our enterprise customers as they strive to achieve more sustainable and impact-orientated innovation outcomes. The current scale-up funding will enable us to accelerate the Bioeconomy through the digital reinvention of science.\"</p><p>Alistair Watson, Head of Strategy Innovation - Private Equity, abrdn, stated:</p><p>\"We believe that Eagle Genomics is poised to support increasing numbers of large enterprise customers with digitising R&amp;D and product innovation activities. This investment will support Eagle Genomics' scale-up while driving further penetration into global markets. It is also pivotal for the wider Bioeconomy, as the importance of microbiome science increases and its applications become more widespread.\"</p><p>Rob Genieser, Environmental Technologies Fund, commented:</p><p>\"We are delighted to see Eagle Genomics continue to mature and scale. The timing could not be better, with the world's focus on disease and accelerated in silico innovation. At a time when there is an urgent requirement for systems change to support and protect the Biosphere, Eagle Genomics is helping drive sustainability and impact-focused business outcomes. We wish the team all the best in expanding its reach and deepening its capabilities.\"</p><p>Notes</p><p>1. Network science is the study of complex networks of physical, biological, and social phenomena, and can also be used to explain and deeply understand these phenomena.</p><p>2. The e[datascientist](TM) is powered by network science and multilayer hypergraphs, applying machine learning and AI to provide a data-driven insight journey into solving complex problems at scale. It integrates active learning at every step of the microbiome innovation journey, from 'descriptive' to 'predictive,' while identifying mechanisms of action. It has been gaining major traction with large household brands as they strive to demonstrate the link between their latest products, microbiome health, and 'One Health' related issues.</p><p>3. The microbiome, the ecosystem of bacteria, fungi and viruses present in virtually all living organisms, is directly linked with health and is proven to be affected by the products we use and consume.</p><p>Notes to Editors</p><p>About Eagle Genomics</p><p>Eagle Genomics is innovating at the intersection of biology, data sciences and bioinformatics, to accelerate the Bioeconomy through the digital reinvention of life sciences R&amp;D.

That was the highest level in half a century. Private and public debts increased fast in industrialised nations, emerging economies and developing countries, with loans being sourced domestically and abroad (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reckons that 60 % of low-income countries were heavily indebted in 2022. The comparative share for 2015 was only about 30 %.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It matters very much that, in many countries, debt services in relation to exports rose considerably. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, they increased from 16 % in 2019 to 22 % in 2020. The implication is that a greater share of exports revenues had to be used for debt servicing, reducing the scope of investments in sustainability-related matters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Large budgetary deficits</p><p>In many developing countries and emerging markets, the deficits in government budgets have skyrocketed. In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, according to the IMF, the deficit was -3.9 % in 2019, but -6.4 % in 2020. The figures were worse for oil-importing countries (-4.3 % in 2019 and -7.3 % in 2020) than for oil-exporting countries (-3.3 % and - 4.6 % respectively).</p><p>The deficits were incurred to cope with costs of the pandemic. At the same time, tax revenues decreased in many countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, taxation tends to be quite a bit lower than in high-income countries.</p><p>War in Ukraine</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February has made matters worse. It has led to yet higher debts and surges in inflation. Especially the increase in energy and food prices are a burden on national budgets and foreign trade balances. Commodity-importing countries are affected in particular.</p><p>Monetary policy has tightened in many high-income countries, causing interest rates to rise on international financial markets. Debt servicing is thus becoming more expensive. Heavy debts stand in the way of economic recovery and will have long-term impacts in business as well as social terms. It is also to be feared that investments to combat climate change will decline.</p><p>Ways out of debt</p><p>To manage debt crises, the countries concerned need reforms as well as external support. Their fiscal power is too small. The international community created new policy instruments during the pandemic and should now make full use of them. The Group of 20 major industrialised and emerging economies (G20) has adopted two instruments of relevance to developing countries.</p><p>The Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) is a debt moratorium for low-income countries to solve short-term liquidity problems. During the moratorium period from May 2020 to December 2021, it has been used by 48 of the 73 eligible countries.</p><p>The Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond DSSI is designed to restructure and - if necessary - even forgive debts accrued by low-income countries. The idea is to prevent both sovereign defaults and long-lasting payment difficulties. So far, however, only three countries have taken part: Chad, Zambia and Ethiopia (see a previous contribution of mine on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Implementation has been delayed mainly due to coordination difficulties among creditors (Georgieva, K./C. Pazarbasioglu, 2021). Involving all private and public creditors would help. Moreover, transparency regarding loan conditions is needed. Otherwise, equal treatment of creditors cannot be ensured. It would make sense to expand the Common Framework beyond low-income countries, given that middle-income countries are struggling too. Moreover, an insolvency procedure for sovereign states is necessary.</p><p>In the longer run, it would be good to draft and adopt codes of conduct for responsible lending and borrowing. The international community should support related initiatives. Relevant institutions, such as the G20, the UN, the OECD and the Institute of International Finance have drafted such codes and are enforcing them to some extent. To avoid divergence, these codes should be acknowledged and harmonised internationally (Berensmann 2022).</p><p>Build back better</p><p>The pandemic proved that our societies are susceptible to shocks. At the same time, we now have the opportunity to build back better in ways that boost future resilience. Current financial crises should be seen as opportunities to restructure debts with an eye to promoting sustainable development (Volz et al. 2021).</p><p>The implication is that the Common Framework should be linked to investments in climate action. Debt relief and debt restructuring should be geared to achieving the sustainable development goals of the UN's 2030 agenda as well as fulfilling the aspirations of the Paris Climate Agreement. In a similar sense, the toolkit of multilateral development banks should serve these purposes too (Berensmann et al. 2022).</p><p>Global heating is causing financial harm. Therefore, debt sustainability assessments must take climate-related risks into account. Investments in climate adaptation should count too, since they reduce climate risks. The IMF is currently working on proposals concerning how to mainstream climate issues in fiscal policy (Massetti / Bellon 2022).</p><p>Tax reforms</p><p>Developing countries, however, must mobilise more domestic resources and become less dependent on foreign debt. Raising more tax revenues is absolutely essential. Both tax administration and tax policy should improve. To broaden the tax base, tax systems must become more transparent, more efficient and more effective. The informal sector should not remain beyond taxation. Technical assistance from high-income countries should prove useful, especially in regard to the digitalisation of national revenue services.</p><p>The internationals tax system must improve too. That is essential for stemming illicit financial flows, tax evasion and tax avoidance. The African Union Commission reckons that illicit financial flows annually deprive African governments of some $ 50 billion to $ 80 billion (AU Commission, 2019). These estimates are by definition difficult, but the figures are definitely huge.</p><p>Two important initiatives are:</p><p>The establishment of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes</p><p>The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).</p><p>The Global Forum is the most important international institution for fighting tax evasion and tax avoidance. It is enhancing transparency in the international tax system and currently has 165 members. Its secretariat is hosted by the OECD. The Inclusive Framework on BEPS is designed to fight tax evasion, boost the coherence of international tax rules, increase the transparency of tax systems and support taxes on digital businesses (von Haldenwang / Laudage 2019). Donors should increase the technical assistance they offer developing countries in this field.</p><p>The developing countries, in turn, must improve their debt management and use their fiscal means more efficiently. Important dimensions include balancing foreign and domestic debts carefully as well as paying appropriate attention to both interest rates and the duration of loans. Good debt management also leads to greater transparency and can drive the growth of domestic bond markets. Such markets can provide a good source of income for developing countries.</p><p>References</p><p>AU Commission, 2019: Domestic resource mobilization: Fighting against corruption and illicit financial flows.

Similar things are happening in other parts of Europe.</p><p>Nevertheless, the EU states assure that they want to meet the European Union's climate protection target, i.e. reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990.</p><p>Ahead of the UN's COP27 Climate Change Conference, which takes place in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6, the European Parliament calls for more leadership in mitigating climate change.</p><p>The EU must show leadership and increase its 2030 emission reduction targets, stated a resolution adopted by the parliament in October.</p><p>The parliament called on industrialized countries to increase their climate protection targets, saying that Russia's war against Ukraine and its consequences made it all the more urgent to transform the global energy system.</p><p>In addition, EU\u00a0lawmakers requested that the developed countries must keep their promise and ensure that the developing countries receive $100 billion in funding each year for climate protection.</p><p>German state secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Action, Jennifer Morgan, called on the EU to take the leading role at the international conference: \"The EU must lead the way in accelerating the energy transition in solidarity with weaker nations.\"</p><p>She added that it was also important to keep financial commitments to developing nations and to support countries particularly affected by climate change through a solidarity pact. Germany will double its international funding commitments for environmental protection to (EURO)1.5 billion ($1.49 billion) per year by 2025 at the latest.</p><p>EU PLEDGES MORE THAN (EURO)23 BILLION IN CLIMATE FINANCE TO THE GLOBAL SOUTH</p><p>On October 28, the Council of the EU announced that the European Union and its 27 member states have pledged (EURO)23.04 billion in climate finance to the Global South.</p><p>The funding from public sources aims \"to support developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change,\" a press release read.</p><p>Of those funds, 54% were either earmarked for climate adaptation or for measures tackling both adaptation and climate change mitigation, the statement read, citing European Commission figures.</p><p>Almost half of the total amount was pledged in the form of grants. International public climate finance aims to support countries of the Global South in implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p><p>SLOVENIA ONE OF THE FASTEST WARMING COUNTRIES</p><p>The targets of the Paris Agreement are increasingly at risk. Slovenia is one of the fastest warming countries. Experts from the Ljubljana Faculty of Mathematics and Physics have calculated that the country already exceeded the two-degree warming limit back in 2020.</p><p>They warned that if only moderate action was taken, average temperatures in Slovenia could increase by almost five degrees Celsius by the end of the century.</p><p>Environment Minister Uros Brezan sees great potential in solar energy. There is also a debate on the potential construction of a second unit at the Krsko nuclear power station. The life span of the plant's first unit is to be extended to 2043.</p><p>Next year, Slovenia is expected to adopt a climate change law, which is to introduce a climate council, a body bringing together experts, political players and NGOs in a bid to find the most suitable measures to mitigate climate change.</p><p>The country expects the COP27 Climate Conference to focus on issues concerning the developing countries. Environment Minister Brezan, who will attend the conference in Sharm El Sheikh, said the issue of financing will always arise in the relationship between developed and developing countries.</p><p>The promise that developing countries would receive $100 billion in climate aid a year had not been kept. \"I believe we can make progress there. Slovenia, as a developed country, is committed to making a greater effort,\" Brezan said.</p><p>SERBIA'S CLIMATE PROMISE</p><p>Serbia has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33.3% 2030 and announced that by the end of this year, the country will publish the first National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change in Serbia.</p><p>The country aims to abandon fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources, as well as switching to a circular economy model and reducing waste.</p><p>The EU delegation in Serbia welcomed the country's increased climate ambition and called for the adoption of long-term strategies for climate neutrality by 2050.</p><p>The head of the EU delegation in Serbia, Emanuele Giaufret, said that \"the EU will provide direct budget support in the amount of (EURO)165 million to mitigate the energy crisis. In parallel, the EU supports Serbia in increasing the energy efficiency of public and private facilities and the share of renewable energy sources.\"</p><p>Ahead of the COP27, the Digital Climate Atlas of Serbia was presented in Belgrade. The online platform is based on meteorological and geospatial data, providing insights into current and future climate changes for all of Serbia.</p><p>BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA'S DEPENDENCE ON THERMAL POWER PLANTS</p><p>Serbia's neighbour Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the UN Convention on Climate Change in December 2000. However, for its electricity supply, Bosnia is still dependent on thermal power plants, which are major polluters.</p><p>Authorities in the country have approved the continued operation of two thermal power plants, one in Tuzla and the other in Kakanj, whose service life has expired. This is to maintain stability in electricity production.</p><p>Bosnian authorities had previously pledged that these plants would not operate for more than 20,000 hours after January 1, 2018.</p><p>The Energy Community (EC), an international organization of the EU and several third states, initiated proceedings against Bosnia for violating the regulations.</p><p>The EC states that pollution protection systems have not been modernized as required and that the continued operation of the two thermal power plants violates the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive as well as Bosnia's own national plan for the reduction of harmful gas emissions.</p><p>The EC has to ensure that signatory states commit themselves to liberalizing their energy markets according to the requirements of the acquis and the EU Treaty.</p><p>According to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Bosnia generated 42.3% of its total energy from renewable sources in 2021.</p><p>EUROPE ONE OF THE FASTEST-HEATING REGIONS IN THE WORLD DESPITE PROGRESS IN EMISSION REDUCTION</p><p>Meanwhile, according to a joint report by the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service, temperatures in Europe have increased by more than twice the global average over the past three decades, making it the fastest-warming of all continents.</p><p>However, according to preliminary figures, emissions from the 27 EU states fell by 32% between 1990 and 2020, which means that the climate target of a 20% reduction by 2020 was clearly achieved, states a report published by the European Environment Agency on October 26.</p><p>The experts at the Copenhagen-based EU agency wrote that the annual progress would have to more than double on the way towards meeting the more ambitious climate and energy targets for 2030.</p><p>Emissions would have to decrease by an average of 134 million tons of CO2 per year, or 4%, to meet the target of reducing emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990.</p><p>For WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, \"Europe presents a vivid picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from the effects of extreme weather events.\"</p><p>But the WMO also notes that it's not all bad news: \"Europe can play a key role in achieving a carbon-neutral society by mid-century to meet the Paris Agreement,\" Taalas said.</p><p>For Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, \"European society is vulnerable to climate variability and climate change, but Europe is also at the forefront of international efforts to mitigate climate change and develop innovative solutions to adapt to the new climate that Europeans will have to live with.\"</p><p>The content of this article is based on reporting by AFP, ANSA, dpa, FENA, Tanjug and STA as part of the European Newsroom (enr) project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>Editorial contactsEditing by: Helen Maguire, &lt;<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:international@dpa.com\">international@dpa.com</email>;</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPA-22110499388461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66SN-BGS1-JB0G-F54S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144245</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1454\"/><timeReceived>4:46 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Deutsche Presse-Agentur All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa international (Englischer Dienst)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37152\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 4, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The policy brief was prepared by the Global Center on Adaptation and African Adaptation Initiative and outlines a plan of action for African countries to ensure stimulus spending is used to build back better from the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The policy brief recommends adaptation actions for three key systems affected by both the pandemic and climate change in Africa: systems that produce our food; protect and manage our water and plan and build our infrastructure. Specifically, the recommendations include adaptation actions to secure the food supply for vulnerable populations and strengthen the agricultural value chain; increase access to water and sanitation in parallel with efforts to improve water governance; and investment in resilient infrastructure to create jobs. These recommendations result in a triple dividend for African countries: reduced pandemic risk, increased climate resilience and strengthened economic recovery.</p><p>Commenting on the brief's release, Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon and African Union Champion of the African Adaptation Initiative said:</p><p>\"The real impact of the coronavirus crisis on climate will ultimately depend on the choices we make in how we recover. Meeting the Paris Agreement's goals for mitigation and adaptation must be central to this effort to ensure we reduce the likelihood of future pandemics.\"</p><p>Ban Ki-moon, 8th United Nations Secretary General and Co-Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation said:</p><p>\"If the virus is a shared global challenge, so too should be the need to build resilience against future shocks. Emerging and developing countries are the least prepared for the arrival of COVID-19, just as they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\"</p><p>Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation said:</p><p>\"Previous epidemic outbreaks have provided us with vital lessons, local knowledge and expertise that is also relevant in helping us to find innovative ways to address our climate crisis.\"</p><p>Other global leaders also endorsed the policy brief recommendations:</p><p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund said:</p><p>\"The world is about to deploy enormous, gigantic fiscal stimulus and we can do it in a way that we tackle both crises at the same time. If our world is to come out of this crisis more resilient, we must do everything in our power to make it a green recovery.\"</p><p>Feike Sijbesma, Honorary Chairman of Royal DSM and Co-Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation said:</p><p>\"The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the critical role of initiatives like Africa Improved Foods to ensure we can guarantee Africa's food security while adapting to the impacts of climate change.\"</p><p>Peter Eriksson, Minister of International Development for Sweden said:</p><p>\"For Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has collided with our climate emergency. We must ensure we integrate solutions to both crises into a coherent response in support of African countries. This can be achieved through intensifying climate adaptation efforts through the Global Center on Adaptation. The GCA is a key solutions broker and center of excellence with a holistic approach, that aims to accelerate adaptation solutions for a climate resilient future in Africa.\".</p><p>Dag-Inge Ulstein, Minister of International Development for Norway said:</p><p>\"The COVID-19 crisis is creating an even greater need for international cooperation. Using the stimulus spending to assist poorer countries in addressing the impacts of our climate crisis is not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do as we continue to work in close collaboration with the Global Center on Adaptation in building climate and pandemic resilience in Africa.\"</p><p>Akinwui Adesina, President of the African Development Bank said:</p><p>\"The combination of COVID-19 pandemic and the massive invasion of desert locusts in parts of Africa present a twin challenge for health and food security for millions of people, and exacerbates Africa's vulnerabilities and development challenges. It is time to devote more resources to Africa to expand its fiscal space to secure lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and for safeguarding the environment, on which all lives today and the future depend, by enhancing climate adaptation.\"</p><p>About the Global Center on Adaptation</p><p>Please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gca.org/about\">http://www.gca.org/about</url></p><p>About the African Adaptation Initiative</p><p>Please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://africaadaptationinitiative.org/#about2\">https://africaadaptationinitiative.org/#about2</url></p><p>Logo - <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1044191/GCA_Logo.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1044191/GCA_Logo.jpg</url> Logo -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171710/African_Adaptation_Initiative_Logo.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171710/African_Adaptation_Initiative_Logo.jpg</url> PDF -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171711/The_Global_Center_on_Adaptation.pdf\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171711/The_Global_Center_on_Adaptation.pdf</url></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Additional content: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presseportal.de/pm/135145/4603002\">https://www.presseportal.de/pm/135145/4603002</url><br/> OTS:                The Global Center on Adaptation<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAEN-8RBD3P0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYH-JSD1-JCSW-K0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222519</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><timeReceived>2:00 AM CET</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 <br/><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41326\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo>News aktuell GmbH - Ein Unternehmen der dpa-Gruppe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>OTS Deutschland (Englisch)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41325\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 22, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But a lack of expertise on the ground has also stalled crucial adaptation projects.From cyclones in the south, to floods and drought in the east: Climate change is already leaving its mark on the African continent. Although Africa accounts for the world's smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 just 3.8% \u2014 it's paying a severe price for a crisis it did little to help create. </p><p><br/>Many experts acknowledge that climate finance is crucial for Africa to be able to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change. Over a decade ago, wealthy nations pledged $100 billion (\u20ac91 billion) a year to developing nations by 2020 for this very purpose. <br/>Now \u2014 two years past the deadline \u2014 developed countries estimate they won't fulfill this pledge until 2023. And they're under increasing pressure to make good on their promise. <br/>\"We need to understand that Africa is warming faster than the entire globe,\" Richard Munang, the Africa climate change coordinator at the UN Environment Program (UNEP) told DW. <br/>\"The challenges of food insecurity and the socio-economic challenges that we are facing will only continue and put Africa in a very precarious situation. What is needed now is adaptation that drives resilience of communities.\" <br/>Needs continue to mount <br/>With Africa's share of the world's population expected to grow from 17% to 40% by 2100, the clock is ticking on climate adaptation projects. The continent is also struggling to maintain its momentum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 which were adopted by all UN member states in 2015 in a bid to end poverty and increase climate resilience by 2030 \u2014 as well as its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). <br/>\"Africa today needs $2 trillion to implement the NDCs,\" explains Munang. \"And on top of this, the continent needs $1.2 trillion to implement the SDGs. It is therefore imperative that support for Africa to [implement] climate resilience happens.\" <br/>Munang points to recent natural disasters as evidence that the global community needs to act on their pledge as soon as possible. <br/>\"You see mothers going hungry, crop failure, floods, drought and the displacement of people These realities are only going to increase under the changing climate. <br/>Project expertise missing <br/>But this narrative only partly explains Africa's dilemma. While some funds intended for climate change mitigation projects have made their way to the continent, it often unclear exactly how they are being used \u2014 or how they can be accessed in the first place. <br/>Adeline Tengem, a Cameroonian forestry technician and NGO leader, says she has tried to access climate financing several times without success. <br/>\"Our idea is to restore the degraded landscape while improving the livelihoods of local communities surrounding those landscapes,\" she told DW. \"So far, we have been struggling to access funding to carry out these kinds of projects. Each time I submit projects, they would reject it because [they said] it was of low quality.\" <br/>Tengem isn't alone in her struggle. Peter Gondo from the United Nations Forum on Forests says difficulty accessing climate financing is a recognized problem across the continent. He says it often comes down to a lack of expertise in formulating project proposals that meet the requirements of climate finance sources. <br/>\"[Applicants need] to demonstrate how the projects that they want funded contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation,\" he explains. \"This requires a lot of detailed, accurate data to estimate how much you are going to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if you implement the project. Many countries do not have enough experts with adequate skills to do that.\" <br/>Training for a better future <br/>To try and get more climate projects off the ground, the African Forest Forum has partnered with the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network (GFFFN). Together, they organize training sessions for forest stakeholders from the public sector and NGOs on \"climate finance and writing bankable projects.\" <br/>Tengem took part in a workshop in Douala, where she learned not only what kind of funding opportunities are available to her, but how to draft projects that meet funding requirements. She says she's now more confident in submitting her future proposals. <br/>\"I have learnt the mechanism that will take me from problem to solution, which is what the [financing] partners want.\" <br/>Ultimately, the initiative aims to help ensure that Africa will gain easier access to existing and future international climate finance. Sector stakeholders say with both adequate financing and expertise, Africa should on the path towards a low emission and climate resilient future. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

On the one hand, they are especially vulnerable to climate risks such as extreme weather events which are becoming more frequent and more intense. On the other hand, measures to mitigate climate change can put these communities at a disadvantage, further adding to their marginalisation. Social-protection systems make it easier to tackle both problems. Accordingly, they should be established and extended everywhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The term 'social protection' covers a range of policy instruments, including unconditional safety-net payments,cash transfers depending on conditions such as a poor family's children attending school,income-generating employment schemes,government-sponsored health insurance andpublic pensions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The instruments have in common that they support individual persons and families. They can end extreme poverty - and prevent it from childhood to old age.</p><p>A core function of social-protection schemes is to boost peoples' resilience to shocks shocks (see Markus Loewe on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). That includes individual shocks, such as an illness or job loss, as well as collective shocks, such as a drought or flooding. Experts speak of 'adaptive' social protection when schemes are designed to respond fast to collective shocks by adjusting modalities and scaling support. In the event of a collective shock, affected people who already receive benefits can temporarily get extra support. Moreover, coverage should be expanded to additional people who now qualify for support. An adaptive system does so in a far-reaching, fast and flexible manner. Ideally, the system will anticipate collective shocks and provide additional support even before they hit, boosting vulnerable peoples resilience and preventing the shock from triggering a full-blown crisis (regarding social-protection and refugees, see Maren Suchta-Platzmann and Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Schmitz on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>The adaptiveness of a social-protection system hinges on several factors, including:</p><p>data and information-processing systems that facilitate the identification of vulnerable people and link that information to risk assessments,</p><p>robust delivery infrastructure, including for digital payments, so people are reached reliably,</p><p>financial buffers to allow urgently needed money to be disbursed fast,</p><p>financial buffers for reserves lined up for rapid disbursement.</p><p>One example is the multilateral 'Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program' (SASPP). It is run by the World Bank. Germany is its most important donor. The SASPP is being implemented in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Chad. The idea is to gradually develop the countries' nascent social-protection programmes into comprehensive and adaptive systems.</p><p>The SASPP focuses on preventing drought-induced food crises. Due to its adaptive nature, it nonetheless proved useful during the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than 4.6 million people in the Sahel region receiving additional cash transfers by September 2021.</p><p>It is possible to combine basic social-protection schemes with measures that help people to adapt to climate change, for example by diversifying economic activities. Experts speak of 'economic inclusion'. The Partnership for Economic Inclusion is a global network which is coordinated by the World Bank and promotes such approaches, for example in Niger in the context of the SASPP.</p><p>Moreover, strong social-protection systems can reduce the need for humanitarian relief in times of crisis. An increasing number of developing countries are buying sovereign climate-risk insurance. It en\u00adtitles them to financial payouts, for example, should they be hit by severe drought. So far, the insurance payouts are mainly channelled through the humanitarian system to people in need. Yet, efforts are underway to use the national social-protection systems instead.</p><p>Lessons from the pandemic</p><p>In response to Covid-19, almost every country adopted some social-protection measures to cushion the socio-economic impacts (World Bank 2020). Without them, even more people would have fallen deeper into poverty (UNDP 2021). In this sense, the pandemic proved that social protection does indeed mitigate the impacts of collective shocks.</p><p>However, dramatic disparities between nations became strikingly evident. Where strong social-protection systems were in place, governments could respond to this major crisis comparatively well. Where the need is greatest, by contrast, such systems are often still in their infancy or do not exist at all. Of the world population, 53 % are not covered by social-protection systems. In Africa, the rate is even higher: 83 %. Many programmes are quite slow, moreover, and more funding is needed too.</p><p>These things have implications for tackling the climate crisis. Where the vulnerability to climate impacts is great, social-protection systems must improve fast. That is a core message of the Global Risk Report 2021, which was published by Bndnis \u00adEntwicklung Hilft, an alliance of Germany development and relief agencies (see Monika Hellstern on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Setting up social-protection systems is a long-term but worthwhile effort, as the Cambodian example shows. German agencies, including the GIZ, have been cooperating with the national government for more than ten years on developing mechanisms to identify poor households and creating the poverty registry IDPoor. During the pandemic, an additional 50,000 people could be registered within ten days in May 2020. So far, IDPoor has facilitated timely cash transfers to more than 2 million people.</p><p>Social justice and climate protection</p><p>In view of the climate crisis, we must make our societies and economies climate neutral. The core principle of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which the UN adopted in 2015, is to leave no one behind. However, some mitigation policies create or exacerbate social disparities, for example when jobs are lost in fossil industries or when prices of vital goods rise.</p><p>This is not only problematic from a social justice perspective. It also threatens the political viability of ambitious climate action. When they affect large sections of the population without compensation, protests may arise that may thwart implementation. In settings of this kind, adaptive social-protection systems have a stabilising and compensatory function. This is how social protection can facilitate a just transition to climate neutrality.</p><p>So far, however, there are only few examples of policymakers intentionally using social-protection schemes to make more ambitious climate action politically viable. In practice, such schemes have mostly served to cushion job losses, for example when coal mines are closed.</p><p>That said, some social-protection instruments are intentionally used in the context of climate mitigation. So-called 'payments for ecosystem services' programmes offer financial rewards either for verifiable eco-friendly action or for refraining from harmful practices such as unsustainable logging. To a growing extent, moreover, public works programmes are geared to green goals. Prominent examples include India's MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme.</p><p>The experience of the pandemic has proved once more just how important adaptive social-protection systems are for societies to cope with collective shocks. In view of escalating climate risks, such systems are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it is high time to work together across sectors at all levels to strengthen these systems and close coverage gaps. This requires concerted efforts at the nexus of social protection, humanitarian assistance, climate adaptation, climate-risk finance and disaster-risk management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0906202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65N2-03R1-JCH9-G0YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1298\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 9, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;
