Experts suggest the problem is set to get worse.Protima Rai still remembers the aftermath of tropical Cyclone Bulbul that struck the Sundarbans in 2019 leaving behind a trail of destruction and lost lives.The cyclone that had formed in the Bay of Bengal forced Rai, 27, and hundreds of other families from to migrate from their village to safer areas.Climate change forces people to move onThe fields were not fit for cultivation. Rising sea levels and increasing salinity deprived the people living in the core Sundarbans areas of their main sources of livelihood - which is agriculture and fishing, Rai told DW.Substantial migration from the Sundarbans still continues on a permanent, seasonal and temporary basis. According to the Rural Household Survey, over 25% of the principal earners of individual families migrated temporarily searching for work.The Sundarbans is a cluster of low-lying islands in the Bay of Bengal, spread across India and Bangladesh, famous for its unique mangrove forests. </p><p>The Indian Sundarbans has 104 islands in total, of which 54 are inhabited by humans.Environmentalists point out that coastal erosion and rising sea levels are gradually eating away at the land in the Sundarbans. Many people from the villages are being forced to migrate to cities, like Kolkata, because their fertile land is turning saline with an increasing number of storms and floods.No political plan to helpThere is no structured policy or action plan from the administration to provide social protection in countering climate change and related migration, Jayanta Basu, a Kolkata-based environment and climate expert, told DW.The eastern state of Odisha is also an important source of migrant workers, and climate change plays an important role in increasing vulnerabilities, pushing people in search of work.Over the years, the Chilika Lake, the largest brackish water lagoon in the state and an important bird area, has been exposed to changing environmental conditions, impacting the livelihoods of the local people.Employment options are limited after extreme weather events hit Mangalajodi town on the northern banks of the lake. Many have decided to move out permanently, Sugyan Behera, who works in the tourism industry, told DW.The town has a population of 10,000 people, mostly engaged in work around the wetlands.Climate migration is often influenced by extreme events - such as storms, floods, and droughts - or slow-onset events - like sea levels rising or saline water intrusion into agricultural land.A report published in December 2020 by ActionAid and Climate Action Network South Asia showed that even if the global community acts on their greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation pledges and targets, about 37.5 million people will still be displaced by 2030 and an estimated 62.9 million by 2050, across five South Asian countries - Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Highest number of displacementsIndia alone will see 45 million people being forced to migrate from their homes by 2050 due to climate disasters - three times the current number number of people on the move as a result of extreme weather events.According to the State of India&amp;#39;s Environment-2022 report, India is the fourth worst-hit country in the world when it comes to climate change-induced migration, with more than three million people forced to leave their homes in 2020-2021.The highest number of migrations took place in China with more than 5 million people driven out of their homes due to weather-related disasters.Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), points out that given the impacts of the climate crisis, it is essential to invest in building local climate resilience and protecting economies.In an extensive study across 15 states, CSE found that wherever such an investment had been made, it brought benefits to villages while stemming migration. In fact, in villages where water harvesting was organized and ecological resources were used for the benefit of locals, reverse migration started.Narain referred specifically to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), a social security measure that aims for rural folk to safeguard their &amp;#39;right to work.&amp;#39;You can change the future. It does not have to be a story of climate distress driving migration. The value of MGNREGA and such schemes is to invest in ecological infrastructure that bolsters local livelihoods and community resilience, crucial in the era of climate change, Narain told DW.Abinash Mohanty, sector head of climate change and sustainability at IPE Global, an international development organization, also maintained that India needs to map the sectoral impacts through hyper-granular risk assessments to restrict climate cataclysm, in particular the issue of climate-induced migration.Climate-induced migration not taken seriously enoughLimiting migration calls for conducive policies and action plans, especially that can climate-proof climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture and tourism, among others. While India has a robust climate action plan both at the national and sub-national level, it hardly encompasses climate-induced migration as a pivotal issue, Mohanty told DW.India records some of the highest numbers of displacements in the world every year, the vast majority of them triggered by disasters.According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in India there are currently about 14 million people who have been displaced due to climate change.Though migrants receive immediate support in terms of relief and rehabilitation in the aftermath of these disasters, there is little long-term institutional support for their needs.A 2021 study, &amp;#39;Climate induced displacement and migration in India&amp;#39; found that people are migrating to escape poverty because of collapse of traditional livelihoods and the dismal infrastructure that is failing due to climate change.In the hilly districts of Uttarakhand, erratic rainfall patterns and a receding water table has forced people to abandon their homes and farms to migrate to the plains. In Saharsa district of northern Bihar, a relocated community continues to be overwhelmed by incessant floods.Inter-state and intra-state (rural-urban) migration due to drought, floods and other extreme events have been taking place in the country for a long time and it is widely acknowledged that nature of this migration has changed due to increasing frequency of climate induced extremes, Chandra Bhushan, founder of International Forum for Environment, Sustainability &amp; Technology, told DW.While states have started to seriously look the issues of migrants since COVID 19, there are no separate policy or initiatives for climate induced migration, added Bhushan.Edited by: John Silk </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/india-migration-from-climate-change-getting-worse/a-65369043?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988168193146664625876100216</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6823-8FX1-F03R-N2SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1164\"/><timeReceived>7:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

But a lack of expertise on the ground has also stalled crucial adaptation projects.From cyclones in the south, to floods and drought in the east: Climate change is already leaving its mark on the African continent. Although Africa accounts for the world's smallest share of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 just 3.8% \u2014 it's paying a severe price for a crisis it did little to help create. </p><p><br/>Many experts acknowledge that climate finance is crucial for Africa to be able to adapt to the growing impacts of climate change. Over a decade ago, wealthy nations pledged $100 billion (\u20ac91 billion) a year to developing nations by 2020 for this very purpose. <br/>Now \u2014 two years past the deadline \u2014 developed countries estimate they won't fulfill this pledge until 2023. And they're under increasing pressure to make good on their promise. <br/>\"We need to understand that Africa is warming faster than the entire globe,\" Richard Munang, the Africa climate change coordinator at the UN Environment Program (UNEP) told DW. <br/>\"The challenges of food insecurity and the socio-economic challenges that we are facing will only continue and put Africa in a very precarious situation. What is needed now is adaptation that drives resilience of communities.\" <br/>Needs continue to mount <br/>With Africa's share of the world's population expected to grow from 17% to 40% by 2100, the clock is ticking on climate adaptation projects. The continent is also struggling to maintain its momentum on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \u2014 which were adopted by all UN member states in 2015 in a bid to end poverty and increase climate resilience by 2030 \u2014 as well as its own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). <br/>\"Africa today needs $2 trillion to implement the NDCs,\" explains Munang. \"And on top of this, the continent needs $1.2 trillion to implement the SDGs. It is therefore imperative that support for Africa to [implement] climate resilience happens.\" <br/>Munang points to recent natural disasters as evidence that the global community needs to act on their pledge as soon as possible. <br/>\"You see mothers going hungry, crop failure, floods, drought and the displacement of people These realities are only going to increase under the changing climate. <br/>Project expertise missing <br/>But this narrative only partly explains Africa's dilemma. While some funds intended for climate change mitigation projects have made their way to the continent, it often unclear exactly how they are being used \u2014 or how they can be accessed in the first place. <br/>Adeline Tengem, a Cameroonian forestry technician and NGO leader, says she has tried to access climate financing several times without success. <br/>\"Our idea is to restore the degraded landscape while improving the livelihoods of local communities surrounding those landscapes,\" she told DW. \"So far, we have been struggling to access funding to carry out these kinds of projects. Each time I submit projects, they would reject it because [they said] it was of low quality.\" <br/>Tengem isn't alone in her struggle. Peter Gondo from the United Nations Forum on Forests says difficulty accessing climate financing is a recognized problem across the continent. He says it often comes down to a lack of expertise in formulating project proposals that meet the requirements of climate finance sources. <br/>\"[Applicants need] to demonstrate how the projects that they want funded contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation,\" he explains. \"This requires a lot of detailed, accurate data to estimate how much you are going to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if you implement the project. Many countries do not have enough experts with adequate skills to do that.\" <br/>Training for a better future <br/>To try and get more climate projects off the ground, the African Forest Forum has partnered with the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network (GFFFN). Together, they organize training sessions for forest stakeholders from the public sector and NGOs on \"climate finance and writing bankable projects.\" <br/>Tengem took part in a workshop in Douala, where she learned not only what kind of funding opportunities are available to her, but how to draft projects that meet funding requirements. She says she's now more confident in submitting her future proposals. <br/>\"I have learnt the mechanism that will take me from problem to solution, which is what the [financing] partners want.\" <br/>Ultimately, the initiative aims to help ensure that Africa will gain easier access to existing and future international climate finance. Sector stakeholders say with both adequate financing and expertise, Africa should on the path towards a low emission and climate resilient future. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection ? at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact ? are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent?s poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended. The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork ?for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.? Though summit attendees didn?t arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars: Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties, especially the most indebted countries.  Foster private sector development in low-income countries.  Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition in emerging and developing countries.  Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate change. The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It?s no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It?s not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it?s become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal. And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it ? and welcome it. It?s the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects. Valid Finance Concerns?Up to a Point To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation?s capital city. Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis. When Mottley ? an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas. Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank?s biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank?s then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass? leadership, the World Bank did too little to ?align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts? ? while it continues to fund oil and gas projects). Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world?s economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to ?mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.? And, again, that?s an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa?s gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa. To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that?s not what we?re seeing. Look at Afrieximbank?s Excellent Example In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa?s important domestic banks. For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to ?invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,? and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine ?our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.? As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies. Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that? At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in ?revitalizing Africa?s climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.? To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables. This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa?s economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What?s more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa?s much-needed industrialization, we all know that?s not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now. All of this requires money. As I?ve written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won?t work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN?s sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept. \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said. The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection - at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact - are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent's poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended.  The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork \"for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.\" Though summit attendees didn't arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars:    * Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties,     especially the most indebted countries.    * Foster private sector development in low-income countries.    * Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition     in emerging and developing countries.    * Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate     change.  The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It's no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It's not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it's become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal.  And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it - and welcome it.  It's the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects.  Valid Finance Concerns-Up to a Point  To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation's capital city.  Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis.  When Mottley - an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)- floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas.  Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank's biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank's then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass' leadership, the World Bank did too little to \"align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts\" - while it continues to fund oil and gas projects).  Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world's economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments.  The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to \"mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.\"  And, again, that's an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa's gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa.  To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that's not what we're seeing.  Look at Afrieximbank's Excellent Example  In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa's important domestic banks.  For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to \"invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,\" and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine \"our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.\"  As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies.  Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that?  At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in \"revitalizing Africa's climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.\"  To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables.  This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas  Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa's economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What's more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa's much-needed industrialization, we all know that's not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now.  All of this requires money.  As I've written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won't work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN's sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept.  \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said.  The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Billions of dollars worth of rice, sugar and wheat have already been lost.Flooding in dozens of districts in Pakistan's Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab provinces have destroyed wide swaths of agricultural land. The country could soon face food shortages if thousands of acres of cropland are not restored.  </p><p><br/>\"We are concerned that if the farmlands aren't drained right now, we won't be able to plant crops for winter season, the most important of which is the wheat crop,\" Nazia Bibi, a farmer in Pishin district of Balochistan, told DW. <br/>There is a fear that Pakistanis will be unable to find essential food staples in markets. To cope with the challenge, the government is importing tomatoes and onions from neighboring Afghanistan and Iran. <br/>\"My existing stock of vegetables is the only one I have had for the past few days. I am waiting for the imported stock of onions and tomatoes to reach the warehouses so we can sell those,\" a vegetable vendor in Islamabad sitting with a cart of mostly rotten onions told DW. <br/>Food assistance needed <br/>Pakistan's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) is leading relief efforts in coordination with the UN and other international organizations. <br/>The United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP) has so far provided over 464,000 people in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Sindh with relief food assistance. <br/>The WFP added that it aims to provide 1.9 million people facing food insecurity in flood-affected districts with food assistance, according to a September situation report. <br/>\"The intensity of the situation in villages is such that people are snatching ration packs from each other during distribution drives. It's really heartbreaking to see that,\" Abid Mir, a social activist and professor at a university in Sindh, told DW. <br/>Muhammad Younas, an official at the Provincial Disaster Management Authority in Balochistan, told DW that foreign aid was being distributed to people through the NDMA. <br/>\"The NDMA delivers aid to provincial disaster management authorities, who then pass it to the district management and other administrative units.\" <br/>\"International NGOs have their own local partners who they give their aid to. They have their own mechanism and ways of assessing the damages and victims' needs. They, however, must get permission from the government to work in a particular area,\" Younas added. <br/>Although the Pakistani government plans to provide cash payments to over 4.5 million flood-affected households through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Islamabad has been criticized for not doing enough to prepare for the monsoon season. <br/>Saqlain Abbas, a farmer in Punjab state's Rajanpur district, told DW that enough measures were not taken to protect land and homes during the monsoon season. <br/>\"For years, my family has been reliant on cultivating rice and wheat to feed ourselves and now all our crops have been submerged in water,\" he said. <br/>The WFP said it will begin \"climate resilience\" programs next year in Pakistan after its initial relief response by \"improving community infrastructure.\" <br/>Renowned economist Kaiser Bengali, however, told DW it will not be easy for the Pakistani government to get a large amount of aid. <br/>\"One, there is a donor fatigue. Two, Pakistan needs to slash non-development expenditure, including the non-combatant defense budget, ration petrol and ban non-essential imports to generate more money that will be required for flood rehabilitation,\" he said. <br/>Economic impact of flooded agricultural sector <br/>The monsoon floods come as Pakistan is facing an ongoing economic crisis, with high inflation making food staples more expensive. Pakistan is also a major exporter of agricultural products, and the flood damage will likely cut into a vital source of income. <br/>For example, Pakistan is the world's fourth-largest exporter of rice. <br/>According to the nation's Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan exported a record $2.5 billion (\u20ac2.5 billion) worth of rice during the 2021-22 fiscal year. <br/>Flood-stricken Sindh province accounts for 42% of the rice production. A report by the NGO International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) assessing crop loss in Sindh shows that flooding was particularly severe in rice-growing areas. <br/>This has resulted in the estimated loss of 1.9 million tons of rice, equivalent to an 80% loss of the expected total rice production in the province. <br/>Combined with an 88% loss of sugarcane and 61% loss of cotton, the total economic impact is worth $1.3 billion in Sindh alone, according to the report. Three key vegetable crops in several districts in Sindh \u2014 tomatos, onions and chilli \u2014 face losses of $374 million, it added. <br/>Edited by: Wesley Rahn <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988166307555314525976100236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CK-KG31-F03R-N4BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><timeReceived>1:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 13, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CP4R</classCode><className>2010 PAKISTAN FLOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0FD</classCode><className>FOOD SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00098XE</classCode><className>FOOD ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9J</classCode><className>FOOD CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001463</classCode><className>RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp;

The new office, which is set to open on September 5th, 2022, marks the ninth international office for Longevity Partners since its inception in 2015; joining its other locations in Paris, London, Munich, Amsterdam, Milan, Austin, Seattle, and New York.  The expansion comes on the heels of Longevity's recognition as Europe's fastest growing ESG advisory firm by the Financial Times and after having doubled its annual revenue for the seventh consecutive year in a row in 2021. In line with Longevity's practice of establishing offices in jurisdictions where clients' needs are the greatest, the new subsidiary will provide local, tailored, and first-class ESG solutions to Longevity's new and existing clients in Japan and beyond.  Etienne Cadestin, Founder and Global CEO, said: \"To respond to fantastic client demand and accelerate our impact in the Asia Pacific region, I am delighted to announce the launch of our Asian headquarters and fully owned subsidiary in Tokyo. We are very excited about our Japanese expansion, the world's third-largest economy.\"  \"Though the country is the fifth-largest carbon emitter in the world, Japan has a very ambitious emission reduction programme to halve their emissions by 2030. Longevity's local team of experts will provide a unique global experience to the local real asset market to meet their climate goals. Our ambition is to create plenty of green jobs and employ more than a hundred people in the next few years in our Tokyo office, to support our partners and accelerate the region's decarbonisation efforts.\"  \"This latest expansion finalises our three years globalisation program, which means that we can now deliver globally wherever our clients need us. It also marks a milestone for Longevity as we now have boots on the ground in 6 of the G7 countries, which represent around 30 percent of the global economy.\"  \"I'm also delighted to bring Kemmu on board to lead our efforts in Japan, and we very much look forward to working closely with him in the coming years to deliver our agenda in the Asia Pacific region to secure a more sustainable, inclusive, and low carbon society for future generations!\"  Kemmu Kawai, the new Country Director of Longevity Partners Japan and Asia will be responsible for overseeing all of Longevity's activities in the region.  Kemmu Kawai, Country Director, said: \"I am thrilled to be joining Longevity and excited to launch the Tokyo office, the first Longevity Partner's Asian office with our professional team members. I will bring to the Longevity team my expertise in real estate in Asia and I am looking forward to delivering unique ESG solutions to our local as well as global clients across the Asia Pacific region. I am excited to be in this position to contribute to the success of our business and that of our clients.\"  In recent months, Longevity Partners has undergone a tremendous organisational restructuring, including the expansion of its technical expertise at a global level with the appointment of over 70 new experts since January 2022. At the same time, Longevity Partners has invested heavily in the digitalisation of its innovative service solutions and launched new services such as Climate Resilience, Value at Risk, Green Finance, Social Impact and Net Zero Carbon Portfolio Management. The new opening in Tokyo is designed to fit the rapidly evolving needs of its clients and to better support its partners' decarbonation efforts across the Asia Pacific region, giving Longevity the right edge to assert itself as the first truly global independent ESG advisory firm in the real estate sector.       END  About Longevity Partners Operating in over 40 countries for more than 100 institutional investors across all asset classes, Longevity Partners provides all services required to future-proof property investment portfolios.

Experts say adapting farming practices and growing more millets can ensure India's food security.Russia's war on Ukraine disrupted wheat supplies and drove up food prices across the globe, as the two countries are the top two exporters. India, the third biggest exporter, stepped in to fill the gap in the global market. </p><p><br/>But India banned the export of wheat with immediate effect, just two days after announcing that it was eyeing a record push on wheat shipments this year. <br/>Days ago, India also announced it would restrict sugar exports to stabilize prices and ensure supply. India is the second largest exporter of sugar in the world.  <br/>Before the wheat export ban, India had set a goal of shipping a mammoth 10 million tons this year, looking to capitalize on the global disruptions to wheat supplies from the war and to find new markets for its wheat in Europe, Africa and Asia. <br/>Food security under threat <br/>Amid a severe heatwave and rising domestic prices, India's Directorate of Foreign Trade said the food security of India along with neighboring and vulnerable nations was under threat. <br/>India saw the hottest March since temperature records began, in 1901. Wheat grains usually ripen around this period, which is why they are extra sensitive to heat. <br/>With extreme weather conditions expected to become more and more common in the future, concerns are being raised about India's food security. <br/>India received requests to supply over 1.5 million tons of wheat from countries that are looking to prevail over the ongoing shortage of the commodity, with the bulk of the request coming from neighboring Bangladesh. <br/>\"India is keen to help vulnerable countries and anyone who needs wheat,\" an official told Reuters. <br/>Extreme weather changing growth patterns <br/>Namrata Ginoya, climate resilience expert at the World Resources Institute, says India's food security has become more vulnerable to extreme weather, unpredictable rainfall and other such climate factors. <br/>\"These events have a quick impact on food production, and since we are continuing on the high emissions trajectory right now, we will see a lot of impact,\" Ginoya told DW. <br/>Ginoya said there are several ways farmers can adapt to the changing weather conditions, and these practices are being followed on a smaller scale. <br/>\"We're seeing summers arrive earlier than the previous years. That is the time when the grains grow in the crop. If the temperature at the time is higher than 30-31 degrees Celsius [86-88 degrees Fahrenheit], it is bad for the growth of grains,\" Ginoya said. <br/>So, farmers can start sowing the grain 10-15 days earlier than usual. Changes can also be made in the irrigation and fertilization of crops, to adapt to the weather,\" she added.  <br/>She believes people need to move towards a style of farming in which every stage of production is monitored and researched, and farmers can access and utilize the findings of the research. <br/>\"We also need to identify areas where it is sustainable to grow wheat, and regions where it is no longer viable to grow the crop,\" she told DW. <br/>Millet as an alternative <br/>Even with changes in climate practices, wheat and rice may not be able to fulfill the domestic and international demands of the crop. <br/>Under these circumstances, some experts believe it is time to turn to millet, or nutri-cereals, to fulfill the food requirements of the world. <br/>\"I think we can expect more and more extreme climate events, and heat waves will exacerbate in the future,\" Ruth DeFries, professor of ecology and sustainable development at Columbia University told DW. <br/>\"We also know that coarse cereals, or what are now called as nutri cereals, such as jowar, bajra, raagi, have the physiology of being resilient. They have lower water demands and higher tolerance to coarse soils and heat,\" she added.  <br/>Due to their high levels of iron, fiber and certain vitamins, they are still grown in more than 130 countries. Yet they only play a significant role in the diets of some 90 million people in Africa and Asia, and are often regarded as food for the poor. <br/>By comparison, around half the global population relies on rice, and more than one-third on wheat. <br/>The United Nations has declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets, which could lead to changes in how these grains are perceived. <br/>However, substituting peoples' diets with the more commonly consumed rice and wheat could prove challenging. <br/>\"Historically, nutri-cereals were a part of the diets of many people in India, but that has declined over the last two decades. But now they are seen more commonly in grocery stores and restaurants, as they are a different kind of food and good for health too,\" said DeFries. <br/>Edited by: Leah Carter <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Examples underpinning this reputation are the EU's energy policy (Dupont, 2016), its Emission Trading System (Liu et al., 2019), its regulation of aircraft emissions (Bernauer et al., 2013), the Green Diplomacy Network (Bremberg et al., 2019) and the EU's funding of multilateral climate action (Dellmuth et al., 2020). Given this track record, it comes as no surprise that the EU has also extensively engaged in climate governance in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) region.1</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This region is highly vulnerable to climate change. Especially the southern neighbourhood has experienced dramatically rising temperatures, more frequent droughts and increasing water scarcity (Rizzo, 2016). Existing vulnerabilities to climate change in the region could, in turn, adversely affect national security, human livelihoods and migration flows \u2013 all areas of strategic importance to the EU (European Commission, 2009). The region's strategic importance for the EU warrants an inquiry into the motivations underpinning the EU's climate governance in the ENP region, which is the focus of this article.</p><p>Climate change poses a complex transboundary policy challenge, as it cannot be handled unilaterally. In the absence of international cooperation among partner states, climate policies become uncoordinated and inefficient. To coordinate efforts to combat the threats posed by climate change for nature and societies, the EU uses various instruments. Unlike the instruments that the EU can apply unilaterally, such as conditionality attached to trade agreements or climate diplomacy, climate policy networks build on horizontal ties between the EU and third countries (Shyrokykh, 2022).</p><p>In this article, we shed new light on the EU's climate governance in regional policy networks. Toward this end, we build on network governance theory which yields important insights for this current study for two main reasons. First, network governance theory is uniquely suitable for studying the international governance of complex issues such as climate change, as this governance is often characterized by interdependent and interconnected sets of actors. To capture the dynamics in these forms of governance, network governance theory acknowledges the interdependence of actors in a network (e.g., Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; McGuire, 2002; Slaughter and Hale, 2013). Network governance is defined as decision-making in relation to cross-border challenges and situations when joint problems require policy solutions from interdependent actors (cf. Jones et al., 1997; McGuire, 2002). In this article, EU climate networks are well captured by the theoretical concept of policy networks, as the latter are issue-specific, focus on joint problem-solving and have the aspiration to improve climate cooperation. Second, we build on network governance theory as it provides insights into the functions served by policy networks. More specifically, it enables us to develop hypotheses that contribute to a better understanding of the role of climate networks in the EU's external climate governance and in climate policy networks more broadly.</p><p>In so doing, we advance on two related literatures that have studied EU climate governance in third countries, but that have paid insufficient attention to network governance. First, climate governance research has privileged the study of climate policy mainstreaming, analysing how the EU promotes policies on energy (Dupont, 2016; Shyrokykh, 2021b), security (Dellmuth et al., 2018), health, migration and economic affairs (Dellmuth and Gustafsson, 2021). Previous research has also examined the EU's involvement in international climate negotiations (e.g., B\u00e4ckstrand and Elgstr\u00f6m, 2013) and in bilateral climate cooperation (e.g., Liu et al., 2019).</p><p>Second, Europeanization research has predominantly focused on the ways in which the EU promotes democracy in the ENP region (e.g., Noutcheva, 2015, 2016). Little attention has been paid to EU climate governance. Although there are notable exceptions (B\u00f6rzel and Fagan, 2015; Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013; Shyrokykh, 2021b), these have not systematically distinguished between environmental and climate cooperation, or between cooperation on adaptation and mitigation. The network governance perspective is well suited to contribute to the investigation of EU networks on adaptation and mitigation, as well as to identify their key functions. Policy networks are by definition issue-specific and require clear objectives to be effective (McGuire, 2002), which suggests that it is useful to distinguish between networks on adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>In this article, we focus on the first generation of EU regional climate projects in the ENP region that aimed to support low-carbon development and to increase resilience to climate change: Clima East and Clima South.2 We ask: what are the determinants of the EU's resource allocation in EU climate networks? To address this question, this article develops different hypotheses about the specific functions of climate policy networks by drawing on the network governance literature. To test these hypotheses, we compiled a novel dataset including measures of the extent to which the EU allocates resources in climate policy networks in the ENP states within Clima East and Clima South, and the correlates of these measures.</p><p>A distinct strength of our empirical approach is that our dataset distinguishes between <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">adaptation</emphasis>, or the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">mitigation</emphasis>, which refers to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2022). This distinction enables us to relate our analysis to both of these central pillars of climate policy in the Bali Action Plan of 2007 and in the 2015 Paris Agreement (Liberatore, 2013). Most studies on global climate governance and the EU's external climate governance in the ENP region foreground mitigation, while adaptation as a transboundary policy issue has only recently started attracting scholarly attention.</p><p>The results from a statistical analysis of this dataset suggest that the EU climate networks are both <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cohesive</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fluid</emphasis> at the same time. On the one hand, both adaptation and mitigation networks are used to govern interdependencies and to enhance partner countries\u2019 institutional capacities. On the other hand, network resources are allocated in a fluid and flexible way that follows the pattern of the interdependencies between the EU and individual ENP countries. These findings contribute to EU climate governance research and to the literature on Europeanization and network governance, which we discuss by way of conclusion.</p><h>EU climate networks in the neighbourhood</h><p>The ENP was established in response to the Eastern enlargement in 2004. It aligned previously disparate foreign policy strategies vis-\u00e0-vis the neighbouring states in a single policy vision. Since then, the ENP has developed more nuanced approaches to the region by way of establishing the Eastern Partnership and the Mediterranean dimension of cooperation in 2009.</p><p>Two central projects were created to support the development of so-called \u201cecosystem-based\u201d approaches to climate change in the ENP region: Clima East and Clima South. An ecosystem-based approach is defined by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as the \u201cuse of biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change as part of an overall adaptation strategy\u201d (CBD, 2009). The aim of the projects was to improve policies, strategies and market mechanisms relevant for adaptation and mitigation, by fostering regional cooperation and by improving access to information on EU climate policies, laws and expertise.3</p><p>The EU's aspiration with both regional projects was to appear as a climate actor and to help neighbouring countries to improve their climate governance standards (European Commission, 2009). Clima East and Clima South were designed to assist the ENP states in their transition to low-carbon economies and to climate resilience, by strengthening domestic capacity through expertise sharing and improved monitoring and verification methodologies for measuring and reporting emissions. The objectives of the cooperation were defined by the EU in line with international climate treaties and climate science (European Commission, 2009). Both Clima East and Clima South were active between 2013 and 2017 and individual activities lasted until 2018. The total cost of the Clima projects amounted to about \u20ac23m.4</p><p>More generally, policy networks established by regional projects like Clima East and Clima South tend to be technocratic and depoliticized, so as to facilitate joint governance of complex cross-border issues (Shyrokykh, 2021b). Such networks aim to share expertise with partner countries, mainly targeting related ministries and state agencies, technical units and the legislative bodies of partner countries (Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013; European Commission, 2004).5 Clima East and Clima South provided technical assistance in legislative drafting, as well as in the implementation and enforcement of previously signed international treaties.6 Clima East and Clima South did not direct any funding to the beneficiary countries, but their scope was rather limited to technical cooperation.</p><h>Theory and hypotheses</h><h>Conceptualizing network governance</h><p>Network governance is usually described as coordinated deliberation and decision-making with the aim to provide public goods and to address complex problems by way of cooperation rather than by relying on bureaucratic structures in formal institutions (cf. Jones et al., 1997). Network governance focuses on transboundary issues and can involve various interdependent stakeholders. Although policy networks are sometimes referred to as \u201ctrans-governmental\u201d and are primarily designed for government-affiliated actors, the EU's climate policy networks bring together stakeholders from various domains such as academia, business, and civil society.</p><p>There are a number of other types of governance, such as multi-level governance and private sector governance, which warrants a systematic conceptual discussion. Much climate governance takes a hybrid form or represents a mix of different types of governance. Hybrid climate governance models have been extensively studied in the literature and include <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">public non-profit governance</emphasis> across national, regional and local levels with some involvement of civil society, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">public for-profit governance</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">private sector governance</emphasis> (Young, 2005: 28\u201329; Pattberg and Stripple, 2008). This article focuses on the intersection between the three hybrid approaches \u2013 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">network governance</emphasis> \u2013 where state and non-state actors from different countries and levels of governance collaborate to address climate change.</p><p>Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, network governance also differs from multilevel governance. While both concepts refer to non-hierarchical and fluid cooperation settings, most multilevel governance research does not consider non-state actors to be part of governance processes and instead privileges state actors at the international, national, regional and local levels (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). The notion of network governance best captures the EU's climate policy networks, which are open to the participation of both state and non-state actors at different levels.</p><p>Similar to international organizations, policy networks reduce transaction costs and provide information that facilitates both effective monitoring and flexible problem-solving at the international level (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). Unlike the cooperation that takes place within international organizations, however, policy networks cannot take recourse to enforcement mechanisms (McGuire, 2013: 439).</p><p>Policy networks do not emerge spontaneously as self-sufficient and autonomous entities; both the operational and strategic character of networks depends on the actions of network managers (McGuire, 2002). Network management refers to activities intended to steer interactions between network participants to enhance collective efficiency (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999). While network managers drive governance processes in networks, they do so in ways that are different from command-and-control processes (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; O\u2019Toole, 1997). The primary activities of network managers involve selecting the appropriate partners and resources, shaping the operating context of the network, and developing ways to cope with strategic and operational complexity (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; McGuire, 2002).</p><p>In climate governance in the ENP region, the EU acts as a network manager. Unlike in other policy networks in which cooperation is demand-driven (Shyrokykh, 2022), priorities for cooperation in Clima East and Clima South were rather supply-side spearheaded by the EU's policies on neighbouring countries (European Commission, 2009). A particular emphasis was put on the areas of agriculture, biodiversity, forests, energy, health, disaster risks and water management.</p><p>The Clima East and Clima South projects invited eastern and southern neighbours to participate in capacity-building and information-exchange events in the areas of adaptation and mitigation. While cooperation was optional, state authorities or centralized institutions were not directly involved in these loosely structured peer-to-peer interactions. The two programs thus fit the description of network governance well, and the role of the EU in these programs is best described as the role of a network manager who defines cooperation objectives and arranges cooperation opportunities.</p><h>Hypotheses: matching resources and policy context</h><p>One of the main tasks of the network governance literature is to understand how resources are allocated in policy networks \u2013 in other words, how network managers match available resources to policy context. In this section, we develop hypotheses on contextual factors that might explain the extent to which the EU, as a network manager, allocates resources to climate networks in the areas of adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>The existing network governance literature has identified three main functions of policy networks: managing external dependencies, improving the institutional capacity of partner countries and providing support for less advanced partners (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). In the context of EU policy networks on adaptation and mitigation, we argue that these functions can co-occur but are analytically distinct. In the following, we discuss each function to elicit how resources are allocated in climate networks in the ENP countries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Manage external dependencies.</emphasis> According to the network governance literature, managing external dependencies is one of the most important functions of policy networks. As \u201cinterdependent actors, by definition, cannot achieve their goals on their own\u201d, cooperation in such networks is essential (McGuire, 2013: 437). External dependency is typically understood in terms of actors\u2019 inability to resolve their own problems without cooperating and coordinating with others (Lavenex et al., 2021).</p><p>Although the defining feature of policy networks is that they are meant to be non-hierarchical in terms of a lack of demand-and-control type of relations, networks do have network managers (McGuire, 2002). In the context of the Clima projects, this role was assumed by the European Commission. As noted above, the European Commission funded these networks and defined their objectives, which raises the possibility of influencing the extent and focus of the cooperation.</p><p>There might be different types of interdependencies between the EU and its neighbours (Gleditsch and Ward, 2001; Lavenex et al., 2021). Three types of external dependencies are chiefly relevant here, namely: (a) interdependencies due to geographic proximity, (b) trade relations, and (c) energy interdependence. We will discuss each of these three types in more depth to develop a hypothesis about how the EU can be expected to use policy networks to address its external dependencies.</p><p>Geographic proximity fosters multiple complex dependencies. A case in point are resource dependencies between states. In the context of climate governance, EU member states and ENP countries draw on interconnected natural and environmental resource pools, including air, biodiversity, forestry and water. For example, sustainable forest management is a key objective in EU mitigation policies. The deforestation in the Carpathian mountain range, partially caused by illegal logging in Ukraine, has adversely affected biodiversity and ecosystems in the EU member states that share the mountain range. This is the case in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia (UNEP, 2020). As Carpathian ecosystems are interconnected, the damaging practices of a neighbouring country can affect EU member states. The European Commission has acknowledged the need for coordinated climate policies with neighbours due to mutual dependencies and shared climate risks (European Commission, 2009). The EU is thus likely to have an interest in climate governance in its closest neighbouring states as there is a greater shared dependency related to natural and environmental resources.</p><p>Similarly, interdependencies in trade and energy relations can shape the degree to which the EU as a network manager allocates resources to climate networks. Trade and energy relations between the EU and the ENP states can be affected by climate-related reforms, or the lack thereof. In turn, policy networks can be useful to promote such reforms. For example, the EU usually includes energy-related objectives in its climate projects as part of its cooperation with some neighbouring states. In doing so, the EU pursues its own energy security and trade interests as a network manager by allocating more resources to countries with which it has relevant interdependencies (Shyrokykh, 2021b).</p><p>Taken together, the EU's allocation of resources in adaptation and mitigation networks in the neighbourhood might at least partially be motivated by the EU's interest in managing interdependencies. Assuming that the function of EU adaptation and mitigation networks is to manage external dependencies, we expect that the EU allocates more resources to states with which it has more interdependencies.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a:</emphasis> The EU allocates more resources in climate networks to ENP countries with which it has more interdependencies.</p><p>At the same time, adaptation and mitigation networks have different policy foci. Mitigation policies address the issue of global greenhouse gas emissions by promoting decarbonization in areas such as energy, trade and economic development. These issue areas are of strategic importance to EU member states (European Commission, 2009). By contrast, adaptation policies tend to be highly localized as national and international policy-makers have only recently started to recognize the transnational dimension of adaptation challenges (Benzie and Persson, 2019; Dellmuth et al., 2020).</p><p>The varying nature of policy challenges related to adaptation and mitigation, respectively, might impact how the EU, as a network manager, uses climate networks to further its objectives in these two issue areas. More concretely, the EU might have incentives to prioritize mitigation over adaptation in cooperation with states with which it has more economic dependencies (such as on trade and energy).   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b:</emphasis> The relationship stated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a</emphasis> is more pronounced in mitigation networks than in adaptation networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Enhance institutional capacity.</emphasis> Another important function of policy networks is to address capacity gaps in partner countries (Slaughter and Hale, 2013). From this vantage point, developing an adequate and effective response to global challenges such as climate change requires functional state institutions. A lack of expertise or inability to retain in-house expertise, for example, are highlighted as the main factors that undermine the establishment of robust Measurement, Reporting and Verification systems in neighbourhood states (Rizzo, 2016). Similarly, a lack of institutional capacity has been pointed out as one of the main reasons why the ENP countries fail to make full use of existing climate finance mechanisms (Clima South, 2017). Against this background, the EU might allocate resources to climate networks to enhance the institutional capacity of neighbours in order to ultimately improve adaptation and mitigation governance.</p><p>More generally, institutional capacity is vital to the quality of governance, public service provision and problem-solving (Charasz and Vogler, 2021; Shyrokykh, 2022). Vice versa, weak institutional capacity can undermine policy implementation and the absorption of available funding (B\u00f6rzel and Fagan, 2015; Buzog\u00e1ny, 2009). Thus, it comes as no surprise that the EU has paid particular attention to capacity building in its own member states (e.g., Charasz and Vogler, 2021) and in third countries (Buzog\u00e1ny, 2009; Lavenex, 2008).</p><p>Given that adaptation and mitigation governance require appropriate policy responses, the ability of states to effectively achieve a chosen policy outcome is key. Climate policy networks are useful vehicles to improve institutional capacity, for example, by providing policymakers with guidance to design adequate adaptation and mitigation measures, by strengthening the administrative capacity of the public sector, and by disseminating knowledge about how to foster effective implementation and enforcement of climate policies.</p><p>In sum, the capacity building argument aligns well with the EU's approach to climate governance in the ENP. Recognizing the potential implications of low institutional capacity, policy networks in Clima East and Clima South were used to provide technical training for civil servants, to share best practices, and to advise on climate change resilience (e.g., Clima South, 2017). Assuming that the function of EU climate policy networks is to enhance the institutional capacity of partner countries, the EU is likely to use such networks to engage more with countries with relatively low levels of institutional capacity.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a:</emphasis> The EU allocates more resources in climate networks to ENP countries that have relatively low institutional capacity.</p><p>Similar to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b</emphasis>, we expect differences between adaptation and mitigation networks. Most of the neighbourhood states have a better understanding of the need for mitigation than adaptation. To date, many of these states have no adaptation plans (Shyrokykh, 2021b), indicating a lack of awareness or willingness of engaging in adaptation. Additionally, as noted earlier, cross-border adaptation is a more recent policy priority when compared to mitigation (European Commission, 2009), which might require particular attention and capacity.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2b:</emphasis> The relationship stated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis> is more pronounced in adaptation networks than in mitigation networks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Supporting vulnerable states.</emphasis> The third function of policy networks is that policy networks are issue-specific in the sense that they are usually built to address a specific transboundary problem. Taking this perspective, we assume that the EU in part establishes climate policy networks with its neighbours to improve their responsiveness to adaptation and mitigation challenges.</p><p>Indeed, the EU's aspiration to support vulnerable states might not only be grounded in principled, but also in strategic considerations. To be sure, unmanaged climate vulnerabilities in the neighbourhood could adversely affect the security of EU member states (European Commission, 2009). Failure to address disaster risks can have adverse security implications and thereby destabilize regional security, economy and trade. The EU has long considered and framed climate change as a threat to national and human security (European Commission, 2009).</p><p>Climate change poses a security risk to the livelihoods of vulnerable societies in the neighbourhood, as conflicts could arise over scarce resources such as water or food (World Bank, 2020). This could affect the lives of millions of people. Policy networks can be used to transfer expertise to enable more effective management of joint problems, implying that this type of cooperation can also be used to alleviate pressing climate vulnerabilities. If the function of EU adaptation and mitigation networks is to address climate change vulnerabilities, we would expect the EU to strengthen climate networks in vulnerable countries.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a:</emphasis> The EU allocates more resources in climate networks to ENP countries that are more vulnerable to climate risks.</p><p>Again, we expect different effects for adaptation and mitigation. Mitigation-related policies are not designed to reduce vulnerabilities to climate risks. In contrast, adaptation policies typically seek to reduce climate-related risks for nature and human livelihoods, for example by supporting communities and infrastructures to become more resilient to the adverse effects of climate change. Adaptation is also typically geared at the areas of agriculture, water management, coastal protection, disaster risk reduction, migration and security (European Commission, 2009).   <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3b:</emphasis> The relationship stated in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a</emphasis> is more pronounced in adaptation networks than in mitigation networks.</p><h>Research design</h><p>To test the hypotheses, we compiled a longitudinal dataset for 14 ENP countries (2013\u20132017).7 The dataset includes measures of the EU's allocation of resources in adaptation and mitigation networks, several country-level indicators for the explanatory factors and a number of control variables. The structure of the data is time-series cross-sectional, whereby the unit of analysis is a country-year.</p><p>Two dependent variables were used to distinguish between mitigation and adaptation policy networks set up by the EU. The first dependent variable captures the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">resources allocated in mitigation networks</emphasis>, measured by the annual number of Clima East and Clima South mitigation-related activities in each ENP country. The second dependent variable, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">resources allocated in adaptation networks</emphasis>, expresses the annual number of Clima East and Clima South adaptation-related activities in each ENP country (see the Online appendix).</p><p>An \u201cactivity\u201d refers to a single instance of cooperation. Activities take different forms, such as seminars, workshops, study visits and expert missions. The data were coded manually from the Clima East and Clima South websites on each activity. There were 124 distinct activities in climate policy networks and multiple countries typically attend the same activity. In total, our data contains 440 country-activities.</p><p>Unlike other cooperation formats, cooperation in Clima East and Clima South built on adaptation and mitigation objectives that were defined by the European Commission, rather than being a reaction to beneficiary countries\u2019 requests. The European Commission (2009) stressed the importance of addressing both adaptation and mitigation in partner countries and defined policy areas that were to be addressed in cooperation with neighbours. As a consequence, partner countries were invited to participate in cooperation events arranged by the EU.</p><p>About 19% of the activities deal with adaptation and 21% deal with mitigation. About 60% of the activities in the climate networks in our dataset have no specific focus or were related to both mitigation or adaptation (see the Online appendix). The large proportion of unspecified and cross-cutting activities can be explained by the fact that Clima East and Clima South were the first generation of regional climate projects; many of their activities prioritized establishing ways of working and defining objectives of cooperation, raising awareness about climate risks, and sharing information about the potential consequences of these risks. This observation is in line with one of the propositions of the network governance literature that suggests that in policy networks without clear policy-specific objectives, network managers will direct most of their resources to framing the networks by defining operating rules, clarify foundational values, establishing objectives and arranging structures (McGuire, 2002; O\u2019Toole, 1997). Given that both Clima East and Clima South were the first EU climate networks in the ENP region, it is logical that most of the resources were directed to the framing of climate change.</p><p>In this study, we examine how the EU distributes scarce resources to improve climate governance in third countries. As elaborated earlier, policy networks tend to be most efficient when they have a concrete policy objective (Agranoff and McGuire, 1999; McGuire, 2002). Consequently, we focus on those activities that have a concrete policy focus, either on adaptation or on mitigation, excluding activities that do not have such a specific focus. This design choice enables us to systematically examine our hypotheses on adaptation and mitigation \u2013 two central pillars in regional and global climate governance \u2013 which existing research on EU climate and environmental governance has not yet compared.</p><p>The dependent variables capture the frequency of climate cooperation activities and provide a good sense of the extent of the EU's resource allocation in climate change mitigation and adaptation to the region. These variables do not reflect the number of attendees from each country or the actual cost of each activity because this data was not available.</p><p>While other EU projects might be directly or only indirectly related to climate, we focus on Clima East and Clima South because they were the first regional projects to explicitly and exclusively focus on climate policies in the ENP region. Since both projects were completed in 2018, new formats of cooperation have been established \u2013 EU4Climate and ClimaMed \u2013 that continue and expand collaboration. We leave the analysis of these new regional climate projects to future research.</p><p>To operationalize <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b</emphasis>, we required a measure of external dependence between the EU and its ENP partners. Because it is a complex concept, we chose several measures that each capture a different aspect: interdependence generated by geographic proximity, interdependence generated by trade relations and energy interdependence. Interdependence generated by geographic proximity can be best captured by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">geographic distance</emphasis> (in log kilometres) between the EU and ENP countries, which is also the most common proxy for capturing interdependence between countries (see Gleditsch and Ward, 2001).</p><p>Although frequently used, measures of interdependence through geography do not capture other important aspects, such as economic and energy interdependence. To address this, we distinguish between different aspects of interdependence. Thus, to capture economic interdependence, we account for the effects of total <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">trade (log)</emphasis> between the EU and each of the ENP countries and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">energy interdependence</emphasis>. The latter is a measure of energy cooperation on natural gas and oil between the EU and neighbouring countries, coded to reflect whether a country exports energy to EU member states (=3), is an energy transit country to the EU (=2), has signed an agreement planning for future energy cooperation (=1) or has no energy cooperation (=0). Using these three measures of interdependence enables us to distinguish between trade dependency, energy dependency and dependency stemming from geographic distance.</p><p>To measure <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">institutional capacity</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2b</emphasis>), we used the Government Effectiveness Index (Kaufmann et al., 2010) as it captures the quality of policy formulation and implementation, as well as the credibility of a government's commitment to its policies. The index ranges between weak (= \u22122.5) and strong (= 2.5) governance performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3b</emphasis> are operationalized by a measure of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vulnerability</emphasis> to climate risks. We captured vulnerability using the Climate Risk Index (CRI) (Eckstein et al., 2020). This index reflects socio-economic losses in terms of the annual number of deaths and the amount of economic losses in US dollars that occurred due to extreme weather events in each country. The CRI scores for each country were coded from annual reports retrieved from the website.</p><p>Finally, we added a number of control variables to consider the influence of potential confounding factors on the EU's engagement in adaptation and mitigation policy networks. First, the models controlled for whether a country belonged to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Eastern Partnership</emphasis> (0 = Southern neighbour; 1 = Eastern neighbour). Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine were coded 1, whereas all the other countries were coded 0. The ENP originated from deepening relations with the EU's Eastern neighbours, but later incorporated the Southern Mediterranean countries. This legacy can result in greater cooperation with the Eastern than with the Southern neighbours.</p><p>We also included the (log of) gross domestic product (GDP) per capita to account for the effects of economic development (World Bank, 2019). Lastly, we controlled for the effects of democracy because cooperation with the EU is conditional on a democratic record. It is also possible that representatives from non-democratic countries are less interested or are not allowed to participate in EU climate networks. We therefore used the Policy score to capture the level of democracy (Marshall and Gurr, 2020). We used a set of additional control variables as robustness checks. The Online appendix provides summary statistics and data sources for these variables.</p><h>Model specification</h><p>The outcome variables in our models capture the number of cooperation activities related to climate adaptation and mitigation, respectively, implying that they are count variables. We therefore opted for a model designed for count data, which is both skewed and discrete. To decide between Poisson, zero-inflated and negative binomial models, which are widely used for count data, we relied on several statistical tests. First, we plotted the distribution of the outcome variables to detect the frequency of zero-values in the data (see the Online appendix). The value of 0 was not over-represented, so we ruled out zero-inflated models. Next, we computed a likelihood-ratio test to decide between Poisson and negative binomial models. The results of the test suggested that the former was more appropriate for our data (detailed results are reported in the Online appendix).</p><p>In light of these considerations, we estimated a series of time-series cross-sectional population-average Poisson regression models with robust standard errors clustered at the panel level to account for the presence of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (Wooldridge, 2002). A population-average model is preferred over a random-effects model because the number of events for countries are correlated \u2013 a few countries typically participate in cooperation events at the same time, which violates the independence assumptions inherent in random-effects models.</p><h>Results</h><p>The results reported in Table\u00a01 support <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis>. In Model 1 (Table\u00a01), the dependent variable is the extent of resources allocated in climate adaptation networks, whereas in Model 2 (Table\u00a01), the dependent variable is the extent of resources allocated in climate mitigation networks.</p><h>Table\u00a01.</h><p>Effects of interdependence, state capacity and vulnerability on climate cooperation.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Model 1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Model 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">DV: adaptation</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">DV: mitigation</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Interdependence (geographic distance in log km)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.530** (0.17)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.196** (0.07)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Energy interdependence</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.055 (0.10)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.177*** (0.05)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Trade interdependence (log)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.265 (0.15)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.055* (0.03)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Institutional capacity</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.281* (0.14)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.373*** (0.11)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Vulnerability (log)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.074 (0.29)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u22120.568 (0.34)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">GDP per capita (log)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.247 (0.15)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.269*** (0.08)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Democracy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22120.000 (0.02)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.008 (0.01)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Eastern partnership region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u22121.190*** (0.26)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.579*** (0.06)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.288*** (0.04)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.071 (0.06)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Constant</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u2212570.845*** (77.53)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u2212141.455 (125.20)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">N</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">70</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">70</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Note:</emphasis> Levels of statistical significance: * <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.05, ** <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.01, *** <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001. Unstandardized coefficients, with their robust standard errors in parentheses.</p><p>In both models, the coefficients of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">geographic distance</emphasis> are statistically significant in the expected direction, suggesting that the EU allocates more resources to climate networks in ENP countries that are geographically close to the EU. More precisely, on average, a 0.5% increase in the number of adaptation activities and a 0.2% increase in the number of mitigation activities in climate networks can be expected for every 1% decrease in geographic distance between the EU and the ENP country. Moreover, a 0.1% increase in the number of activities on mitigation is associated with every 1% increase in trade.</p><p>These results suggest that the EU allocates more resources in climate networks to countries where there are interdependencies stemming from geographic proximity and trade. This finding corroborates existing research emphasizing the importance of external dependencies in horizontal cooperation between the EU and third countries (Lavenex 2015; Lavenex et al., 2021; Shyrokykh, 2021a).</p><p>The findings also add to existing knowledge as we distinguish between different types of interdependencies. Thus, the effects of trade and energy interdependencies in Model 2 (Table\u00a01) are statistically significant, indicating that they are observed only in mitigation and not in adaptation networks. The positive effect of trade interdependence suggests that the EU is more likely to allocate resources to those countries with which it is more entangled in trade. The positive effects of trade interdependence on the allocation of resources in mitigation networks support <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H1b</emphasis>.</p><p>Additionally, the negative effect of energy interdependence in Model 2 (Table\u00a01) is a result worthy of discussion, as it suggests that the EU is less likely to allocate resources to those countries with which it has more intense energy cooperation. While counterintuitive at first, this finding aligns with existing research. Katsaris (2016) shows that mitigation networks tend to create antagonistic relations between the EU and neighbouring energy-exporting states. So, energy-exporting ENP countries are less likely to participate in mitigation networks as this might be at odds with their energy export policies. Future research could usefully examine the EU's climate cooperation with third countries in the presence of different energy relations.</p><p>Turning to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2a</emphasis>, the coefficient of institutional capacity is statistically significant and in the expected direction (Table\u00a01). This suggests that the EU establishes adaptation and mitigation cooperation with countries that have relatively low levels of institutional capacity. Holding other variables constant, for each one-unit decrease in institutional capacity (on a scale from \u22122.5 to 2.5), on average, countries receive 32% more adaptation activities and 45% more mitigation activities.8</p><p>Meanwhile, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H2b</emphasis> is not confirmed \u2013 institutional capacity is negatively associated with resource allocation in both adaptation and mitigation networks. This result indicates that resources are allocated in climate networks to enhance the domestic institutional capacity of the ENP countries, which is line with network governance theory. Finally, the coefficients of vulnerability to climate risks are not statistically significant, which is not in line with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3a</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H3b</emphasis>. In contrast to much of the network governance literature, these results suggest that not all EU climate policy networks are established to fulfil all three functions \u2013 manage interdependencies, enhance institutional capacity and address multijurisdictional challenges. In our view, the findings showcase the power of the EU as a network manager: the EU appears to allocate resources in climate networks to manage external dependencies with the ENP countries, while also assisting countries with lower institutional capacity.</p><p>Importantly, although we find <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cohesion</emphasis> in the way how the EU allocates resources in climate networks \u2013 both types of networks are allocated to address interdependencies and to improve partner states\u2019 institutional capacity \u2013 the results also indicate some degree of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fluidity</emphasis> in climate networks. Namely, the effects of the independent variables vary across the models with different dependent variables. The effects of interdependence as defined by geographic proximity are larger when we study resource allocation to adaptation compared to mitigation. Indeed, flawed adaptation could fail to prevent physical damage from extreme weather events to local areas. For example, if water dumps and related infrastructure in a neighbouring country are not climate-resilient, devastating cross-border effects can affect EU member states. In fact, adaptation is largely discussed in the contest of disaster risks and cross-border effects of climate change have been highlighted among other reasons to promote adaptation in neighbourhood countries (European Commission, 2009). Thus, the observed differences between cooperation on adaptation and mitigation further support our interpretation of the results as evidence for the EU's cohesive and strategic considerations and self-interest in climate networks in the ENP region.</p><p>Likewise, we detect differences in the effects of trade interdependence on resource allocation. The stronger trade interdependence, the more resources are allocated for climate change mitigation networks. These findings are in line with existing literature suggesting that more climate-related rules have to be followed by third countries the more advanced trade relations between the EU and third countries are (Shyrokykh, 2021b). These results underpin a common assumption made in network theory that policy networks are fluid and adaptive \u2013 in other words, they are established to address a particular structure of interdependencies. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that EU climate networks are both cohesive and fluid.</p><p>Finally, we wish to highlight that these results add to the existing literature as we examine adaptation and mitigation policy networks separately. Previous research has neither distinguished between climate and environmental cooperation, nor between mitigation and adaptation. Although more general assessments of EU-ENP cooperation on environmental and climate affairs have advanced understanding of the drivers of cooperation (Shyrokykh, 2021a), the issue areas of adaptation and mitigation, with their specific and distinct policy objectives and logics of cooperation, can be usefully distinguished.</p><h>Robustness checks</h><p>Before discussing the broader implications of these results, we document five robustness checks. First, we checked for the presence of endogeneity because institutional capacity could be affected by cooperation in earlier policy networks. We ran a two-stage least squares model that explicitly modelled institutional capacity as an outcome of earlier climate cooperation. We then performed a post-estimation test for endogeneity. The results suggest that state capacity is an exogenous variable.</p><p>Second, we checked the sensitivity of the results in models with additional control variables. To account for the fact that some countries might be more willing to establish cooperation with the EU in climate networks, we controlled for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">EU membership aspirations</emphasis>. States that have more developed relations with the EU could be more likely to participate in policy networks, compared to states that are more reserved or even hostile towards the EU. Next, we controlled for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">level of political stability</emphasis> in countries, as unstable states might have limited ability to participate in, and be less likely to be invited to join, policy networks. To capture this possibility, we used the Political Stability and Violence Indicator (Kaufmann et al., 2010). As a result, institutional capacity loses its statistical significance, but this can be explained by the fact that the political stability index is moderately correlated with this variable (see the Online appendix).9</p><p>Third, we used an alternative operationalization of interdependencies generated by geographic proximity through a count variable expressing the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">number of shared borders</emphasis> with EU member states, ranging between 0 (no shared borders, e.g., in the case of the southern neighbours) and 4 (the number of shared borders between Ukraine and EU member states). When interdependence was operationalized through the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">number of shared borders</emphasis>, the effect of proximity loses its statistical significance. Thus, geographic distance seems to capture what shared borders do not. Actual distance rather than shared borders seems to define the EU's horizontal cooperation on climate. This makes sense as climate change is not limited by the physical borders of states \u2013 even localized climate risks can have cross-border impacts (cf. Benzie and Persson, 2019). Climate change is a transboundary policy challenge by nature \u2013 greenhouse gas emissions, loss of forests and the deteriorating effects of climate change do not depend on state boundaries, but rather distance. The negative effects of the degrading practices of neighbours can be felt more if the neighbour is close. Consequently, we interpret this finding in the sense that distance and shared borders capture different dimensions of interdependencies. Distance to the so-called centroid (Brussels) captures interdependence with the entire EU, while the variable of the number of shared borders captures interdependence with individual member states.</p><p>Lastly, we checked the results against models with time-fixed effects to account for the effects of potential time-specific exogenous shocks. The results of the robustness checks are documented in the Online appendix.</p><h>Discussion and conclusions</h><p>Horizontal cooperation that takes place in climate networks on adaptation and mitigation is a central hallmark of EU regional climate projects. This article has examined how the EU allocates resources to advance climate governance in the ENP region. To date, this remains an understudied topic of EU climate governance and Europeanization research. Thus, this study addresses an important limitation in earlier research and adds knowledge on the functions of adaptation and mitigation networks. The article makes three principal contributions.</p><p>First, we find that the EU's adaptation and mitigation networks in the ENP region serve the EU's interests in managing its external dependencies on the ENP countries. Our results suggest that the EU's policy networks might not just deal with \u201clow politics\u201d, as suggested in the existing literature (Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013). Climate networks appear to be at least partly \u201chigh politics\u201d, tackling external interdependencies and challenges arising from these interdependencies. These findings contribute to the network governance literature by showing that network managers can sometimes use policy networks for their strategic purposes.</p><p>Second, the results indicate that climate networks on adaptation and mitigation also serve to improve partner countries\u2019 institutional capacities. Using its power to decide on the scope of adaptation and mitigation policy networks, the EU tends to prioritize some cooperation foci and partners over others. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of the EU as a network manager driven by multiple motivations.</p><p>Third, our study is the first to examine the functions of adaptation and mitigation policy networks in EU regional climate projects separately, rather than focusing on climate or environmental policy networks in general, as done in previous research (B\u00f6rzel and Fagan, 2015; Buzog\u00e1ny, 2013; Shyrokykh, 2021b). We demonstrate that EU climate networks are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fluid</emphasis> in the sense that they allow for flexible resource allocation depending on context. Mitigation received more attention from the EU in the projects addressing a complex interdependence structure with the neighbours. Adaptation cooperation is more likely to target closely located countries, given the potentially devastating effects of insufficient adaptation or maladaptation (Schipper, 2020). We also show that EU network governance of climate change demonstrates <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">cohesion</emphasis> across mitigation and adaptation cooperation, which helps the EU to pursue its policies.</p><p>To conclude, we sketch avenues for future research on the causes and consequences of EU external climate governance. To begin with, future research could examine EU climate governance in other geographic regions that are targeted by EU region-specific climate projects. Indeed, the regional approach to external climate governance is not limited to the ENP. For example, to help Latin American countries improve their climate governance, the EU has established two climate policy networks \u2013 EUROCLIMA and EUROCLIMA+. Similar networks address climate cooperation with the Western Balkan region.</p><p>Moreover, future research in European studies could explore the influence of EU external climate governance on third countries\u2019 climate legislation and climate practices. We still know little about the conditions under which the EU's external climate governance is likely to trigger change towards deep adaptation and decarbonization, and our study has indicated that the distinction between these issue areas is consequential.</p><p>Finally, our results from the context of the EU speak to broader issues related to climate policy networks. Climate policy networks, be they managed by international organizations or domestic authorities, remain an understudied tool in global governance. Our findings show how a network manager can navigate different issue areas in relation to the same policy networks, and under what conditions different priorities are likely to be made, with implications for policy outcomes.

Prices for wheat, gas, and gasoline are at record highs. Crisis regions could see things getting worse than they already are.Every morning, the operators of a small kiosk located in an informal neighborhood in Kenya's capital Nairobi, bake fresh chapati \u2014 a popular flatbread. </p><p><br/>Chapatis usually cost around 20 Kshs ($0,17, \u20ac0,17). However, customers can hardly afford it anymore. \"Chapati costs twice as much now. Life has become extremely expensive,\" one customer at the kiosk complained. <br/>Samuel Mose, who heads the small bakery, told DW, that though prices for wheat flour and sunflower oil have been rising for some time, things are getting worse because of Russia's war on Ukraine. <br/>\"We are following the war because we need to know what is happening. Some of the products we use come from those two countries,\" Mose said. <br/>In Kenya, about one-third of imported wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine. The price increase on the world market is also being felt by the Kenafric wholesale bakery in Nairobi, which produces bread for supermarkets. <br/>\"The situation is worrying, not only because of the price, but also because of availability,\" Kenafric's manager, Keval Shah, said. <br/>He regretted that many suppliers had already reduced their contracted quantities due to force majeure. <br/>The 2022 Kenya Economic Survey found that most Kenyans are increasingly turning to their savings and loans to meet the rising cost of living. <br/>According to Teresa Anderson, international climate policy coordinator at the nongovernmental organization Actionaid, many African economies are still reeling from the COVID pandemic, the climate crisis, humanitarian emergencies, or political and economic unrest. But she stresses that the effects of the Ukraine war have exacerbated the situation. <br/>Zimbabwe: Gasoline price triples <br/> \"Mothers are skipping meals, going hungry, many can no longer pay school fees, are working and dropping out of school,\" Anderson told DW, explaining that the global rise in prices is being felt more acutely in Africa than in other parts of the world. <br/>\"In Zimbabwe, the price of gasoline has more than tripled, as has the price of cooking gas. The price of noodles has more than doubled.\" <br/>According to Anderson, many countries are already in a supply crisis. \"But if nothing changes, we could be facing a famine of unimagined proportions,\" the climate resilience expert warned. <br/>\"The situation is particularly extreme in the Horn of Africa, where 20 million people are already suffering severe hunger because of the ongoing drought.\" <br/>Hunger in the Horn of Africa <br/>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) assessment is similarly worrying. In East Africa, prices have skyrocketed because of livestock deaths and crop yields far below the long-term average, Petroc Wilton, WFP spokesman in Somalia, said. <br/>Wilton added that the lack of wheat supplies from Ukraine had aggravated the food crisis. <br/>A humanitarian disaster is brewing in Somalia, according to WFP. Around 6 million people are affected by acute food insecurity, including 1.4 million children. If aid agencies do not receive additional funding, there could be a famine as early as the middle of this year. <br/>Hirsiyow Idolo Mohamed has already felt the full force of the crisis. The Somali woman left her impoverished village with her three children and struggled for fifteen days on foot through the hot desert with little water and food. <br/>But two of her children did not survive the arduous walk to the newly built camp for displaced people near the town of Dollow in the Gedo region of southern Somalia. <br/>Farmers flee drought and bombings <br/>\"We walked and walked and my son was very thirsty and exhausted. He asked me many times 'mommy, water, mommy water.' He started gasping, but there was not a drop of water I could give him,\" Idolo Mohamed told DW. <br/>The eight-year-old died upon arrival at the camp. He had been weakened from the journey and suffered from a severe cough. <br/>According to WFP, more than 500,000 people left their homes this year alone because of the drought. <br/>In West Africa, the security situation is also hampering food supplies. For example, farmers could not cultivate their fields due to attacks by the terrorist organization Boko Haram. <br/>Alarm bells ringing <br/>For Assalama Dawalack Sidi, regional director of the international charity organization Oxfam in Niger, action is urgently needed to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. <br/>\"This is an alarm signal for the world,\" Sidi said. \"We are witnessing 27 million people in West Africa being affected by the worst food crisis in the past decade,\" he stressed, adding that the number could rise to 38 million people if nothing was done. <br/>Yet wheat wouldn't have to be in short supply as there are significant reserves. <br/>In China, for example, experts estimate that the East Asian country has around half of the world's wheat stocks in its warehouses. However, they fear that the People's Republic could exploit the global food crisis by using grain to get concessions. <br/>\"China has enough reserves to support poorer countries in Africa with food supplies,\" Hendrik Mahlkow of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy told DW. The Communist Party could thereby increase its economic influence in Africa. <br/>Marion Betjen, Mariel M\u00fcller (Somalia), and Flourish Chukwurah (Nigeria) contributed to this article. <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

Bangladesh has made remarkable progress towards becoming climate resilient. More will be needed since global heating is getting worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Due to its geographic location and high population density, the entire country is a climate hotspot. Common issues include heat waves, erratic rainfall, flooding, droughts, cyclones, river bank erosion and ground water becoming saline due to the rising sea level. People who live close to river banks or the Indian Ocean Coast are especially at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The nation must cope with both slow- and rapid-onset crises. Climate change is affecting water availability, food security, nutrition, health and livelihoods in general. Loss of land or a failed harvest often push people below the poverty line. The results are displacement and social crisis.</p><p>Impressive progress</p><p>The good news is that impressive progress is being made. The death count of major cyclones has gone down spectacularly. In 2020, Amphan claimed 26 lives. In 1991, Gorky was of similar magnitude, but killed almost 140,000 people. Another two decades earlier, the death toll of Bhola was even worse: more than 500,000 dead.</p><p>These numbers show that the action taken by both government agencies and civil-society organisations has been successful. Today, Bangladesh has an effective early-warning system. Among other things, it relies on cell-broadcasting. Before an imminent catastrophe, text messages are sent to every mobile phone in the area concerned. Volunteers have been trained to manage evacuation efforts, with an eye to supporting needy people in particular. The coastal areas have an extensive network of cyclone shelters, and many of them serve other purposes too. Some, for example, are primary schools in ordinary times, for instance.</p><p>Preparing for disasters obviously includes teaching school children what to do when a cyclone strikes. It has become part of the national curriculum. When the need arises, the shelters can accommodate entire village populations. Indeed, most people flee there when disaster strikes, though some of those who do not, still perish.</p><p>Civil-society organisations matter very much</p><p>The role of non-governmental organisations cannot be over-emphasised. Bangladesh has a vast network of them, and many are involved in raising awareness of climate change and its impacts, disseminating knowledge among local communities and building capacities to tackle socio-economic hazards.</p><p>In this brief essay, the example of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society must suffice. After the deadly devastation of Bhola in 1970 and the war of independence in 1971, it established its Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) in 1972. Today, it has 70,000 volunteers who, in a unique institutional arrangement, serve communities at the grassroots level.</p><p>Cyclones, of course, do not only harm human bodies. They cause economic devastation which is harder to limit. Homes are destroyed, livestock killed and fields made useless. It adds to the problems that many families who depend on small farms or fishing are too poor to afford private insurance. The assets they lose - a boat, a cow or artisanal tools, for instance - may not be worth a lot of money, but to the people concerned, they are most precious. Their livelihoods depend on them.</p><p>For people to bounce back after a disaster, several things are helpful, they include reliable social safety nets and infrastructure that is strong enough to survive extreme weather. Economic opportunities matter too. In all areas, nature-based solutions are best because they are not only comparatively inexpensive, but also enhance, rather than deplete the resilience of the local eco-system. The rehabilitation of mangrove forest along the coast, moreover, has reduced the impact a cyclone has after landfall, with the trees serving as a first barrier. Moreover, locally-led interventions are to be preferred, because they tend to be both efficient and effective (regarding nature-based and locally-led solutions, also see David Mfitumukiza on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>In recent decades, Bangladesh has adopted several policies, plans and strategies for coping with climate change. Important ones include:</p><p>the National Adaptation Programme of Action of 2005 (NAPA), which was updated in 2009,</p><p>the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) of 2009,</p><p>the Standing Orders on Disasters (SOD) of 2010, which were updated in 2019,</p><p>the Climate Change and Gender Action Plan (ccGAP) of 2013,</p><p>the National Disaster Management Policy of 2015,</p><p>the National Disaster Management Plan for the years 2021 to 2025,</p><p>the Eighth Five Year Plan 2020-2025,</p><p>the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 of 2018,</p><p>the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan (MCPP) of 2021.</p><p>In the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, moreover, the Government of Bangladesh has prepared a national adaptation plan and spelled out the nationally determined contributions to multilateral climate action.</p><p>Comprehensive vision</p><p>The focus of policymaking has been expanded from initially identifying and tackling problems of an immediate nature to increasingly holistic approaches that boost the resilience of individual people, local communities and ultimately society as a whole. The vision is to eradicate poverty and achieve economic and social well-being. The Government of Bangladesh's idea of climate resilience is both pro-poor and gender-sensitive. It keeps updating its policies in the light of new evidence and insights.</p><p>So far, two national ministries play lead roles. They are the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. Other ministries, however, are expected to design their own programmes in accordance with the overarching policies. Subnational government institutions matter too, of course, including district administrations and municipal authorities. All ministries are expected to prepare their own detailed work plan in accordance with the SOD guidelines. Moreover, there are Disaster Management Committees (DMC) at all subnational levels.</p><p>In terms of implementation, Bangladesh has been relying on its own financial resources to a large extent. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF) was established in 2010. The national government uses it to distribute funding. So far, the \u00adBCCTF has disbursed the equivalent of about $ 450 million.</p><p>Most of the related projects have focused on things like water infrastructure, food security and disaster risk reduction. Apart from multi-purpose shelters, other kinds of built infrastructure are helpful, including for example drainage and irrigation channels. River regulation and hydraulic systems matter too, and strong embankments protect people and fields from flooding. In a more general sense, agricultural adaptation, afforestation and reforestation help to reduce disasters risks too.</p><p>International funding</p><p>The country has also received financial resources from abroad in past decades. Official development assistance (ODA) and various forms of climate finance has helped Bangladesh to gradually turn vulnerability into resilience. It is disappointing, however, that high-income countries have not been living up to all climate-finance commitments (see Saleemul Huq on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Although Bangladesh has come a long way in achieving resilience, there is still room for improvement. According to the most recent assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>), one of the problems Bangladesh will most likely face is even more frequent and more intense cyclones in the future.</p><p>The IPCC has also mentioned maladaptation to environmental change as a serious challenge. In Bangladesh, shrimp cultivation is an example. Converting agricultural land to aquaculture ponds brought short-term benefits, but the long-term impacts have proven to outweigh them. The business is now seen to be unsustainable. Future development plans must be better geared to eco-friendly, but broad based prosperity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1006202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65N8-3FB1-JCH9-G0N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 10, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They will be determined to effect positive change on everything from African governance and human rights to food security and education. The heads of state and business and government leaders who will meet during the Summit?s U.S.-African Business Forum will try in good faith to advance mutually beneficial two-way trade and investment partnerships. As history has demonstrated, however, promises made at such lofty meetings, no matter how heartfelt, are frequently not kept. History tells us that time and time again, the high ideals, good words, handshake commitments (and even contractual obligations) which are reached at these meetings have, for any range of intervening reasons, been ignored, set aside, overlooked, or found to be too ambitious to complete. (Consider, for example, the West committing to giving $100 billion a year by 2020 to help emerging economies reduce emissions and prepare for climate change.\u00a0 When the original target was missed, it was moved ? and has yet to be met.) To the extent possible, dear Sirs, let?s avoid building such bridges to nowhere in this Summit. What to Do About Africa?s Energy Resources As you?d imagine given the authorship of this Open Letter, our true aim herein is to speak on the issue of Africa?s energy resources and the policies that will prevail in the Continent?s use of those resources. We are aware that, inevitably, the topic of African energy will arise, interwoven as it is with issues ranging from the effect of climate change to the potential for industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth. There?s no question that African energy is a hot-button topic, pitting climate activists who want the continent to keep its considerable hydrocarbon assets (including newly found natural gas reserves) in the ground, on the one hand, against others who recognize that fossil fuels cannot be discarded in Africa in the short run if the continent hopes realistically to lift people out of energy ? and real ? poverty. Under the banner of ?climate justice,? the many in the developed world have cut off public financing for new African fossil fuel projects ? although that hasn?t stopped them from bankrolling or even subsidizing their own hydrocarbon activities or seeking feverishly to secure increased hydrocarbon commodities for a European Union threatened by an unprovoked and unjust war. Wealthy nations contend that because Africa is more vulnerable than most to the severe effects of climate change, the continent must abandon its oil and gas opportunities, and the economic and social improvements that come with it, and switch to renewables ? NOW. In fact, Sirs, the true impact of future climate crises on everyday Africans is actually exacerbated by their current state of impoverishment. Without the minimal level of development and infrastructure, Africans face harsher consequences BECAUSE they don?t have the accoutrements of development?shelter, power, diet, and personal amenities?that people in the developed world will use on an individual basis to defend against any creeping climate degradation. That is, to give Africans an even chance to survive climate disasters of the future, let?s give them the resources to bring them up to the level of personal protections that others around the world have. Africa?s Hydrocarbon Resources Must be Considered In the Global Context, Not in a Vacuum First, as is widely known, to the degree that greenhouse gases cause climate change, the problem is not of Africa?s own making.  It is irrefutably known that Africa produces an infinitesimal amount of greenhouse gases and has the lowest emissions per capita of any region on earth. At an event during COP 27, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) reminded participants that Africa, where one-fifth of the world?s population lives, currently contributes only 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. How would monetizing Africa?s natural gas reserves change that figure? Not very much, especially in light of how it would benefit everyday Africans. According to Birol, were the continent to turn all of its natural gas discoveries into production it would add 90 billion cubic meters (bcm) of useful energy by 2030. Two-thirds of that could be used for domestic needs ? among other things, to provide power to the 600 million Africans who still lack access to electricity and to wean the 900 million Africans (mostly women) who rely on biomass for cooking off the hazardous stuff ? and the rest exported, and even then the amount of greenhouse gases coming out of Africa would rise only to 3.4%, ?which is nothing,? Birol said. Yet the world is trying to keep that solution out of our reach. Second, it is countries that prospered via fossil-fueled industrialization that wish to deny us the same privilege. Despite the fact that fossil fuels enabled the technological revolution and have led to massive improvements in quality of life and longevity across the globe ? all things Africa needs, deserves, and has the hydrocarbon means to achieve ? big economies want us to stop using oil and natural gas as soon as possible. But, as Miriam Hinostroza, an environmental economist with the UN Environment Programme, told UN News, that?s out of the question. Banning fossil fuels within the next decade, she said, ?is not a reality? ? at least not without economic and social fallout. ?Sometimes, a priority for countries is economic growth, which they only get from using fossil fuels ? they are still cheap, the technologies are there, there are many power plants [and] they cannot [all of a sudden] just get rid of these plants, Hinostroza said. Economist Vijaya Ramachandran goes even further. ?It is not fair for rich countries to fight climate change at the cost of low-income countries? development and climate resilience,? Ramachandran wrote for nature.com. Instead, she suggests the adoption of funding criteria that consider economic growth alongside climate impact, where countries with ?lower per-capita incomes, low emissions, or high use of green energy are deemed more eligible for development projects that depend on fossil fuels.? One example: using the 4.2 trillion cubic meters (tcm) of natural gas along the Tanzania?Mozambique border to expand access to electricity and generate much-needed revenue in two ?low-income, low-emitting countries.? Third, a fossil fuel-free world doesn?t reflect current market realities ? including how accustomed Europeans are to keeping their homes and businesses warm and well-lighted, especially during a dark and blustery winter. Yes, in a perfect world, the wind would always blow, the sun would always shine, and Russia would never have invaded Ukraine, meaning natural gas supplies would still move unfettered across Europe. But with none of this being the case, since June the EU has returned to using coal, the dirtiest energy source (although at least it banned imports of Russian coal). Somehow, EU officials believe they can take that step without ?derailing their longer-term climate goals.? And even though the European Parliament labeled investments in gas and nuclear power plants as climate-friendly, unrelenting pressure to keep African gas in the ground remains, and renewables advocates say there should be no new investment in infrastructure that would bring African gas to Europe. Fourth, despite arguments that investments into Africa?s fossil fuel sector are undermining the enormous potential of Africa?s renewables, growth is already underway. Most of the electricity in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, and Uganda comes from hydroelectric power, and several other countries have taken steps toward scaling up other renewables through policy-building, regional collaboration, and investment promotion. The problem, however, is that investment in the continent?s wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable power-generating projects was just $2.6 billion in 2021, an 11-year low.\u00a0 Of the $434 billion invested in renewables worldwide, Africa?s share was just 0.6%. Before Africa can more fully embark on a low-carbon future there must be global strategies for mobilizing capital into renewables, and the world must honor the billion-dollar promises it has already made. Let?s Avoid Being Ad Hoc About Africa?s Role in Climate Change Remediation As many of you know, delegates at COP27 agreed to create a fund that would compensate poorer nations harmed by climate change. Eligible countries are in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Caribbean. Reaction to the announcement has been far-ranging, from cheers to assertions that it is paternalistic (and perhaps even racist), to the earnest admissions of some scientists that it?s difficult at his stage to gauge climate change damage in such regional terms or tell if a specific weather event is even due to climate change. Then there were those who asked if, instead of receiving loss-and-damage dollars, African nations could be paid to keep hydrocarbons in the ground, thereby avoiding whatever greenhouse gases they would emit. Of course, any such ?reparations,? as they have been loosely (and, from a legal standpoint, inaccurately) called, depend on the UN actually raising the estimated $290 billion to $580 billion required ANNUALLY to keep the loss-and-damage fund going. And as we know, no matter how good the intentions, it?s not always easy to bring them to fruition.\u00a0 In specific regards to Africa?s energy resources, we encourage participants to promote a sustainable development of Africa, including universal energy access ? recognizing that it will require a variety of energy sources.\u00a0 Africa has too much oil and natural gas to ignore, especially when they can be used to raise people to the way of life most Americans have been enjoying for decades. Africa should not be the test case for a renewables-only future because the world finds itself in a panic over emissions. We have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to negative externalities. Ramachandran has said Africa needs reliable energy infrastructure, not rich-world hypocrisy. To paraphrase Benjamin Attia and Morgan Bazilian of the Colorado School of Mines, limiting the use of fossil fuels in Africa can make poverty and inequality worse while not accomplishing much in the way of reducing global greenhouse emissions, especially as fossil fuel use continues around the world. In the End, Dear Delegates, We Ask for This We at the Africa Energy Chamber are not writing this letter with animosity, nor are we neutral on the importance of d\u00e9tente between the US and Africa on the range of issues that are on the agenda of the Summit. Indeed, we are candidly grateful for the robust approach the new US Administration has taken on matters of US/Africa cooperation. We applaud the US leadership for its continuous engagement with us as well as various African Presidents. But any observer of the growing indecisiveness on the future of Africa?s use of its resources for its own betterment must agree that the Summit offers a chance to break energy transition stalemate and offer solutions to Africa?s dual obligations to support climate-smart policies while also striving to end the vast energy deficit and economic poverty on the Continent. We know that, for three days in Washington, D.C., everyone will work toward tangible, measurable results. What we hope is that, throughout the events, the Parties gravitate towards mutual accommodation and the overall betterment of conditions in Africa. Most of all, we are asking that everyone who attends the Summit only makes promises they can keep. The time for empty gestures is over. Today calls for action. The true test of how successful the Summit is will not be the news reports about it afterward but the results we see in the months and years to come.

The African Continent, some organizers have said, will shape the future of the world.  We truly believe that the leaders who will assemble in Washington have the best intentions in mind. They will be determined to effect positive change on everything from African governance and human rights to food security and education. The heads of state and business and government leaders who will meet during the Summit's U.S.-African Business Forum will try in good faith to advance mutually beneficial two-way trade and investment partnerships.  As history has demonstrated, however, promises made at such lofty meetings, no matter how heartfelt, are frequently not kept. History tells us that time and time again, the high ideals, good words, handshake commitments (and even contractual obligations) which are reached at these meetings have, for any range of intervening reasons, been ignored, set aside, overlooked, or found to be too ambitious to complete. (Consider, for example, the West committing to giving $100 billion a year by 2020 to help emerging economies reduce emissions and prepare for climate change. When the original target was missed, it was moved - and has yet to be met.)  To the extent possible, dear Sirs, let's avoid building such bridges to nowhere in this Summit.  What to Do About Africa's Energy Resources  As you'd imagine given the authorship of this Open Letter, our true aim herein is to speak on the issue of Africa's energy resources and the policies that will prevail in the Continent's use of those resources.  We are aware that, inevitably, the topic of African energy will arise, interwoven as it is with issues ranging from the effect of climate change to the potential for industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth.

This will create new investment and business opportunities for local and foreign businesses.</p><p>Academics say the challenge for Laos is to ensure that investment projects do not harm the environment.

Politicians and experts met at an \"Africa Roundtable\" to discuss how to reset the relationship for the benefit of all.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier set the tone in his opening remarks for the \"The Africa Roundtable\" held on Wednesday when he called for greater cooperation between Europe and Africa. \"We, Africa and Europe, need each other to tackle the big challenges, and we can learn a lot from each other in the process,\" he said at the start of the online debate organized by the Global Perspectives Initiative (GPI). </p><p><br/>Steinmeier said that it was crucial to cooperate closely in fighting the pandemic, climate change, migration, digitization, terrorism, and globalization. He called for a more significant contribution by western countries to the global vaccination campaign against the coronavirus virus. All panelists agreed that one thing the pandemic had taught the world was, as Nigerian economist Oby Ezekwesili put it: \"Health is economy and economy is health.\" <br/>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala had already warned in February, when she took over as director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO), that there would be no \"business as usual\" after the pandemic. At the online debate, she specified that she intended to dismantle existing trade barriers for basic medical products, vaccines, and active ingredients. <br/>Fair play for Africa <br/>Senegalese President Macky Sall agreed that it was important to vaccinate global populations to ensure an end to the pandemic for all and restart the global economy. But this alone will not solve Africa's problems. \"We must support the economic recovery through strong and innovative measures,\" Sall said. Such measures include greater flexibility vis--vis debt ceiling rules and the budget deficit threshold for developing countries. Other support could come via \"easier access to loans on terms compatible with the enormous investment required in heavy infrastructure and more transparent and fairer assessments of investment risk in Africa,\" Sall proposed. <br/>Many panelists concurred that the exaggerated perception of Africa as high-risk for business investments has significantly hampered needed investments on the continent. <br/>This is all the more urgent since African populations, while not as badly hit by Covid-19 as those in Europe and other parts of the world, will, as is often the case in international crises, bear the brunt of the pandemic's economic fallout, several panelists said. That also applies to the second big issue identified by the panelists: the danger of climate change to health and economies. <br/>Europe's responsibility <br/>Economist Ezekwesili admitted the importance of economic growth in Africa, notably in an equal partnership with rich countries. But for this to happen required \"the continent first taking responsibility for its development. There is no way that Germany or any other country can parachute development to Africa,\" she said. <br/>For a partnership to be equal, Europe needs to acknowledge its special responsibilities, for instance, regarding climate change, said Ska Keller, head of the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament. She stressed that \"the contribution of the African continent to that climate crisis has been marginal, especially compared to what the EU has historically been emitting as greenhouse gases.\" In her view, \"the EU needs to step up efforts a lot to do a fair share of the global effort to combat the climate crisis.\"  <br/>Keller also said it was important not to see the green transition everybody agrees must come as separate from a social transition. In a direct reply to the executive Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans, who had referred to the huge economic opportunity renewable energies could create for Africa, she cautioned: \"It's important that we don't do with renewable energies what we did before with fossil energy, namely producing vast amounts maybe on the African continent and then exporting it to Europe.\" <br/>No development without clean energy <br/>The importance of access to clean and abundant energy for all on the African continent cannot be stressed enough, according to Sierra Leonean Agricultural economist Kandeh Yumkella. \"It is critical for enhancing the incomes of rural communities and providing long-term climate resilience or, for that matter, economic resilience,\" he said, adding, \"You cannot run intensive care without reliable energy. You cannot have the concentration of oxygen to fight Covid-19 without power sources. You cannot reduce maternal mortality without storing blood when the women need it when they are bleeding after childbirth.\" <br/>Cooking with unclean energy alone claims over one million lives every year, of which 60% are women and children, the economist explained. \"So for social protection, you need that nexus energy and health.\" <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099881623259251348259793000233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62W9-49Y1-JCMN-Y23H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><timeReceived>5:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 9, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CU</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Brutal heatwaves seen recently along the western seaboard of the United States and Canada, as well as in Siberia and other parts of the world, are further evidence of an increasingly hostile climate \u2014 and the need to adapt to it, fast. <br/>A global problem <br/>The pictures from Germany underscore the dangers that climate change poses even to the world's most advanced economies. While Europe has done more than most to attempt to mitigate the risks \u2014 the European Commission recently proposed the most ambitious package of climate measures yet by a major economy \u2014 these will not reverse changes that have already happened. Carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for about 100 years.  <br/>A certain amount of warming \u2014 and the extreme weather events associated with it \u2014 is already baked into our future making adaptation a necessity even if the Paris Agreement targets are met. Scientists warn that the recent floods and heatwaves are not the new normal, rather they herald the end of a stable climate. And without action, according to the World Bank, up to 132 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change by 2030. <br/>These warnings must urge us into faster action, with more funding, to adapt and\u202ffind ways to work with the natural world rather than against it. <br/>By accelerating investment today, we can prevent billions \u2014 even trillions \u2014worth of economic damage and save many thousands of lives. A Global Commission on Adaptation report found that investing $1.8 trillion (\u20ac1.5 trillion) globally by 2030 in just five key areas, including climate-resilient infrastructure, such as\u202fstronger dams and drainage systems, and early warning systems could generate $7.1 trillion in total net benefits.  <br/>Some excellent climate-resilience projects already exist. In Germany, the new district of HafenCity within Hamburg is being built on raised plinths, lifting the whole area at least eight meters above sea level. In the Netherlands, engineers have been working on \"Room for the River,\" a program to widen and deepen the rivers Rhine, Meuse, Waal and IJssel to protect nearby cities and towns. Besides creating additional water channels, flood-prone buildings have been removed and additional storage basins created with farmers co-operating to allow agricultural areas to be flooded as required. <br/>In China, where floods have caused on average 251 billion ($38 billion, \u20ac33 billion) of damage annually in the decade to 2016, so-called sponge cities such as Xiangyang Han River Eco City now feature more water-absorbent areas including green roofs, fewer hard surfaces, and more efficient water channels and storage. <br/><br/>Sharing success <br/>On their own, however, these projects are not enough. One of the greatest challenges of climate adaptation is that responsibility spans many diverse authorities, at the local, regional and national level. <br/>Extreme heat, floods and storms also require precautionary planning and upfront investment in adaptation measures. <br/>This makes it imperative that we share successful strategies and transfer knowledge and solutions wherever appropriate. To understand the scale of action needed, as well as measure success, governments and the private sector must carry out climate vulnerability assessments and stress tests to evaluate the risk of damage from flooding and heat stress. They must incorporate the resulting data into planning and investments, and closely monitor progress toward greater resilience. <br/>We need to act fast. Gathering detailed knowledge will also allow us to better protect vulnerable groups, which usually suffer disproportionately more. <br/>These recent extreme weather events have shown that the climate emergency is an all-of-society and all-of-world problem. It is encouraging to read that the US and the EU are planning to increase their contributions to help developing countries fight climate change, but all developed countries must now deliver on their promise to jointly mobilize $100 billion a year in finance for both mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.  <br/>As the floods in Europe and China have shown, we need to accelerate adaptation efforts worldwide to ensure we are as well placed as possible to deal with whatever our newly unstable climate unleashes next. And we need to do it now. <br/>Ban Ki-moon is 8th Secretary-General of the United Nations.\u202fPatrick Verkooijen is CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation in Rotterdam. <br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988162779883420425979100110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638J-6G91-JCMN-Y0RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><timeReceived>6:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 1, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>Business &amp;

TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / October 7, 2021 / ITOCO INC. (OTC Pink:ITMC) ITOCO representatives will be presenting to and attending the meeting session COP 26, Glasgow, UK, from 25 Oct 2021 to 12 Nov 2021. COP26 is the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference. It is the largest Conference of its type in the world. The climate talks will be the largest international summit ever held in the UK, bringing together heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to agree on actions to tackle climate change. The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture Program in Mexico has demonstrated Nopal Cactus farming innovations that leverages the cacti's superb adaptation to dry and arid landscapes, which include fixing carbon dioxide at night and closing the spores (stomata) during the day, thus earning producers carbon credits at an accelerated pace in under twelve months. In other words, Nopal Cactus efficiently removes carbon from the atmosphere permanently. Nopal Cactus is able to trap up to 30 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year. The Cactus is also able to offer strong vegetative cover against erosion or desertification while being able to tolerate a wide range of temperatures and to thrive in water limited environments. As is characterized by a wide-spreading fibrous roots system allowing it to access surface water and its succulent stems and pads store large quantities of water per hectare. These can be obtained by factory processing and purified for domestic use as acknowledged by the United Nations Food Agriculture Organization. The impact on air pollution, soil remediation, and water provisioning would reach and improve many lives in the dry and arid areas we propose to set up the innovation. ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Carbon Capture program as an addition to the Great Green Wall is now being implemented in more than 20 countries across Africa. To date, more than eight billion dollars have been mobilized and pledged for its support internationally. The initiative brings together African countries and international partners under the African Union Commission and Pan-African Agency of the Great Green Wall. Once complete, the Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet - an 8,000 km natural wonder of the world stretching across the entire width of the continent. By 2030, the initiative's ambition is to restore 100 million ha of currently degraded land, sequester 250 million tons of carbon and create 10 million green jobs. This will support communities living along the Wall to: - Grow fertile land, one of humanity's most precious natural assets - Grow economic opportunities for the world's youngest population - Grow food security for the millions that go hungry every day - Grow climate resilience in a region where temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth - Grow a new world wonder spanning 8,000 km across Africa The Nopal Cactus prefers dry well drained gravel to sandy soils, better still in areas of high sunlight and warm temperatures. Hence the degraded areas would be ploughed, thus allowing the planting of the Nopal Cactus as is the practice in Mexico. This is an inexpensive option to protect the environment, begin the rehabilitation of land and soil, and obtain these benefits more efficiently than by the difficult talk of planting trees initially. In fact, planting the Cactus ultimately allows trees to flourish more quickly. Cactus' period to maturity is much shorter and thus benefits the people by producing fruit, vegetables, flour, fertilizer, animal feed, biomass, biofuel, etc. The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Program has already been proven with over 1,450 Hectares under management with the support of the Government of Mexico, which has endorsed the Paris Agreement adopted at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (\"COP\") to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNDCC\") and is taking action to mitigate its Green House Gas (\"GHG') emissions in accordance with the Land Use Protocol of the United Nations (LULUCF), by 2030. ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture program to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which is made up of fifteen member countries located in the Western African region. These countries have both cultural and geopolitical ties and shared common economic interests. ITOCO representatives have been invited by The Government of Nigeria, to join the diplomatic mission as a National Focal Point (NFP) to attend the meeting session COP 26, Glasgow, United Kingdom. Nigeria is a strong proponent and supporter of the principles behind the United Nations Framework Convention (climate change), as well as being one of the largest Petroleum producers in the world. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat (UNFCCC Secretariat) requests the customary assistance of Governments to facilitate such participation. The Government of Nigeria has duly nominated ITOCO representatives to attend and present the Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture Offset program at the sessions mentioned above of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.

TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / October 7, 2021 / ITOCO INC. (OTC Pink:ITMC) ITOCO representatives will be presenting to and attending the meeting session COP 26, Glasgow, UK, from 25 Oct 2021 to 12 Nov 2021.  COP26 is the annual United Nations Climate Change Conference. It is the largest Conference of its type in the world. The climate talks will be the largest international summit ever held in the UK, bringing together heads of state, climate experts and campaigners to agree on actions to tackle climate change.  The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture Program in Mexico has demonstrated Nopal Cactus farming innovations that leverages the cacti's superb adaptation to dry and arid landscapes, which include fixing carbon dioxide at night and closing the spores (stomata) during the day, thus earning producers carbon credits at an accelerated pace in under twelve months.  In other words, Nopal Cactus efficiently removes carbon from the atmosphere permanently.  Nopal Cactus is able to trap up to 30 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year.  The Cactus is also able to offer strong vegetative cover against erosion or desertification while being able to tolerate a wide range of temperatures and to thrive in water limited environments. As is characterized by a wide-spreading fibrous roots system allowing it to access surface water and its succulent stems and pads store large quantities of water per hectare. These can be obtained by factory processing and purified for domestic use as acknowledged by the United Nations Food Agriculture Organization. The impact on air pollution, soil remediation, and water provisioning would reach and improve many lives in the dry and arid areas we propose to set up the innovation.  ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Carbon Capture program as an addition to the Great Green Wall is now being implemented in more than 20 countries across Africa. To date, more than eight billion dollars have been mobilized and pledged for its support internationally. The initiative brings together African countries and international partners under the African Union Commission and Pan-African Agency of the Great Green Wall.  Once complete, the Wall will be the largest living structure on the planet - an 8,000 km natural wonder of the world stretching across the entire width of the continent.  By 2030, the initiative's ambition is to restore 100 million ha of currently degraded land, sequester 250 million tons of carbon and create 10 million green jobs.  This will support communities living along the Wall to:  - Grow fertile land, one of humanity's most precious natural assets  - Grow economic opportunities for the world's youngest population  - Grow food security for the millions that go hungry every day  - Grow climate resilience in a region where temperatures are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth  - Grow a new world wonder spanning 8,000 km across Africa  The Nopal Cactus prefers dry well drained gravel to sandy soils, better still in areas of high sunlight and warm temperatures. Hence the degraded areas would be ploughed, thus allowing the planting of the Nopal Cactus as is the practice in Mexico. This is an inexpensive option to protect the environment, begin the rehabilitation of land and soil, and obtain these benefits more efficiently than by the difficult talk of planting trees initially. In fact, planting the Cactus ultimately allows trees to flourish more quickly. Cactus' period to maturity is much shorter and thus benefits the people by producing fruit, vegetables, flour, fertilizer, animal feed, biomass, biofuel, etc.  The ITOCO Nopal Cactus Program has already been proven with over 1,450 Hectares under management with the support of the Government of Mexico, which has endorsed the Paris Agreement adopted at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties (\"COP\") to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (\"UNDCC\") and is taking action to mitigate its Green House Gas (\"GHG') emissions in accordance with the Land Use Protocol of the United Nations (LULUCF), by 2030.  ITOCO will be presenting its Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture program to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which is made up of fifteen member countries located in the Western African region. These countries have both cultural and geopolitical ties and shared common economic interests.  ITOCO representatives have been invited by The Government of Nigeria, to join the diplomatic mission as a National Focal Point (NFP) to attend the meeting session COP 26, Glasgow, United Kingdom. Nigeria is a strong proponent and supporter of the principles behind the United Nations Framework Convention (climate change), as well as being one of the largest Petroleum producers in the world.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat (UNFCCC Secretariat) requests the customary assistance of Governments to facilitate such participation. The Government of Nigeria has duly nominated ITOCO representatives to attend and present the Nopal Cactus Carbon Capture Offset program at the sessions mentioned above of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.

The building sector plays a decisive role in achieving climate goals: the construction and operation of buildings accounts for almost 40?% of energy-related carbon emissions and more than one third of energy consumption worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The UN Climate Change Secretariat is calling for a 'Race to Zero' - reducing emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. The race is against emissions, but also against time.</p><p>Reducing energy consumption in the building sector can play a key part in succeeding. Unfortunately the efforts made so far to cut energy use - the main source of carbon emissions - have not shown results. On the contrary: in the building sector, energy consumption continues to rise.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, one reason is increased use of electrical appliances. While appliances are becoming more efficient, increased use more than cancels out the efficiency gains. Consider the sharp increase in demand for cooling in buildings. Since 1990, annual sales of air conditioners have quadrupled to 135 million units worldwide, and the trend continues upward. Some 1.6 billion units, half of them in the US and China alone, consume 2,000 terawatt hours of electricity each year. That is 2.5 times the annual electricity consumption of the entire African continent.</p><p>Another factor is demographic change: in 2050, around 9.7 billion people will populate the earth, about 2 billion more people than today. They will all need space to live, work and play, causing a disproportionate growth in demand for buildings. Between 2010 and 2018 the world's population grew by just under 10?%, but building space increased by over 20?%. The additional building space created currently amounts to constructing another Paris every five days.</p><p>The longevity of buildings creates enormous challenges, but also opportunities. Half of all the buildings that will exist in 2060 have not yet been built. What we do - or fail to do - today will have an impact on energy use and emissions decades from now. We must act with foresight when planning and building today.</p><p>Range of activities</p><p>That applies to a wide range of activities. In a joint roadmap to 2050, the International Energy Agency and the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, which emerged from the Paris climate summit in 2015, focus on eight areas of activity that should include energy efficiency planning:</p><p> urban planning,</p><p> new buildings,</p><p> renovation of existing buildings,</p><p> building management,</p><p> efficient systems,</p><p> sustainable building materials,</p><p> climate resilience and</p><p> clean energy.</p><p>This wide-ranging list shows that measures such as installing insulation or multiple glazing - which are often seen as the centrepiece of energy efficiency - are only cogs in a larger wheel. In fact, energy efficiency and sustainability should be factored into all decisions related to construction and renovation. Humankind needs an adequate standard, for example when drawing up building codes, setting national climate protection targets or reimbursing costs incurred to improve energy efficiency. We also need a faster rate of retrofitting buildings. The application of new technologies and use of sustainable building materials are imperative too, to name just a few important issues.</p><p>Acting on behalf of Germany's Federal Government, KfW Development Bank is supporting partners in the construction sector in the 'Race to Zero'. KfW's initiatives vary significantly, depending on the partner country, local opportunities and overall conditions. On the other hand, KfW can sometimes contribute to shaping the policy context. One example is Georgia. With substantial financial investment and the experience of many years of successful cooperation, KfW and Georgia have jointly developed high energy efficiency standards that are now implemented in public buildings.</p><p>In India, KfW construction-specific financing is based on standards that the country previously developed with support from Germany's GIZ. KfW's partner is the State Bank of India, the country's largest bank. KfW provides grants for construction measures that reduce energy demand by 40?% compared to conventional technologies. These grants ensure the economic viability of energy-saving measures and provide incentives for widespread implementation. This is very important, as India is number three in the world in terms of energy consumption in the building sector.</p><p>Flagship projects in Montenegro</p><p>In Montenegro, KfW is developing a project for a 'nearly zero energy building' as part of the country's national energy-efficiency programme. Reasons for offering support included the country's proximity to the European Union, its high energy costs and its backlog of renewable energy and building refurbishment projects. Montenegro's EU accession agreement requires the country to modernise an annual one percent of the total state-owned building stock according to efficiency standards. To help Montenegro achieve this goal, KfW will provide subsidised loans to buy modern energy management systems for the country's 2,500 public buildings.</p><p>Thanks to up-to-date sensor and measurement technology, smart electricity metering can automatically monitor the consumption every 15 minutes. It is thus possible to identify major consumers and to save both energy and water. Worldwide experience shows that such systems can reduce energy use by up to 20?%. The city of Frankfurt, where KfW has its headquarters, was the model for Montenegro's new system.</p><p>Apart from cutting buildings' energy use, countries should focus on the sustainability of buildings throughout their lifecycle. Even the most energy-efficient buildings have roofs and walls whose production involves CO2 emissions. The way to eliminate carbon footprints eventually is to use sustainable and locally sourced building materials. KfW promotes that approach. It also promotes the use of solar and photovoltaic roof systems - for example as part of Mexico's 'EcoCasa' project (see box).</p><p>Sanna Stockstrom is a portfolio manager in the Urban and Social Development team at KfW Development Bank.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Matthias Zilbauer s a sector economist in the Competence Centre Climate and Energy at KfW Development Bank.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP3101202100018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61X0-DRS1-JCH9-G02G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 31, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

India alone could need more than 300,000 MW of additional renewable energy capacity in the next few decades.</p><p>Hydropower has driven Bhutan\u2019s development success by contributing to GDP growth and enabling investments in physical and human capital. High economic growth in the region will require a steep increase in power supply in the coming decades.</p><p>For Bhutan, however, there are risks. Future is becoming ever less certain due to climate change. Considering innovations such as the growth of battery storage technologies in the coming years, the future development of hydropower could become irrelevant due to higher costs, environmental and social factors.</p><p>\u201cThere is a need to diversify financing sources and export markets for hydropower. To date, almost all of Bhutan\u2019s hydropower projects have been financed by India, which takes all its hydroelectricity exports. However, it has become more difficult to raise financing from India for new hydropower projects,\u201d says the report.</p><p>The challenge for Bhutan is that Bhutanese companies find it hard to participate in joint venture projects. The government\u2019s high-level committee that reviewed Bhutan\u2019s future hydropower development plans is yet to make the findings public. What this means is that Bhutan\u2019s development model, built around hydropower, could witness a significant change.</p><p>The need to realign Bhutan\u2019s growth model so is becoming more urgent.</p><p>\u201cUnder the status quo scenario, Bhutan\u2019s growth is projected to decelerate abruptly after 2021 and fall below 3 percent in less than a decade,\u201d warns the report. Building the country\u2019s skill sets and the systems to adapt to changing conditions is an imperative that cannot be ignored.</p><p>The report says: \u201cBhutan is fortunate that it will be able to use hydropower revenues during this transition process; realignment could involve short-term costs in terms of lower growth and higher unemployment, but the cushion provided by the hydropower revenues will help ease the transition process.\u201d</p><p>What could happen otherwise?</p><p>Bhutan could miss the demographic window of opportunity.</p><p>The report recommends some modifications in the sector because the hydropower sector will continue to play a dominant role in the country\u2019s economy. Investing in small, medium-sized as and mega hydropower projects could help reduce the risk of depending too heavily on a few mega-projects.</p><p>\u201cManaging smaller projects could also help build the required capacity in the domestic market and establish vertical and horizontal links,\u201d says the report. \u201cBetter management of environmental and social effects and improvements in the design and construction stage could help limit time and cost overruns, which have been frequent and rampant.\u201d</p><p>Taking Bhutan\u2019s development success to the next level will so require boosting private sector development, strengthening macro-fiscal stability, investing in human capital, and improving service delivery. Also, not least, it will demand enhancing disaster and climate resilience and addressing implementation gaps, among others, without which the country find it challenging to diversify its export markets.</p><p>The report points to the significant potential for ICT-enabled services that could support regional and global trade. \u201cThe proliferation of digital technologies globally creates opportunities for individuals and businesses in landlocked countries like Bhutan,\u201d it says.</p><p>Investment in ICT-enabled services could provide Bhutan with opportunities to remove challenges related to transport connectivity. In other words, this could help the landlocked country exploit economies of scale. However, the reality today is Bhutan is ranked among the lowest in the ICT Development Index. The index takes into account access, use, and ICT-related skills.</p><p>Says the report: \u201cFast, reliable, and affordable Internet connectivity with the rest of the world is essential for these services to develop. Bhutan\u2019s fibre optic network within the country already provides the infrastructure to promote business incubation and potential startups in the ICT sector.\u201d</p><p>What should Bhutan do to realise its full ICT potential?</p><p>The country must improve both ICT infrastructure and policies and encourage e-commerce activities, greater digitisation of financial services, tourism, and other key sectors of the economy. But then that also require easy access to finance.</p><p>Diversification of economy will remain a monumental challenge otherwise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Kuensel (Bhutan)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-113604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5V-V871-JDSH-20GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Bhutan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009G86</classCode><className>ENERGY EXPORTS &amp;

If no mitigating action is taken, global temperatures could rise by more than 3\u00b0C and the world economy could shrink by 18% in the next 30 years. But the impact can be lessened if decisive action is taken to meet the targets set in the Paris Agreement, Swiss Re Institute's new Climate Economics Index shows. This will require more than what is pledged today; public and private sectors will play a crucial role in accelerating the transition to net zero.\u00a0 Swiss Re Institute has conducted a stress test to examine how 48 economies would be impacted by the ongoing effects of climate change under four different temperature increase scenarios. As global warming makes the impact of weather-related natural disasters more severe, it can lead to substantial income and productivity losses over time. For example, rising sea levels result in loss of land that could have otherwise been used productively and heat stress can lead to crop failures. Emerging economies in equatorial regions would be most affected by rising temperatures. Major economies could lose roughly 10% of GDP in 30 yearsIn a severe scenario of a 3.2\u00b0C temperature increase, China stands to lose almost one quarter of its GDP (24%) by mid-century. The US, Canada and the UK would all see around a 10% loss. Europe would suffer slightly more (11%), while economies such as Finland or Switzerland are less exposed (6%) than, for example, France or Greece (13%).\u00a0 Thierry L\u00e9ger, Group Chief Underwriting Officer and Chairman of Swiss Re Institute, said: 'Climate risk affects every society, every company and every individual. By 2050, the world population will grow to almost 10 billion people, especially in regions most impacted by climate change. So, we must act now to mitigate the risks and to reach net-zero targets. Equally, as our recent biodiversity index shows, nature and ecosystem services provide huge economic benefits but are under intense threat. That's why climate change and biodiversity loss are twin challenges that we need to tackle as a global community to maintain a healthy economy and a sustainable future.' Climate Economics Index ranks countries' resilience to climate changeAlong with evaluating each country's expected economic impact from climate risks, Swiss Re Institute also ranked each country on its vulnerability to extreme dry and wet weather conditions. In addition, it looked at the country's capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Put together, these findings generate a ranking of countries' resilience to the impacts of climate change.\u00a0 The ranking displays a similar view to the GDP impact analysis: Countries most negatively impacted are often the ones with fewest resources to adapt to and mitigate the effects of rising global temperatures. The most vulnerable countries in this context are Malaysia, Thailand, India, the Philippines and Indonesia. Advanced economies in the northern hemisphere are the least vulnerable, including the US, Canada, Switzerland and Germany.\u00a0 Public and private sectors play a crucial role in accelerating climate action\u00a0Given the consequences highlighted in Swiss Re Institute's analysis, the need for action is indisputable. Coordinated measures by the world's largest carbon emitters are crucial to meet climate targets. The public and private sectors can facilitate and accelerate the transition, particularly regarding sustainable infrastructure investments that are vital to remain below a 2\u00b0C temperature increase. Given the long-term horizon of their liabilities and long-term capital to commit, institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies are also ideally positioned to play a strong role.\u00a0 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist, said: 'Climate change is a systemic risk and can only be addressed globally. So far, too little is being done. Transparency and disclosure of embedded net-zero efforts by governments and the private sector alike are crucial. Only if public and private sectors pull together will the transition to a low-carbon economy be possible. Global cooperation to facilitate financial flows to vulnerable economies is essential. We have an opportunity to correct the course now and construct a world that will be greener, more sustainable and more resilient. Our analysis shows the benefit of investing in a net-zero economy. For example, adding just 10% to the USD 6.3 trillion of annual global infrastructure investments would limit the average temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C. This is just a fraction of the loss in global GDP that we face if we don't take appropriate action.' Mitigating climate change requires a whole menu of measures. More carbon- pricing policies combined with incentives for nature-based and carbon-offsetting solutions are needed, as well as international convergence on taxonomy for green and sustainable investments. As part of financial reporting, institutions should regularly disclose how they plan to achieve the Paris Agreement and net-zero emission targets. Re/insurers also play a role in providing risk transfer capacity, risk knowledge and long-term investment, using their understanding of risk to help households, companies and societies mitigate and adapt to climate change. Notes to editors Methodology of the report The Swiss Re Institute scenario analysis uses insights gained from an existing model by Moody's Analytics, quantifying the gradual impacts of climate change over time, and from research by the World Bank, identifying so-called \"impact channels\", such as the effect of rising temperatures on productivity. Swiss Re Institute's analysis incorporates the uncertainties related to the potential economic impacts of climate change under different scenarios of global temperature increase and at different levels of severity. These uncertainties include additional and typically omitted impact channels, such as potential disruptions to supply chains and trade due to climate change, as well as respective economic sensitivities. A detailed description of the methodology can be found in the report.

If no mitigating action is taken, global temperatures could rise by more than 3\\xB0C and the world economy could shrink by 18% in the next 30 years. But the impact can be lessened if decisive action is taken to meet the targets set in the Paris Agreement, Swiss Re Institute's new Climate Economics Index shows. This will require more than what is pledged today; public and private sectors will play a crucial role in accelerating the transition to net zero.  Swiss Re Institute has conducted a stress test to examine how 48 economies would be impacted by the ongoing effects of climate change under four different temperature increase scenarios. As global warming makes the impact of weather-related natural disasters more severe, it can lead to substantial income and productivity losses over time. For example, rising sea levels result in loss of land that could have otherwise been used productively and heat stress can lead to crop failures. Emerging economies in equatorial regions would be most affected by rising temperatures.  Major economies could lose roughly 10% of GDP in 30 years In a severe scenario of a 3.2\\xB0C temperature increase, China stands to lose almost one quarter of its GDP (24%) by mid-century. The US, Canada and the UK would all see around a 10% loss. Europe would suffer slightly more (11%), while economies such as Finland or Switzerland are less exposed (6%) than, for example, France or Greece (13%).  Thierry L\\xE9ger, Group Chief Underwriting Officer and Chairman of Swiss Re Institute, said: 'Climate risk affects every society, every company and every individual. By 2050, the world population will grow to almost 10 billion people, especially in regions most impacted by climate change. So, we must act now to mitigate the risks and to reach net-zero targets. Equally, as our recent biodiversity index shows, nature and ecosystem services provide huge economic benefits but are under intense threat. That's why climate change and biodiversity loss are twin challenges that we need to tackle as a global community to maintain a healthy economy and a sustainable future.'  Climate Economics Index ranks countries' resilience to climate change Along with evaluating each country's expected economic impact from climate risks, Swiss Re Institute also ranked each country on its vulnerability to extreme dry and wet weather conditions. In addition, it looked at the country's capacity to cope with the effects of climate change. Put together, these findings generate a ranking of countries' resilience to the impacts of climate change.  The ranking displays a similar view to the GDP impact analysis: Countries most negatively impacted are often the ones with fewest resources to adapt to and mitigate the effects of rising global temperatures. The most vulnerable countries in this context are Malaysia, Thailand, India, the Philippines and Indonesia. Advanced economies in the northern hemisphere are the least vulnerable, including the US, Canada, Switzerland and Germany.  Public and private sectors play a crucial role in accelerating climate action Given the consequences highlighted in Swiss Re Institute's analysis, the need for action is indisputable. Coordinated measures by the world's largest carbon emitters are crucial to meet climate targets. The public and private sectors can facilitate and accelerate the transition, particularly regarding sustainable infrastructure investments that are vital to remain below a 2\\xB0C temperature increase. Given the long-term horizon of their liabilities and long-term capital to commit, institutional investors such as pension funds or insurance companies are also ideally positioned to play a strong role.  J\\xE9r\\xF4me Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist, said: 'Climate change is a systemic risk and can only be addressed globally. So far, too little is being done. Transparency and disclosure of embedded net-zero efforts by governments and the private sector alike are crucial. Only if public and private sectors pull together will the transition to a low-carbon economy be possible. Global cooperation to facilitate financial flows to vulnerable economies is essential. We have an opportunity to correct the course now and construct a world that will be greener, more sustainable and more resilient.  Our analysis shows the benefit of investing in a net-zero economy. For example, adding just 10% to the USD 6.3 trillion of annual global infrastructure investments would limit the average temperature increase to below 2\\xB0C. This is just a fraction of the loss in global GDP that we face if we don't take appropriate action.'  Mitigating climate change requires a whole menu of measures. More carbon- pricing policies combined with incentives for nature-based and carbon-offsetting solutions are needed, as well as international convergence on taxonomy for green and sustainable investments. As part of financial reporting, institutions should regularly disclose how they plan to achieve the Paris Agreement and net-zero emission targets. Re/insurers also play a role in providing risk transfer capacity, risk knowledge and long-term investment, using their understanding of risk to help households, companies and societies mitigate and adapt to climate change.  Notes to editors  Methodology of the report  The Swiss Re Institute scenario analysis uses insights gained from an existing model by Moody's Analytics, quantifying the gradual impacts of climate change over time, and from research by the World Bank, identifying so-called \"impact channels\", such as the effect of rising temperatures on productivity. Swiss Re Institute's analysis incorporates the uncertainties related to the potential economic impacts of climate change under different scenarios of global temperature increase and at different levels of severity. These uncertainties include additional and typically omitted impact channels, such as potential disruptions to supply chains and trade due to climate change, as well as respective economic sensitivities. A detailed description of the methodology can be found in the report.

Yet it underlined the role of Wangari Maathai's Green Belt Movement in building a peaceful and self-sustained society.How was Wangari Maathai's early life?Wangari Muta Maathai was born in 1940 in Tetu village in the central highlands of Kenya, about 160 kilometers (99 miles) from Kenya's capital city Nairobi. She was among 800 young Africans in the 1960's to study in the United States through the Kennedy Airlift scholarship program.What were Wangari Maathai's achievements in academia?</p><p>She studied biological sciences in the USA, where she drew inspiration from the Civil Rights Movement. Further studies brought her back to Kenya and then to Germany. Maathai was the first woman from East and Central Africa to earn a doctoral degree; she went on to become the first woman associate professor in East and Central Africa. In 1976 Wangari Maathai became chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy at the University of Nairobi, where she took her post as associate professor the following year.How was Wangari Maathai's Green Belt Movement born?Maathai introduced the idea of community-based tree planting that she developed into a broad-based grassroots organization which she named the Green Belt Movement (GBM). The movement was founded in 1977, under the auspices of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), as a response to the energy and water needs of rural women in Kenya. Over the years, Maathai's GBM has planted over 51 million trees in Kenya. Working at the grassroots, national, and international levels, the movement focuses on building climate resilience and empowering communities, especially women, to foster democratic space and sustainable livelihoods.How did Wangari Maathai champion human rights?Maathai is renowned for her fight against land grabbing and for protecting water catchment areas and green spaces in Kenya. In 1989, while Kenya was still under a one party rule led by then President Daniel arap Moi, she led a campaign against the construction of a 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust business complex at Uhuru Park - a 13 hectare (130,000 square meter) public recreational park adjacent to the central business district of Nairobi.A decade later, she led a group of concerned citizens into a confrontation with thugs hired by corrupt developers who were trying to grab Karura Forest - an urban forest gazetted in 1932 located in the capital. Originally measuring 1,041hectares, the reserve has been reduced to 564 hectares due to developers' incursions according to a 2005 Kenyan report on illegal land allocations.Wangari Maathai was also deeply engaged with the struggle for multi-party democracy in her home country. In 1992, the year of the first multi-party elections, Maathai took the lead of a group of defiant mothers who had been on a hunger strike at Uhuru Park in Nairobi. The women together with another political activism group known as Release Political Prisoners (RPP) were demanding the release of their sons confined in prison without trial for politically instigated accusations. The women stripped naked after security officers broke the protest. They remained defiant for almost 11 months after which the government backed down and released the political prisoners. That section of Uhuru Park was later named Freedom Corner to commemorate that incident.After the introduction of multiparty democracy, the Green Belt Movement led by Maathai was instrumental in educating communities on good governance, fostering peace and protecting the environment.How was Wangari Maathai honored for her work?For her groundbreaking achievements, Wangari Maathai was awarded countless prizes, among them the Right Livelihood Award, the Goldman Environmental Prize, the Indira Ghandi Prize and the French Legion of Honor. In 2005, eleven heads of state in the Congo region appointed her the Goodwill Ambassador to the Congo Basin Forest Ecosystem.In 2004 she obtained one of the highest honors when the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded her the Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy, and peace in Kenya and in Africa.Give me some of Wangari Maathai's memorable quotes!\"The generation that destroys the environment is not the generation that pays the price. That is the problem.\"\"Human rights are not things that are put on the table for people to enjoy. These are things you fight for and then you protect.\" \"Today we are faced with a challenge that calls for a shift in our thinking, so that humanity stops threatening its life-support system. We are called to assist the Earth to heal her wounds and, in the process, heal our own - indeed to embrace the whole of creation in all its diversity, beauty and wonder. Recognizing that sustainable development, democracy and peace are indivisible is an idea whose time has come.\" \"I'm very conscious of the fact that you can't do it alone. It's teamwork. When you do it alone you run the risk that when you are no longer there nobody else will do it.\"How is Wangari Maathai remembered?Wangari Maathai died after a battle with ovarian cancer on 25 September 2011, aged 71.In 2012, the African Union designated March 3, as Wangari Maathai Day. The day is observed in conjunction with Africa Environmental Day.In 2016, the Nairobi County Government renamed Forest Road as Prof. Wangari Maathai Road The Wangari Maathai Institute for Peace and Environmental Studies (WMI) at the University of Nairobi was established to honor, recognize, celebrate, advance, and immortalize the ideals and works of Professor Wangari Maathai.Scientific advice on this article was provided by historians Professor Doulaye Konat, Lily Mafela, Ph.D., and Professor Christopher Ogbogbo.

In response to gradual structural shifts in its markets over recent years, Wickes has a balanced business focusing on three key customer journeys - Local Trade, DIY (together \"Core\") and Do-it-for-me (\"DIFM\").\u00a0Wickes operates from its network of 229 right-sized stores, which support nationwide fulfilment from convenient locations throughout the United Kingdom, and through its digital channels including its website, TradePro mobile app for trade members, and Wickes DIY app. These digital channels allow customers to research and order an extended range of Wickes products and services, arrange virtual and in-person design consultations, and organise convenient home delivery or click-and-collect.\u00a0Forward looking statements\u00a0This announcement may include statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. By their nature forward-looking statements involve opportunity, risk and uncertainty since they relate to future events and circumstances, and actual results may differ materially. Any forward-looking statements in this announcement reflect management's view with respect to future events as at the date of this announcement.\u00a0Business reviewWickes achieved record sales in the first half, benefitting from its market-leading value proposition and underpinned by its uniquely balanced business model. Despite lower market volumes we maintained our track record of achieving market share gains in our Core business, with the growth of our TradePro customer base a particular feature. DIFM ordered sales were up modestly in the first half, with delivered sales benefitting from working through the elevated order book. MarketDespite the full lifting of Covid restrictions in the period compared with the first half last year, many market changes brought about by the pandemic have remained. Many businesses have retained hybrid working practices, increasing the dwell time at home, fuelling further desire for homeowners and tenants to invest in their properties. While there are well-documented challenges facing the consumer, home improvement remains an attractive and large market worth \u00a326.5bn.Market fundamentals remain strong, underpinned by full employment and a healthy property market with the ongoing need for RMI (Repair, Maintenance and Improvement) investment and interest in making properties more energy-efficient, all supporting project work in the home. With high levels of price inflation, driven by global factors including energy inflation and supply chain disruption, market volumes have declined in the first half. Looking forward, our most recent Mood of the Nation survey indicates a moderate slowing of demand for home improvement from its post-Covid levels, order books for the trade remain very strong, with around 25% of those surveyed having order books for 12 months or more.The homeowning demographic into which our Local Trade and DIFM end propositions face also leave us well placed to continue to take share, as do our credentials for value, quality and convenience. Although as yet we have seen little sign of trading down or rising own label participation, our surveys tell us that customers are becoming more discerning on price and are shopping around more. We believe that our value credentials, the strength of the Wickes brand, our simple and clear pricing policy, alongside our 10% flat rate discount to all TradePro members, stand us in good stead as market conditions become more challenging.Our value credentials and the strength of our digital offer are reflected in our TradePro customer base, which has increased by 10,000 per month since the start of the year, a much faster pace of growth than in 2021. Sales through TradePro continue to grow strongly, and we are exploring a number of initiatives to drive basket size and frequency over the next six months.\u00a0Operational progressWe are pleased to have made strong operational progress since demerger, reflected in continued growth in Core market share.During the first half we demonstrated the flexibility of Wickes? operational model, including a number of actions undertaken to both respond to more challenging market conditions and to continue to drive efficiencies within the business to offset increases in our cost base. We have balanced both fixed and flexible resourcing to enable agility to respond to customer demand, leading to efficiencies across both store and distribution centre fulfilment costs. Whilst the first half of 2021 was characterised by high levels of Covid-related costs such as cleaning, social distancing and marshalling, these continued to unwind with the lifting of restrictions during the first half of 2022. LFL sales across the Group were up 0.8% despite very tough comparatives in our Core business. Core LFL revenue was down by 5.5% during the first half, although on a three-year basis Core LFL revenue increased by 36.3%. On a one year basis, Core LFL sales improved in the second quarter from the first quarter, reflecting easing comparatives and the timing of Easter. During the first half we continued to prioritise our price leadership by working closely with our suppliers. We remained committed to managing supply chain inflation responsibly by passing through cash cost increases while maintaining our leading price position.The estimated level of price inflation for the first half was 15%, driven mainly by categories such as timber and cement. We expect inflationary pressures to moderate slightly in the second half as we annualise the pressures seen in products such as timber in the second half of FY 2021, although there remain inflationary pressures in areas that are particularly impacted by the rising cost of energy, such as furnaced products. In 2023, we expect some upward pressure from freight and FX against expectations of a further moderation in supply chain inflation. Despite the well documented industry shortages in certain categories in the first half, our strong supplier relationships, curated range and operational agility served us well to continue to provide customers with the products they need. Together with our price leadership and own brand credentials, we believe our strong focus on availability helped to drive increased awareness of Wickes, as reflected in our Core market share gains and the strong performance in sales to TradePro members, which increased by 20% during the first half.We entered the period with an elevated pipeline of DIFM orders due to the impact of Covid on the ability of our installation teams to deliver projects in the final quarter of 2021. DIFM LFL delivered sales in the first half were 29.7% ahead on a one year basis. Although this was a strong performance, there was still some disruption in the first half from Covid and also some supply chain issues in areas such as appliances.Ordered DIFM sales on a year-on-year basis were stronger in the first quarter, against a period in which our showrooms were closed in 2021, then slowed in Q2 against a rebound in orders in the prior year. As mentioned in our 26 July update, orders have slowed towards the end of the period as customers are taking longer to commit to big ticket purchases. Installation participation was broadly in line with the prior year.There was another strong performance in bathrooms, where new ranges in sanitaryware and accessories, and a wider price architecture have helped to broaden our appeal. Refitted stores also continue to perform strongly in DIFM due to the welcoming nature of new showroom displays. As expected, given improvements in product availability and labour scheduling, we have been working through our elevated order book, although at the half year end it remained considerably ahead of the prior year. Our current expectation is that there will continue to be an elevated level of order book carry over into FY2023, although this will be dependent on order trends in the second half.Winning for TradeOur TradePro membership scheme showed increasing momentum in the period. We enrolled over 60,000 customers in the first half, taking its total membership to 690,000 as we continued to grow the awareness and appeal of the scheme through its compelling proposition. Our local trade customers indicate that they are increasingly conscious of rising material costs and are switching to Wickes for its strong value credentials and simple discount scheme. We also believe the recent addition of 30 minute click-and-collect to our offering has increased the attraction of the scheme during a period where tradespeople are finding ways to most efficiently use their time whilst balancing full order books. We are encouraged that the TradePro members joining the platform during the first half of the year have adopted characteristics in line with previous cohorts recruited to the platform. Sales from TradePro customers in the first half increased by 20% compared to the same period in 2021. Our TradePro customers continue to represent strong strategic value to Wickes in terms of average order value and frequency of visit, and we continue to evolve our offering to drive further loyalty and engagement.Alongside the positive impact of our recent sponsorship of darts coverage on Sky Sports and increasing momentum of TradePro Monday events, we are looking at ways to improve the proposition to leverage the opportunities available within this market as we continue to take market share. To this end, we are encouraged that the results of our August Mood of the Nation survey showed that 56% of tradespeople have a pipeline of work for over three months, broadly unchanged from the start of the year.Accelerating DIFM\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Developing our digital expertise and continuous innovation of our product range continues to be a key focus within DIFM.\u00a0 We completed the major refresh of our kitchen ranges initiated in Autumn 2021, introducing a number of new ranges and trending colourways during the period. This innovation has been carried through to six new ranges of our ?Ready to Fit? offering tailored to the lower budget kitchen market.Following the introduction of a completely new bathroom range during the second half of 2021, we continued to progressively introduce new products to showroom displays. We have also further improved our end-to-end bathroom service by driving greater engagement and endorsement with our design consultants, supported by focused recruitment of installers with bathroom capabilities. Across kitchens and bathrooms our installer network continues to grow and now stands at 2,800 teams of independent contractors (FY 2021: 2,600), enabling Wickes to continue to offer the best available lead times in the market whilst retaining a flexible approach to capacity.We continue to see encouraging attachment rates of tiling, flooring and joinery sales to kitchen and bathroom projects, and trials for new service propositions are confirming the opportunity to extend our DIFM offering to increase overall project spend within the home.DIY Category WinsAs communicated in our most recent trading update, following the Jubilee weekend in June, we experienced signs of the DIY market softening from the very high levels of demand experienced during the pandemic. The outlook remains uncertain, although we continue to outperform the market and expect activity to remain ahead of pre Covid levels.In line with our strategy to capture share in underweight categories, we have grown market share in key categories such as garden and d\u00e9cor following recent range reviews. Most recently this has included the roll out of our new Crown colour emulsion paint range to support greater customer choice across different price points. The continued growth of our extended online range continues to support range depth whilst our curated range in store lends itself to high stock turn and limited exposure to highly seasonal lines and markdown activity across the wider sector. Digital developmentsDespite annualising Covid comparatives we have continued to grow the proportion of our digitally-enabled sales on a year-on-year basis. We completed a number of enhancements to our digital capabilities in the first half, including greater use of push messaging, personalisation and targeted campaigns across our digital channels. Underpinned by our predictive Missions Motivation Engine, we have also stepped up the digital experience for our trade customers, increasing the levels of engagement throughout the project journey. Increased usage of social campaigns and display marketing has also grown the awareness of the TradePro mobile app.During the first half of the year we successfully launched our WickeseBay store with 4,000 lines, extending our customer reach. We are currently looking at ways to expand our relationship with marketplace platforms including eBay to further grow our range accessibility with a wider audience of home improvers. \u00a0Growing our estate of new format stores Four store refits were completed during the first half of the year in Chadwell Heath, Oxford, Wimbledon and Stirchley. Our refitted stores benefit from an improved order fulfilment space which increases our home delivery capacity by over 10% per store. Implementation of our latest store service proposition allows store managers to better implement more efficient management of volumes and cost. Despite the impact of heightened build costs during the first half, store investments continue to deliver sales uplifts of over 25% and ROCE also of over 25%. Two further refits have been completed in Q3 to date, and we expect to complete 11 during the financial year as a whole.Our property team is reviewing and stress testing a number of white space opportunities and we remain confident on the opportunity to expand our proven model into 20 new locations over the next five years. We expect to open a new store in Bolton in the second half.\u00a0\u00a0IT separationFollowing initial mobilisation during the previous financial year, we continue to see good progress with the transition of technology and processes from our previous parent Travis Perkins plc. Projects completed in the first half of the year were all successful, allowing us to remain on track to complete the separation of the IT infrastructure within two years of the demerger. All aspects of the programme continue to be overseen by the Wickes Executive and PLC Board who monitor delivery and mitigate any operational risk arising.\u00a0Responsible Business StrategyLaunched as part of our first Annual Report, our Responsible Business Strategy is now embedding across all aspects of our business, to deliver our goals of Supporting a diverse and inclusive society, an environment protected for the next generation, and homes fit for a sustainable future for everyone.PeopleInclusion and Diversity remains central to our people strategy. We have relaunched our I&amp;D networks with a new look and feel as part of our \"Feel at home\" campaign, and also repositioned our Youth Board as the Forward Focus Network, aimed at supporting sustainability, communication, and development across the business. Our Charity programme which has supported Young Minds, our charity partner, has hosted a series of fundraising events including a Paddle the Thames challenge, and a 50p ask for customers, taking us ever closer to our \u00a32m fundraising target. We have also supported efforts in Ukraine with colleagues collecting donations, and a small team of colleagues driving to Ukraine to deliver them where they are needed most. Our Community programme has grown from strength to strength, supporting over 34830 organisations to date, with 168 of our stores taking part in the programme. We have donated over \u00a375,000 worth of products and supported over 28,000 people through these initiatives. EnvironmentWith our continued focus on Carbon and Climate, we have refined our Greenhouse Gas Inventory as part of our work to submit Science Based Targets in September, providing us with a more detailed and precise understanding of the emissions within our business. We have also conducted climate risk and resilience workshops, to build on our TCFD work in 2021, with a focus on building climate resilience within our operations and supply chain, as well as new focus areas for our next TCFD report. Addressing our operational sustainability needs has been another key focus area, with new Energy and Environment networks and learning pages established for colleagues to upskill, as well as launching an energy efficiency drive, with a focus on store electricity and gas consumption across the estate. We have been engaging with landlords to understand their own ESG agendas, and working to identify areas of improvement in our stores, including sites suitable for solar panels, and new air source heat pumps. We are also addressing our transportation emissions, by launching a new corporate car policy which looks to deliver a hybrid and then electric fleet over the next three years, as well as continuing to explore low carbon opportunities within our store and home delivery networks. HomesAs one of our growth pillars, sustainable products and services will be central to our business strategy over the coming years. We have spent the first half of the year mapping out the sustainability credentials of all of our products, and are working on a taxonomy and labelling strategy that will enable customers to make more informed decisions about the products they purchase, and their environmental impact. We are also looking to support customers in the challenges around the cost of living crisis, with a focus on energy efficiency in the Home. This will include improving the information and guidance available to customers in store and online, and being a partner for home decarbonisation. We will continue to deliver on our packaging commitments, to increase the recycled content in our packing, make it easier to recycle, and reduce its quantities.Financial reviewWe are pleased to report another period of sales growth and market share gains (source: GfK), building on our long term track record. LFL sales for the period were ahead by 0.8% against very tough comparatives in our Core business. Adjusted operating profit declined moderately with another strong focus on costs partially offsetting a lower gross margin as a result of inflation and mix factors. Adjusted pre-tax profit was only marginally down, reflecting higher FX hedging gains. Profit before tax in the first half also declined, reflecting the modest reduction in adjusted pre-tax profit, and slightly higher adjusting items year on year relating to IT separation.The business continued to generate cash with period end net cash of \u00a3166.5m, also reflecting seasonal working capital movements.RevenueRevenue for the 26 weeks to 2 July 2022 was \u00a3822.3m, an increase of 1.3% on the prior year. Against tough comparatives, Core sales declined by 5.1% to \u00a3632.6m, with DIFM delivered sales increasing by 30.6% to \u00a3189.7m, reflecting a disrupted H1 2021 in which showrooms were closed for several weeks. The shift in the first half calendar this year following the 53rd week last year added \u00a35.4m to reported sales, and there was a modest reduction in the contribution from space from the closure of three stores. Comparable period LFL sales (weeks 1-26 this year versus weeks 2-27 last year) increased by 0.8%.Core LFL revenue declined by 5.5% over the period, although was 36.3% ahead on a three-year basis. Our long term trend of market share gains continued in the first half (source: GfK), with particularly strong performances in hardware, decorative and garden. Our performance strengthened from Q1 into Q2 both on a one-year and three-year basis, although, as mentioned in our trading update of 26 May 2022, some of the one-year improvement was the result of a later Easter in 2022.Commodity cost inflation continued to accelerate during the period, with pressure in heat-sensitive categories such as tiling, cement and insulation more than offsetting some moderation in the rate of inflation in timber. We continue to pass through cash cost increases to customers, while maintaining our competitive price position. Retail price inflation for the period was 15%, compared with 3% in the first half of 2021. The pricing outlook for the second half remains uncertain, although at this stage we would expect some moderation in the rate of retail price inflation against the second half of last year when inflation first moved into double digits (H1 2021 3%, H2 11%).Within Core, local trade sales remained strong in the first half, with our TradePro customer base increasing by 60,000 to 690,000 during the period. As of early September, this was over 710,000. Feedback from our monthly Mood of the Nation survey suggests that order books remain buoyant. As a measure of this, 24% of our trade customers have order books of over 12 months or longer, slightly higher than the January reading.The same survey shows trade customers are seeking to offset the impact of higher prices wherever possible. This includes using digital channels to seek better value, and this may also be a key driver of the acceleration in TradePro sign ups during the period. We have yet to see any significant change in the proportion of sales from Wickes? excellent value own label products, although, given our strong Wickes brand heritage, we are well placed to benefit here if inflation remains at high levels.As mentioned in our trading update of 26 July 2022, sales in DIY categories weakened towards the end of the period. Our survey data also showed a modest increase in the proportion of customers planning to delay or cancel projects. Although there may be seasonal factors here, such as weather and holiday patterns, some may be a result of the current pressures on disposable income and are therefore expected to continue into the second half of the year.Delivered DIFM LFL revenue increased by 29.7% in the first half, driven by an increase in ordered sales and the build-out of the elevated order book carried over from 2021. We continue to make good progress in working through the order book, although there was slightly more disruption than expected from Covid infection rates and also supply chain issues. The latter revolves predominantly around the computer chips used in appliances, with installation times now falling towards more normal levels. Cancellation rates remain low as many projects and peers are affected by the same issues.The order book has now started to decline in absolute terms, although at period end remains ahead year-on-year and roughly double pre-Covid levels. Our current expectation is that there will be some order book carry over into 2023, although the extent of this will depend on order trends in the second half.We have continued to see a strong performance in the bathroom category, as we build on our position as the only national retailer and installer. Product ranges have been extended to offer more choice, both in terms of sanitaryware and accessories. Kitchen sales were more affected by the slower conversion issues referred to above. Installation participation was broadly in line with the prior year.Gross profitGross profit for the first half was \u00a3292.6m, down from \u00a3294.8m last year. Gross profit % declined by 70bp to 35.6%, a similar rate of decline to that seen in FY2021. The key drivers were again inflation and product mix, the latter reflecting a higher mix of TradePro sales.We have a consistent strategy of passing inflationary cost price increases through to customers on a cash recovery basis, whilst maintaining a competitive price position. This negatively affects the percentage gross margin. Mix effects continue to be adverse for margin percentage, with rising trade sales offered at a 10% trade discount. Mix effects within Core were in part offset by growth of DIFM within total sales.Lower distribution costs reflect the fact that some costs are volume, not value linked, allowing some improvement in ratios despite inflation in related costs. Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit was \u00a356.3m, down 9.0% on the \u00a361.9m reported in the first half last year. Incremental profit from the strong recovery in DIFM sales was broadly offset by a lower contribution from Core as a result of lower LFL sales, with cost inflation and investment costs driving the reduction in profitability.Our adjusted operating profit margin was 6.8%, down from 7.6% last year. The majority of the 80bp decline was from the 70bp decline in the gross margin as noted above. The cost to sales ratiowas broadly flat, with a number of influences here. Underlying cost inflation in areas such as minimum wage and transport costs were higher than headline LFL of 0.8%. Against this, some costs are volume rather than value related, providing opportunities to reduce cost ratios. In addition, there was an additional \u00a33.5m of plc costs compared with only a part-period charge last year. Selling costs increased by \u00a32.1m year on year, driven by the recovery in DIFM revenues and associated commissions. Administrative expenses were up \u00a31.3m, with increases in Support Centre costs (inflation and plc costs), IT and Marketing in part offset by a reduction in bonus accrual after the increase experienced last year.Net finance costsNet finance costs were \u00a310.7m, down from \u00a315.4m last year. The main driver here was a \u00a33.8m increase in unrealised FX gains as a result of the appreciation of the USD during the period, which will either be realised or reversed in due course depending on exchange rate movements. IFRS16 lease interest was \u00a314.9m, down from \u00a315.7m in the prior year.Adjusted profit before taxAfter finance costs adjusted profit before tax for the first half was \u00a345.6m, a decline of 1.9%. Excluding unrealised FX gains, the decline was 10.2%.Adjusting itemsPre-tax adjusting item charges for the first half were \u00a312.1m, up from \u00a310.8m in the prior year. Costs associated with IT separation were \u00a312.1m, up from \u00a35.4m in the prior year as the programme was stepped up after separation from Travis Perkins. The first half last year also included \u00a35.4m of demerger costs.Tax on adjusting items in the 26 weeks ended 26 June 2021 and the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2021 includes a credit of \u00a36.8m arising from the increase in the rate of UK corporation tax effective from 1 April 2023 from 19% to 25%. The legislation enacting this rate increase was substantively enacted prior to 26 June 2021.Profit before taxProfit before tax in the first half was \u00a333.5m, compared with \u00a335.7m in the prior year. The decline reflects the modest reduction in adjusted pre-tax profit, and slightly higher adjusting items year on year relating to IT separation.TaxTax for the period is charged on profit before tax, based on the forecast effective tax rate for the full financial year.\u00a0 The underlying effective tax rate (before adjusting items) for the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 is 19.5% (26 weeks ended 26 June 2021: 21.1%, 53 weeks ended 1 January 2021: 19.4%).Capital investmentCapital investment in the first half totalled \u00a321.6m. The main components were \u00a39.6m investment in the store estate, of which refits were \u00a35.5m. Separately, there was a \u00a36.1m investment in one freehold at Braintree. There was also \u00a35.1m of investment in our digital IT capability. In the second half, we expect to further accelerate capital investment into our IT capabilities and refit activity. We continue to expect FY 2022 capex to be \u00a340-45m. Cash / net debtNet cash in the first half was \u00a3166.5m, reflecting strong operating cash flow and the favourable impact of the normal working capital cycles in the business. Investment in IT separation projects and our growth levers is weighted to the second half, and, together with the normal seasonal working capital unwind, there will be a cash outflow in the second half. The inventory position of \u00a3205.5m compared with \u00a3162.4m in the prior year, due to the impact of product inflation and build up of stock in the second half of 2021 to mitigate against supply issues. Despite lower Core sales, stock turn remained strong at 4.3x, reflecting efficient management of stockholding.IFRS 16 net debt reduced to \u00a3558.5m, driven by a fall in lease liabilities to \u00a3725.0m due to the low level of lease renewals during the period. On a last twelve month basis, IFRS16 leverage was 2.6x compared with our target of consistently below 2.75x. However, as noted, we expect cash balances to moderate by the year end, while in addition there will be some impact from lower full year profitability reflected in our current guidance. As such, we expect year end leverage to be somewhat higher than the half year figure.DividendThe Board has declared an interim dividend of 3.6p, which will be paid on 4 November 2022 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 30 September 2022. The shares will be quoted ex-dividend on 29 September 2022. Shareholders in the UK may elect to reinvest their dividend in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). The last date for receipt of DRIP elections and revocations will be 14 October 2022.We recognise the importance of cash returns to our shareholders, and, at our FY 2021 results, we announced an enhanced payout ratio of 40% of adjusted profit after tax, with approximately one third to typically be paid as an interim dividend. While there are well-documented headwinds for the sector to navigate, given the cash generative nature of our business and the strength of our balance sheet, and on the basis that adjusted profit before tax falls within the current guidance range, we intend to maintain the full year dividend per share at last year?s level.In the current year the payout ratio will thus rise above 40%, but over time we would look to return to this level.Appendix</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"11\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec

financial statements \u00a0  \u00a0 General information and accounting policies The condensed consolidated interim financial statements (?interim financial statements?) have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that certain financial instruments including derivative instruments are stated at their fair value. The interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries (?the Group?). Basis of preparation The financial information for the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 and 26 June 2021 is unaudited. The 2 July 2022 information has been reviewed by KPMG LLP, the Group's auditor, and a copy of their review report appears on pages 26 and 27 of this interim report.\u00a0 The June 2021 information was also reviewed by KPMG LLP.The comparative figures for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022 do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 1 January 2022, as prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts (i) was unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report, and (iii) did not contain statements under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. This condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted for use in the UK.The latest annual financial statements of the group were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the next annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published consolidated financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022.Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the Directors consider appropriate for the following reasons.Although the Group saw some weakening of sales and cost pressures at the end of the period due to the ongoing cost of living crisis, the Group continues to demonstrate the flexibility of Wickes? operational model, including a number of actions undertaken to both respond to more challenging market conditions and to continue to drive efficiencies within the businessThe Group manages its day-to-day working capital requirements through cash generated from its operating activities and its existing cash reserves. In March 2021 the Group negotiated a three year revolving credit facility of \u00a380m with associated covenants, with a one year further extension of this facility negotiated in March 2022. As at the date of approval of these interim financial statements the revolving credit facility remains undrawn.The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts, including a severe but plausible downside scenario, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements. These forecasts indicate that the Group is able to continue to operate and remain undrawn on its Revolving Credit Facility. The Directors however remain watchful of ongoing pressures on customers and suppliers given the current economic environment, and are aware that the Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could affect the Group?s ability to meet its forecasts.The Directors believe that the Group has the flexibility to react to changing market conditions and is adequately placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have undertaken a detailed going concern assessment which entails assessing the Group?s current and projected financial performance and position, including current assets and liabilities, debt maturity profile, future commitments and forecast cash flows. The downside scenario tested, outlining the impact of a severe but plausible adverse scenario based on a severe recession and housing market weakness, shows that there  General information and accounting policies (continued) is sufficient liquidity headroom and the Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn \u00a0for at least the next 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements.Consequently, the directors are confident that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. New and amended standards adopted by the Group There are no new or amended standards applicable for the current reporting period. Adjusting items Adjusting items are those items of income and expenditure that, by reference to the Group, are material in size or unusual in nature or incidence and that in the judgement of the Directors should be disclosed separately on the face of the financial statements to ensure both that the reader has a proper understanding of the Group?s financial performance and that there is comparability of financial performance between periods.Items of income or expense that are considered by the Directors for designation as adjusting items include, but are not limited to, significant restructurings, significant write downs or impairments of current and non-current assets, the costs of demerging and listing the business, the associated costs of separating the business from the Travis Perkins Group?s IT systems, and the effect of changes in corporation tax rates on deferred tax balances.To enable a reader of the interim financial statements to obtain a fuller understanding

accounting policies The condensed consolidated interim financial statements (?interim financial statements?) have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that certain financial instruments including derivative instruments are stated at their fair value. The interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiaries (?the Group?). Basis of preparation The financial information for the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 and 26 June 2021 is unaudited. The 2 July 2022 information has been reviewed by KPMG LLP, the Group's auditor, and a copy of their review report appears on pages 26 and 27 of this interim report.\u00a0 The June 2021 information was also reviewed by KPMG LLP.The comparative figures for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022 do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 435 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the year ended 1 January 2022, as prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of the auditor on those accounts (i) was unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report, and (iii) did not contain statements under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. This condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted for use in the UK.The latest annual financial statements of the group were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the next annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the condensed set of financial statements has been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Company's published consolidated financial statements for the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022.Going concernThe interim financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the Directors consider appropriate for the following reasons.Although the Group saw some weakening of sales and cost pressures at the end of the period due to the ongoing cost of living crisis, the Group continues to demonstrate the flexibility of Wickes? operational model, including a number of actions undertaken to both respond to more challenging market conditions and to continue to drive efficiencies within the businessThe Group manages its day-to-day working capital requirements through cash generated from its operating activities and its existing cash reserves. In March 2021 the Group negotiated a three year revolving credit facility of \u00a380m with associated covenants, with a one year further extension of this facility negotiated in March 2022. As at the date of approval of these interim financial statements the revolving credit facility remains undrawn.The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts, including a severe but plausible downside scenario, for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements. These forecasts indicate that the Group is able to continue to operate and remain undrawn on its Revolving Credit Facility. The Directors however remain watchful of ongoing pressures on customers and suppliers given the current economic environment, and are aware that the Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could affect the Group?s ability to meet its forecasts.The Directors believe that the Group has the flexibility to react to changing market conditions and is adequately placed to manage its business risks successfully. The Directors have undertaken a detailed going concern assessment which entails assessing the Group?s current and projected financial performance and position, including current assets and liabilities, debt maturity profile, future commitments and forecast cash flows. The downside scenario tested, outlining the impact of a severe but plausible adverse scenario based on a severe recession and housing market weakness, shows that there  General information and accounting policies (continued) is sufficient liquidity headroom and the Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn \u00a0for at least the next 12 months from the date of approval of these interim financial statements.Consequently, the directors are confident that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the interim financial statements and therefore have prepared the interim financial statements on a going concern basis. New and amended standards adopted by the Group There are no new or amended standards applicable for the current reporting period. Adjusting items Adjusting items are those items of income and expenditure that, by reference to the Group, are material in size or unusual in nature or incidence and that in the judgement of the Directors should be disclosed separately on the face of the financial statements to ensure both that the reader has a proper understanding of the Group?s financial performance and that there is comparability of financial performance between periods.Items of income or expense that are considered by the Directors for designation as adjusting items include, but are not limited to, significant restructurings, significant write downs or impairments of current and non-current assets, the costs of demerging and listing the business, the associated costs of separating the business from the Travis Perkins Group?s IT systems, and the effect of changes in corporation tax rates on deferred tax balances.To enable a reader of the interim financial statements to obtain a fuller understanding of the underlying trading and to allow comparability between periods and give a better indication of potential future periods, the Directors have presented the items below separately in the income statement.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_14\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a3m</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">26 weeks ended 2 July 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">26 weeks ended 26 June 2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">53 weeks ended 1 January 2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusting items ? operating</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">IT separation project costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">14.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Demerger related costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Right-of-use asset impairment charge</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Reversal of impairment of right-of-use assets recognised in prior financial years</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(1.0)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total pre-tax Adjusting items</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">19.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusting items ? tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tax on adjusting items</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(2.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(3.2)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusting items ? deferred tax rate change</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(6.8)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(6.7)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total tax on Adjusting items</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(2.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(8.1)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(9.9)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total post-tax Adjusting items</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">9.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">9.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusting items (continued) IT separation project costs IT separation project costs are the costs incurred to enable the Wickes Group to operate an entirely standalone IT environment from the Travis Perkins Group. These costs have included the costs of creating standalone versions of already existing systems, of transferring data from Travis Perkins systems onto these standalone systems, of upgrading some older legacy systems to newer ?software as a service? solutions, and of managing the project. Costs related to maintenance and licence of existing systems are included in underlying trading as these costs will continue after the separation project is concluded: where costs meet the definition of an intangible asset they have been capitalised, and future amortisation will be included in underlying trading. Demerger related costs Demerger related costs are the costs incurred during the process of demerging the Wickes business from the Travis Perkins plc group, excluding IT related costs which are shown separately due to their significance. Costs predominantly relate to professional services fees and all costs were incurred in 2021.\u00a0\u00a0  Store impairment charge In the period ended 1 January 2022, an impairment charge of \u00a31.1m was recognised on stores that had previously been identified as impaired in 2020. \u00a31.0m of impairment charges identified in 2020 were reversed due to the improved performance of the stores.In the period ended 26 December 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic and related government restrictions implemented on 23 March 2020 was considered an impairment trigger and as a result all stores were tested for impairment. These impairment reviews resulted in a \u00a312.1m impairment charge in respect of right-of-use assets, which were the only material assets of these stores at that time.The nature of the original impairments, given that they arose due to the pandemic, was considered to arise from a one-off or unusual event, and the impairment in the financial year ended 26 December 2020 was therefore recognised within adjusting items. In order to be consistent, revisions to these previous impairment charges, including both reversals of impairment and further impairments, have been recognised within adjusting items.In a portfolio of stores there will be, from time to time, impairments rising on certain specific stores that do not arise from such a one off event, but arise from underlying trading performance. These impairments are therefore included within adjusted profit. In the 26 week period ended 2 July 2022, no impairment charge has been recognised either within adjusted profit or adjusting items. Deferred tax rate change The tax charge includes an adjusting credit of \u00a3nil (26 weeks ended 26 June 2021: \u00a36.8m, 53 weeks ended 1 January 2022: \u00a36.7m) arising from the increase in the rate of UK corporation tax effective from 1 April 2023 from 19% to 25%. The legislation enacting this rate increase was substantively enacted prior to 26 June 2021.\u00a0 \u00a0 Revenue The Group has one operating segment in accordance with IFRS 8 ?Operating Segments?, which is the retail of home improvement products and services, both in stores and online.The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board of Directors of Wickes Group plc. Internal management reports are reviewed by them on a regular basis. Performance of the segment is assessed based on a number of financial and non-financial KPIs as well as on profit before taxation.The Group identifies two distinct revenue streams within its operating segment which are analysed below.Both activities operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom. The Group?s revenue is driven by a large number of individual small value transactions and as a result, Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Revenue (continued) Revenue reconciliation and like-for-like sales</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_15\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a3m</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">26 weeks ended2 July 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">26 weeks ended\u00a026 June 2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">53 weeks ended1 January 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">822.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">812.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,534.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Core (product sales)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">632.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">666.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,234.7</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Do-it-for-me (project sales)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">189.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">145.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">300.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Network change</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(0.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(0.3)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(0.4)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other movements</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(17.6)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue (like-for-like basis)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">822.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">811.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,516.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">812.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">612.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,346.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period network change</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(2.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(2.7)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(4.8)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period other movements</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prior period revenue (like-for-like basis)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(815.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(610.0)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(1,342.1)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Increase / (decrease) arising on a like-for-like basis</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">201.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">174.8</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Like-for-like Sales Growth (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.8%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">13.0%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Core (product sales) Like-for-like Sales Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(5.5)%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">36.2%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">14.2%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Do-it-for-me (project sales) Like-for-like Sales Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">29.7%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">8.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Calculating like-for-like sales enables management to monitor the performance trend of the business period-on-period. It also gives management a good indication of the health of the business compared to competitors.Like-for-like sales are a measure of sales performance for two successive periods. Branches contribute to like-for-like sales once they have been trading for more than twelve months. Revenue included in like-for-like sales is for the equivalent times in both years being compared. When branches close revenue is excluded from the prior year figures for the months equivalent to the post closure period in the current year.Other movements represent the impact of the fact that the financial year ended 1 January 2022 is a 53 week period, whereas the financial year ended 26 December 2020 was 52 weeks; the extra week is presented separately to enable direct comparison.\u00a0 The Prior period other movements represent the impact of the fact that the 26 weeks ended 2 July 2022 is not aligned to the 26 weeks ended 26 June 2021; the sum disclosed separately reflects the removal of the week 1 revenue and addition of the week 27 revenue to enable direct comparison. \u00a0 \u00a0 Net finance costs Net finance costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_16\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a3m</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">26 weeks ended 2 July 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">26 weeks ended26 June 2021</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">53 weeks ended1 January 2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Current tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- current year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.9</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">12.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- prior year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(0.1)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total current tax charge</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.9</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">12.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deferred tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- current year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(6.0)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0- prior year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total deferred tax credit</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7.2)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">(5.7)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total tax charge</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">6.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tax for the interim period is charged on profit before tax, based on the best estimate of the corporate tax rate for the full financial year.

This matter is subject to review by HMRC, and whilst the directors believe that a favourable outcome is probable, with management?s current best estimate of the amount to be recovered being \u00a33.6m, the receipt of the amount is contingent on the outcome of HMRC?s review and their subsequent agreement to reimburse the company, which at this stage is not virtually certain.As a result this amount has not been recognised in these interim financial statements. Related party transactions  The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, with its Directors and up to the date of the demerger had related party relationships with Travis Perkins Group companies. There have been no related party transactions with Directors other than in respect of remuneration. Transactions with the Travis Perkins Group companies relate to the purchase of goods and lease arrangements before the demerger date of 28 April 2021 and are detailed below. The Travis Perkins Group companies ceased to be related parties after the demerger date and therefore there are no further related party transactions after that date, although payments continue to be made under the Transitional Services Agreement with Travis Perkins on an arms? length basis.  Related party purchases of \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a30.9m) were made from other entities in the Travis Perkins group, of which \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021:\u00a30.4m, 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a3nil) remained due at the period-end. Related party rental payments of \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a30.9m) were made to other entities in the Travis Perkins group, of which \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a3nil) remained due at the period-end. Related party rental income of \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a30.4m) was received, of which \u00a3nil (26 weeks to June 2021 and 53 weeks to January 2022: \u00a3nil) remained due at the period-end.

However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern, and the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group will continue in operation. Directors? responsibilities  The Interim Results 2022 is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.\u00a0 The directors are responsible for preparing the Interim Results 2022 in accordance with the DTR of the UK FCA.As disclosed in note 1, the latest annual financial statements of the group were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the next annual financial statements will be prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\u00a0 The directors are responsible for preparing the condensed set of financial statements included in the Interim Results 2022 in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted for use in the UK.In preparing the condensed set of financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group?s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\u00a0 Our responsibility  Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the Interim Results 2022 based on our review.\u00a0 Our conclusion, including our conclusions relating to going concern, are based on procedures that are less extensive than audit procedures, as described in the Basis for conclusion section of this report. The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities This report is made solely to the company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the company in meeting the requirements of the DTR of the UK FCA.\u00a0 Our review has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose.\u00a0 To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.\u00a0Andrew Cawthrayfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP Chartered AccountantsOne SnowhillSnow Hill QueenswayBirminghamB4 6GH\u00a014 September 2022 \u00a0  Source: GfK GB PoS data, sourced from GfK DIY Category Reporting June 2022  For a definition of LFL sales, see note 3 of the interim financial statements \u00a0 cost to sales ratio is the total of Selling costs and Administrative expenses as a proportion of Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_30\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"256\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"368\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ISIN:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">GB00BL6C2002</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Category Code:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">TST</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TIDM:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">WIX</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">LEI Code:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">213800IEX9ZXJRAOL133</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sequence No.:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">188205</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EQS News ID:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1442801</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_31\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_32\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"336\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">End of Announcement</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EQS News Service</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_33\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EQSNWS-UKRegulatory1442801en</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EQSNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66CY-WWR1-JCK0-T217-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435682</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12921\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 EQS Group AG All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EQS Newsfeed (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"36711\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 15, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Against  the  backdrop  of  new Covid-19 variants, increasing inflation  and a few  large technology companies  dominating returns, this was a robust result although behind our benchmark. A significant increase in dividends was  introduced for the third and fourth  interim dividends resulting in a year- on-year  total increase  of 32.5%. Had  we applied  the same  increased level of interim dividend throughout 2021, this would have resulted in an annual dividend yield  of 2.3%.(1) From here, we expect  to continue extending our 55-year track record of annual dividend increases.\"   * In 2021 the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) amounted to 16.5%; its     Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return was 18.6% while the Company's benchmark     index returned 19.6%.   * Performance in the year was significantly ahead of the Company's benchmark     index until the fourth quarter when the index returns became dominated by     the performance of a few of the largest US technology companies.   * The Investment Manager and your Board are confident that the fundamental     characteristics of the portfolio mean that we expect it to generate     outperformance over the longer term.   * A significant increase in dividends was introduced for the third and fourth     interim dividends resulting in a year-on-year total increase of 32.5%; had     we increased the first and second interim dividends to the same level, this     would have resulted in an annual dividend yield of 2.3%.(1)   * We expect to continue extending our 55-year track record of increasing     dividends. 1. This is based on the Company's share price on 31 December 2021. Stock  markets generally posted strong gains in  2021, led once again by the US, as  the global economy initially  continued its recovery from  the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  However,  in  the  fourth  quarter,  with  volatile markets, inflation  pressures building and further variants  of the virus emerging, there was  new uncertainty about the outlook for 2022. As a result, valuations of many stocks  suffered in  this period  and most  of the  performance of the benchmark index  in the final quarter of the year  was generated by a very small number of large   US  technology  stocks.  Overall  performance  and  the  effect  of  the concentration  of  market  returns  is  further  analysed  in  the report of our Investment Manager, WTW, on pages 11 to 15 of the Annual Report. As  a result of  the above factors,  the performance of  the Company's portfolio relative  to its benchmark  declined materially during  the final quarter of the year.  For the  first nine  months of  the year,  as the  vaccine-fuelled market recovery  broadened in impact,  the Company's NAV  Total Return outperformed the benchmark  by 3.4%. Although the Company's portfolio  included some of the large US  technology stocks  it did  not mirror  the degree  of concentration  of such stocks   in   the   benchmark   index.   This   resulted  in  NAV  Total  Return underperformance  relative  to  the  index  of  4.0% in  the  fourth quarter. To illustrate  the  extreme  nature  of  this  concentration,  if the portfolio had included  Apple and Tesla at  the same weight as  the benchmark, the portfolio's performance would have improved by approximately 1.0% in the fourth quarter. This  concentration factor has harmed the performance of the Company relative to the  benchmark for significant  periods over recent  years. This has resulted in the  portfolio underperforming relative to the  benchmark index, and against our target,  since 1 April 2017 when  WTW was appointed  as the Company's Investment Manager.  In  this  period,  excluding  the  effect  of  non-equity  investments previously  held by the  Company, the Company's  annualised NAV Total Return was 0.45% per annum below its benchmark return. In  the past year we have seen  encouraging signs that when the individual stock returns from global markets are less concentrated and focus on long-term company fundamentals,  returns from our portfolio exceed  those of the market index. The Board  and  WTW  remain  confident  that  over  the  longer  term  the Company's diversified but high conviction portfolio is well placed to provide the level of outperformance we target. We announced a number of changes to our Stock Pickers during the year. Following the  termination of Lomas Capital Management's  mandate in February we appointed Sands Capital Management and Metropolis Capital. If and when any further changes are  made, we will announce these once  the transition of assets to the relevant Stock Pickers has been completed. The  discount remained stable for most of the year closing at 5.3% (2020: 3.5%) and  averaging 5.9%. The  Company bought  back just  over 4% of its issued share capital  during the year. The  widening of the discount  is consistent with many other global equity investment trusts. DIVIDEND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED During  2021 the  Board  completed  a  review  of  the  level and funding of the Company's  dividend. After taking account  of the Company's projected investment income  and  significant  accumulated  distributable  reserves,  enhanced by the conversion  of the merger  reserve, the Board  determined it was appropriate and prudent  to  increase  significantly  the  Company's  dividend.  This  has  been implemented  without changing  the Company's  investment objective  or strategy. Before   making   this   decision,   the  Board  sought  views  from  individual shareholders, institutional investors and wealth managers. The  total dividend paid for 2021 will be 19.05p (2020: 14.38p), representing an increase  of 32.5% on that  paid for 2020. For  illustration, if the Company had paid  all interim dividends during  the year at the  same level as the increased third  and fourth interim  dividends, the annual  dividend yield would have been 2.3%(1). Following this increase, through a combination of its investment income and  the use  of its  significant distributable  reserves, the  Board expects to continue  extending the Company's 55-year track record of dividend increases. Of the  Company's  \\xA33.3bn  distributable  reserves  at  31 December 2021, the Board anticipates  that \\xA310.5m  (2020: \\xA310.1m)  will be  utilised to support the total dividend  declared for  2021. The Board  believes that  delivering a higher, but still  sustainable,  level  of  dividend  will benefit existing shareholders and enhance the attractiveness of the Company's shares. INVESTING RESPONSIBLY In  2021 we reaffirmed our  focus on Environmental,  Social and Governance (ESG) factors  through  announcing  a  formal  commitment,  along  with our Investment Manager,  that  the  Company's  portfolio  will  be  managed  to target net zero greenhouse  gas emissions by  2050. In addition, the  aim is to reduce emissions over  the medium term on  a pathway which may  not necessarily show year-on-year improvements  but one that will still be  consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  You  can  read  more  about  the  practical  implications  of  these commitments in our Investment Manager's report on page 24 of the Annual Report. While  we  would  much  rather  encourage  positive change through the Company's stewardship  and engagement activities, we will consider excluding certain types of  stocks from its portfolio. For example, in July we decided to exclude stocks with  significant  exposure  to  thermal  coal  or producing oil from tar sands. Thermal  coal is by far the most  carbon-emitting source of energy in the global fuel  mix, and tar sands are among  the most carbon-intensive means of crude oil production.  If  we  believe  that  positive  change  cannot be brought about by engagement  alone, we may decide to impose further restrictions on the stocks in which the portfolio may be invested. BOARD CHANGES AND SUCCESSION PLANNING I  was pleased  to welcome  Sarah Bates  and Dean  Buckley to the Board in March 2021. These  appointments added  to the  Board's existing  skills and expertise. Sarah  took on the role of Senior  Independent Director when Karl Sternberg, who joined  the Board  in 2015, stood  down in  June 2021 as  part of  the Company's succession  plans. Chris Samuel, who became a Director at the same time as Karl, will  not seek re-election at the  2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and Anthony Brooke,  the third of our Directors  appointed in 2015, will complete his tenure at  the 2023 AGM. I would like to reiterate my thanks to Karl and to thank Chris for  the significant and continuing  contribution he has made  to the Board over the last six and half years. We  are mindful  that the  Board is  currently all  white and all British. As we refresh  the Board,  in addition  to ensuring  that we  have a  diverse range of individuals  with the necessary skills and knowledge, we are aiming to achieve a more  ethnically diverse  Board by  2024 or earlier.  This is  in line  with the recommendations of the Parker Review. In  accordance with our  succession plan, we  anticipate recruiting at least one further  Director  during  2022, which  will  both  enhance the Board's existing skills and help us achieve this aim. ENGAGING WITH SHAREHOLDERS The  increased  use  of  online  meetings  and  webinars  allowed the Company to continue  to engage  with its  stakeholders throughout  the year. During 2021 we conducted three online webinars and the number of shareholders receiving regular updates increased to over 14,000. It  was disappointing  that due  to Covid-related  government restrictions I was again unable to welcome shareholders to the Company's AGM. I am hoping that will not  be the case in 2022. We  will be holding our AGM  in Dundee and, subject to there  being no restrictions in place at  the time, shareholders will be welcome to  attend. In any  event we will  stream the AGM  live to shareholders and they will  be able to  submit questions in  advance or during  the meeting. If we are unable  to address  all questions  during the  meeting, we  will answer  them in writing  afterwards  and  details  of  all  the  questions  and  answers will be published  on the Company's website. Full details of how to view the meeting and submit  questions will be sent  to all shareholders and  will be on our website. After the formal meeting  we will be  holding a webinar  where shareholders will  be able to hear presentations  from not  just WTW  but also  from Metropolis  Capital and Vulcan Value Partners, two of the Company's Stock Pickers. We will keep shareholders updated on arrangements for the AGM, webinar and other investor  events through our website. You can also sign up to receive details of events  and the  Company's monthly  factsheet and  quarterly newsletter  via the website. OUTLOOK We  note with concern the events in Ukraine taking place as we write this report and  the potential consequences this  will have. It is  difficult to predict how this will impact on global markets. At its core, our portfolio in aggregate, contains companies that are now cheaper and  have stronger  and more  stable earnings  potential than the benchmark. The Board  and  WTW  believes  that  as  Omicron-variant  related  fears recede, and provided  that longer-term fundamentals come back  into focus, this will provide the  environment for our portfolio to outperform.  We have seen some evidence of this  in early 2022 with the broadening of  index returns. WTW believes that the domination  of the market  by so few  companies is unlikely  to persist over the longer term. This should provide further opportunities for our Stock Pickers and portfolio to deliver outperformance. Gregor Stewart Chairman 24 February 2022 INVESTMENT MANAGER'S REPORT INVESTMENT YEAR 2021 2021 was  a strong  year for  equity returns.  It began  on a  positive tone for global  markets as vaccine  rollouts gained pace  and the reopening of economies boosted investor sentiment. The broad economic recovery meant that value stocks, small  to mid-cap areas of the market,  and stocks which are more cyclical fared better than the large-cap US-based growth companies, which had dominated returns for  much of the pandemic. However, this market rotation and move away from 'big tech'  was short-lived, as US large-cap  growth stocks rebounded in June leaving value stocks and smaller and mid-cap companies lagging again. This reversal was, in  part, due to  comments from the  US Federal Reserve  suggesting it might act sooner  to control inflation, causing investors  to pile back into long-duration growth  names under the assumption that  inflation would be temporary. The trend towards  large-cap US stocks was significantly  amplified in the last quarter by concerns over the new Omicron variant. A  mix of additional worries emerged: fears of further lockdowns, global supply- chain  problems and regulatory shocks in  China. Emerging markets equity returns were  weighed down by China's cataclysmic  sell-off in the second quarter during their  government's  regulatory  crackdown  on  Chinese  private  education  and technology companies. This was later amplified by fears that Chinese real estate giant, Evergrande Group, might default. Our portfolio's exposure to some Chinese companies detracted value during this period. Inflation  as an  ongoing theme  continued throughout  the year,  with increases leading  the market to debate whether this was transitory or stickier in nature. By  its final meeting of 2021, the  Federal Open Market Committee announced that it  would end the  emergency quantitative easing  programme a few months earlier than  had been expected, in a bid to curb elevated levels of inflation. Fears of rising  interest  rates  pushed  investors  out  of  growth  stocks in December, impacting  some,  but  not  all  growth  players as many large technology stocks continued to outperform. Arguably one of the biggest impacts on markets in 2021 was the growing influence of  retail investors. This  was particularly true  in the US, where individuals' stimulus  cheques(1) were  used to  support the  equity markets. This became big news  in the  early part  of the  year, as  GameStop share  price volatility hit headlines,  and  remained  a  key  presence  throughout. Another example was the special  purpose acquisition company (SPAC)(2), Digital World Acquisition Corp., that  saw shares  soaring nearly  1,000% following the  announcement of a merger with  Trump Media &amp;  Technology Group Corp.  Retail investors strongly supported the  rally in the stock, and  it was one of the  most mentioned stocks on social media  sites such as Reddit  and Twitch. These investors  relied on social media platforms  to define and coordinate their portfolio strategies, often focused on shorter-term  speculative momentum,  and markets  saw a  rise in  volatility and trading  volumes. This  was magnified  by the  leverage taken  over the  year by individual investors and led to some already expensive stocks becoming even more expensive. We  believe that it  is long-term company  fundamentals such as earnings growth, that  drive returns over time. Overall, markets  finished the year with the MSCI ACWI  returning 19.6% over  2021 in sterling  terms, and  although our portfolio lagged  its benchmark, we remain  confident that it is  very well positioned for strong future returns that, most importantly, are sustainable.

THE PORTFOLIO Our  portfolio has delivered  strong absolute returns,  both over 2021 and since our  appointment in April 2017. However, returns  relative to the MSCI ACWI have been disappointing over both periods. What appeared to be a broadening of market conditions  in the earlier  part of 2021, ended  up being a  continuation of the challenging market conditions we have seen over the last few years, where market leadership has remained very narrow in a handful of very large growth companies. Our  Stock Pickers' focus on the  longer-term fundamentals of the companies they hold  was not sufficiently rewarded by the  market. This was largely a result of the   last   quarter,   where  the  Company's  portfolio  lagged  the  benchmark significantly  after being ahead over the first  three quarters of the year. The 2021 market  environment  was  challenging  for  many active equity managers, as illustrated in the AJ Bell 'Manager versus Machine' report for 2021.(3) Based on that  report, 25% of  active global  equity managers  outperformed their passive alternatives last year. Over  the  full  year,  the  Company's  Total  Shareholder Return was 16.5%. The discount  widened  from  3.5% as  of  the  end of 2020 to 5.3% as of 31 December 2021, consistent  with what was  seen in other  global equity investment trusts. The  Company's Net Asset  Value (NAV) Total  Return was 18.6%, 1% below the MSCI ACWI  return of  19.6%, but was  7.8% above the  MSCI ACWI  Equal-Weighted Index which returned 10.8%. The  Board  set  us  a  high  bar  when  we were appointed in April 2017 with an outperformance  target  of  2% per  annum  after  costs  over rolling three-year periods.  The large-cap skewed, and  challenging, market environment experienced since  2018, has meant that  our focus on  finding the best  companies in a wide global universe, regardless of benchmark biases or company size, has resulted in our  being behind our target. We have a long track record in identifying quality Stock  Pickers.  By  asking  them  to  pick  only their best stock ideas for the Company,  and constructing a risk managed portfolio, we believe we are enhancing our portfolio's alpha potential. We have been managing funds based on our multi- manager,  concentrated approach for many years and have experienced tough market environments  in  the  past.  Despite  temporary  drawbacks,  markets eventually normalise  and long-term  fundamentals come  back into  focus, leading to strong relative  returns  for  our  strategies.  We  therefore  have  conviction in the fundamental  strength of  our portfolio  and believe  it will deliver attractive returns once the narrow leadership of the market dissipates. Since  our appointment, the Company has  delivered a Total Shareholder Return of 64.2% (11.0%  per annum) and a NAV Total  Return of 63.6% (10.9% per annum). If, however,  the  impact  of  the  Company's  now  sold  legacy Non-core Assets and subsidiaries  is  excluded,  the  Company  delivered  a  NAV (Excluding Non-core Assets)  Total Return(1) of 66% (11.3% per annum). All these measures are quoted after  all costs. The  MSCI ACWI returned  69.2% (11.7% per annum)  and the MSCI ACWI  Equal-Weighted Index 38.1% (7.0% per annum) over the same period. The MSCI ACWI  Equal-Weighted Index gives all the stocks  in the MSCI ACWI index an equal weighting rather than, as the MSCI ACWI does, weighting them by company size. As a  result, it is a better indicator of how the average-sized stock performed and reduces the impact of mega-cap growth names that dominated. The  table below, illustrates the performance of the MSCI ACWI index relative to the  MSCI ACWI Equal Weighted Index, on a 12-month rolling basis, along with the performance  of  the  Company's  NAV  (Excluding  Non-core  Assets) Total Return relative  to the MSCI ACWI index on the same bases. The MSCI ACWI Equal Weighted Index,  is an indicator of how the average stock performed rather than the small number  of large-cap companies that dominated the market capitalisation weighted index.  In many  ways, the  equal weighted  index is  more reflective of how our Stock  Pickers think about their portfolios -  focusing on their best ideas from anywhere  and  ignoring  short-term  risks  relative  to the benchmark. From the table,  you can note that the Company's portfolio performs better when a broader set  of stocks share in the market  momentum and underperforms when a few large- cap  stocks dominate. In  2021 the bulk of  our underperformance occurred in the final quarter when the size bias in the market was largest. 1. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/many-americans-used-part-of-their-</url> coronavirus-stimulus-check-to-trade-stocks.html 2.

While  the  current  narrowness  of  markets  could clearly continue for a while longer  (it has already  lasted longer than  we anticipated was  likely), we are confident  that at some point there will be  a reversal in this trend, as we saw briefly in the first half of 2021. We believe that this reversal could take hold for  a much longer period. That would  be extremely beneficial for our portfolio and  is one of the reasons we are so excited about it today. In the meantime, we are  comforted that we own a number  of high-quality businesses that are growing faster than the market (have higher earnings per share growth), with more stable earnings  and which are cheaper than the  market (have a lower Price to Earnings ratio).

Notes:  The Price to Earnings ratio, also called the P/E ratio, is an indication of  the worth of a company. It is the amount per share that an investor will pay for each \\xA31 of that company's earnings. One way to calculate the P/E ratio is to use actual reported earnings over the past 12 months. This is referred to as the trailing  P/E ratio. The P/E  ratio can also be  calculated using an estimate of future earnings (the forward P/E).

STOCK PERFORMANCE The main reason for our underperformance was that we held more mid and small-cap stocks  and less  large-cap stocks  than the  index. The  table below show that, based  on company size  alone, our size  positioning cost us approximately 3% in performance  terms.  This  was  partially  offset  by good stock selection which improved  performance by  approximately 0.8%. This  negative effect  of the size allocation  impacted our stock selection and  allocation across the regional and sector  level attributions. If we look at  the sectors in which we invested, our overweight  in  Communication  Services,  which  tends  to  have  less large-cap companies  in it and  which did less  well than the  index, detracted some value leading  to a negative sector  allocation effect. Our overweight  is a result of our  Stock Pickers' company selections as opposed  to a macro view on the sector overall.  In addition, stock  selection was negative  as the smaller and mid-cap companies  we held  in each  sector did  less well  than their larger cap peers. Looking at the regions in which we invest we benefited from being underweight in Asia  and the  Emerging Markets,  this benefit  was outweighed  by the choice of stocks  which reduced performance by  2.8%. This negative stock selection impact was  largest  in  the  US,  with  our underweight to US large-caps significantly penalising  the  portfolio.  In  the  following  section we explain this in more detail  and  give  examples  of  the  stock  selections  that  contributed, both negatively and positively, to performance during the year. +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ |                       | Allocation Effect | Selection Effect | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | ATTRIBUTION BY SIZE   | -3.0              | 0.8              | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | ATTRIBUTION BY SECTOR | -0.8              | -1.4             | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ | ATTRIBUTION BY REGION | 0.6               | -2.8             | +-----------------------+-------------------+------------------+ Data to 31 December 2021.

Key detractors to performance:   * Certain emerging markets stocks, particularly, Chinese stocks, with our     holdings in Baidu and New Oriental Education alone detracting -0.9%   * In the US, we did not hold Apple and Tesla which detracted -0.7% and some US     stocks that were held such as Charter Communications, Fleetcor Technologies     and Visa, lagged the market   * Some stocks held within the Information Technology and Consumer     Discretionary sectors together with negative allocation impacts from our     slight overweight in Communication Services (one of the worse performing     sectors) also impacted performance With  the  Chinese  government  regulatory  crackdown  and market turmoil around Evergrande, several Chinese stocks detracted value over the year. The  two key  detractors were  Baidu and  New Oriental Education. Baidu, China's internet  search and online community leader, was  held in the portfolio by both River  and Mercantile  Asset Management  and Black  Creek Investment Management. Despite  solid fundamentals, shares  have suffered with  the general sell-off in Chinese  equities, with  the stock  down 30% over  the year.  Nonetheless, these Stock  Pickers  remain  favourable  to  Baidu  and  view  the loss as short-term volatility  within the context of their long-term investment horizon. Baidu is a technology-driven  company and is considered a leader in artificial intelligence (AI)  research, including technology for autonomous vehicles. It is also growing its  cloud  computing  service  offerings  in  China  and  Southeast Asia and is considered  a leader  in AI  cloud services  in China.  With Baidu's only modest direct  exposure  to  the  areas  of  increased  regulation,  its core market of internet  advertising is  competitive and  its areas  of growth,  such as AI and autonomous vehicles, are strongly supported by the Chinese Communist Party, both Stock  Pickers' outlooks for the company are favourable, in particular given its attractive valuation. The  other significant  detractor was  New Oriental  Education, the Chinese for- profit  education  business,  a  company  that  was  held  by Sustainable Growth Advisers  (SGA). SGA had  owned New Oriental  Education for a  long time. It had generated  significant value  for investors  as its  share price multiplied. SGA sold  down the  company's shares  in February  2020 at a significant profit from their  original acquisition  cost. More  recently, regulation  in the sector has been  expected and SGA's  view was that  ultimately regulation would benefit the strongest players as they would be best able to navigate the regulations, absorb the cost and gain market share. SGA bought shares in the company after the share price  fell  approximately  50% from  its  peak  but,  as  it  became  clear the regulatory clampdown was going to materially change the profitability allowed in the  sector, SGA quickly exited  the position, at a  loss. Despite being a major negative contributor to performance over the year, SGA's holding in New Oriental added value since April 2017. The next biggest detractor to performance was not holding Apple which rallied by more  than 35% over the year. Not  holding Tesla also hurt relative performance, with  the stock  up 51% over  the year.  Last year,  many active growth managers underperformed(1),  being underweight both stocks. Tesla  is valued at more than all  other key auto manufacturers in  the world combined, despite accounting for just  over 1% of global car sales. Over 2021, the company's market cap increased by  over half a trillion dollars, essentially the equivalent of a new JP Morgan, or  a Procter &amp; Gamble, whereas Apple added approximately the same amount to its market capitalisation in just 6 weeks from mid-November 2021. 1. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1f96d83-1a72-47d7-a4af-2483bd49b024\">https://www.ft.com/content/d1f96d83-1a72-47d7-a4af-2483bd49b024</url> Key contributors to performance:   * Stock selection within the Communication Services sector was positive. Our     holding in Alphabet and Interpublic Group of Companies added value, as did     being underweight Tencent and Verizon Communications Inc.   * Stock selection within the Health Care sector with a number of our holdings     performing strongly such as CVS Health Corporation, UnitedHealth Group and     Novo Nordisk   * Our underweight in Emerging Markets, which was the worst performing region     over the period Internet  search leader Alphabet Inc. was the largest contributor to performance during  the year, up  66%. Alphabet's reported revenues  grew significantly over the  year,  largely  on  the  back  of  strong  growth  in advertising revenues, including  solid  growth  in  YouTube  revenues.  Google Cloud, another business segment of the tech giant, also delivered solid results despite still being loss making. The  company is held across five Stock  Pickers as at the 31 December 2021, with many  impressed by the company's execution  and growth potential while remaining cognisant of valuation and rising regulatory risks. The  second largest contributor to  performance was Nvidia Corporation (Nvidia), up  an impressive 127% over  the year. Nvidia  designs graphics processing units (GPUs)  for the gaming and  professional markets, as well  as 'system on a chip' (SoC)  units  for  the  mobile  computing  and automotive market. The company is benefitting from a sustained increase in demand for its products, driven in part by  gaming consoles that use  Nvidia's GPUs (which constitute  more than half of its  revenue) and in  part by cryptocurrency  infrastructure. Evergrowing demand for  the company's  cloud storage  has also  fuelled robust spending by Nvidia's largest  customers  and  has  been  a  source  of  high margin revenue strength. Continued  growth  in  the  firm's  large  gaming  sector business and a growing automotive  pipeline  are  other  key  factors  in  the positive outlook for the company.  Nvidia was held in the portfolio by both GQG Partners and Vulcan Value Partners over 2021. KKR  &amp; Co.  Inc., an  American global  investment company  held by  Vulcan Value Partners,  was the third largest contributor to performance for the year. KKR is a global investment firm that manages multiple alternative asset classes. It has stable  capital  with  a  stable  client  base and predictable earnings. KKR has enjoyed  the  favourable  tailwind  of  increasing  allocations  by investors to private and alternative investments. STOCK PICKER PERFORMANCE In  the 12 months to  31 December 2021, only three  out of our  ten global Stock Pickers outperformed the benchmark index. GQG Partners' emerging markets mandate which has a lower exposure to China outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets Index over the year. The cyclical rotation at the beginning of the year allowed our value-based Stock Pickers  to  recover  some  of  the  previous  years' losses, with Lyrical Asset Management  (Lyrical) posting  the strongest  returns in  the first  half of the year.  In contrast,  the portfolio's  large-cap, growth-oriented  Stock Pickers, such  as Sustainable Growth Advisers (SGA),  were amongst the poorer performers. As   concerns  over  inflation  diminished  somewhat  mid-year,  growth-oriented managers  recovered ground and the recovery in value-oriented managers' momentum faltered,  until December, when  value rebounded again.  In the 12-month period, which  saw  fluctuations  in  terms  of  style  and size dominance, Vulcan Value Partners  and  Lyrical  were  the  best  performing  managers,  with  River  and Mercantile  Asset  Management,  the  deep-value  recovery  manager,  the biggest underperformer. The  volatility and rotation  in markets this  year illustrate the importance of maintaining  a  mixture  of  different  Stock Pickers whose different investment styles  allow the  portfolio to  gain upside  in different  market scenarios and deliver smoother returns. OUTLOOK Despite  disappointing relative  returns in  the fourth  quarter of 2021, we are very  excited by the current portfolio's  fundamentals and how these are helping to  position the portfolio for 2022. As of  the end of 2021, the portfolio looks better  value than the benchmark, with stronger and more stable earnings growth. Although  long-term fundamentals were  less of a  focus in 2021, we believe they will  come back into the  limelight, as they are  the driver of long-term equity returns. Some  of our stocks have  been hurt on a  relative basis by the sentiment-driven market,  being overly penalised by short-term considerations despite maintaining very  strong long-term credentials. Our Stock Pickers stand by these firms. They include  names such as  Booking.com, other consumer  discretionary names such as Adidas,  or payments companies such as  MasterCard or Visa. These companies were all  hit  by  the  Omicron  variant-related  uncertainty  as  well as occasional idiosyncratic  concerns. Despite the short-term  impacts of the Omicron variant, companies  such as Booking.com, with  dominant market positions, should flourish over the long term. With the threat of persistent inflation now present, those growth companies with particularly  lofty valuations are  most vulnerable to  the associated impact of tightening  financial conditions, particularly once Omicron fears recede, and as longer-term  fundamentals come back into focus.  We have already seen volatility in the early part of 2022 as markets weigh up the impact of rising inflation and increasing costs of capital. We believe the overall growth rate of corporate profits is set to slow in 2022, relative  to  the  recovery  levels  of  growth  seen in 2021, returning to pre- pandemic  trend growth perhaps as early as the end of 2022. While the outcome is uncertain,  we expect  inflation rates  to slow  as commodity  prices stabilise, workers  continue to  return to  the workforce  after Covid pressures abate; and some  of the global supply constraints currently disrupting industry continue to ease. However,  there are risks to the upside  in terms of inflation trends and equity market  returns.  The  increased  geopolitical  tensions surrounding Ukraine and Russia's recent actions are further fuelling volatility and compounding concerns around  inflationary impacts  on energy  prices associated  with this escalating conflict. We could also see elevated price pressures persisting for longer given continued  risks of supply-side constraints and  the impact of very tight labour markets.  As such,  a fundamental  bottom-up analysis  of the resiliency of each company  to inflationary pressures is  required. Valuations continue to compress driven by rising discount rates and continued recovery in earnings for Covid-hit sectors.  We  expect  margins  to  be  the  deciding  factor  for equity returns (particularly  in the  US where  the economy  is further  along in  the business cycle).  Companies best able  to pass on  (or avoid) rising  input prices whilst navigating  the impact of rising yields across many developed markets may be set to  navigate  this  environment  well.  Our  Stock  Pickers  have  been actively evaluating the impacts of higher inflation on their companies to ensure they can weather that storm. Regarding  China, recent regulatory changes  have dominated 2021 for the region. Navigating  these changes may be  the main challenge for  investors in the short term  against a global backdrop  of rising inflation in  the West and prevailing US-China  tensions.  Overall,  whilst  uncertainty  does  cloud  the  region, we continue  to believe  the long-term  case for  Chinese equities  remains and the region  provides  selective  investment  opportunities,  potentially  broadening sources of diversity available to investors. As  current  global  constraints  start  to  ease, and concerns over the Omicron variant  continue to dissipate, we believe we  will see a continuation of market recovery, providing great opportunities. PORTFOLIO CASE STUDY: CLOUD COMPUTING Demand  for  cloud  computing  is  growing  rapidly  driven  by  the  constantly increasing amount of global data produced, and the need for complex and flexible computation.  Cloud solutions are also  offering enhanced employee flexibility - which is critically important due to the increasing permanence of remote working and  adaptability companies  will need  in the  future. Covid-19 has accelerated these  trends. Cloud has also  helped transform software by  allowing for a more subscription  and consumption-based  business model,  enabling more frequent and seamless  software updates, significantly improving customer profitability, ease of use and functionality. We  hold  several  stocks  that  benefit  both  directly and indirectly from the migration  of businesses  toward greater  cloud computing.  From the  well known mega-caps  such as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft or  Baidu, to other names such as Oracle,  Dell, Western Digital, ServiceNow, Twilio, Autodesk and salesforce.com, these are just a few of the stocks held that benefit from cloud computing. Ultimately,  cloud computing  companies are  seeing more  recurring revenues via longer-term   relationships  with  businesses  which  has  been  the  source  of attractive  growth for  the segment.  While the  growth opportunity  is massive, selectivity will be increasingly critical. PORTFOLIO CASE STUDY: SEMICONDUCTORS Semiconductors  are  an  essential  component  of  electronic  devices, enabling advances   in   communications,   computing,   healthcare,   military   systems, transportation, clean energy and countless other applications. Due to their role in  the  fabrication  of  electronic  devices,  semiconductors are a high growth segment  of the market which will  benefit from increasing digitalisation of the economy.  One of our Stock Pickers expects annualised industry revenue growth to accelerate from 5% over the past decade to more than 10% over the next 10 years. Historically,  the semiconductor industry has been largely driven by devices per human.  In the future,  it is likely  the industry will  benefit from trends not limited  by human use (The Internet-of-Things), and new technologies that demand greater  processing power than traditional  smartphone devices (e.g. virtual and augmented reality). We   hold  many  semiconductor  companies,  including  Nvidia,  Qorvo,  Skyworks Solutions,   ASML  Holdings,  Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Company  and Broadcom,  to name but a  few. Current demand for  semiconductor chips is vastly outstripping supply, impacting production across a number of industries from car manufacturers  to  consumer  appliance  producers  -  a  trend that is likely to continue  into  2022. The  semiconductor  industry  is also benefitting from the transition  to  a  world  aligned  with  a  2\\xB0C climate  target,  being critical components  in electric vehicles (EVs) and other  products that form part of the climate solution. The concentrated market, coupled with demand outstripping supply, has caused our Stock Pickers to focus on the best-in-class companies in the semiconductor space where  they  see  the  highest  likelihood  of sustainable earnings growth going forward. PORTFOLIO CASE STUDY: CLIMATE SOLUTIONS Climate  change is one of the biggest  issues facing investors today and both we and  our Stock Pickers, are actively looking at climate-related risks within the portfolio.  But the climate transition also offers opportunities by investing in those companies that are providing solutions to others in this space. The  portfolio includes a number  of companies that are  working on solutions to help  the  economy  reduce  climate-related  risks,  including  Bureau  Veritas, Schneider Electric, Owens Corning, ANDRITZ and many more. Bureau  Veritas  is  a  global  leader  in  the  provision  of carbon and energy consultancy,  verification  and  certification  services.  Their team of experts support  the development of  bespoke energy and  carbon management strategies to set  objectives,  targets  and  management  plans,  helping  companies  in their decarbonisation journey. Schneider  Electric SE  is a  French multinational  company providing energy and automation  digital solutions  for efficiency  and sustainability.  It addresses homes,  buildings,  data  centres,  infrastructure  and industries, by combining energy  technologies, real-time automation, software and services. It was ranked the  world's  most  sustainable  corporation  by  Corporate Knights in 2021.(1) Schneider  Electric helps customers reduce  their carbon footprints via products and software tools that optimise energy management and industrial processes. Owens  Corning  is  a  global  building  and  industrial  materials  leader. The company's  three  integrated  businesses  are  dedicated  to the manufacture and advancement  of a  broad range  of insulation,  roofing and fibreglass composite materials.  Owens Corning provides innovative products and sustainable solutions that  address  energy  efficiency,  product  safety,  renewable  energy, durable infrastructure and labour productivity. ANDRITZ   is  an  international  technology  group  providing  plants,  systems, equipment  and  services  for  various  industries.  ANDRITZ  Hydro  is a global supplier  of electromechanical  systems and  services ('from water-to-wire') for hydropower plants and one of the leaders in the world market for hydraulic power generation. ANDRITZ offers technologies for producing steam and electricity from renewable fuels as well as the efficient use of traditional fossil fuels. In  addition to  the above  stocks, we  also hold  a number of energy companies. Although  their carbon footprint  might be significant  now, we believe they are also  part of  the solution,  not only  because they  have plans  to align their carbon   reduction  trajectory  with  the  Paris  Agreement,  but  also  through researching  and  investing  in  alternative  energy  sources and carbon capture technology.  Our Stock  Pickers incorporate  an ESG  lens in their evaluation of these  companies and  also, along  with EOS  at Federated Hermes (EOS), actively engage  with  them  to  steer  them  towards better practices, reinforcing their engagement via voting activity. We provide a BP engagement case study by EOS via the Climate Action 100+ initiative in our Responsible Investment section on page 25 of the Annual Report. 1.

Stock  selection  remains  the  key  driver  of performance and of the portfolio's  risk  profile.  The  portfolio  maintained  a  regional  and sector allocation approximately in line with that of the benchmark as a result. By  far the  largest country  weighting is  to the  US, which saw strong returns throughout   2021. At  57.6% of  the  portfolio  as  at  31 December  2021, this represents  a slight  underweight to  the benchmark  weight which was 61.2%. The portfolio  had  an  allocation  to  the  UK  of 10.5% as at 31 December 2021, an overweight  of 6.9% versus  the MSCI  ACWI, and  our biggest regional overweight position.  Most UK  investments are  opportunities selected  by our  value Stock Pickers and, whilst many of these companies are based in the UK, they tend to be global in nature. The best performing sector over the period was Energy, up 38% for the year, with our allocation of 3.4% within the portfolio being in line with the index weight. The  sector was boosted  by soaring energy  prices throughout the year. Consumer Discretionary  was the worst  performing sector over  the year and the portfolio was slightly underweight, with a position of 10.8% as of 31 December 2021 versus a weight of 12.4% in the MSCI ACWI.

INVESTMENT RISK AND POSITIONING The Company has both long-term and short-term borrowing facilities to provide it with  flexibility to  manage gearing.  In 2021, we  maintained a  gross level of gearing  of  between  9.2% and  10.2%, reflecting  our  positive  view of equity markets.  Given the strong equity returns  in 2021, gearing added value over the period. In December we recommended the Company increase its short-term borrowing facility by up to \\xA3100m. At 31 December 2021 the Company has unsecured long-term loans  amounting to \\xA3160.0m.  In addition the  Company had drawn  \\xA3180.5m of its approved  borrowing facilities of \\xA3250.0m plus  an accordion option of a further \\xA350.0m. Portfolio  turnover was 65.7% for  the 12 months to  December 2021. The level of turnover  was  higher  than  might  otherwise  be  expected,  in part due to the addition of Sands Capital Management and Metropolis Capital as Stock Pickers and the termination of Lomas Capital Management's mandate during the year. Annualised expected volatility was 19% p.a. for the portfolio and 18.3% p.a. for the benchmark as at 31 December 2021. Active Share, the measure of how different the portfolio is to the benchmark, was 75%, with Active Risk (or tracking error) at  2.7% p.a.  as  at  31 December  2021. We  have  retained  a broadly balanced exposure  to styles, sectors,  and geographical regions  in 2021 relative to the benchmark.  This is in line with our  process and has been an appropriate method to  manage risk, as performance of  the different investment styles, markets and sectors  differed significantly,  in another  particularly volatile year. During 2021, we did not implement any currency hedging for the portfolio. Our reference benchmark  is unhedged, and  our currency exposure  is in line  with our country allocations.  As part  of our  portfolio risk  management, we monitor and manage country  and currency  exposure, aiming  not to  diverge significantly  from the benchmark  allocations.  However,  we  can  hedge  currency  risk  as  required, depending on our view of the risk profile.

We monitor and  continuously review  the performance  of each  Stock Picker. Changes can be made  at any time if we believe there is the potential to improve expected risk- adjusted  returns.  Changes  in  our  views  on  the Stock Pickers are driven by factors  that impact on  their sustainability of  competitive advantage, such as changes  to  key  personnel  or  company  culture  and  to corporate activity or investment  style drift. The Company will  usually announce any changes of Stock Pickers  once  the  transition  of  assets  to  the  new  appointee(s)  has been completed.

'JUPITER'  and the Jupiter  logo are the trade  marks of Jupiter  Investment Management Group  Ltd. 2. Appointed 16 April 2021. Lomas Capital Management was a Stock Picker until 3 February 2021. HOW WE MANAGE THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO We have overall responsibility for the management of the Company's portfolio. We have  built and manage a team of  diverse, best-in-class* Stock Pickers, each of whom  invest in  a bespoke  selection of  typically 10-20 of their 'best ideas'. 'Investing For Generations' is the backbone of the philosophy of the Company. It brings  long-term  principles  into  how  we  invest  your  money, including ESG considerations.  This helps us define our investment approach, ensuring that the Stock  Pickers' thinking and practices are aligned  with the core beliefs of the Company  and that  they invest  responsibly. We  consider this  a key factor for long-term success. HOW WE CHOOSE OUR STOCK PICKERS We  aim to forge abiding  partnerships with our Stock  Pickers, enabling them to focus  on what they do best. Our Stock  Pickers are focused on the long term and do  not necessarily look  at volatility as  a risk, but  more as an opportunity: risk is more associated with the permanent loss of capital. After  a number of  years where no  significant manager changes  were made, this year  saw a number  of changes. Following  the termination of  Lomas' mandate in February, due to the surprise decision of the firm to wind down its business, we appointed  two  new  Stock  Pickers:  Sands  Capital Management, LLC (Sands) and Metropolis Capital Limited (Metropolis). Sands is a growth manager. It seeks out opportunities  in businesses offering sustainable, above-average earnings growth with  leadership positions and significant  competitive advantages, clear value- add  and  financial  strength.  Metropolis  adopts  a  value-based  approach  to investing. It looks to identify mispriced opportunities across a broad universe. This  ranges from  high-quality companies  in industries  with poor economics or out-of-favour  sectors, to  ones where  its assessment  of growth differs to the market  or  where  growth  investors  are  selling  due  to  decelerating growth momentum. We invest significant time, research and effort in identifying Stock Pickers for the  Company's  portfolio,  leveraging  our  extensive  research network, robust process  and  expertise.  Our  approach  involves  identifying  the  skills  and characteristics  we believe are essential in  good Stock Pickers. We believe the key  to identifying tomorrow's  high-performing Stock Pickers  lies in extensive due  diligence  combined  with  qualitative  and quantitative analysis. This due diligence focuses on:   * the investment processes, resources and decision-making that make up the     Stock Picker's competitive advantage;   * the culture and alignment of the organisation that leads to sustainability     of that competitive advantage;   * their approach to responsible investment. We expect our Stock Pickers to     have a demonstrable process in place that identifies and assesses material     ESG factors; we aim to appoint Stock Pickers who actively engage with the     companies in which they invest and have an effective voting policy. When     necessary, we engage with the Stock Pickers and guide them towards better     practices; and   * the operational infrastructure that minimises risk from a compliance,     regulatory and operational perspective. We  do not  believe that  quantitative assessments  on their  own provide enough information to give us an advantage in assessing the potential of a Stock Picker to  outperform. Our Manager Research team formulates a view on each Stock Picker we  seek to  rate over  a series  of meetings.  We look  beyond past performance numbers  to try to understand what 'competitive  edge' each Stock Picker has and whether  that edge is likely to be sustainable in the future. We dig deeper into the  investments made  by each  Stock Picker  using a  case study methodology to understand  the depth of fundamental  analysis involved in investment decisions. We look at matters such as the team's process for selecting stocks, adherence to this  process  through  different  market  conditions,  relevant  team dynamics, training  and experience as well  as performance track record.  We see the track record  as just a single  data point and, without  the context of the additional data  we assess, it is  unlikely to persuade us  that a Stock Picker is skilled. Our  expectation of success further rises where  we engage with Stock Pickers to structure  bespoke high conviction, concentrated strategies usually of 10 to 20 stocks,  at an attractive cost and we believe portfolios are more robust when we diversify  across Stock Pickers with differing approaches. High active share and concentrated  portfolios are  advantageous. Academic  research supports this(.1) The  broadest opportunity  set is  provided by  unrestricted global mandates, to allow skilled Stock Pickers the widest scope. 1.

RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OUR APPROACH TO RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT A  core part of our  manager research, selection and  monitoring procedure is an assessment  of ESG risks and opportunities. We require our Stock Pickers to have a  demonstrable  process  in  place  that  identifies  and assesses material ESG factors.  We expect our Stock Pickers to act where they determine an ESG risk is likely  to affect the performance  of an investee company  and that this risk is outweighing  any potential financial  reward. Although we  consider the 'E', 'S' and 'G' factors within our approach, in our report for this year we have focused more on the 'E' component and, in particular, climate risk. E IS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT Whilst climate-related risk is first and foremost a physical environmental risk, it  is also a  financial risk. It  is one of  the key areas  that we require our Stock Pickers to identify and assess when they select stocks for the portfolio. In  2021, both we and the Board recognised the impact that climate-related risks could  have,  and  made  a  commitment  to  a  target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions  from the portfolio by 2050 and, on the way, to halve them by 2030. In addition to playing a part in the necessary transition to a low-carbon world, we believe  that this will be beneficial to  the expected returns of the portfolio, ensuring  we reduce the transition risks in the portfolio and investing ahead of other investors moving in this direction. This  means that, by the  middle of the century,  the amount of greenhouse gases across  the  portfolio  must  overall  net  off  to  zero, taking account of the emissions  arising from the  day-to-day operations of  the companies held in the portfolio. This  target is consistent with  the goals of the  Paris Agreement and meets the principles  of the Institutional Investors Group  on Climate Change (IIGCC), Net Zero  Investing Framework (NZIF)(1)  and the Net  Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI)  of which  we are  signatories. We  have always  recognised the power of collaboration and that it is particularly important in the area of ESG. WTW is a signatory   to  the  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment  and  the  2020 UK Stewardship  Code,  signalling  the  robustness  of our approach to stewardship, including our partnership with EOS, a stewardship specialist, which provides our Stock   Pickers   with   voting  recommendations  and  engages  with  companies, legislators, regulators, and industry bodies on our and the Company's behalf. Climate  risk is a key consideration and  engagement priority for EOS as well as our Stock Pickers. EOS and a number of our Stock Pickers are involved in Climate Action  100+, a  collaborative  engagement  initiative  which aims to ensure the world's  largest  corporate  greenhouse  gas  emitters  take necessary action on climate change. We illustrate a case study of their engagement with BP below. TARGET NET ZERO: OUR CARBON JOURNEY PLAN Plotting the net zero journey, is a developing science; identifying what data we should  collect and how best  to measure and analyse  it is part of our evolving Carbon  Journey Plan  methodology. This  will include  a rigorous framework with which to measure and evaluate our progress, along with controls to help keep the portfolio on track. Our  aim is  to align  our Carbon  Journey Plan  to limiting  global temperature increases well below 2\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. We have also set a mid-way milestone  where, by 2030, we plan to have achieved a 50% reduction in portfolio emissions relative to 2019. This provides the Company with a strategic framework to  manage and monitor the reduction in  carbon exposure over time. Our triggers and intermediate targets will be developed and shared as we report, in the years to come, on our progress on this journey. 1. The Net Zero Investment Framework, published in March 2021, provides a common set  of recommended actions,  metrics and methodologies  through which investors can maximise their contribution to achieving global net zero global emissions by 2050 or sooner. EOS CASE STUDY: BP plc Climate Action 100+ In  the 2019 Annual Report  we described EOS  and Climate Action 100+ engagement with  BP which culminated  with the 2019 shareholder  resolution calling for the company  to set out a business strategy that is consistent with the goals of the Paris  Agreement on climate change. The resolution gained management support and was  co-filed by nearly 10% of  the shareholder base, passing  with a very large majority at the shareholder meeting in 2019. In early 2020, the newly-appointed CEO, Bernard Looney, announced a new ambition for  the company to transition  to net zero by  2050 or sooner, supported by 10 underpinning  corporate aims. The company has since laid out a detailed strategy by which it intends to transition the energy it produces from high carbon to low carbon, including short, medium and long-term targets and aims on the journey to net  zero. The company also has  market-leading disclosures demonstrating how it evaluates  new  material  capex  investments  for  consistency  with  the  Paris Agreement goals. EOS  further intervened at  the 2020 shareholder meeting,  asking the company to reconsider  its assumptions  for Paris-consistent  investment and  its long-term oil-and-gas  price assumptions in light of  the coronavirus pandemic. During its Q2  2021 results, BP reduced the long-term oil-and-gas price assumptions used in its  financial  statements,  giving  shareholders  greater  visibility about the firm's climate-related risks. EOS  continue  to  engage  with  BP  to  seek  assurances that it has in place a rigorous   investment  process,  with  economic  criteria  consistent  with  the company's   purpose  and  a  range  of  price  scenarios  including  assumptions consistent  with the Paris goals.  They are also requesting  that BP extends its net  zero goal beyond  the energy produced  by the company  to apply also to the energy products it markets and sells to customers.

APPROACH: LOOK FORWARD AND AVOID OVERSIMPLIFICATION Divestment from carbon intensive industries can often be self-defeating. We want to  encourage corporates,  industries and  countries to  move towards low-carbon solutions.  Starving  them  of  investment  can potentially discourage them from making  a  positive  change.  Many  climate  solutions  are  being  developed by companies  that are currently  highly carbon intensive  but which will provide a path for the whole economy to decarbonise more quickly. It  might not always be in the Company's shareholders' financial interests to be ahead  of the pathway  to net zero.  This year, some  of our Stock Pickers found attractive  opportunities in  the Energy  sector, leading  to an increase in the portfolio's  carbon  footprint.  These  stocks  contributed  positively  to  the portfolio, as energy prices sky-rocketed, driven by supply chain issues. Many of these  companies are, however, on a decarbonisation path that is consistent with the Paris Agreement, something that we and our Stock Pickers monitor. Often they are heavy investors in green energy and will be a key part of the solution. This  approach means that  we place greater  importance on effective stewardship and,  more  specifically,  voting  and  engagement  as  a  means  to support the transition to a low-carbon economy. We  provide an illustration of the  carbon emissions and Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI) of the current holdings in the portfolio and the index, as well as  the trend  in the  emissions and  WACI of  these stocks through time. Carbon emissions for the portfolio is higher than for the benchmark, due to some of our Stock Pickers having increased  their allocation to  energy stocks earlier  in the year. Our exposure will depend on opportunities that arise and, at any given point in time, we will not necessarily always be ahead of the pathway to net zero. The weighted average carbon  intensity,  a  measure  of  a  portfolio's  exposure  to  carbon-related potential  market and  regulatory risks,  is however  lower than  the benchmark. Critically, in terms of both measures, the carbon emissions of the stocks in the portfolio are reducing at a faster rate than the stocks in the benchmark.

ENGAGEMENT EOS engaged with 128 companies on 571 issues and objectives There  are numerous 'layers' of engagement within the Company's portfolio. These include  our  engagement  with  the  Stock  Pickers  in order to assess how well climate-related  issues, as  well as  wider sustainability  issues, are factored into  their  investment  process  and  stewardship  activities  and when needed, steering them towards better practices. We also engage with the asset management industry  at large regarding sustainability  and stewardship practices, and with industry  bodies, governments, regulators, and  policy makers, both individually and via several collaborative initiatives. In  addition, we partner  with EOS, who  engages with companies, regulators, and governments on our and the Company's behalf. Our Stock Pickers and EOS regularly engage with companies to ensure they improve disclosure and change behaviours to enhance  their climate resilience. This  includes collaborative initiatives such as  Climate Action 100+. Over the course of 2021, EOS engaged with 128 companies held  within  the  Company's  portfolio  on  571 issues and objectives. Of these engagements  within the environmental category, which accounted for 25% of total engagement, 74% of environmental engagements related to climate change. MANDATE CHANGES We excluded companies with significant exposure to tar sands and thermal coal Exclusion can be warranted in situations where, for example, exposure to climate risk  cannot be resolved via  other means such as  engagement. Where a company's business  relies heavily on activities  that are likely to  be phased out in the 'net  zero world',  engagement is  unlikely to  be fruitful.  In 2021, the Board decided  to exclude companies with significant revenue exposure to tar sands and thermal coal from the portfolio. CLIMATE SOLUTIONS Our  Stock Pickers will  hold companies trying  to develop more energy efficient alternatives and new technology solutions Finally,  we should note that climate change also presents attractive investment opportunities  for our Stock Pickers. Many  companies are involved in addressing climate  resilience and our Stock  Pickers actively invest in  a number of them. This  includes  companies  in  some  traditionally  'dirty'  sectors, working on developing  more  energy  efficient  alternatives,  as  well  as  new innovative companies offering new technology and/or solutions. S IS FOR SOCIAL Whilst  this year we report more on climate risk, we do not forget other factors that  appear  closer  to  home.  Social  and  ethical topics regularly represent approximately a quarter of EOS's engagement activity. During the last couple of years, EOS has recognised how the pandemic has put key workers in supermarkets, retail pharmacies, logistics and the caring professions under acute pressure - but the ongoing pandemic has also demonstrated their true value  to society more clearly  than ever. As a  result, EOS has engaged closely with  companies on how they have treated their employees, given their importance to overall business performance. In  their engagements with  companies, EOS recognised  that companies in certain sectors faced unenviable choices - between making workers redundant or going out of  business, for example.  Hospitality, travel and  high street retail were all badly  hit, triggering thousands of job losses.  EOS wrote an open letter to the CEOs  of the companies in its engagement  programme, asking how they were making difficult decisions in relation to their employees, supply chains, customers and other stakeholders. Companies that made workers redundant after benefitting from taxpayer-funded  bailouts or  furlough schemes  have attracted public criticism, particularly if they had spent the pre-crisis years using surplus cash for share buybacks.  EOS has  encouraged a  responsible approach  to the use of government furlough schemes, and fairness between executive and staff pay. In addition to the engagement activity undertaken by EOS, our Stock Pickers also engage  on social issues  with their companies.  SGA, for instance, engaged with Walt Disney on the topic of modern slavery risk within the supply chain of their licensed merchandised goods. MANAGER ENGAGEMENT CASE STUDY: SGA ENGAGEMENT WITH WALT DISNEY Walt  Disney is one of  the world's largest licensors  with brands spanning Walt Disney  Studios, DisneyPixar, Marvel,  ESPN and more.  Given the company's broad exposure  to  its  suppliers,  Disney  takes  a  risk-based approach to auditing suppliers  with the vast majority of audits  conducted by third parties in high- risk  areas. If corrective issues are identified, suppliers are given one chance to  remedy the  issue before  termination of  the relationship. Audits currently prioritise  the health  and safety  of the  manufacturing environment  and while forced  labour is an area  of audit, it is  not currently a significant feature. Disclosures  into Walt  Disney's supply  chain are  limited and  the company has opportunities  to increase transparency, particularly into its suppliers further down  the chain. SGA encouraged management to take action and publicly map these supply  chains; they  will continue  to monitor  the company's progress in these areas of risk. Source: Sustainable Growth Advisers. G IS FOR GOVERNANCE Good governance gets great results Stock  Pickers  are  expected  to  promote  good  governance by exercising their investor  rights  and  by  engaging  with  companies on issues of governance and shareholder value and in the long-term interest of the Company's shareholders. It  is  no  surprise  that  the  majority  of  voting activity and a significant proportion  of engagement activity therefore  continues to relate to Governance- related issues. This can be on a number of issues such as Board Diversity, Board Independence,   Executive   Remuneration,   Shareholder  Rights  and  Succession Planning. Voting: Stock Pickers voted on 3,290 resolutions In  addition to  engagement, EOS  provides voting  recommendations to  our Stock Pickers, who exercise the voting rights in respect of the stocks they hold. Over the  course of 2021 the  Stock Pickers voted  on all voteable proposals, casting votes  on 3,290 resolutions  at company  meetings. Of  these, they voted against company  management on 323 and abstained from voting on 59. Of the votes against management,  the  key  issues  voted  on  were governance-related issues such as remuneration  and Directors-related  topics. Voting  against management,  and in particular, against the re-election of certain Directors or on specific climate- related  resolutions, allows  the Stock  Pickers to  communicate dissatisfaction following a lack of progress achieved via engagement.

Source: EOS at Federated Hermes, data to 31 December 2021 DIVIDEND AN INCREASED DIVIDEND The  Company has significantly increased its  total dividend for 2021, up 32.5% from 14.38p in 2020 to 19.05p in 2021. This was achieved by increasing the third and  fourth interim dividends for 2021 by 62.0% from  that paid at the same time last  year. Had we increased the first  and second interim dividends to the same level this would have resulted in an annual dividend yield of 2.3%.(1) The  increase in  the Company's  dividend was  implemented by  the Board after a review  of the level  and funding of  the dividend which  included obtaining and listening  to the views  of shareholders. The  Board believes that the increased level  of dividend is both  sustainable and affordable and  it expects to extend the Company's 55-year track record of annual dividend increases for many years. The  Company's Dividend Policy  and its investment  objective (see page 2 of the Annual Report) and investment strategy remain unchanged. The  aim is to continue delivering a rising  dividend year after year as well as capital growth. 1. This is based on the Company's share price at 31 December 2021. DIVIDEND POLICY Subject  to market conditions and  the Company's performance, financial position and  outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The  Company expects to  pay four interim  dividends per year,  on or around the last  day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. In  determining the level of future dividends,  the Board will take into account factors  such  as  any  anticipated  increase  or  decrease  in  dividend cover, projected income, inflation and yield on similar investment trusts. The  Board will  continue to  take advantage  of the  Company's structure  as an investment  trust and  will use  both its  investment income and its significant accumulated distributable reserves to fund dividend payments. The Company policy of paying quarterly interim dividends means that shareholders have  certainty of the  date on which  they will receive  their income but means they   are  not  asked  to  approve  the  final  dividend.  However,  each  year shareholders  are given  the opportunity  to share  their views on the Company's dividend by being asked to approve the Company's Dividend Policy. DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES The  Company's distributable reserves at  31 December 2021, including the merger reserve  which was  converted into  a distributable  reserve in  July 2021, were \\xA33.3bn (2020: \\xA32.3bn). Of these, the Company's revenue reserve was \\xA395.2m (2020: \\xA399.2),  realised  capital  reserves  were  \\xA32.8bn (2020: \\xA31.9bn) and unrealised capital  reserves  were  \\xA30.5bn  (2020:  \\xA30.4bn).  Both  elements of the capital reserves  are readily convertible  to cash. The  Board expects to utilise \\xA310.5m (2020:  \\xA310.1m) to support the total  dividend declared for 2021. Details of the Company's reserves can be found on page 90 of the Annual Report. DIVIDEND DECLARATION The  Ordinary  Dividend  for  2021 will  increase  by 32.5% to 19.054p. A fourth interim dividend of 5.825p will be paid on 31 March 2022 to shareholders who are on  the register on 11 March 2022. The payment dates for the 2022 financial year can be found on page 119 of the Annual Report. INCOME &amp; COSTS INCOME The Company's income from dividends in 2021 saw a significant increase to \\xA361.9m from \\xA345.6m, also above the \\xA358.7m received in 2019. COSTS The  Company's  Ongoing  Charges  Ratio  (OCR)  was  0.60% (2020:  0.64%). Total administrative expenses were \\xA35.9m (2020: \\xA36.0m). Investment management expenses were  \\xA314.1m (2020: \\xA312.0m).  The Company incurred  property and other costs not connected  with the ongoing investment  business of the Company  for the year of \\xA30.5m  (2020: \\xA30.4m). The main  contributor to the lower  OCR was an increase in the  average daily  NAVs. This  meant that  the Company's  fixed costs  became a smaller proportion of its expenses. The  Board has  a policy  of adopting  a one-quarter  revenue and three-quarters capital  allocation  for  management  fees,  financing  costs and other indirect expenses  where this is consistent with  the Association of Investment Companies (AIC)  Statement  of  Recommended  Practice:  Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts. The  Company's costs  remain competitive  for an  actively managed multi-manager global equity fund. DISCOUNT &amp; SHARE BUYBACKS   * A stable discount   * 4.2% of our share capital bought back in 2021 DISCOUNT AND SHARE BUYBACKS The  discount remained stable for  most of the year  except for one day in March 2021 when  it rose  to 9.3% before  returning to  the range  of between 7.0% and 4.5% that it occupied for most of the year. The discount at 31 December 2021 was 5.3% (2020:  3.5%) and  the  average  for  the  year  was 5.9% (2020: 5.6%). The widening of the discount is consistent with what was seen in other global equity investment trusts. The  Company  bought  back  4.2% of  its  issued  share capital during the year, purchasing  13,480,500 shares  and  adding  \\xA38.0m  to  the  Net  Asset Value for remaining  shareholders. The total  cost of the  share buybacks was \\xA3131.0m. The weighted  average discount of shares  bought back in the  year was 6.1%. All the shares bought back were cancelled. Share  buybacks,  combined  with  the  effect  of  the  change  in the discount, contributed a total of 0.3% to the Company's performance in the year. The  table below the high level of discount that persisted in the years prior to the adoption of the current investment strategy in 2017 and the stability of the average  discount since.  It also  shows that  the cost  of share buybacks since 2017 to  maintain a stable discount  have been roughly equal  to the cost in the years  immediately prior to  that date. The  Board will continue  to monitor the stability of the discount and will take advantage of any significant widening of the discount to produce additional return for shareholders.

The Court Order became effective on 9 July 2021 completing the process such that the  former Merger reserve is now distributable.

The auditors have reported  on  those  accounts;  their  reports  were  unqualified,  did not draw attention  to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The  same  accounting  policies,  presentations  and  methods of computation are followed  in these  financial statements  as were  applied in the Company's last annual  audited  financial  statements,  other  than  those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting While  the financial information  included in this  preliminary announcement has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of UK- adopted  international accounting  standards (IASs),  this announcement does not itself  contain sufficient  information to  comply with  IASs. The  Company will publish full financial statements that comply with IASs on its website. 1. Income An analysis of the Company's revenue is as follows: --------------------------------------------------------   \\xA3000                                    2021     2020 --------------------------------------------------------   Income from investments   Listed dividends - UK                 12,961    7,511   Listed dividends - Overseas           48,913   38,041 --------------------------------------------------------                                         61,874   45,552 --------------------------------------------------------   Other income   Property rental income                   321      318   Mineral rights income                      -       20   Other interest                            54      246   Other income                              33      108 --------------------------------------------------------                                            408      692 --------------------------------------------------------   Total income                          62,282   46,244 -------------------------------------------------------- 2. Total   Company   expenses  of  \\xA320,049k  (\\xA317,953k)  consist  of  investment management  fees of \\xA314,127k  (\\xA311,964k) and administrative  expenses of \\xA35,922k (\\xA35,989k).   Administrative  expenses  include  property  and  other  costs  not connected to the ongoing investment business of the Company of \\xA3471k (\\xA3394k). 3. The  diluted  earnings  per  share  is  calculated using the weighted average number  of ordinary shares, which includes 1,611 (22,331) shares held in a trust that  was set up to satisfy awards  made under historic share award schemes. The basic  earnings per share is calculated by excluding these shares. The basic Net Asset Value per share calculation also excludes these shares. 4. All  expenses  are  accounted  for  on  an  accruals  basis. Where there is a connection  with the  maintenance or  enhancement of  the value of the Company's investments  and  it  is  consistent  with  the AICSORP, the Company attributes indirect expenditure including management fees and finance costs, 25% to revenue and 75% to capital profits. Specific exceptions to this general principle are:   * Expenses which under the AIC SORP are chargeable to revenue profits are     recorded directly to revenue.   * Expenses connected with rental income and mineral rights income are included     as administrative expenses.

Our response to the challenging operating environment caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with how we were placed going into the crisis, positions us well for the recovery. Response to COVID-19  Darren Steinberg said: \"In recent years we have actively undertaken initiatives to improve asset quality and portfolio diversification, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through transactions, developments and favourable asset valuations we achieved growth in funds under management, consistent with our focus on leadership in office and being a wholesale partner of choice. We increased the group's exposure to the industrial and healthcare property sectors alongside our third party capital partners, further diversifying our position across these growing sectors. We have also invested in property technology initiatives and enhanced our product offering, working proactively with our customers to provide workspace solutions that enable additional flexibility and a seamless experience. \"When the pandemic took hold in late March 2020, our number one priority was to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the people in our buildings. With government restrictions implemented across our key markets, we kept our buildings operational to enable business continuity for the essential services of our customers. We actively supported the viability of our small business customers most affected by the crisis through the provision of rent relief, consistent with the Code of Conduct. These actions have impacted our financial result for the year which, until the last quarter, was tracking ahead of expectations. In response to the uncertain environment, we implemented cost reduction initiatives and secured additional debt facilities. We also withdrew our FY20 guidance until there was further certainty on cash flow, and in early June 2020 announced revised guidance for a distribution consistent with FY19, which we have delivered on.\" While these challenges adversely impacted the financial result and the Dexus security price, Dexus progressed its strategic objectives and delivered solid operational achievements for the year. Financial result Dexus's net profit after tax was $983.0 million, down 23.3% on the prior year. This movement was primarily driven by net revaluation gains of investment properties of $612.4 million, which were $160.7 million lower than FY19. These revaluation gains primarily drove the 38 cent or 3.6% increase in net tangible asset (NTA) backing per security to $10.86 at 30 June 2020. Underlying Funds from Operations (FFO) per security of 63.5 cents, which excludes trading profits, grew by 1.0% despite the impact of rent relief provided, highlighting the contribution from the funds management business and non-recurring cost reduction measures. AFFO and distribution per security of 50.3 cents, was consistent with the prior year and in line with revised guidance provided on 1 June 2020, with the distribution payout ratio remaining in line with free cash flow in accordance with Dexus's distribution policy. The distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2020 of 23.3 cents per security will be paid to Dexus Security holders on Friday, 28 August 2020. Rent collections for the Dexus portfolio were strong at 98% in FY20, with 92% collected in the fourth quarter of FY20. Dexus achieved a ROCE2 for FY20 of 9.0% driven largely by AFFO and revaluation gains from completed developments at 240 St Georges Terrace, Perth and the city retail component of 175 Pitt Street, Sydney. Dexus continued to maintain a strong and conservative balance sheet with gearing (look-through)3 at 24.3%, well below the target range of 30-40%, and $1.6 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities. Chief Financial Officer, Alison Harrop said: \"We have remained focused on preserving capital while selectively investing in assets with solid fundamentals and divesting non-core or lower returning assets. We enhanced our financial position by sourcing $1.85 billion of debt, including the issue of $700 million of 10 and 12-year Medium-Term Notes, which increased our debt duration to 6.9 years and further diversified our funding sources. In this uncertain environment, we remain focused on maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.\" Dexus has manageable debt expiries in late FY21 and limited development commitments of circa$180 million remaining to spend until the end of FY22. Dexus remains within all of its debt covenant limits and continues to retain its credit ratings of A-/A3 from S&amp;P and Moody's respectively.

Executive General Manager, Office, Kevin George said: \"Our office portfolio was performing well leading into the crisis with high occupancy and significant leasing success, including our leasing focus at 80 Collins Street which achieved record rents and set new benchmarks for the Melbourne CBD.\" In the current environment, office leasing enquiry levels have fallen, and inspection rates have slowed however occupancy has remained high at 96.5%. Lead indicators point to a period of uncertainty in the Australian office market, with demand across the major CBD markets likely to be patchy in the short term. In times of uncertainty, high-quality and well-leased assets can be expected to hold their value better than lower quality assets due to their appeal to both occupants and purchasers as well as their relative scarcity. At 30 June 2020, Prime grade9 buildings comprised 94% of Dexus's office portfolio. Office portfolio like-for-like income growth10 was +2.4% (FY19: +3.4%), impacted by rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus office portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020. As Australia's largest owner and manager of office buildings, Dexus has taken a leadership role in the operational aspects of assisting Australian businesses to return back to their offices in a safe manner and consistent with government guidelines. This has involved working with the authorities on lift capacities and end-of-trip facilities, as well as regular customer communications and surveys. Kevin George said: \"Developing meaningful partnerships with our customers, local communities and suppliers has a valuable impact on the people in and around our buildings. Our customers are at the heart of what we do, and we invest time in understanding their needs and delivering solutions to help them thrive in their workspaces. Our team is focused on enhancing our customers' experience as shown through the annual customer survey which returned a high customer Net Promoter Score of +50 (out of a possible range of -100 to +100), an increase from +46 in FY19, reflecting the strength of our relationships. \"We leveraged our workplace consulting business, Six Ideas by Dexus, to gain insights into the future of workspace. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the flexible working trend as well as some of the long-term structural trends, like technology, that have underpinned our workspace strategy. We invest time in understanding our customers' needs to drive innovation, collaboration and workplace culture. This has resulted in enhancements to our customer offering over the years, from fitted suites to Dexus Place and SuiteX.\" Dexus Industrial Portfolio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"424\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Key metrics</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30 June 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30 June 2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Occupancy by income</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">95.6%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">97.0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted average lease expiry (by income)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.1 years</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.7 years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Average incentives</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">13.4%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11.7%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Weighted average cap rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5.66%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.92%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dexus manages a growing, high-quality $5 billion6 group industrial portfolio, $2.2 billion of which sits in the Dexus portfolio. During the year, Dexus leased 181,472 square metres8 of industrial space across 95 transactions, with the portfolio continuing to benefit from an uptick in logistics and e-commerce demand with non-discretionary and online retail sectors experiencing growth during the crisis. Portfolio occupancy remains high at 95.6%, however was lower than FY19 at 97.0% primarily due to vacancy at Axxess Corporate Park. Industrial portfolio like-for-like income growth11 was -2.1% (FY19: +2.5%) impacted by expiries at Axxess Corporate Park in addition to rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus industrial portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020. The weighted average capitalisation rate across the total property portfolio tightened 21 basis points over the year to 5.05%. The weighted average capitalisation rate of the Dexus office portfolio tightened 18 basis points from 5.15% at 30 June 2019 to 4.97% at 30 June 2020 and for the Dexus industrial portfolio tightened 26 basis points from 5.92% at 30 June 2019 to 5.66% at 30 June 2020. Funds Management Dexus manages $15.5 billion of funds on behalf of 77 third party clients. The funds platform raised circa $955 million of equity for new and existing funds, including DWPF which raised circa $240 million from existing investors to fund its future development pipeline. DWPF continues to outperform its benchmark over one, three, five, seven and ten years and HWPF continued to deliver strong performance, achieving a one-year return of 10.9%. All partnerships have performed well, exceeding their return objectives for the year. Executive General Manager, Funds Management, Deborah Coakley said: \"We remain a real estate partner of choice across the Australian office, industrial, retail and healthcare sectors and we continue to attract significant interest from domestic and international capital partners seeking to invest in Australian property. In the current environment we are focused on delivering continued superior performance and navigating the unanticipated market conditions for our third party capital partners, while accelerating opportunities to expand our funds platform, including the launch of an unlisted opportunity fund series in FY21.\" During the year, GIC acquired an additional 24% interest in DALT, bringing its total share of the partnership to 49%, and entered into a new commercial JV with Dexus that acquired 50% of Rialto Towers in Melbourne. GIC holds a 90% share in the JV and Dexus holds the remaining 10%. Dexus is the investment manager of the JV and property manager of the entire Rialto Towers complex. HWPF welcomed two new investors, completed the development of the new Calvary Adelaide Hospital, and acquired the North Shore Health Hub, Stage 1 currently under development at 12 Frederick Street, St Leonards. Post 30 June 2020, HWPF acquired the College Junction building in Clayfield, Brisbane, a modern healthcare facility that accommodates Qscan's head office, radiology clinic and other healthcare tenants. Developments and transactions During the year, Dexus completed $1.1 billion of developments across the group including its office development at 240 St Georges Terrace in Perth (96% committed), The Annex at 12 Creek Street, Brisbane (24% committed) and the office and retail component of 80 Collins Street (94% committed). In addition, three city retail projects, four specialised industrial facilities and HWPF's new Calvary Adelaide Hospital were also completed. Dexus's group development pipeline now stands at a cost of $10.6 billion, of which $5.4 billion sits within the Dexus portfolio and $5.2 billion within third party funds. Dexus has only circa $180 million remaining to spend on its committed development projects until the end of FY22. Construction continues at the $84 million Richlands project in Queensland and the $150 million South Granville project in NSW, both industrial development projects held within DALT. Construction also progressed at three other industrial properties, taking the total committed group industrial pipeline to over 270,000 square metres. Chief Investment Officer, Ross Du Vernet said: \"We've made significant progress across our city shaping developments at Central Place Sydney, 60 Collins Street in Melbourne and Waterfront Brisbane. In the current uncertain environment, our risk is reduced by the fact that these assets are currently income producing and the majority are owned in partnership with our third party capital partners, allowing us to progress planning to enhance the optionality of these developments.\" Dexus had an active year of transactions, undertaking $1.2 billion of acquisitions and $1.0 billion of divestments across the group, recycling capital to strengthen Dexus's balance sheet and enhance flexibility. Dexus divested two assets at pricing in line with their prior book value, including Garema Court 140-180 City Walk, Canberra and 45 Clarence Street, Sydney which is subject to FIRB approval. In addition, Dexus made a number of smaller acquisitions and post 30 June 2020, settled on the divestment of Finlay Crisp Centre in Canberra. Trading Dexus realised $35.3 million of trading profits (net of tax) driven by the sale of the initial 25% of 201 Elizabeth Street in Sydney and progress at the North Shore Health Hub in St Leonards, currently under construction and sold to HWPF on a fund-through basis. Post 30 June 2020, Dexus entered into agreements to sell a portfolio of six trading assets to DALT across two tranches and exercised the option to sell its remaining 25% interest in 201 Elizabeth Street. These transactions (including the North Shore Health Hub) are expected to contribute circa $85 million to pre-tax trading profits across FY21 and FY22 (in the event the options over the second tranche are exercised). Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) update The impact of the Australian drought and bushfire crisis that dominated the summer of 2019-20 increased investor focus on the resilience of Dexus's properties to climate change. The launch of Dexus's Towards Climate Resilience report in June 2020 reinforces the group's approach to addressing climate change and enhancing resilience. This year Dexus progressed its net zero emissions by 2030 goal by improving energy and water efficiency, delivering its 2020 NABERS Energy and Water targets, and expanding the adoption of renewable energy sources, including the rollout of solar projects across properties in Queensland and New South Wales. Dexus gained global recognition for its commitment to its net zero goal, enhancing sustainability disclosure and its ongoing focus on portfolio resilience, achieving industry leadership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and a position on the CDP Climate Change A List. Dexus was again recognised by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) for its active commitment to and progress towards gender equality across its workplace - being awarded an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality (EOCGE) citation for 2019-20. Dexus's highly engaged workforce is committed to delivering on its strategy, reflected in the high employee Net Promoter Score of +61. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Dexus employees have played an instrumental role in ensuring the safety of customers, contractors and the community across the group property portfolios. Dexus's ongoing focus on safety is measured by independent external safety audits across its corporate and management workspaces, and this year Dexus achieved an average score of 100%. Summary and outlook Darren Steinberg said: \"Dexus is well positioned, with a track record of delivering on strategy, a stable and experienced management team, a quality property portfolio with a diversified customer base, and a strong balance sheet. \"In recent years we have demonstrated our ability to capitalise on opportunities while also preparing for periods of uncertainty. We have improved our portfolio composition through the acquisition of quality properties with solid fundamentals to drive long-term returns, while taking advantage of the good years to recycle properties in non-core locations. \"Our substantial city-shaping development pipeline comprises projects that will deliver long-term value beyond the recovery period, while our diversified funds management business is performing and continues to attract interest from new capital. \"Our team's knowledge, expertise and ability to innovate, combined with our investments in technology and workspace consulting, will help us position for the recovery. \"Office property is a long-term asset class and has shown its resilience to perform through the cycle. However, with Australia in a recession, we are preparing for subdued tenant demand and increased vacancy levels in our core office markets. In this environment we remain focused on maintaining high portfolio occupancy. \"We will also make decisions that set the group up to perform over the long term. We will selectively recycle assets, which may result in short-term earnings dilution but will enable us to reinvest into opportunities that we believe will drive stronger investor returns over the next decade. \"Our immediate priorities are summarised across five key areas: assisting Australian businesses in returning safely to their workplaces, optimising our property portfolio composition, accelerating opportunities to expand our funds management platform, continuing to work with our customers on the future of workspace, and progressing the city-shaping development pipeline.\" Dexus intends to deliver a distribution in line with free cash flow in FY21. However, taking into account continued uncertainty, Dexus is not providing distribution per security guidance for the 12 months ended 30 June 2021.

Our response to the challenging operating environment caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with how we were placed going into the crisis, positions us well for the recovery.  Response to COVID-19  Darren Steinberg said: 'In recent years we have actively undertaken initiatives to improve asset quality and portfolio diversification, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Through transactions, developments and favourable asset valuations we achieved growth in funds under management, consistent with our focus on leadership in office and being a wholesale partner of choice. We increased the group's exposure to the industrial and healthcare property sectors alongside our third party capital partners, further diversifying our position across these growing sectors. We have also invested in property technology initiatives and enhanced our product offering, working proactively with our customers to provide workspace solutions that enable additional flexibility and a seamless experience.  'When the pandemic took hold in late March 2020, our number one priority was to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the people in our buildings. With government restrictions implemented across our key markets, we kept our buildings operational to enable business continuity for the essential services of our customers. We actively supported the viability of our small business customers most affected by the crisis through the provision of rent relief, consistent with the Code of Conduct. These actions have impacted our financial result for the year which, until the last quarter, was tracking ahead of expectations. In response to the uncertain environment, we implemented cost reduction initiatives and secured additional debt facilities. We also withdrew our FY20 guidance until there was further certainty on cash flow, and in early June 2020 announced revised guidance for a distribution consistent with FY19, which we have delivered on.'  While these challenges adversely impacted the financial result and the Dexus security price, Dexus progressed its strategic objectives and delivered solid operational achievements for the year.  Financial result  Dexus's net profit after tax was $983.0 million, down 23.3% on the prior year. This movement was primarily driven by net revaluation gains of investment properties of $612.4 million, which were $160.7 million lower than FY19. These revaluation gains primarily drove the 38 cent or 3.6% increase in net tangible asset (NTA) backing per security to $10.86 at 30 June 2020.  Underlying Funds from Operations (FFO) per security of 63.5 cents, which excludes trading profits, grew by 1.0% despite the impact of rent relief provided, highlighting the contribution from the funds management business and non-recurring cost reduction measures.  AFFO and distribution per security of 50.3 cents, was consistent with the prior year and in line with revised guidance provided on 1 June 2020, with the distribution payout ratio remaining in line with free cash flow in accordance with Dexus's distribution policy. The distribution for the six months ended 30 June 2020 of 23.3 cents per security will be paid to Dexus Security holders on Friday, 28 August 2020.  Rent collections for the Dexus portfolio were strong at 98% in FY20, with 92% collected in the fourth quarter of FY20.  Dexus achieved a ROCE2 for FY20 of 9.0% driven largely by AFFO and revaluation gains from completed developments at 240 St Georges Terrace, Perth and the city retail component of 175 Pitt Street, Sydney.  Dexus continued to maintain a strong and conservative balance sheet with gearing (look-through)3 at 24.3%, well below the target range of 30-40%, and $1.6 billion of cash and undrawn debt facilities.  Chief Financial Officer, Alison Harrop said: 'We have remained focused on preserving capital while selectively investing in assets with solid fundamentals and divesting non-core or lower returning assets. We enhanced our financial position by sourcing $1.85 billion of debt, including the issue of $700 million of 10 and 12-year Medium-Term Notes, which increased our debt duration to 6.9 years and further diversified our funding sources. In this uncertain environment, we remain focused on maintaining the strength of our balance sheet.'  Dexus has manageable debt expiries in late FY21 and limited development commitments of circa $180 million remaining to spend until the end of FY22. Dexus remains within all of its debt covenant limits and continues to retain its credit ratings of A-/A3 from S&amp;P and Moody's respectively.  Property portfolio  Dexus Office Portfolio       Key metrics                            30 June      30 June                                                2020         2019      Occupancy by income                      96.5%        98.0%      Weighted average lease expiry (by    4.2 years    4.4 years      income)      Average incentives7                      17.1%        13.4%      Weighted average cap rate                4.97%        5.15% During the year, Dexus leased 88,467 square metres8 of office space across 207 transactions as well as 26,403 square metres of space across office developments, locking in future income streams.  Executive General Manager, Office, Kevin George said: 'Our office portfolio was performing well leading into the crisis with high occupancy and significant leasing success, including our leasing focus at 80 Collins Street which achieved record rents and set new benchmarks for the Melbourne CBD.'  In the current environment, office leasing enquiry levels have fallen, and inspection rates have slowed however occupancy has remained high at 96.5%. Lead indicators point to a period of uncertainty in the Australian office market, with demand across the major CBD markets likely to be patchy in the short term. In times of uncertainty, high-quality and well-leased assets can be expected to hold their value better than lower quality assets due to their appeal to both occupants and purchasers as well as their relative scarcity. At 30 June 2020, Prime grade9 buildings comprised 94% of Dexus's office portfolio.  Office portfolio like-for-like income growth10 was +2.4% (FY19: +3.4%), impacted by rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus office portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020.  As Australia's largest owner and manager of office buildings, Dexus has taken a leadership role in the operational aspects of assisting Australian businesses to return back to their offices in a safe manner and consistent with government guidelines. This has involved working with the authorities on lift capacities and end-of-trip facilities, as well as regular customer communications and surveys.  Kevin George said: 'Developing meaningful partnerships with our customers, local communities and suppliers has a valuable impact on the people in and around our buildings. Our customers are at the heart of what we do, and we invest time in understanding their needs and delivering solutions to help them thrive in their workspaces. Our team is focused on enhancing our customers' experience as shown through the annual customer survey which returned a high customer Net Promoter Score of +50 (out of a possible range of -100 to +100), an increase from +46 in FY19, reflecting the strength of our relationships.  'We leveraged our workplace consulting business, Six Ideas by Dexus, to gain insights into the future of workspace. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the flexible working trend as well as some of the long-term structural trends, like technology, that have underpinned our workspace strategy. We invest time in understanding our customers' needs to drive innovation, collaboration and workplace culture. This has resulted in enhancements to our customer offering over the years, from fitted suites to Dexus Place and SuiteX.'  Dexus Industrial Portfolio       Key metrics                            30 June      30 June                                                2020         2019      Occupancy by income                      95.6%        97.0%      Weighted average lease expiry (by    4.1 years    4.7 years      income)      Average incentives                       13.4%        11.7%      Weighted average cap rate                5.66%        5.92% Dexus manages a growing, high-quality $5 billion6 group industrial portfolio, $2.2 billion of which sits in the Dexus portfolio. During the year, Dexus leased 181,472 square metres8 of industrial space across 95 transactions, with the portfolio continuing to benefit from an uptick in logistics and e-commerce demand with non-discretionary and online retail sectors experiencing growth during the crisis.  Portfolio occupancy remains high at 95.6%, however was lower than FY19 at 97.0% primarily due to vacancy at Axxess Corporate Park. Industrial portfolio like-for-like income growth11 was -2.1% (FY19: +2.5%) impacted by expiries at Axxess Corporate Park in addition to rent relief measures and a provision for expected credit losses. The Dexus industrial portfolio outperformed its benchmark over the one, three and five-year time periods to 31 March 2020.  The weighted average capitalisation rate across the total property portfolio tightened 21 basis points over the year to 5.05%. The weighted average capitalisation rate of the Dexus office portfolio tightened 18 basis points from 5.15% at 30 June 2019 to 4.97% at 30 June 2020 and for the Dexus industrial portfolio tightened 26 basis points from 5.92% at 30 June 2019 to 5.66% at 30 June 2020.  Funds Management  Dexus manages $15.5 billion of funds on behalf of 77 third party clients.  The funds platform raised circa $955 million of equity for new and existing funds, including DWPF which raised circa $240 million from existing investors to fund its future development pipeline. DWPF continues to outperform its benchmark over one, three, five, seven and ten years and HWPF continued to deliver strong performance, achieving a one-year return of 10.9%. All partnerships have performed well, exceeding their return objectives for the year.  Executive General Manager, Funds Management, Deborah Coakley said: 'We remain a real estate partner of choice across the Australian office, industrial, retail and healthcare sectors and we continue to attract significant interest from domestic and international capital partners seeking to invest in Australian property. In the current environment we are focused on delivering continued superior performance and navigating the unanticipated market conditions for our third party capital partners, while accelerating opportunities to expand our funds platform, including the launch of an unlisted opportunity fund series in FY21.'  During the year, GIC acquired an additional 24% interest in DALT, bringing its total share of the partnership to 49%, and entered into a new commercial JV with Dexus that acquired 50% of Rialto Towers in Melbourne. GIC holds a 90% share in the JV and Dexus holds the remaining 10%. Dexus is the investment manager of the JV and property manager of the entire Rialto Towers complex.  HWPF welcomed two new investors, completed the development of the new Calvary Adelaide Hospital, and acquired the North Shore Health Hub, Stage 1 currently under development at 12 Frederick Street, St Leonards. Post 30 June 2020, HWPF acquired the College Junction building in Clayfield, Brisbane, a modern healthcare facility that accommodates Qscan's head office, radiology clinic and other healthcare tenants.  Developments and transactions  During the year, Dexus completed $1.1 billion of developments across the group including its office development at 240 St Georges Terrace in Perth (96% committed), The Annex at 12 Creek Street, Brisbane (24% committed) and the office and retail component of 80 Collins Street (94% committed). In addition, three city retail projects, four specialised industrial facilities and HWPF's new Calvary Adelaide Hospital were also completed.  Dexus's group development pipeline now stands at a cost of $10.6 billion, of which $5.4 billion sits within the Dexus portfolio and $5.2 billion within third party funds. Dexus has only circa $180 million remaining to spend on its committed development projects until the end of FY22.  Construction continues at the $84 million Richlands project in Queensland and the $150 million South Granville project in NSW, both industrial development projects held within DALT. Construction also progressed at three other industrial properties, taking the total committed group industrial pipeline to over 270,000 square metres.  Chief Investment Officer, Ross Du Vernet said: 'We've made significant progress across our city shaping developments at Central Place Sydney, 60 Collins Street in Melbourne and Waterfront Brisbane. In the current uncertain environment, our risk is reduced by the fact that these assets are currently income producing and the majority are owned in partnership with our third party capital partners, allowing us to progress planning to enhance the optionality of these developments.'  Dexus had an active year of transactions, undertaking $1.2 billion of acquisitions and $1.0 billion of divestments across the group, recycling capital to strengthen Dexus's balance sheet and enhance flexibility. Dexus divested two assets at pricing in line with their prior book value, including Garema Court 140-180 City Walk, Canberra and 45 Clarence Street, Sydney which is subject to FIRB approval. In addition, Dexus made a number of smaller acquisitions and post 30 June 2020, settled on the divestment of Finlay Crisp Centre in Canberra.  Trading  Dexus realised $35.3 million of trading profits (net of tax) driven by the sale of the initial 25% of 201 Elizabeth Street in Sydney and progress at the North Shore Health Hub in St Leonards, currently under construction and sold to HWPF on a fund-through basis.  Post 30 June 2020, Dexus entered into agreements to sell a portfolio of six trading assets to DALT across two tranches and exercised the option to sell its remaining 25% interest in 201 Elizabeth Street. These transactions (including the North Shore Health Hub) are expected to contribute circa $85 million to pre-tax trading profits across FY21 and FY22 (in the event the options over the second tranche are exercised).  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) update  The impact of the Australian drought and bushfire crisis that dominated the summer of 2019-20 increased investor focus on the resilience of Dexus's properties to climate change. The launch of Dexus's Towards Climate Resilience report in June 2020 reinforces the group's approach to addressing climate change and enhancing resilience.  This year Dexus progressed its net zero emissions by 2030 goal by improving energy and water efficiency, delivering its 2020 NABERS Energy and Water targets, and expanding the adoption of renewable energy sources, including the rollout of solar projects across properties in Queensland and New South Wales.  Dexus gained global recognition for its commitment to its net zero goal, enhancing sustainability disclosure and its ongoing focus on portfolio resilience, achieving industry leadership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) and a position on the CDP Climate Change A List.  Dexus was again recognised by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) for its active commitment to and progress towards gender equality across its workplace - being awarded an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality (EOCGE) citation for 2019-20.  Dexus's highly engaged workforce is committed to delivering on its strategy, reflected in the high employee Net Promoter Score of +61. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Dexus employees have played an instrumental role in ensuring the safety of customers, contractors and the community across the group property portfolios. Dexus's ongoing focus on safety is measured by independent external safety audits across its corporate and management workspaces, and this year Dexus achieved an average score of 100%.  Summary and outlook  Darren Steinberg said: 'Dexus is well positioned, with a track record of delivering on strategy, a stable and experienced management team, a quality property portfolio with a diversified customer base, and a strong balance sheet.  'In recent years we have demonstrated our ability to capitalise on opportunities while also preparing for periods of uncertainty. We have improved our portfolio composition through the acquisition of quality properties with solid fundamentals to drive long-term returns, while taking advantage of the good years to recycle properties in non-core locations.  'Our substantial city-shaping development pipeline comprises projects that will deliver long-term value beyond the recovery period, while our diversified funds management business is performing and continues to attract interest from new capital.  'Our team's knowledge, expertise and ability to innovate, combined with our investments in technology and workspace consulting, will help us position for the recovery.  'Office property is a long-term asset class and has shown its resilience to perform through the cycle. However, with Australia in a recession, we are preparing for subdued tenant demand and increased vacancy levels in our core office markets. In this environment we remain focused on maintaining high portfolio occupancy.  'We will also make decisions that set the group up to perform over the long term. We will selectively recycle assets, which may result in short-term earnings dilution but will enable us to reinvest into opportunities that we believe will drive stronger investor returns over the next decade.  'Our immediate priorities are summarised across five key areas: assisting Australian businesses in returning safely to their workplaces, optimising our property portfolio composition, accelerating opportunities to expand our funds management platform, continuing to work with our customers on the future of workspace, and progressing the city-shaping development pipeline.'

The third one will focus on the people and make themselves climate re- silient so that they are able to protect the environment.\u201d The project would complement the 11th and 12th Plans. The UNDP GEF-LDCF project received US$ 13.9 million for the project of which US$ 1.1 million is from GEF Trust Fund for Sustainable Forest Management Incentive Fund, US$ 2.3 million from GEF Trust Fund and US$ 10.5 million from GEF-LDCF.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Kuensel (Bhutan)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-59763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VMF1-F17J-S4SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 31, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Bhutan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNCI</classCode><className>POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F91</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000948</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

Hundreds of medical facilities and schools were destroyed.</p><p>Nearly 600 people were killed, 75,000ha of paddy fields were damaged and 130,000 tonnes of warehoused food was soaked in floodwater.</p><p>For locals, it is remembered as the late 20th-century cataclysm.</p><p>Gloomy memories of diseases and starvation still haunt many people, despite the fact that two decades have passed.</p><p>When my grandfather was finally able to build a new house, he decided to give it a mezzanine as a hiding place for family members and to store precious assets and rice for when floods hit.</p><p>Last week, a report released by Climate Central warned southern Vietnam could disappear under water due to sea level rises by 2050.</p><p>More than 20 million people face watching their homes and livelihoods being taken away by high tides.</p><p>HCM City, the country\u2019s economic engine, is apparently at risk of being submerged. The current severe situation, even in high-class neighbourhoods like Thao Dien and Phu My Hung, could get even worse.</p><p>Some people, whether in jest or seriously, have started talking about moving from the south and buying houses \u201csomewhere higher\u201d.</p><p>Just like thousands other families in central Vietnam 20 years old, running is the best policy.</p><p>But what about those who have to stay, whose livelihoods depend heavily on paddy fields in Mekong Delta or neon streets in HCM City?</p><p>After five days at a community house, my grandparents came back to their village which was covered in mud. They believed they could rebuild it, regain what was gone and mitigate the impacts of later disasters.</p><p>But what about southern people in 2050? If they lose their land, they will lose it forever.</p><p>Da Nang City is also in the spotlight, as its sandy beaches are choked in plastic waste after excessive rain over the last few weekends.</p><p>In a photo currently going viral online, thousands of used plastic bottles were found inside the city\u2019s drainage sewer when cleaning worker tried to unclog it.</p><p>Some 6,000 households of northern central Nghe An Province\u2019s Vinh City will never forget the serious flooding in mid-October which left them in the dark for several days due to electricity cuts.</p><p>The reason, ironically, was because Dong Vinh Ward authorities forgot to build a drainage system when upgrading Tran Binh Trong Street earlier this year, preventing water from flowing away in case of heavy rain.</p><p>Other wards faced the same ordeal as ponds, lakes and fields through which water runs to the sewer have been encroached upon for construction.</p><p>\u201cExtreme weather does not care about man-made borders, whenever the tide rises or storm hits it affects the whole region,\u201d Henk Ovink, Special Envoy for Water Affairs of the Netherlands, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Viet Nam News</emphasis> this time last year.</p><p>Flooding is no longer a problem for disaster-prone localities like Quang Tri or Hue.</p><p>Extreme weather events no longer just come, destroy and go like the 1999 flood in central provinces.

It takes time and it can\u2019t be done\u00a0in one year,\u00a0but I\u2019m quite confident that we\u2019re on the right way and I hope that we can proceed fast,\u201d he added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Challenges</emphasis></p><p>Experts at the conference agreed that the Mekong Delta is facing existential threats. According to studies, 39 per cent of the Mekong Delta could be underwater by the year 2100 and some areas of the coast are already eroding at a rate of 30 metres a year.</p><p>Early last year, the region suffered the worst drought in 90 years, which, together with rising sea levels, led to a heavy intrusion of saltwater into rice-growing areas. The mangrove forests along the coast, which protect the hinterland from floods and storms, are also in dramatic decline.</p><p>These problems threaten the future of the Mekong Delta and its ability to provide essential ecosystem services in which the communities of the delta and millions of people around the world depend.</p><p>Henckes said the biggest risk was the land sinking into the ocean at a faster rate than ever. \u201cThe land has subsided by several centimetres each year, especially in Ca Mau, Soc Trang and Bac Lieu,\u201d he said.</p><p>As the region faces rising sea levels, more land will be underwater. \u201cI think we won\u2019t lose the whole delta, but I also think that we can\u2019t maintain it exactly as it is,\u201d\u00a0Henckes said.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t expect concrete decisions today or\u00a0tomorrow. We should expect a common understanding on how our finances can be mobilised and how the government is going to spend them,\u201d\u00a0he added.</p><p>Because of the risk of land loss along the coast, Henckes said that\u00a0\u201cwe need right now to protect the frontline of the coast against the sea, but also to figure out the second line of defense for 20-30 metres inside the area, just in case the first line breaks, to protect the people and villages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the Integrated Coastal Management Programme for nearly 10 years now. We began focusing on coastal protection and reinforcing the dyke system, as well as supporting the people who live behind the dyke to help them increase their incomes,\u201d he said.</p><p>Now, the programme is focusing on agriculture and governance, getting provinces to work together, and investing in the projects that are needed most.</p><p>\u201cThis year, for example, we are working with Viet Nam on a complete coastal protection plan for 720km of the Vietnamese coast,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Mekong Delta, home to 17 million people, is Viet Nam\u2019s most important agricultural region. Producing 55 per cent of the country\u2019s rice, it feeds more than 245 million people worldwide.</p><p>The region is also the country\u2019s third largest industrial region after the metropolitan areas of HCM City and Ha Noi.</p><p>The conference was organised by Viet Nam\u2019s Government Office and the ministries of Planning and Investment; Natural Resources and Environment; and Agriculture and Rural Development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Viet Nam News (Vietnam)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-57369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VMF1-F17J-S200-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 27, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CZ2O</classCode><className>DELTA NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS221111 HYDROELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC4931 ELECTRIC &amp;

Some of these hotspots, the report notes, are already vulnerable as they are less developed, suffer from poor connectivity, and are water stressed.</p><p>According to the report, in Sri Lanka, areas in northern and north-western provinces are the most likely to experience increases in average temperature and more variable precipitation by 2050. The analysis concludes that Sri Lanka\u2019s average annual temperatures could rise by 1.0\u00b0C to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050 even if carbon emission reduction measures are taken as recommended by the Paris Agreement of 2015. If no measures are taken average temperatures in Sri Lanka could increase by up to 2.0\u00b0C.</p><p>\"Weather changes will result in lower per capita consumption levels that could further increase poverty and inequality across South Asia,\" said Muthukumara Mani, a lead economist in the World Bank South Asia Region and author of the report. \"Identifying climate hotspots will help policymakers prioritize resources and actions in specific locations and communities where they are the most needed,\" he added.</p><p>The report provides options to prioritize investments and strategies to build local resilience to climate change. The analysis suggests that creating opportunities in less climate-sensitive sectors through enhancing education opportunities, improving market access, and generating non-agricultural jobs could reduce the overall severity of climate-related impact on the living standards of the vulnerable. If these interventions were implemented together, they would likely yield greater benefits than if implemented individually.</p><p>The World Bank is working closely with the government of Sri Lanka to support climate resilience and adaptation to climate change.

If climate change is going to have some of the disadvantages that many people are predicting then, how can the UN help,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Bhutan becomes stronger, we need to think about helping the vulnerable section of the society such as theelderlyanddisabled.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Kuensel (Bhutan)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-56731</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VMM1-F17J-S0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 20, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Bhutan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;
