But this may not be enough to avert the farming crisis.The Philippines' government announced more money to fight the agriculture crisis, raising the funding by 40% in comparison to last year. Around \u20ac3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) will be allocated for agriculture, which has been designated one of the government's five top budget priorities alongside education, infrastructure, the health sector, and social protection. </p><p><br/>The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., aims to transform agriculture \"from being an economic laggard to one of the main drivers for growth and employment,\" officials said in a statement. In June, the new president named himself agriculture minister. <br/>Experts welcomed the funding hike with cautious optimism, pointing to devastating losses suffered by the Philippines' farmers owing to natural disasters. These loses have worsened in recent years due to climate change. <br/>Climate is key <br/>According to economist Jan Carlo Punongbayan, the way to help agriculture is to fight the climate crisis. <br/>\"Unless the government puts climate change mitigation and management to the fore, agriculture will continue to be in the doldrums in decades to come,\" Punongbayan told DW.  <br/>Situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is one of the of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. The country experiences an average of 20 typhoons each year.  <br/>According to government data, the country's agricultural output shrank last year by about 2.6% due to a decline in crops caused by adverse weather conditions. This comes against the background of international experts, such as the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warning that stronger typhoons and longer dry spells are likely to massively disrupt agriculture worldwide and cause chronic food insecurity. <br/>Harvest 'literally washed away' <br/>Speaking to DW, environmentalist Ryan Bestre lamented that farmers in the Philippines do not get adequate government support in the form of subsidies and insurance to recover from natural disasters.  <br/>\"Their harvest and everything they have worked so hard for is literally washed away. Before they can even recover, another typhoon comes,\" said Bestre. The activist is the founder of 'I am Hampas Lupa' \u2014 an organization that advocates for elevating the stature of farming by addressing the links between agriculture, climate change, and mindful food consumption. <br/>\"Our farmers, among the poorest of society, are the ones continuously whipped by the effects of climate change over and over again. Where is the justice in that?\" asked Bestre. <br/>According to the Climate Risk Index, the Philippines is the fifth most affected country in the world by climate change, but only contributes to about 0.3% of global emissions.  <br/>Activists push for climate justice <br/>Bestre and other environmental advocates are calling for \"climate justice\" and demanding accountability from big corporations they say are responsible for climate change.  <br/>\"Climate justice is when Filipinos and other climate impacted communities around the world are protected with laws and that corporations responsible for climate change are held accountable,\" said Virginia Benosa-Llorin from GreenpeacePhilippines.  <br/>\"Filipinos are at the front lines of a climate emergency,\" she said. <br/>Last May, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights released a report on their inquiry on the effects of climate change on human rights. In the report, they called for enacting laws to curb corporations and businesses from committing human rights abuses. <br/>\"The impacts of climate change are cross-cutting among sectors and on the whole gamut of human rights, such as the rights to life, health, water, sanitation, education, and healthy environment,\" said Roberto Cadiz, former CHR Commissioner who headed the inquiry.  <br/>\"The issue of climate change is also an issue of climate justice, where those who contribute least to it are affected most by it,\" Cadiz told DW.  <br/>Philippines running out of farmers <br/>Agriculture in the Philippines also faces another issue \u2014 its image. The average Filipino farmer is 57-59 years old. Last year, the Department of Agriculture warned that declining employment in the agricultural sector combined with the ageing of farmers would contribute to a critical shortage of farmers in just 12 years.  <br/>But there are also youth groups who want to change the image of farming so that it doesn't appear to be only for the old and the poor.  <br/>\"The climate crisis is the defining crisis of our generation,\" Antonio Flores from Farm Lab told DW. <br/>Flores' NGO works with farmers on implementing techniques that are less damaging to the environment. <br/>\"Agriculture and our farming communities will be the hardest hit but it also has immense potential to regenerate the earth,\" he added. <br/>Youth sector infusing hope in agriculture  <br/>Other activists, such as Norhaya Vasquez Demacaling, focus on raising a young generation of what they call agri-entrepreneurs \u2014 a new kind of Filipino farmers. <br/>Demacaling is campus director for School for Experiential and Entrepreneurial Development (SEED) which aims to train thousands of students at three locations across the Philippines by 2024. <br/>The 29-year-old told DW climate change has impacted the sustainability of farming as a job. <br/>\"The loss of income from farming contributes to the lack of confidence among local growers. Their children, who are expected to replace them, are avoiding agriculture-related careers because they see it as a one way ticket to poverty,\" Demacaling said. <br/>With a population of around 110 million, government data shows that in 2018 the number of Filipinos working in the agriculture sector sank to 9.9 million, the lowest since 1995.  <br/>\"Through agri-entrepreneurship, we can make farming and agriculture fun, sexy, exciting and profitable,\" said Demacaling. <br/>Edited by: Darko Janjevic <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988166143032240325976100106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667J-6DW1-JCMN-Y3C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1010\"/><timeReceived>12:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 25, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>Business &amp;

The green is occasionally punctuated by slopes so steep and rugged that nothing grows on them.Africa's tectonic plate is splitting into two through the Great Rift Valley, said Anna Mwangi, a geologist with KenGen, Kenya's state-owned power generating company.Where we are right now is on the rift floor, she said as she pointed to the wide valley bordered by escarpments some 120 kilometers (74 miles) northwest of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.Fine white lines of water vapor stretch towards the sky in the distance. These mark the geothermal plants operated by KenGen in the Olkaria area. KenGen has five power stations in the area, with one more under construction and another proposed. It also runs more than a dozen wellhead plants.The location here in Olkaria is ideal for the climate-friendly geothermal plants, explained Mwangi.Tapping into renewable energy from the groundWe have magma coming close to the surface, and it's heating up the groundwater and \u2026 that steam is stored [underground], she said. </p><p>Geoscientists model the location of these pockets of steam, which can then be drilled and harnessed to drive turbines and generate electricity.Germany has given funding and technical support for the development of geothermal plants, the scale of which impressed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz when he visited the area in May.Scholz said that Germany could learn from Kenya, praising the East African nation as an inspiring climate champion.Green energy mixThe East African country is richly endowed with renewable energy resources. With nearly 1,000 megawatts installed, Kenya ranks first in Africa and top ten globally for geothermal power production. Large wind farms in the country's north and hydropower also contribute to the country's clean energy mix.According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables accounted for 75% of Kenya's total energy supply in 2020.That percentage was much higher in March 2023, according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, when renewables powered 84% of the national grid. Some 50% of electricity, or 509 million kilowatt hours, came from geothermal alone.President William Ruto, who is pushing Kenya to become a green powerhouse, is well aware of the powerful impact of such statistics on global audiences.President Ruto's ambitious plan for renewable energyAs the host of the inaugural Africa Climate Summit held in September, Ruto even claimed that renewable energy comprised 93% of electricity generation. The fact-checking platform Africa Check deemed this claim incorrect. Various climate analysts told DW that 70-80% is probably more likely.Ruto, however, leaves no doubt about his goal. He has set an ambitious target of meeting 100% of Kenya's electricity demand with clean energy by 2030.Even though the renewables goal might be commendable, it's important to note that Kenya doesn't produce much electricity in the first place.One in four people in Kenya still didn't have access to electricity in 2021, and the country only has an electricity capacity of just over 3,000 megawatts. According to Bloomberg news agency, that's just 50% more than Johannesburg consumes.Kenya's climate presidentRuto is also working on his image as climate-friendly in other ways, including driving himself from the State House to the climate summit venue in a small electric car. His government declared November 13 National Tree Planting Day, making the day a public holiday to encourage planting 100 million trees in the next ten years.Ruto has also pledged to adopt low-carbon transport. One program aims to make electric motorcycle taxis, popularly known in Kenya as boda-bodas, more readily available.Boda-bodas and tuk-tuks, small three-wheelers also used as taxis, comprise two-thirds of the national fleet, Ruto said in September while launching the electric boda-boda scheme.However, providing electric vehicles doesn't mean that buyers will automatically follow.Reluctance to embrace electric vehiclesIn a plain warehouse made of prefabricated parts and corrugated iron in Mombasa, Kenya's second-largest city, Alijawaad Molu shows off the 26 electric tuk-tuks stored here.For Molu, the co-founder of Solutions Africa, manufacturing electric tuk-tuks was about more than potentially making money.We asked ourselves, how can we give back to the community? the young Mombasa-born entrepreneur said. Money aside, noise pollution and air pollution can all be reduced in [Mombasa]. We thought that's very important.His electric tuk-tuks produce zero emissions; they are roomier, less noisy, and have lower running costs. Importantly, they are powered by lead-acid batteries, widely used in Kenya, rather than the lithium-ion batteries often found in electric vehicles.But despite offering environmentally friendly tuk-tuks at standard commercial prices, Solutions Africa has hardly sold a single e-tuk-tuk.Maybe we're a bit too early, said Molu, adding that the shorter driving range and concerns around the new technology deter buyers.Raising the profile of green transportThat's why Molu is pleased that President Ruto is strongly supporting green transport.Over the past year, [Ruto] has been doing lot to push electric mobility, said Molu. Look at how many new players are now on the market.He thinks the government could use financial incentives more cleverly to develop the green transport market. So far, his company has only benefited from a subsidy for making the tuk-tuks in Kenya, which also applies to combustion engine vehicles.Reducing the license fees for electric tuk-tuks in Mombasa is one way of promoting them, Molu said.Instead of 800 Kenyan shillings ($5.25 or \u20ac4.90), they could make e-tuk-tuk owners pay just 200 shillings, he said.But, Molu said, the company has recently received more inquiries about the e-tuk-tuks - perhaps thanks to Ruto's green policies or maybe because King Charles III and Queen Camilla sat in one when they visited Kenya last month.Africa's voice at COP28Last week, Ruto was in Dubai, where he delivered a speech at the COP28 climate summit on behalf of all African heads of state.There, he was praised by COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber for his unprecedented climate brilliance in bringing Africa together for the Africa Climate Summit.But is Ruto's green image a mere political calculation, as some commentators suggest, or is he a real green champion?What is important is that Africa has a new and loud voice speaking out about climate change and the importance of moving to a decarbonized future, Mwenda Mithika, Executive Director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance, told DW.We welcome any champion, any voice which adds to the voices of those pushing to tackle climate change, Mithika said. We never used to have that and I think civil society is very happy that [Ruto's] voice is very loud in this.This article was originally written in German.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/kenya-positions-itself-as-africa-s-climate-champion/a-67653369?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988170195165016325876100048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69TH-BWB1-F03R-N3DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1199\"/><timeReceived>12:17 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 7, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp;

The aim is to plant 15 billion trees on approximately 10.6 million hectares of land throughout the country, what will cost an estimated $ 5 billion.</p><p>Kenya's president William Ruto has thrown his weight behind this initiative as his government continues to find solutions to adverse effects of a prolonged drought that undermines food production in the country. 'Forests and trees regulate temperatures and water flows,' Ruto stated, while launching the initiative in December 2022. 'They also conserve biodiversity, provide habitats for wildlife and enhance the resilience of communities to climate change. Their potential to serve as carbon sinks offer tremendous climate-change mitigation capacities,' he added.</p><p>It has not been hard to convince Kenyans about the importance of planting trees. The country has faced a debilitating drought which claimed lives of people and livestock. For people like 42-year-old Sophia Wairimu, a farm owner in Kenya, the effects of climate change have become imminently felt in day-to-day life, prompting her urge to act.</p><p>Whereas Wairimu has always known about the need to have trees, she had never planted any on her three acres of land at the outskirts of Naivasha, north of Nairobi. Considering the new campaign, she has felt that it is now time to act. 'Since January this year, I have planted at least 100 trees,' she says. 'Some of them are fruit trees, while others will serve as fencing, and others will give us timber or firewood in years to come.'</p><p>Many Kenyans are complicit in carrying out deforestation without planting any new trees. Now, they are beginning to see the impact of their unsustainable lifestyle. Recalling her younger days, Wairimu says that her neighbourhood is a good example of how people have cut trees and cleared forests to pave way for construction of homes and infrastructure.</p><p>Kenya is an important country in the global efforts to achieve climate justice and counter climate change. It is the seat of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), and it is rightly serving as an example for other countries on the continent and beyond with this tree planting initiative.</p><p>The government has rightly recognised that efforts to mitigate climate change are not just a responsibility of the state, but that also collective action of individuals and organisations is needed. Therefore, Kenyan leaders are calling on all nationals and residents to plant at least 30 trees a year each. In a decade, each person could have contributed at 300 trees.</p><p>'I feel that I am part of a joint initiative, and it is my hope that everyone shall plant trees and make a difference,' Wairimu says. 'Hopefully, we shall have many trees in the landscape soon, just as it used to be when I was a little girl.'</p><p>Joseph Maina is a freelance writer based in Naivasha, Kenya.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0506202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68D1-DWG1-F00C-605K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"483\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 5, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Activists have blamed the high costs of travel and accommodation, along with restrictions in the isolated city for limiting the number of demonstrators.  <br/>Those who did make it on Saturday called for climate justice, criticizing developed nations for stalling negotiations to create a framework of compensation. <br/>Saturday's rallies also called for human and gender rights, with protesters saying both are linked to climate justice and urged for an end to a crackdown on rights and environmental activists, especially in developing nations. <br/>US, UK using 'delay tactics' <br/>Environmental NGO Greenpeace said that while many developed countries sought to address the compensation framework, the US and Britain were blocking progress on the issue by \"consistently using delay tactics\" to ensure that no agreement is reached on the issue until at least 2024. <br/>\"All the talk of deadlines and complexities about loss and damage is just code for climate delay, which is disappointing, but not surprising,\" said Yeb Sano, who leads the Greenpeace delegation in Egypt. <br/>\"How to restore the trust lost between the global north and global south? Five words: loss and damage finance facility,\" Sano added, in reference to the current plan that is being discussed. <br/>But US Climate Envoy cleared the air, saying ''it's a well known fact that the United States and many other countries will not establish some ... legal structure that is tied to compensation or liability. That's just not happening.\"  <br/>Kerry added that money could still be paid out, eventually, but in different forms such as aid tied into existing funds, requiring contributions from all major emitters. <br/>No agreement on 1.5 degrees <br/>As the two-week conference hit its midway point, negotiators were still drafting deals on a wide range of issues that will be presented to ministers next week. <br/>One main issue in the conference is the pledge to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), which countries reaffirmed in the last COP in Glasgow. The figure was the main recommendation from the Paris climate accord. <br/>In Egypt, negotiators have sought to \"keep 1.5 alive,'' but UN chief Antonio Guterres warned that the temperature goal is on life support \"and the machines are rattling.'' <br/>US Climate Envoy John Kerry said some countries have opposed the temperature goal. \"There are very few countries, but a few, that have raised the issue of not mentioning this word or that word,\" Kerry said when asked about opposition by some governments to mentioning the 1.5C target. <br/>jcg/aw (AP, dpa) <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/cop27-activists-rally-for-climate-reparations/a-63737897?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988166828443296325876100052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66VH-7TX1-JCMN-Y4S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><timeReceived>8:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 12, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp;

According to Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), a climate change advocacy group organized by the company's employees, over 1,800 employees worldwide have committed to participating in a walkout, with 870 of them being based at the company's headquarters in Seattle.  A portion of the employees planning to participate in the walkout will convene at the Amazon Sphere, a four-story building located in downtown Seattle, while others will engage in the protest remotely during lunchtime.   AECJ claims that the company has been sluggish in tackling its contribution to climate change. It points out that Amazon's emissions usage rose by 40 percent following the announcement of the Climate Pledge agreement in 2019. The group insists that the company needs to take further action to achieve zero emissions by 2030.   According to a news release from AEJC, the urgency of the climate crisis is evident, and the walkout presents a valuable opportunity for employees to unite in solidarity and protect the remaining portions of our planet. By participating in the walkout, employees will join forces with fellow Amazon workers who are advocating for improved climate policies and addressing related concerns, with the shared belief that collective action can drive meaningful change within the company.  In response to the walkout, an Amazon spokesperson acknowledged that achieving net zero carbon will require time for the company. They emphasized the company's commitment to reaching net zero carbon by 2040, highlighting the involvement of more than 400 companies in their Climate Pledge initiative.   The spokesperson acknowledged the complexities associated with a company like Amazon, which has significant power consumption, transportation, packaging, and physical assets, but assured that they are diligently working towards their goal. They also affirmed the company's determination to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2025, expressing a commitment to substantial investment, innovation, and collaboration both internally and externally.   The walkout occurs one month after the implementation of a company policy that mandates employees to work from the office for three days every week.  In a memo sent by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in February, it was stated that the company made the decision to require employees to work from the office for three days a week based on observations of employee work patterns during the pandemic. The conclusion drawn from these observations was that employees are more actively involved and collaborative when working in person.  Furthermore, the walkout follows multiple rounds of layoffs by the company in the last few months, resulting in the elimination of 27,000 positions across various divisions such as advertising, human resources, gaming, stores, devices, and web services.

Heatwaves, droughts, forest fires, floods and the rise in sea level, which is affecting coastal regions, are all increasing rapidly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The food security and livelihoods of many millions of people are at risk. With a current population of approximately 1.4 billion people, the World Bank estimates that by the year 2050, there will be up to 86 million climate refugees in Africa.</p><p>Women bear the brunt of the climate crisis. The reason is that patriarchal gender roles have assigned them primary responsibility for producing and preparing food, collecting water and harvesting energy. In most cases they also care for children as well as the elderly and sick.</p><p>WoMin wants to make African women's everyday realities visible and strengthen their position. The main goal of the work is to prevent the natural environment on which women depend from being further destroyed. In many countries, however, the environment is being threatened by large-scale extraction projects or infrastructure expansion.</p><p>Land grabbing and environmental destruction</p><p>In cooperation with women's groups, farmers and communities impacted by mining, WoMin is supporting resistance movements and campaigns against oil and mineral extraction and other mega projects. The organisation draws attention to the consequences of the climate crisis and the associated crises of land grabs, water scarcity and large-scale resource extraction.</p><p>At the Women's Climate Assembly, held in October 2022 in the Niger Delta, Ngozi Azumah from Nigeria spoke out against energy companies. She pointed out that the Delta's food and soils are very rich, but have been defiled by the pollution caused by oil and gas extraction. She spelled out that the companies do not compensate local people for the harm they cause. Azumah insisted that before fossil-fuel extraction began, 'we were working and contributing something'. Women's scope for economic activity and  feeding children has been reduced.</p><p>The event was supported by WoMin  and convened over 100 women from different women's organisations in West and Central Africa. All of them are working together to fight destructive large-scale projects. The participants believe that these often worsen the climate crisis and impact communities' access to communal resources such as water and farmlands. The event gave women a platform to discuss what kind of sustainable and just development solutions African women and their communities need to survive - now and in the future.</p><p>'Building the voices of rural women in climate action will make sure that there are real solutions to climate change,' Josiane Boyo Yebi from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire emphasised. 'Rural women are doubly impacted, they suffer the loss of the land and the consequences of the climate crisis.'</p><p>Specific projects</p><p>WoMin is active in 17 African countries and supports numerous initiatives, including a collective of women working in the fish processing industry in Bargny, Senegal. They are opposing a coal-fired power plant that is planned for their community. They fear that the plant will further poison their already polluted coast and thereby destroy their livelihoods.</p><p>In Madagascar, WoMin is working with the organisation CRAAD-OI (Centre de Recherches et d'Appui pour les Alternatives de D\u00e9veloppement-Oc\u00e9an Indien / Research and Support Center for Development Alternatives-Indian Ocean). It promotes climate justice for communities and sustainable development alternatives. The activists support a women-led resistance against the Australian mining project Base Toliara. The women believe that the planned extraction of minerals will threaten protected forests as well as the sovereignty of the indigenous Mikea community.</p><p>Opposing 'green' extractivism</p><p>In the Northern Cape province of South Africa, WoMin is directing its efforts against so-called green extractivism, which the organisation wants to expose as deceptive greenwashing.</p><p>International corporations and politicians continue to display a rapacious interest in Africa's wealth of natural resources and markets. 'Green' extractivism is a new form of raw material extraction. It refers to the extraction of the minerals and metals that are needed for the technologies that address climate change, such as lithium batteries, wind turbines, solar cells or electric vehicles. It also includes generating energy through 'green' gas, hydrogen, and mega-dams.</p><p>This kind of resource use is a false solution because it continues to violate human rights, destroying ecosystems in the name of fighting climate change. With regards to green extractivism, there are new  proposals for raw-material extraction every week. Companies are working with the state agencies. All too often, the promises they make are empty. Ultimately, the communities are likely to be robbed of their land and, consequently, their livelihoods. Local people do not benefit from raw-material extraction, and they are not compensated for land seizure and pollution.</p><p>Across Africa, WoMin is organising resistance to the distorted concept of 'development'. It is necessary to build movements that empower women, so communities can exercise their right to say 'no' to harmful projects.</p><p>WoMin's work also includes researching the cost and impact of destructive development projects, questioning the plans of governments and companies and supporting community-led actions. These efforts include legal support, advocacy campaigns and building development alternatives from the ground up.</p><p>Communities that oppose these projects are often subjected to harsh reprisals when they express their opinions. For that reason, WoMin and a network of allies have created the platform 'Rise Against Repression'. It collects the stories and testimonies of human-rights defenders who were subjected to repression or have even died (also note essay by Suparna Banerjee).</p><p>WoMin connects its demand for an end to destructive 'development' to a call for the payment of ecological debt for climate-related damage from historically responsible countries and polluters. The goal of all these activities is for women to come together in a pan-African movement to fight for climate justice. After all, their future is at stake.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1903202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67TD-VHF1-F00C-63FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1060\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 19, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They have the responsibility to address the situation and assist those who are suffering disproportionately because of the impacts. Climate change is a result of industrialisation, so high-income countries with long industrial histories must assume responsibility. Poor countries lack the means to cope with global environmental change, so they deserve support. Rich nations, however, must not only support poorer ones, they also need to drastically reduce their carbon emissions. Currently, they are not changing their unsustainable lifestyles and exploitative economic system as they should.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is the perspective of indigenous peoples?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We indigenous peoples have the smallest carbon footprints. We live in areas where the impacts of global warming are felt, but we do not have the means to cope with the rapid changes that are happening. In the past, we could adapt because things happened slowly. Now change has become fast, drastic and largely unpredictable.</p><p>To what extent are your voices heard in global debate?</p><p>We are making ourselves heard in climate talks but our rights and well-being are not fully addressed. We can make significant contributions, especially in regard to our knowledge and practices of sustainability. How we think about resources matters. We consider them valuable not only because they serve our present needs, but just as much because future generations will need them too. Therefore, we manage - and conserve - them diligently. Accordingly, a large share of the Earth's remaining biodiversity is found on indigenous peoples' territories. Indigenous communities focus on the common good, not individual interests.</p><p>Do you want that to be the international approach too?</p><p>Well, the global pattern is to look at resources from a commercial perspective, focusing on the monetary and commercial value. The profit-maximising extractivism is what has caused climate change. Businesses thrive on creating a lot of artificial demand so people will consume more. Production and consumption thus result from profit interests. Sustainability and social equity are not prioritised. This mindset needs to change.</p><p>Do you think that will happen?</p><p>Yes, I see mindsets changing, especially among young people. There is a trend of people reducing consumption to reduce their carbon footprint. They are also in the streets and taking action demanding governments to take drastic actions to save their future. Many people pay attention to recycling, moreover, buying second-hand clothes instead of new ones, for example. There is also a spirit of volunteering. People clean up, collect garbage and don't create more waste. Small changes matter. The more people join in, the more we will achieve. Nonetheless, we must still address the root causes. Those that have caused the crisis need to change their behaviour immediately. Systemic changes at a global scale to change the extractivist and unsustainable economic system must be implemented.</p><p>Were you happy with the results of the climate summit in Egypt last year?</p><p>It is a big step forward that a loss and damage mechanism will be established. I see it as a crucial accountability mechanism. From the perspective of indigenous peoples, loss and damage means renewing our harmonious relationship with nature. It is important to rehabilitate areas that were destroyed and degraded, and it requires funding and technical support. Direct, appropriate and adequate support and assistance to indigenous communities suffering from the impacts of climate change such as flooding and drought should also be provided. We need to ensure that the environmental destruction will not happen again.</p><p>What dangers are looming on the way to a sustainable world?</p><p>A just transition is an important part of climate justice. We support the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it must not harm indigenous communities. Unfortunately, that is what is happening. Our land is being grabbed for renewable energy projects - whether for windmills, solar farms or dams. The extraction of transition minerals without the consent of indigenous peoples, without equity and the protection of the environment is green colonialism in the name of climate action. We need to make sure that human rights are upheld and principles of social justice are applied in the course of the transition. Far too often, we indigenous peoples are not considered. Our resources are exploited without our free, prior and informed consent which is part of our fundamental right. Once again, we are on the losing end. We are being sacrificed, even though we are doing the most to protect the global environment.</p><p>What is your organisation, Indigenous Peoples Rights International (IPRI), doing?</p><p>We are raising awareness, supporting communities defending their lands, territories and resources and advancing policy reforms for the respect and protection of indigenous peoples' rights against criminalisation and human-rights violations with impunity. We insist on solutions that respect rights and facilitate inclusion. When decisions are made without us, no one understands the impacts of climate change and so-called development on our lives. We are doing what we can to make ourselves heard. We are not simply victims, we insist on our rights and we provide solutions.</p><p>Do you see racism in how the climate crisis is being addressed?</p><p>Yes, there is a strong racist undercurrent. Some people are privileged and others are denied their rights and a life in dignity. 'Why would we change our economic system and comfortable lifestyles?' is a racist attitude when the poor people, the majority of which are the 'coloured people' are suffering because of these. It flies in the face of the need for global solidarity to drastically reduce carbon emission at its source and assist those that are suffering from the impacts of climate change but have contributed the least.</p><p>In 2018, you were labelled a terrorist by the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, who was the president of the Philippines. How did that change your life?</p><p>I fully understand what human-rights defenders at risk are facing. It really affects you emotionally and mentally. It causes a lot of uncertainty, stress and anxiety. It becomes hard to focus on the work you want to do. Sometimes it makes it very difficult to pursue different advocacy strategies because of the risk and possible consequences to the life and well-being of activists in the front line.</p><p>Did you begin to doubt your mission?</p><p>No, I did not. Indeed, the government's approach strengthened my belief that we must not consider this kind of authoritarian governance normal. We need change. Trampling on human rights is plainly unacceptable. What I found encouraging, was the strong expression of solidarity at the local, national and international level. It was quite overwhelming, and ultimately made the administration drop the charges, not only against me, but other activists as well. At that time, UNEP, the UN Environment Programme, gave me the Champions of the Earth award. More generally speaking, environmental activists and human-rights defenders deserve to be honoured. We are not terrorists and should not be forced to live in fear. We are promoting the common good, not special interests.</p><p>Does the IPRI have more encouraging news from other countries?</p><p>Yes, recent developments in Brazil and Colombia are quite encouraging. People who are partners of IPRI have recently risen to powerful positions. S\u00f4nia Guajajara is now Brazil's federal minister for indigenous peoples, and Leonor Zalabata Torres is now Colombia's new permanent representative to the UN in New York. She is a member of our board. These two strong women will hopefully be able to make invaluable contributions to advance the protection of our rights, well-being and aspirations not only in their respective countries but globally as well.</p><p>How do you assess climate justice in \u00admiddle- and low-income countries?</p><p>I see more and more social movements rising up in these countries. On the other hand, there are more authoritarian governments. Political repression is a huge challenge. We face increasing risks when we speak out. In most places, the approach to development is still unsustainable. The only good thing is that Jair Bolsonaro was not reelected in Brazil. However, he still has many supporters and there is a right-wing movement. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva attending the climate summit in Egypt, however, was a breath of fresh air. We as indigenous people met with him there and appreciated his clear commitment to protecting the Amazon.</p><p>How do you assess the situation in China?</p><p>China is a very complex country. What is clear is that China is aspiring dominance, which is why they are offering huge investments and funding. They are literally all over Asia, Africa and Latin America with investments. China does not have effective accountability mechanisms, and they have a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. The People's Republic of China is positioning itself as an economic power, but with no environmental or social safeguards including respecting and protecting human rights.</p><p>Do you see any positive impulses coming from China in terms of climate issues?</p><p>At the domestic level, I think they are trying to rise to the challenges. That is a good thing for the Chinese people. They focus on gaining economic control globally but not on achieving sustainability and social equity. They need to acknowledge that we share the world's resources and we must collectively manage them sustainably to the benefit of all of humanity. That is what global solidarity is about. We will all be doomed if every country - not only China - does what it can to protect its own people to the detriment of others.</p><p>Joan Carling is an indigenous rights and environmental activist.

A court order has deemed the turbines' location in Norway illegal, as they disrupt Sami reindeer-herding traditions.The Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg joined Indigenous Sami demonstrators on Monday, blocking the entrance to Norway's Energy Ministry. </p><p><br/>The demonstrators in Oslo are calling for the government to carry out a court order that deemed wind turbines in northwestern Norway illegal. <br/>Why are the wind farms controversial? <br/>The Sami Indigenous people, who are spread out across mostly parts of Norway, but also Sweden, Finland and Russia, have been herding reindeer for centuries. The practice represents a preservation of both livelihood and tradition. <br/>Herders say the loud sounds produced by the wind turbines scare away reindeer. <br/>In 2021, Norway's Supreme Court ruled that two wind farms on the northwestern Fosen peninsula violated the rights of six Sami families. <br/>The ruling stipulated that the farms breached the UN International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, as they prevented the Sami families from practicing their culture of reindeer herding. <br/>What did Thunberg say? <br/>The Supreme Court's ruling did not say what should happen to the turbines on the farms. The turbines in Fosen, therefore, operate to this day. <br/>\"Indigenous rights, human rights, must go hand-in-hand with climate protection and climate action. That can't happen at the expense of some people. Then it is not climate justice,\" Thunberg told Reuters news agency outside the ministry's main entrance with other demonstrators. <br/>Protesters had occupied the ministry's reception area since Thursday. They were forcibly removed and temporarily detained in the early hours of Monday, only to convene again hours later, this time outside the ministry. <br/>Sami protesters wore the gakti, their traditional costume, inside out as a sign of dissent. <br/>What has the response been? <br/>The Energy Ministry said it was hoping to find a compromise on what it said was a complex legal quandary.

Activists were still occupying around 15 \"structures,\" including treehouses and other hideouts.  Police were also trying to advance down a tunnel where two activists had barricaded themselves, according to the spokesman.   Activists in treehouses called out to wake one another in the early hours, according to a dpa reporter at the scene. Large parts of the site were lit with floodlights.  Workers resumed their demolition of the remaining buildings early on Saturday, including the home of the last farmer in the hamlet, according to the reporter.  Clearing and demolition work began on Wednesday in the L\\xFCtzerath, in state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Around 470 activists have since been removed, of whom 320 left voluntarily, according to the police.   The police knew about four injured activists, the spokesperson said, noting that the injuries had occurred during \"resistance activities\" such as people glueing themselves to things, as well as one fall.  Five police officers had been injured by pyrotechnics, while charges were issued against 124 people, mainly for breach of peace and resistance, the spokesperson said.  L\\xFCtzerath is the latest flashpoint for climate activists opposed to Germany's continued use of coal.  The energy company RWE, which owns the site, wants to excavate the lignite underneath. According to the government, this is necessary to ensure energy security. The activists reject this, arguing that the lignite in the current open-cast mine is sufficient.  Later on Saturday, Thunberg is expected to take part in the rally against the demolition of L\\xFCtzerath.   Police expect 8,000 participants at the demonstration in the neighbouring village of Keyenberg, which, like L\\xFCtzerath, is part of the larger Rhineland town of Erkelenz.   The motto of the demonstration is \"Prevent eviction! For climate justice.\"  According to the organizers, the programme with bands and live acts will start at 11 am (1000 GMT) and the demonstration itself at noon.  Participants are expected from 50 cities and 14 federal states, Fridays for Future said.  The situation in L\\xFCtzerath was a huge international embarrassment for the German government, Thunberg told dpa in Cologne ahead of the protest. People had been defending L\\xFCtzerath for years, as part of a global justice movement, she said, describing the activism as a sign of hope.  The 20-year-old called on all citizens to join the demonstration.

He has some support but will also have to deal with critics.The United Arab Emirates on Thursday named the head of the national oil company as president of this year's United Nations climate talks. </p><p><br/>Sultan al-Jaber's appointment as president-designate of the conference known as COP28, prompted fierce criticism from environmental activists. <br/>\"I sincerely believe that climate action today is an immense economic opportunity for investment in sustainable growth,\" he was quoted as saying, promising a \"pragmatic\" approach. <br/>But climate activists said the chief executive officer of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company can not lead the conference. <br/>\"This appointment goes beyond putting the fox in charge of the henhouse,\" Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice at ActionAid, said. <br/>Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said the appointment \"poses an outrageous conflict of interest.\" <br/>Why was al-Jaber chosen? <br/>Each year, the country hosting the UN negotiations, known as the Conference of the Parties, or COP, nominates a person to chair the talks. The nominee's position as \"COP president'' is confirmed by delegates at the start of the discussions, usually without objections. <br/>Al-Jaber, the UAE's minister of industry, is also the Gulf state's special envoy for climate change and has participated in more than 10 COP meetings. <br/>He is also the CEO of Masdar, the UAE's renewable energy company, and has \"played a key role in shaping the country's clean energy path,\" according to the UAE. <br/>\"This will be a critical year in a critical decade for climate action,\" al-Jaber was quoted as saying. <br/>He has a tough balancing act ahead of him, Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School of international affairs at Tufts University in the US, warned. <br/>\"The UAE is competing to be the most efficient and lowest-cost source of fossil fuels as global production must diminish through the energy transition,\" she said. \"It will be challenging as COP president to unite countries around more aggressive action while at the same time suggesting that other producers stop producing because UAE has you covered.\" <br/>COP28 in the UAE<br/>The UAE, one of the world's biggest crude producers, will host COP28 in Dubai in November and December. <br/>COP27, held in Egypt in November, concluded with the adoption of a hotly contested text on aid to developing countries affected by climate change but failed to set new ambitions for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. <br/>Al-Jaber promised an \"inclusive agenda\" that ramps up action on emissions cuts, encourages a just energy transition, and ensures \"substantial, affordable climate finance\" geared to the countries most vulnerable to climate change. <br/>Former UN climate chief Yvo de Boer offered support for the UAE and al-Jaber, saying his work in \"green growth strategy\" and renewable energy give him the \"understanding, experience and responsibility\" to make COP28 a success. <br/>lo/msh (AP, AFP, dpa) <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/cop28-uae-names-oil-chief-to-head-climate-talks/a-64364082?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099881673540442459258793000147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:679J-FMV1-JCMN-Y21N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"536\"/><timeReceived>4:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 12, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00064TY</classCode><className>ABU DHABI NATIONAL OIL CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ACTIONAID INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CITY KIDS FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC1311 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp;

The 10 billion fund, announced by Bezos in Feb 2020, was set up to provide funds to programs, organizations and various efforts undertaken to fight climate change, bring down the carbon levels across the world and offer better data programs and analytics to monitor the economics and the results of this new economy.   On Monday, Amazon announced that $2 billion of the $10 billion would be set aside for restoring nature and changing food systems. Earlier, during Climate Week NYC held in September, the Bezos Earth Fund had committed $1 billion for nature, bringing the total amount spent to $3 billion for conservation, landscape restoration, and food-systems transformation.   Bezos Earth Fund CEO Andrew Steer said, \"The goal of the Bezos Earth Fund is to identify the major transitions we need to go through as an economy and as a society in the world, and to identify where we can help accelerate these transitions that are necessary.\"     The Bezos Earth Fund is completely different from the Climate Pledge Fund set up at Amazon. The Climate Pledge Fund is committed to developing technologies that Amazon and other companies will require to be carbon emissions free by 2040.     At the Bezos Earth Fund, there is a committed team of professionals that make plans for investment. They make proposals, do research and advise.   According to Steer, the evolution to a green economy is a series of large changes, and within each of those large changes, there is another series of smaller steps.   \"There is a big transition, like the energy system, the food system, manufacturing, the built environment, transportation, and so on. And each of these has four or five sub-transitions, which in and of themselves are quite large,\" he added.     In September, the Bezos Earth Fund had pledged $203.7 million in grants to non-profits working in climate justice, advocacy for climate savvy economic recovery, and decarbonization innovation.   Grants were also given to other initiatives as well like decarbonization innovation, climate-focused economic recovery and climate justice among others.      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-163605638900884AFU0883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:640W-6SD1-DXCW-C078-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"389\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 4, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Making deals with fossil fuel corporations such as energy giant RWE - which has bought the site of L\\xFCtzerath for mining - \"show where their priorities are,\" Thunberg said of the Greens, who form part of Germany's coalition government, in an interview with dpa.  Leading Green politicians such as Economy Minister Robert Habeck have defended the demolition of L\\xFCtzerath, arguing that the coal below is needed to maintain energy security in the current crisis.   \"The coal that is in the ground here will not lower prices immediately. Anyone who thinks like that is simply out of touch with reality,\" Thunberg said.  The Greens are also in power in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where the village of L\\xFCtzerath has become the latest flashpoint for activists opposed to the government's continued use of coal.  Police said that several thousand participants were at Saturday's rally in the neighbouring village of Keyenberg, despite the pouring rain. Both Keyenberg and L\\xFCtzerath belong to the larger Rhineland town of Erkelenz.   The motto of the demonstration is \"Prevent eviction! For climate justice.\"  Activists from climate action groups including Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion and Last Generation travelled to the site from across the country.   Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach said the rally would be a challenge for the emergency forces, anticipating more participants than the organizers had announced. Police had previously spoken of 8,000 protesters.   Weinspach warned against attempts to enter L\\xFCtzerath, which is now cordoned off, or a nearby open-cast mine - as activists had called for on social media.   In L\\xFCtzerath, meanwhile, the police continued removing activists on Saturday. Officers climbed up trees where activists were holding out, according to a dpa reporter at the scene.   RWE said it was preparing to remove activists from a tunnel, in an operation described by a police spokesperson as a \"rescue.\"  The protesters in the tunnel were thought to be doing fine and had enough food to spend several days there, according to Bente Opitz of L\\xFCtzerath Lebt (L\\xFCtzerath Lives). Several dozen activists remain in the hamlet, on roofs and in trees, according to the activist group.  The police gave no comment on the number of remaining activists. A spokesperson said they had pretty much cleared the area of activists \"above ground,\" while around 15 \"structures\" remained, including treehouses and other hideouts.  Workers resumed their demolition of the remaining buildings early on Saturday, including the home of the last farmer in the hamlet, according to the dpa reporter at the scene.  Thunberg said she had previously visited L\\xFCtzerath, which \"looked completely different then.\"  Of the nearby open-cast mine, she said: \"It looks like Mordor, it really does. It shows what humans under the wrong circumstances are capable of,\" referring to the realm of evil in J.R.R. Tolkien's book \"Lord of the Rings.\"  The clearing and demolition work at L\\xFCtzerath began on Wednesday. Around 470 activists have since been removed, of whom 320 left voluntarily, according to the police.   The police knew about four injured activists, the spokesperson said, noting that the injuries had occurred during \"resistance activities\" such as people glueing themselves to things, as well as one fall.  Five police officers had been injured by pyrotechnics, while charges were issued against 124 people, mainly for breach of peace and resistance, the spokesperson said.

Making deals with fossil fuel corporations such as energy giant RWE - which has bought the site of L\\xFCtzerath for mining - \"show where their priorities are,\" Thunberg said of the Greens, who form part of Germany's coalition government, in an interview with dpa.  Leading Green politicians such as Economy Minister Robert Habeck have defended the demolition of L\\xFCtzerath, arguing that the coal below is needed to maintain energy security in the current crisis.   \"The coal that is in the ground here will not lower prices immediately. Anyone who thinks like that is simply out of touch with reality,\" Thunberg said.  The Greens are also in power in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where the village of L\\xFCtzerath has become the latest flashpoint for activists opposed to the government's continued use of coal.  Police said that several thousand participants were at Saturday's rally in the neighbouring village of Keyenberg, despite the pouring rain. Both Keyenberg and L\\xFCtzerath belong to the larger Rhineland town of Erkelenz.   The motto of the demonstration is \"Prevent eviction! For climate justice.\"  Activists from climate action groups including Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion and Last Generation travelled to the site from across the country.   Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach said the rally would be a challenge for the emergency forces, anticipating more participants than the organizers had announced. Police had previously spoken of 8,000 protesters.   Weinspach warned against attempts to enter L\\xFCtzerath, which is now cordoned off, or a nearby open-cast mine - as activists had called for on social media.   In L\\xFCtzerath, meanwhile, the police continued removing activists on Saturday. Officers climbed up trees where activists were holding out, according to a dpa reporter at the scene.   RWE said it was preparing to remove activists from a tunnel, in an operation described by a police spokesperson as a \"rescue.\"  The protesters in the tunnel were thought to be doing fine and had enough food to spend several days there, according to Bente Opitz of L\\xFCtzerath Lebt (L\\xFCtzerath Lives). Several dozen activists remain in the hamlet, on roofs and in trees, according to the activist group.  The police gave no comment on the number of remaining activists. A spokesperson said they had pretty much cleared the area of activists \"above ground,\" while around 15 \"structures\" remained, including treehouses and other hideouts.  Workers resumed their demolition of the remaining buildings early on Saturday, including the home of the last farmer in the hamlet, according to the dpa reporter at the scene.  Thunberg said she had previously visited L\\xFCtzerath, which \"looked completely different then.\"  Of the nearby open-cast mine, she said: \"It looks like Mordor, it really does. It shows what humans under the wrong circumstances are capable of,\" referring to the realm of evil in J.R.R. Tolkien's book \"Lord of the Rings.\"  The clearing and demolition work at L\\xFCtzerath began on Wednesday. Around 470 activists have since been removed, of whom 320 left voluntarily, according to the police.   The police knew about four injured activists, the spokesperson said, noting that the injuries had occurred during \"resistance activities\" such as people glueing themselves to things, as well as one fall.  Five police officers had been injured by pyrotechnics, while charges were issued against 124 people, mainly for breach of peace and resistance, the spokesperson said.

Others targeted Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's world-famous painting \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" in the Netherlands.</p><p>In Germany members of the climate group Last Generation which is demanding a speed limit on the country's motorways as well as more affordable public transport have also been associated with the tactic for example when using it to cause blockades at Berlin and Munich airports last year.</p><p>In Munich police have set up a special unit dubbed Glue-On-Team to deal with such cases.</p><p>After a long period of testing different substances including on themselves the officers now swear by a mixture of cooking oil and soapy water.</p><p>They only use stronger agents like acetone - a solvent used in nail polish remover for example - in emergencies due to health risks.</p><p>Luckily most activists refrain from using more powerful two-component adhesives which often require a trip to the hospital with a gouged-out piece of tarmac stuck to the hand.</p><p>In order to dissolve superglue the Munich police officers like their colleagues in other German states carry brushes of various sizes as well as spatulas and gauze bandages in a large black bag in addition to their special solvent - pink soapy water containing equal amounts of soap and water mixed with commercially available cooking oil.</p><p>The bandages are used to apply the slick mixture in the most pain-free manner possible carefully slid back and forth underneath the palm like dental floss.</p><p>Every few minutes police chief Can Palabiyik pours warm water over the hand glued to the paving stone which cools down surprisingly quickly in the cold air and takes on a purple hue.</p><p>Kneeling on pads the officers usually spend between 30 minutes to about an hour patiently brushing away depending on the nature of the substrate and the amount of adhesive used.</p><p>Most of the activists are cooperative and glad to be freed at the end says Michael Trinkl head of the Munich Glue-on-Team.</p><p>His people he emphasizes always try to be as gentle as possible - which the activists appreciate. \"I have only had good experiences with police in Munich\" confirms Andreas Hochenauer from the Last Generation group.</p><p>For more than a year Last Generation activists have been blocking traffic in major German cities including Berlin Hamburg and Munich but also in smaller cities such as Magdeburg Jena Passau and Reutlingen by glueing themselves to busy roads with superglue.</p><p>According to the group it staged 1250 street blockades all over Germany until January 24 which marked the anniversary of the first action in Berlin in 2022 with some 800 people taking part.</p><p>Protesters were taken into police custody more than 1200 times over that period it said.</p><p>In Bavaria the Ministry of the Interior counted 30 completed blockades until the beginning of January. The Glue-on-Team says it has been called out 35 times so far including to street blockades as well as actions in companies or museums.</p><p>Officers in other German states proceed in a similar manner to the Munich glue experts according to protesters. \"I was actually released very gently and carefully four times and the police officers asked me every 30 seconds how I was doing how I felt and that I should tell them if it hurt\" says activist Lars Sch\u00e4fer recalling his experiences during climate protests in Hamburg Flensburg and Hanover.</p><p>However he has witnessed cases in which large pieces of skin remained stuck to the street after the activists had been detached.</p><p>In Munich the process of freeing glued-on protesters is always filmed \"because in the rarest of cases it happens that people suffer minor injuries while being detached\" Trinkl explains. However only one young woman has been affected so far in the Bavarian capital after she glued herself onto the road twice on the same day with the same hand he says.</p><p>Normally only adhesive residue remains on the reddened hand which  may feel a little more sensitive than usual. Those effects usually fade away within a day.</p><p>Hochenauer 30 and Sch\u00e4fer 40 therefore worry less about being detached by police when glueing themselves to the road than about being attacked by angry drivers. In Berlin for example someone once drove over the foot of an activist sitting on the floor.</p><p>They are also concerned about the legal consequences for the protests which in Bavaria can range from fines to preventive detention.</p><p>However neither sees an alternative to participating in the climate actions. </p><p>While Hochenauer considers it to be a moral obligation to stand up for climate justice as a privileged Western European for Sch\u00e4fer it is \"actually an act of desperation. I see these pictures and I have my little child in my arms and I'm afraid that it's going to be a very terrible world that we're rushing towards\" he says.</p><p>In order to prevent this from happening he is happy to accept the consequences for the glueing actions the activist says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><br/>A police officer removes the hand of a climate activist from the street at Gro\u00dfer Stern in front of the Victory Column in Berlin.

He did not give the number of injured, the severity of the injuries or what exactly caused them.  For four days police have been working to clear L\\xFCtzerath so that it can be demolished to make way for the expansion of an open-pit coal mine.   Police deployed water cannon, batons and pepper spray as they tried to push back protesters holding a large demonstration despite powerful wind and rain outside the abandoned hamlet in western Germany's industrial Rhineland.   What remains of the village has been fenced off, but a contingent of activists is still holed up there, many of them in tree houses.  While organizers estimated the number of participants in the demonstration against energy giant RWE's plans to mine the site for coal at 35,000, police counted about 15,000 people, the spokesman said.  Around 1,000 of them, mostly masked, had exerted considerable pressure on police lines at the edge of the open pit and on the outskirts of L\\xFCtzerath, he added, resulting in the use of batons and pepper spray.  Protesters climbed over and damaged several emergency vehicles that were forming a barrier in front of the fence around the village, but the fence itsef was not breached.  The spokesman stressed that the police only resorted to using force and water cannon after repeatedly warning protesters to get back.  According to police, clearance operations were suspended on Saturday evening and were to be continued on Sunday.   By nightfall, the situation had calmed down, according to a dpa reporter at the scene, with many of the rally participants having departed.  Earlier, hundreds of demonstrators confronted the police outside the village, with some shouting, \"On to L\\xFCtzerath! On to L\\xFCtzerath!\"   They were echoing calls by a speaker during an earlier rally who said activists should press onwards to the site.   A police spokesperson said that \"immediate coercion\" had to be used to prevent the demonstrators from advancing to L\\xFCtzerath as the last buildings at the former settlement are currently being torn down. The residents have long since left.  When some demonstrators tried to reach L\\xFCtzerath or access the open-cast mining area, police used force to push them back. Walking to the edge of the open pit was life-threatening because the ground was softened by rainfall, leading to a risk of landslides, officers said.   \"I am absolutely appalled how normal assembly participants allow themselves to sufficiently carried away to the point of entering the absolute danger zone here,\" Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach told dpa.   Police reports said isolated demonstrators also attacked police patrol cars and threw fireworks in the direction of officers.   Earlier at the rally, held under the motto \"Prevent eviction! For climate justice,\" a speaker called on demonstrators to disobey police orders.   He said that it was legitimate for participants to try to enter the L\\xFCtzerath, although it is cordoned off. \"Don't let the police stop you. We are powerful. We are on the side of justice. We will not be stopped by this repressive system. We stop this open pit mining. Do whatever you think is right.\"  The rally's keynote speaker was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who criticized the country's Green Party for supporting the demolition of the village for lignite mining.   Deals with fossil fuel corporations such as RWE - which bought the site for mining - \"show where their priorities are,\" Thunberg said of the Greens, who form part of Germany's coalition government, in an interview with dpa.  Leading Green politicians such as Economy Minister Robert Habeck have defended L\\xFCtzerath's demolition, arguing that the coal below is needed to maintain energy security in the current crisis.   \"The coal that is in the ground here will not lower prices immediately. Anyone who thinks like that is simply out of touch with reality,\" Thunberg said.  The Greens are also in power in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where the village has become the latest flashpoint for activists opposed to the government's continued use of coal.

They are scheduled to hold a vigil in front of the Bank of England later in the evening. <br/>Organizers said similar protests were being held in 26 other countries around the world in an attempt to focus attention on the fact that banks are profiting off of environmental destruction by funding the fossil fuel industry as world leaders prepare to meet in Glasgow, Scotland, Sunday for the COP26 climate summit. <br/>Protesters say they are calling on financial institutions to finally stop the extraction of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. <br/>\"We've come here today as a part of this week of action because ... the UK and corporations in the UK have been funding climate chaos and the destruction of our islands for decades,\" said Joseph Sikuli, an activist from the South Pacific island nation of Tonga. <br/>\"Today we're outside @StanChart asking them to stop funding our destruction,\" Thunberg tweeted Friday. <br/>'Climate justice' march also expected in Glasgow <br/>Thunberg and other young activists from various corners of the globe will be traveling to Scotland for the 12-day United Nations COP26 climate change summit. Thunberg has also announced plans to attend a November 5 \"climate justice\" march in Glasgow. <br/>A leader in the \"Fridays for Future\" climate protest movement that she is largely credited with starting back in 2018, the 18-year-old Swede was not optimistic that the 26th incarnation of the climate summit would bring about the dramatic changes needed to stop global warming. <br/>\"As it is now, this COP will not lead to any big changes, we're going to have to continue pushing,\" Thunberg told reporters at a climate concert in Stockholm last week. <br/><br/>js/wd (AFP, Reuters) <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

One of them is Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya, a farmer and mountain guide. According to data from the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Germanwatch, Lake Palcacocha, located several kilometres above Huaraz, has more than quadrupled in volume since 2003. It is now 34 times larger than it was in 1970. Climate change is raising the risk that large ice blocks will break off the glacier and fall into the lake, which would cause a destructive tidal and inundate the city with a metre of water.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya refuses to simply accept this threat. In November 2015, with support from Germanwatch, he filed a lawsuit against the energy company RWE in a Germancivil court. The company is one of many corporations whose business model is based on fossil fuels. RWE is one of Europe's largest carbon emitters, and Germany's largest. It must therefore bear some responsibility for the climate crisis in general and the flooding risk in Huaraz in particular.</p><p>Special about this lawsuit is that, for the first time, someone affected by climate change is asking a private company to contribute in the necessary protective measures. Lliuya wants RWE to fund adaptation measures at Lake Palcacocha. He wants its contribution to be commensurate with the company's share of responsibility for the global climate crisis.</p><p>According to 'Carbon Majors', a report published by the NGO Climate Justice Programme in 2014, RWE is accountable for 0.47 percent of all greenhouse gases emitted globally since the beginning of the industrial era. According to data from Germanwatch, the construction of a levee on the Andean lake would cost around $ 4 million. Approximately half a percent of that would be $ 20,000, which would be RWE's contribution.</p><p>Risk of a water shortage and flooding</p><p>Should RWE be unable for legal reasons to fund protective measures along the lake, the plaintiff wants the conglomerate to pay a share of the costs for the measures that are needed to protect his house from the risk of flooding. From the start, it mattered to Lliuya that the lawsuit would not only benefit him personally. He is committed to protecting his home town and its people. In future, the glacier retreat may cause water shortages too.</p><p>The activist wants to educate residents of Huarez about the existing risks. Moreover, he intends to involve them in the drafting of adaptation strategies.</p><p>Peru's authorities should be held responsible for upholding their duties too. Ultimately, the German court case could set a precedent that others affected by climate change could invoke in court. That too would exert pressure on policymakers.</p><p>Big win after initial defeat</p><p>The Peruvian activist initially suffered a defeat. The Regional Court of Essen, Germany, dismissed his case in 2016. However, the court of next instance, the Higher Regional Court of Hamm, determined at the end of 2017 that a civil claim against RWE was possible in principle. It decided to start hearing evidence, and that was a big win for the climate movement. For the first time, judges confirmed that a private company is responsible in principle for its share of climate-\u00adrelated damage.</p><p>The Higher Regional Court of Hamm decided to gather evidence on-site in \u00adHuaraz. That procedure had to be postponed multiple times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, in late 2022, it became possible to make the trip, and two judges from the Higher Regional Court travelled to Peru with court-appointed experts. They wanted to determine whether the plaintiff's house would actually be threatened by a potential tidal wave.</p><p>Concerns about a flood of lawsuits</p><p>The experts have not yet compiled their report. It will be submitted to the court and the parties, and the litigants will get time to file their responses. Quite possibly, the report will then be discussed in an oral hearing as well. According to media reports, the Higher Regional Court expects the next oral hearing to take place in the first half of 2023.</p><p>RWE is casting doubt both on its liability and the admissibility of the climate lawsuit. Before the court, its attorneys expressed the concern that this case might trigger a flood of lawsuits against private-sector companies. The corporation is trying to show that it is impossible to attribute glacier melting in the Andes to the emissions caused by an individual company. RWE is even questioning whether climate change is causing the melting. Scientists, meanwhile, have delivered new arguments in support of Lliuya. A research team from the University of Oxford has modelled the retreat of a glacier above Lake Palcacocha and the corresponding increase in the flood risk. They thus established a rather clear causal chain for a worsening flood risk in specific places due to climate change.</p><p>Climate activists have long argued that countries with high past and current emissions, as the instigators of global warming, should financially support low-income countries that are dealing with damage and losses. Companies like RWE should also bear some of the costs of the risks and \u00addamages that are being incurred as a result of their business model. The lawsuit of Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya is making an important facett of this international debate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2202202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67M2-F0V1-F00C-6214-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"876\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>February 22, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The Swedish-based award is often dubbed the Alternative Nobel Prize.Two Somali human rights activists, a group of Ukrainian human rights activists and a Venezuela organization received the Right Livelihood Awards on Wednesday in Stockholm in recognition of their peace and justice efforts. </p><p><br/>Somali Fartuun Adan and her daughter Ilwad Elman won the prize for their courage in promoting peace, demilitarization and human rights in Somalia in the face of terrorism and gender-based violence. <br/>A third African, Dickens Kamugisha, was honored for his courageous work for climate justice and community rights violated by extractivist energy projects in Uganda. <br/>Ukrainian activist Oleksandra Matviichuk and her Center for Civil Liberties also received the award, alongside the Venezuelan collective Cecosesola and the Ugandan Africa Institute for Energy Governance (AFIEGO). <br/>Founded in 1980, the Right Livelihood Award (also known as the Alternative Nobel) honors and supports courageous people solving global problems. The award comes with long-term support to highlight and expand the laureates' work. <br/>To date, 190 laureates from 74 countries have received the award. <br/>Elman's dedication to peace <br/>Ilwad Elman, 33, was only 7 when her father, Elman Ali Ahmed, a prominent Somali peace activist, was assassinated in 1996 in their home country. <br/>When she was 2 years old, the civil war broke out in Somalia, forcing her family to seek refuge in neighboring countries before resettling in Canada. <br/>Ahmed's killing was linked to Elman Peace \u2014 a nonprofit organization Elman's mother, Adan, founded together with Ahmed in 1990. <br/>Though safely in Canada, Adan and Elman were restless about the turmoil at home. <br/>Their restlessness grew into discontent, and, finally, Adan returned to Somalia in 2006 to continue Elman Peace's work and her husband's legacy. Four years later, Elman joined her mother in Somalia. <br/>Together, the duo has pioneered peace and justice projects across Somalia.  <br/>They have also championed climate and security, human rights and protection, gender and equality issues, education, livelihood, and job creation-related projects in Somalia. <br/>Since the fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, Somalia and its people have not known peace, and, currently, the government is battling the al-Shabab extremist group. <br/>Documenting Russia's 'war crimes' in Ukraine<br/>Ukrainian rights defender Matviichuk was crowned this year's Right Livelihood Award winner jointly with her Center for Civil Liberties (CCL), which also won the Nobel Peace Prize in October. <br/>Set up in 2007 to promote human rights values, the center has been hard at work, documenting Russian illegal activities in Ukraine since annexing the Crimea region in 2014. <br/>The center's important documentation activities were even more valuable since Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year. <br/>The body says it has recoded over 21,000 examples of what it says are Russian war crimes committed in Ukraine since 2014. <br/>Standing up for Uganda's voiceless <br/>Ugandan activist Dickens Kamugisha has resisted government and corporate threats as his organization, Africa Institute for Energy Governance (AFIEGO), ensures that communities affected by colonialist extractive energy projects can raise their voices on national and international levels. <br/>According to government estimates, Uganda has between 1.8 billion and 2.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the country's northwestern Albertine region. <br/>As a result of their activities to prevent environmental damage and protect the rights of communities, AFIEGO has faced threats and harassment from the authorities.  <br/>Kamugisha is also an advocate of the High Court of Uganda and a member of Uganda Law Society and East African Law Society. <br/>Facing Venezuela's economic woes <br/>Struggling under a battered economy, many Venezuelans have chosen to flee the country in recent years.Three-quarters of those who remain in the country live in extreme poverty. <br/>The Venezuelan Cecosesola (Central de Cooperativas de Lara) connects organizations from low-income areas to provide affordable goods and services to over 100,000 families. <br/>The network offers funeral services, food markets, a health network, loans services and agricultural production, as it continues to expand for some 55 years. <br/>\"Cecosesola is a beacon that inspires those that are looking for a different way to approach economic activities, transcending the traditional hierarchical model present in private and governmental enterprises,\" the website of the Right Livelihood award said.

Earlier this month, Malaysian officials in Paris were able to prevent French authorities from confiscating several properties in the French capital.  <br/>\"These jurisdictions, for example, Spain, Luxembourg, France We want their governments to respect our government How can a commercial arbitrator come and question our sovereignty?\" Malaysia's law minister, Azalina Othman Said, said in a parliamentary speech earlier this month.  <br/>The colonial legacy <br/>Europe's colonial legacy \"has become an important obstacle in the EU's efforts to upgrade relations with African nations,\" noted Shada Islam, a Brussels-based specialist on European Union affairs. But, so far, it hasn't been such an important topic of opprobrium in Southeast Asia.  <br/>\"References to colonial practices are sometimes made in reference to what Southeast Asian nations view as the EU's restrictive trade policies, especially as regards palm oil, but these are largely in off-the-record comments, not in official discourses,\" she added.  <br/>But the colonial legacy still lingers. Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, was forced to apologize after his remarks last year in which he described Europe as an idyllic \"garden\" and the rest of the world as mostly a \"jungle.\" <br/>\"Some have misinterpreted the metaphor as 'colonial Euro-centrism,'\" Borrell wrote in a blog post in October. \"I am sorry if some have felt offended.\" <br/>What is now Malaysia gained its independence from Britain in 1957, while all Southeast Asian nations except Thailand were at one point colonized by a European power. Many also underwent Japanese occupation in the 1940s, and the Philippines was once a colony of the United States.  <br/>The Sulu heirs <br/>Eight descendants of the Sulu sultanate, funded by a London-based investor, have filed applications in multiple arbitration courts across Europe.  <br/>The claimants argue Kuala Lumpur has reneged on a land deal made in 1878 between Jamalul Kiram II, the last Sultan of Sulu, and the British North Borneo Company, a trading company, over the use of land that is now part of the Malaysian state of Sabah.  <br/>After it gained independence, Malaysia paid the heirs a token sum for decades but broke off those payments in 2013 after a self-proclaimed descendant of Jamalul Kiram II invaded the Lahad Datu district, in Sabah, with around 200 militants from nearby Philippines.  <br/>Last year, a French arbitration court ordered the Malaysian government to pay the $15 billion to the Sulu claimants. But Malaysia \u2014 which did not participate in the original arbitration as it claims the process an illegal land grab \u2014 obtained a stay on the ruling while it pursues an appeal. A decision could come as early as June. <br/>The Sulu heirs are also trying to obtain seizure orders against Malaysia-owned property from other European courts. On March 7, French bailiffs attempted to enforce a seizure order on three Paris properties owned by the Malaysian government, but they were turned away by officials at the Malaysian embassy in Paris, Reuters reported.  <br/>It is thought that this was in relation to a debt of \u20ac2.3 million awarded to the heirs by an earlier preliminary arbitration award in Spain. The French authorities are now evaluating whether those three properties, which are reportedly not diplomatic premises, can be seized. According to the UN convention on arbitration, all state assets aside from diplomatic property can be seized after such an arbitration ruling abroad.  <br/>Colonial legacy <br/>The Sulu heirs claim their side is the one fighting the \"anti-imperialist\" battle. They purport to be the victims battling for \"justice\" for those \"dispossessed\" by Western imperialism, according to statements from their lawyers.  <br/>But the Malaysian government also sees it through anti-colonial eyes: European courts are threatening to breach its sovereignty to appropriate billions of dollars of its wealth.  <br/>According to Rahul Mishra, a senior lecturer at the Asia-Europe Institute of University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, the focus of the Malaysian government is \"still on Sulu heirs and not the European courts of law, which should be beneficial for the EU in not getting dragged into a controversy.\"  <br/>But that could change once those courts give their final arbitration rulings, and if Malaysia-owned property is confiscated by European bailiffs.  <br/>Europe's colonial legacy could also become more prominent in relations as \"calls for climate justice and the decolonization movement gather momentum in the Global South and in academic circles in Europe,\" said Islam, the analyst.  <br/>EU's reputation in the region <br/>The EU's reputation in Southeast Asia has improved in recent years, and Brussels is the preferred \"third party\" that Southeast Asian nations want to engage with amid fractious US-China superpower rivalry in the region, according to the State of Southeast Asia 2023 survey report published last month. Some 43% of the region's respondents preferred the EU as an alternative partner, well ahead of Japan, the UK and India.  <br/>\"As a history graduate, I am acutely aware of the long-lasting impact of colonialism on societies across all continents and it is a shameful part of history,\" Igor Driesmans, the EU ambassador to ASEAN, told DW.  <br/>\"We should not, however, confuse these reprehensible acts undertaken by a limited number of countries in the past with those undertaken by the European Union and its 27 member states in present times,\" he added. <br/>\"Aside from the fact that the majority of our member states have never participated in any colonial venture, I believe that the founding principles and documents of the European Union are the exact opposite of any systematic exploitation.\" <br/>Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/eu-malaysia-relations-at-risk-over-colonial-legacy-claims/a-64973987?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988167872832315925876100201</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67S6-25T1-F03R-N2FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><timeReceived>5:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The two are determined to chain themselves up as soon as an attempt is made to get them out, the spokesperson for L\\xFCtzerath Lebt (L\\xFCtzerath Lives) activist group said, as a huge police operation to clear the site for mining operations goes into its third day.  The discovery of the underground passages, made on Thursday, could hamper police plans to finish the evacuation of the village, which sits next to the vast Garzweiler II open-cast mine, by Friday.  Residents left the hamlet near the town of Erkelenz long ago in order to make way for the mine operations. But activists, in a bid to change L\\xFCtzerath's fate, moved in. They erected tree houses, occupied buildings and built barricades.  L\\xFCtzerath is now the latest flashpoint in a long-running battle between climate protesters - who are demanding a radical rethink of the government's climate change policies - and the German government.  On Thursday, a video of two hooded men posted on YouTube, which has been verified by police, caused a stir. In it, activists under the names \"Pinky\" and \"Brain\" claimed to be in the tunnel under L\\xFCtzerath.   The Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach, whose officers are leading the operation, climbed a little way into the tunnel shaft on Friday and concluded that special forces would need to take over.  \"I just think it's terrible what dangers these people are taking on, for themselves,\" he said, although he added that he did not think the two people were in immediate danger.   \"Officers are currently trying to make contact and talk to the persons concerned,\" he said. They had lost telephone service and were trying to communicate with them via radio.   L\\xFCtzerath Lebt said the two activists underground were staying at a depth of 4 metres and that there was a \"ventilation system\" for them.  Police are also planning to evacuate the last remaining occupied house in the village, which was bought by the energy company RWE to mine the site for lignite, or brown coal.   According to an estimate by a dpa reporter, there were still several dozen activists occupying a fenced-in area, although around 300 had been cleared out by police over the last few days.  The remaining activists were holding out, despite heavy rain, strong winds and temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius early on Friday.  A large rally has been set for Saturday in L\\xFCtzerath's neighbouring town of Keyenberg to show support for the activists. Police expect 6,000 to 7,000 participants.   Famous climate activist Greta Thunberg from Sweden is scheduled to attend. \"Join us from 12:00 to protect lives and prioritise people over profits,\" she wrote on Twitter.  In the face of the movement's continued support, German Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck slammed the actions of the activists.  \"There are many good reasons to demonstrate for more climate protection, even against the Greens,\" the Green party politician told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine.  \"But L\\xFCtzerath is simply the wrong symbol,\" Habeck added, explaining that the demolition of the village in fact didn't symbolize continued activity at the nearby mine but its end.  It had been agreed last year to bring forward a planned coal power phase-out in the nearby mine by eight years, to 2030, which had always been the goal of the climate movement, Habeck added.   It is not clear whether his Green Party supports him on this issue, however. By Friday, more than 2,000 Green Party members had signed an open letter against the eviction, explicitly calling on Habeck and the state's Economy Minister Mona Neubaur to stop the action.   The \"negotiated deal with the energy company RWE threatens to break with the principles of our party,\" it says, adding: \"And not only that, we are also breaking with the Paris Climate Agreement, the traffic light coalition agreement and the last trust of the climate justice movement.\"  The co-federal spokesperson of the Green Youth, Timon Dzienus, warned against alienating the Greens from the climate movement. \"Right now, the Greens would need the support of the climate movement,\" he told the news portal t-online. \"The RWE deal doesn't help at all,\" he said.  Meanwhile, activists of the climate group Extinction Rebellion on Friday also protested in front of the RWE headquarters in the city of Essen, with some chaining themselves to the entry gate.  According to a poll by broadcaster ZDF, a majority of Germans are against the expansion of lignite mining areas. Of those surveyed, 59% were against such an expansion, while 33% were in favour.   Most significantly, a clear majority (87%) of Green voters oppose the project.   On the other hand, 60% of respondents consider the increased use of coal-fired power plants to secure the electricity supply during the energy crisis to be the right thing to do.

Police deployed water cannon, batons and pepper spray on Saturday as they tried to clear protesters demonstrating outside the abandoned hamlet in western Germany's industrial Rhineland for the fourth consecutive day.   Hundreds of demonstrators confronted the police outside the village and some shouted, \"On to L\\xFCtzerath! On to L\\xFCtzerath!\"   They were echoing calls by a speaker during an earlier rally who said activists should press onwards to the flashpoint village.  A police spokesperson said that \"immediate coercion\" had to be used to prevent the demonstrators from advancing to L\\xFCtzerath.  What remains of the village has been fenced off for several days as police seek to evict the remaining protesters there. The last buildings at the former settlement are currently being torn down. The residents have long since left.  In L\\xFCtzerath itself, police called on demonstrators to leave the area, or face the possibility of officers deploying water cannon and using physical force.  There were still several hundred demonstrators hold up inside the fenced off area, according to the dpa reporter at the scene.  At the rally in nearby Keyenberg, thousands protested against energy giant RWE's plans to mine the site for coal, despite pouring rain.   Police put the number at 10,000 participants, while organizers put the number at 35,000. Both Keyenberg and L\\xFCtzerath belong to the larger Rhineland town of Erkelenz, in western Germany.   Some of the demonstrators tried to reach L\\xFCtzerath or access the open-cast mining area and police used force to push them back. Walking to the edge of the open pit was life-threatening because the ground was softened by rainfall, leading to a risk of landslides, officers said.   \"I am absolutely appalled how normal assembly participants allow themselves to sufficiently carried away to the point of entering the absolute danger zone here,\" Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach told dpa.   Police reports said isolated demonstrators also attacked police patrol cars and threw fireworks in the direction of officers. A spokesperson said they could not provide any information about numbers of arrests or injuries yet.   Earlier at the rally, held under the motto \"Prevent eviction! For climate justice,\" a speaker called on demonstrators to disobey police orders.   He said that it was legitimate for participants to try to enter the L\\xFCtzerath, although it is cordoned off. \"Don't let the police stop you. We are powerful. We are on the side of justice. We will not be stopped by this repressive system. We stop this open pit mining. Do whatever you think is right.\"  The rally's keynote speaker was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who criticized the country's Green Party for supporting the demolition of the village for lignite mining.   Deals with fossil fuel corporations such as RWE - which bought the site for mining - \"show where their priorities are,\" Thunberg said of the Greens, who form part of Germany's coalition government, in an interview with dpa.  Leading Green politicians such as Economy Minister Robert Habeck have defended L\\xFCtzerath's demolition, arguing that the coal below is needed to maintain energy security in the current crisis.   \"The coal that is in the ground here will not lower prices immediately. Anyone who thinks like that is simply out of touch with reality,\" Thunberg said.  The Greens are also in power in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where the village has become the latest flashpoint for activists opposed to the government's continued use of coal.  Activists from climate action groups including Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion and Last Generation travelled to the site from across the country.   Police renewed efforts to remove activists from the village itself early in the morning. Officers climbed up trees where activists were holding out, according to a dpa reporter at the scene.   Authorities said they were preparing to remove activists from an underground tunnel. \"The forces are proceeding very cautiously, no heavy equipment can be used here because that would endanger people in the underground ground structures,\" said Weinspach.   The protesters in the tunnel were thought to be doing fine and had enough food to spend several days there, according to Bente Opitz of L\\xFCtzerath Lebt (L\\xFCtzerath Lives). Several dozen activists remain in the hamlet, on roofs and in trees, the activist group said earlier.  The police gave no comment on the number of remaining activists. A spokesperson said they had pretty much cleared the area of activists \"above ground,\" while around 15 \"structures\" remained, including treehouses and other hideouts.  Thunberg said she had previously visited L\\xFCtzerath, which \"looked completely different then.\"  Of the nearby open-cast mine, she said: \"It looks like Mordor, it really does. It shows what humans under the wrong circumstances are capable of,\" referring to the realm of evil in J.R.R. Tolkien's book \"Lord of the Rings.\"  She had also criticized the police for violence, a charge Weinspach vehemently rejected. But she reiterated her criticism, telling dpa, \"police violence means different things in different countries. But there have been several cases where police have endangered the lives of activists.\"   Copyright dpa    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-167371609500073AFU0070</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:679X-PVP1-DXCW-C1VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><timeReceived>6:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>January 14, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DPJG</classCode><className>TEAR GAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X7V</classCode><className>MINES &amp; MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YTE</classCode><className>SURFACE MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N212110CC</classCode><className>COAL MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>PE000DO5O</classCode><className>GRETA THUNBERG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Police deployed water cannon, batons and pepper spray on Saturday as they tried to clear protesters demonstrating outside the abandoned hamlet in western Germany's industrial Rhineland for the fourth consecutive day.   Hundreds of demonstrators confronted the police outside the village and some shouted, \"On to L\\xFCtzerath!

The two are determined to chain themselves up as soon as an attempt is made to get them out, the spokesperson for L\\xFCtzerath Lebt (L\\xFCtzerath Lives) activist group said, as a huge police operation to clear the site for mining operations goes into its third day.  The discovery of the underground passages, made on Thursday, could hamper police plans to finish the evacuation of the village, which sits next to the vast Garzweiler II open-cast mine, by Friday.  Residents left the hamlet near the town of Erkelenz long ago in order to make way for the mine operations. But activists, in a bid to change L\\xFCtzerath's fate, moved in. They erected tree houses, occupied buildings and built barricades.  L\\xFCtzerath is now the latest flashpoint in a long-running battle between climate protesters - who are demanding a radical rethink of the government's climate change policies - and the German government.  On Thursday, a video of two hooded men posted on YouTube, which has been verified by police, caused a stir. In it, activists under the names \"Pinky\" and \"Brain\" claimed to be in the tunnel under L\\xFCtzerath.   The Aachen police chief Dirk Weinspach, whose officers are leading the operation, climbed a little way into the tunnel shaft on Friday and concluded that special forces would need to take over.  \"I just think it's terrible what dangers these people are taking on, for themselves,\" he said, although he added that he did not think the two people were in immediate danger.   \"Officers are currently trying to make contact and talk to the persons concerned,\" he said. They had lost telephone service and were trying to communicate with them via radio.   L\\xFCtzerath Lebt said the two activists underground were staying at a depth of 4 metres and that there was a \"ventilation system\" for them.  Police are also planning to evacuate the last remaining occupied house in the village, which was bought by the energy company RWE to mine the site for lignite, or brown coal.   According to an estimate by a dpa reporter, there were still several dozen activists occupying a fenced-in area, although around 300 had been cleared out by police over the last few days.  The remaining activists were holding out, despite heavy rain, strong winds and temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius early on Friday.  A large rally has been set for Saturday in L\\xFCtzerath's neighbouring town of Keyenberg to show support for the activists. Police expect 6,000 to 7,000 participants.   Famous climate activist Greta Thunberg from Sweden is scheduled to attend. \"Join us from 12:00 to protect lives and prioritise people over profits,\" she wrote on Twitter.  In the face of the movement's continued support, German Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck slammed the actions of the activists.  \"There are many good reasons to demonstrate for more climate protection, even against the Greens,\" the Green party politician told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine.  \"But L\\xFCtzerath is simply the wrong symbol,\" Habeck added, explaining that the demolition of the village in fact didn't symbolize continued activity at the nearby mine but its end.  It had been agreed last year to bring forward a planned coal power phase-out in the nearby mine by eight years, to 2030, which had always been the goal of the climate movement, Habeck added.   It is not clear whether his Green Party supports him on this issue, however. By Friday, more than 2,000 Green Party members had signed an open letter against the eviction, explicitly calling on Habeck and the state's Economy Minister Mona Neubaur to stop the action.   The \"negotiated deal with the energy company RWE threatens to break with the principles of our party,\" it says, adding: \"And not only that, we are also breaking with the Paris Climate Agreement, the traffic light coalition agreement and the last trust of the climate justice movement.\"  The co-federal spokesperson of the Green Youth, Timon Dzienus, warned against alienating the Greens from the climate movement. \"Right now, the Greens would need the support of the climate movement,\" he told the news portal t-online. \"The RWE deal doesn't help at all,\" he said.  Meanwhile, activists of the climate group Extinction Rebellion on Friday also protested in front of the RWE headquarters in the city of Essen, with some chaining themselves to the entry gate.  According to a poll by broadcaster ZDF, a majority of Germans are against the expansion of lignite mining areas. Of those surveyed, 59% were against such an expansion, while 33% were in favour.   Most significantly, a clear majority (87%) of Green voters oppose the project.   On the other hand, 60% of respondents consider the increased use of coal-fired power plants to secure the electricity supply during the energy crisis to be the right thing to do.

It's time they got on with it, and they can use Western money to do so, writes DW's George Okach.Straight from the end of the Sharm el-Sheikh COP27 climate talks, African leaders must rush back to the drawing board. </p><p><br/>Now, more than ever, the continent needs to figure out how millions of people exposed to the devastating effects of climate change can be helped. <br/>The truth of the matter is that financing from richer nations to help mitigate effects of global warming is no longer a dependable source. <br/>Hunger toll set to soar <br/>Drought-driven famine is predicted to hit \"code red\" level in the Horn of Africa. <br/>As a result, millions of vulnerable Africans are bracing for extreme hunger in the coming months, the UN has warned. <br/>This devastating outlook cannot wait for the endless climate change talks. <br/>Africa must accept that it is on its own and take rapid steps to help its population facing cyclic hunger. <br/>Climate of mistrust widened <br/>The climate talks, although crucial, have only resulted in a widening gap of mistrust between the Global South and North. <br/>It comes even as millions of Africans continue to burn out, on a daily basis, under the extreme heat that has been exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction and use, primarily by richer nations, which are the main polluters. <br/>Those who suffer will not patiently wait for an ambitious climate action to be arrived at through rhetoric. <br/>The time to act is now, and African leaders cannot claim to have run out of ideas to save the suffering masses. <br/>In fact, there is a game-changing idea that leaders have been backtracking upon for 20 years now. <br/>Scale up expenditure on agriculture <br/>In 2003, African governments made an ambitious commitment to spend 10% of their annual national budget on the development of the food and agriculture sector. <br/>This monumental undertaking was known as the Maputo declaration. Its intentions were ambitious, achievable and meaningful. <br/>The idea was to alleviate cyclic food insecurity for the continent's most vulnerable people by 2030. <br/>To date, several African countries are struggling to implement this noble idea. Most countries still have their annual allocation to agriculture at a paltry 4%, among them Kenya, Uganda, Senegal. <br/>The horror of climate change reminds the continent that the implementation of Maputo declaration is needed now than never before. <br/>And with the rich polluters' cash stuck in their pockets, Africa should eye agriculture as the socio-economic game changer. <br/>Agriculture, Africa's sleeping giant <br/>The central role of the agricultural sector to the continent cannot be emphasized enough. It's the lifeline of millions in terms of jobs and sustenance. <br/>Currently, even with numerous constraints and stifled resource allocation, the sector is still a promising dependable source of income. <br/>Most leaders have reiterated their government's commitment to revamp the sector but all these have turned out to be mere rhetoric. <br/>Why then the neglect? <br/>Some economists argue that the continent's current fiscal context makes it unrealistic for agriculture to make up 10% of the total budget. <br/>This is because the bulk of most African administrations have a huge debt burden that is eating up their budgets. <br/>Some nations have also prioritized other key sectors, like security, tourism, infrastructure and education. <br/>But in the light of the tough times ahead, which are partly caused by climate change, is it too much to ask that reallocation of expenditure be directed to agriculture? <br/>Higher spending per capita is associated with improved agricultural performance and is therefore a risk worth taking. <br/>If all is done in the right way, the agricultural sector can be a great revenue generator to even fund other sectors. <br/>Further, global warming has made it even more necessary to boost research in that area, which will also have to be financed accordingly. <br/>The continent needs to develop and use tolerant crop varieties, proper pest control arsenals and top-notch technologies. <br/>This transformation drive can be pursued in conjunction with climate justice talks. And the results are bound to be a win-win situation for the whole continent. <br/>Edited by: Nicole Goebel <br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-use-rich-polluters-money-for-african-agriculture/a-63812621?maca=en-cb_en_newstexvolltext_world-6122-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988166892912221175776100187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66X2-GBB1-F03R-N52D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><timeReceived>7:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 20, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

But a lesson could be drawn from the verdict.A French court decision has declared an appeal by several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) against a controversial oil and gas project in East Africa inadmissible. Experts say the decision could set a bad precedent and pose another hurdle on the way to stricter international environmental laws. </p><p><br/>Six French and African civil rights and environmental groups had asked a Paris court to suspend the twin project largely owned by TotalEnergies. <br/>The case was based on the so-called \"law on the duty of vigilance\" from 2017. The legislation requires France-based parent companies to draw up a \"vigilance roadmap\" for subsidiaries abroad in order to document and offset their projects' impact on the environment, local populations, and human rights. <br/>But the court ruled the plaintiffs had not filed the required formal notice, and thus declared the case inadmissible. The urgent applications judge also deemed it was not competent in the case. <br/>\"When a judgment requires a thorough analysis of a dossier's elements, only the trial judge has the power to decide,\" the court's statement, obtained by DW, read. <br/>TotalEnergies is the majority shareholder in the so-called Tilenga and EACOP projects. <br/>The Tilenga oilfied includes 400 wells in Uganda, with dozens located in the national reserve Murchison Falls Parks. The buried 1,443 kilometer-long (897 miles) East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) will cross neighboring Tanzania and link the wells to the Indian Ocean. <br/>Other shareholders comprise the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC), and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC). <br/>Construction works are already underway, with both projects scheduled to become operational in the first half of 2025. <br/>Is TotalEnergies's 'vigilance roadmap' detailed enough? <br/>The plaintiffs had argued that TotalEnergies' vigilance roadmap was not far-reaching enough. <br/>They had estimated more than 100,000 people would be affected by the project, and maintained most of them had not yet been compensated by TotalEnergies. <br/>The rights groups warned that the planned oil and gas exploration would lead to human rights abuses and irreversible environmental damage. <br/>TotalEnergies said it was taking the necessary mitigation measures, and would create tens of thousands of jobs. The company maintained it had compensated 90% of eligible local residents, setting their total number at 18,000. <br/>\"TotalEnergies takes note of today's decision by the Paris judicial tribunal that recalls particularly that the company TotalEnergies has formally established a vigilance roadmap, including the five elements required by the law on the duty of vigilance, and which are sufficiently detailed so as to not be regarded as basic,\" the Paris-based multinational wrote in an email to DW on Tuesday. <br/>Plaintiffs call the court decision 'absurd' <br/>The plaintiffs continue to refute TotalEnergies' arguments. One is Africa Institute for Energy Governance (AFIEGO), a Uganda-based public policy research and advocacy group for clean energy. Others include France's non-profit rights network Friends of the Earth (FoE) and Uganda's non-profit advocacy group Civic Response on Environment and Development (CRED). <br/>Director of AFIEGO Dickens Kamugisha criticized the court's decision.\"That was a very absurd decision for [the court] to say after three years of people waiting for justice. This case is too complex for summary proceedings. I think the court should have been cognizant that many people, the poor communities, are suffering and they [need] justice,\" Kamugisha told DW. <br/>Kamugisha feared the case could set a bad precedent. \"The reason why we went to France was that we had already filed a number of cases in Uganda. Because of our lack of independence of the judiciary, corruption in our judiciary, many of the cases have never moved. We had hoped the developed world, the developed judiciary would handle these cases very well,\" he explained. <br/>The group is at Ugandan courts in five different cases to stop various parts of the oil and gas project. It has also brought the matter in front of the East African Court of Justice, a judicial body of the East African Community (EAC). The EAC is a regional integration organization with 7 partner states: Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. <br/>The trained lawyer Kamugisha is doubtful whether the cases will stand up in Uganda. \"The latest verdict affects these cases very, very much. I believe the courts in Uganda are going to say, if you failed in France, how would you think that here in Uganda you could win anything?\" <br/>Verdict 'could be milestone towards more climate justice' <br/>But Kamalia Mehtiyeva, a law professor at the Paris-Est Crteil University, said the latest court decision was not necessarily sending a bad signal. <br/>\"By the decision which was rendered, you get a negative sort of impression of the way the French justice treats climate activists. But what is important is not to stop at this first impression and to see on what they lost. They lost on a purely technical argument, so they didn't lose,\" she told DW. <br/>\"There is a lesson which has to be drawn from this decision. They [the court] remind the NGOs that they had to put on notice the company,\" Mehtiyeva explained, adding that the court also kept underlining that the 2017 law lacked detail. <br/>\"This decision is just another milestone in the construction of the legal regime of the protection of environment. It's not a failure,\" she stated. <br/>The plaintiffs are considering appealing against the Paris verdict. <br/>Could Germany follow suit? <br/>Kathrin Henneberger, a green member of the Germany's parliament Bundestag, thinks the verdict is first and foremost a call for action. <br/>\"It's a sign that we need to readjust our laws across Europe,\" she told DW. <br/>\"Fossil companies such as TotalEnergies should no longer be allowed to construct such megaprojects,\" said the lawmaker, who travelled to Uganda earlier this year to talk to local residents affected by TotalEnergies' plans. <br/>Henneberger thinks Germany should also strengthen its legislation. <br/>\"We were last year discussing a law on how to keep coal plants online, or power up more of them given the decreasing gas supply. One hotly debated aspect was what impact that would have on regions where we mine that coal,\" she said. <br/>\"Germany does not take into account the situation of local inhabitants, for example in north Colombia, where our coal comes from - we need stricter rules.\" Henneberger added. <br/>Her group has added a paragraph to existing legislation requiring the government to report on the impact of coal mining on local populations. <br/>Edited by: Maren Sass <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988167766633714425876100083</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">109988</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67NK-J391-F03R-N4YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1166\"/><timeReceived>10:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 1, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001PA7</classCode><className>PDC ENERGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0008CJZ</classCode><className>CHINA NATIONAL OFFSHORE OIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0003Y5N</classCode><className>NATIONAL OIL CO OF ZIMBABWE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS213111 DRILLING OIL &amp;

Early on, she declared that she was keen on a feminist development policy (see interview on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). Now she has begun to flesh out what that means.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Berlin in September, Schulze emphasised equality. She pointed out that, wherever women bear equal responsibility, development results consistently turn out better than where women are denied equal rights. This applies to incomes as well as to indicators for health and education, for example.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Women all over the world, according to Schulze, want equality. The self-confident protests of Iranian women in recent weeks are proof of that applying to the Middle East and North Africa, a world region where women are often still denied their rights.</p><p>Schulze sees equality as a human-rights issue. Accordingly, a free and equal society must end all kinds of discrimination, not only gender discrimination. Her approach is intersectional. As a Social Democrat, she says, she fights all kinds of inequality, and minorities must not be marginalised.</p><p>Women and girls, however, make up more than half of humankind, so they are not a minority. Nonetheless, they are often marginalised. In Schulze's eyes, awareness raising and targeted action are needed. Not only state agencies must rise to the challenge, but civil society and faith-based organisations are relevant too.</p><p>Schulze has directed her ministry to pay even more attention to gender issues than it has done in the past. By 2025, the share of projects that serve gender justice in developing countries in some way is set to rise from about 60 % today to 85 %, and 93 % of all new projects will promote the cause.</p><p>Long history</p><p>The minister acknowledges that feminism has a long history. While much has been achieved, a lot remains to be done. She insists that feminism needs to be advanced with determination at all levels and that she is not willing to wait. From peacebuilding to climate justice, women's input in policymaking leads to better and more sustainable results, she argues.</p><p>Sexual and reproductive rights are crucial, in Schulze's eyes, because self-\u00addetermination begins with one's own body. Families' welfare depends on female empowerment. The minister wants women to be seen as agents of change and not merely as victims. Where girls are denied school opportunities, economies perform worse (see Sundus Saleemi on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Schulze's agenda is not anti-men. She states clearly that men matter, not least because they are the rule-makers in many countries. The challenge she sees is to reach out to them and convince them. As young people are the future, the policymaker adds, it is important to give them a say. In her view, listening to one another is important, and euro-centrism is not an option.</p><p>Whole of government</p><p>Schulze intends to promote this comprehensive agenda in international cooperation and alliances. The Federal Government as a whole endorses this approach. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has similarly made a commitment to feminist policy-making. As Schulze reports, even Chancellor Olaf Scholz has declared himself to be a feminist.</p><p>In Berlin, Spogmay Ahmed of the Washington-based International Center for Research on Women welcomed Germany's approach to feminist development cooperation. She emphasised that supported groups must be co-owners and co-leaders, not mere recipients.</p><p>Alvaro Bermejo of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) endorses Schulze's call for action. Progress is not achieved in a long-lasting marathon, according to him, but in fast sprints. The experience of his home country, Spain, shows that change may seem impossible for a long time and then happens suddenly. Given that right-wing authoritarians are eager to move backwards on reproductive rights in many places, he says now is the time to 'go, go, go'.</p><p>According to Sima Bahous of UN Women, humanity is currently not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030 as spelled out in the UN's 5th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). SDG5, however, is indispensable for achieving the entire agenda. In this context, she is grateful to Germany for being her agency's top regular donor.</p><p>Hans Dembowski is editor in chief of D+C Development and Cooperation / E+Z Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1210202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66KP-N2N1-F00C-649J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 12, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The summit has turned this idyllic corner of Bavaria into a high-security zone that has impacted local businesses and schools, as Sabine Kinkartz found out.Chocolate is everywhere you look. Different varieties are stacked on large plates in a display case. There's cranberry white next to peanut-salt-whole-milk, and dark chocolate refined with cardamom, clove and pepper. Chocolatier Franz Ksser makes the delicacies and sells them in his store in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. But customers have been staying away for weeks. \"We're losing out big time,\" Ksser says angrily. </p><p><br/>Garmisch-Partenkirchen is a spa town in UpperBavaria that lives primarily from tourism. Skiers come in the winter, hikers in the summer. \"The tourist beds are occupied, but for the past three weeks they've been police officers, security guards and people doing the set-up for the G7 summit,\" Ksser says, explaining his problem. \"Of course, they don't shop with us or eat with us, because they're catered for differently.\" <br/>And it's not just him, he adds: \"I went out to eat last night, there were three people sitting in the restaurant, where normally everything is booming at this time of year.\" <br/>Even the schools are closed <br/>At least 18,000 police officers have been deployed to Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Elmau, the small village located above the resort town in a valley that is difficult to access, to provide security for the G7 summit. Police cars are lined up everywhere, and helicopters are repeatedly rattling through the air. <br/>The heads of state and government are hermetically sealed off at Schloss Elmau, a remote luxury spa retreat, while in Garmisch the media center has been set up for the 3,000 or so journalists who have arrived. Hundreds of manhole covers have been sealed with white stickers, no trash cans are allowed on the streets, schools are closed, with students forced to take their classes online. <br/>Police checkpoints have been set up on all access roads within a radius of 16 kilometers (10 miles). Motorists must stop, personal details are checked. The plan is to spot and filter out troublemakers and potentially violent protesters before they reach Garmisch. <br/>Lentil stew with the chancellor <br/>\"Many activists don't come because of the checks, they don't want to be searched and are also afraid of repression,\" says Tatjana S\u00f6ding, who together with Christopher Olk has pitched her tent in a protest camp on a meadow on the edge of Garmisch. S\u00f6ding has just completed her master's degree in human ecology, Olk is doing a doctorate in international political economy. Both belong to the \"Stop G7Elmau\" alliance, which plans to stage several protest rallies throughout the summit. <br/>\"Seven heads of state are pursuing their own interests and their decisions affect the world's population, which is not allowed to have a say,\" Olk criticizes. \"They talk about climate justice, but their very own specific, political and economic interests are in the foreground, which don't allow for real climate justice at all.\" <br/>It was pouring with rain when S\u00f6ding and Olk arrived Friday evening. \"It was a little uncomfortable.\" Now, barefoot and in summer clothes, the two stand in the sun on the lawn and watch as more and more tents are erected at the protest camp. Authorities have approved 750 protesters. <br/>What would the two say if they had the opportunity to speak with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in person? \"I would invite him to eat a lentil stew with us and then we would talk about how we can make Germany part of a just world,\" Olk says, laughing incredulously. But talking to the chancellor is not on the cards. <br/>Instead, it has been suggested to the activists that 50 of them be driven up to Elmau, where they could demonstrate out of sight of the heads of state and government, under guard. But they find that unacceptable. \"Freedom of movement and assembly will be severely restricted,\" S\u00f6ding criticizes. <br/>Will the protest remain peaceful? <br/>The plan is for the demonstrators to march through the town at the bottom of Garmisch, but they also want to try to advance through the mountain forest to Elmau in a so-called \"star march,\" in which several groups converge on an agreed point from different directions. The police know this and have already announced that the activists will not get far. \"There is a lot of police in Garmisch, and there is a reason for that,\" said the police chief of Upper Bavaria South, Manfred Hauser as he presented the security concept to the media. <br/>Business people in Garmisch hope the protests will remain peaceful. \"Many residents have gone away for a few days,\" says chocolatier Ksser. \"But we had already planned all the vacations here in the store when we learned six months ago that a G7 summit was to be held in Elmau for the second time.\" The last time, in 2015, he added, they had been informed a year and a half in advance and could have planned differently: \"I can't send people on vacation now.\" <br/>G7 still up to date? <br/>Ksser is certain there will be no third G7 summit here. \"Never again G7,\" he says with fervor in his voice. \"The people here in town wouldn't go along with that, and it's supported by some in the local council.\" The chocolatier criticizes that the whole effort is not even in keeping with the times. \"We're supposed to heat less and shower less, and here they're banging out the energy with hundreds of police cars driving around and helicopters doing practice flights for weeks.\" <br/>Ksser doesn't deny that meetings of heads of state and government are necessary. \"But please not in this format,\" he said. \"There are hundreds of people in each entourage. Why don't they meet with their closest circle of advisors, and all the other people can meet on the internet these days, can't they?\" <br/>There are also places where such meetings could be better held, he said. \"In (US Air Force Base) Ramstein, a NATO summit was organized at very short notice with important people, and the US president was able to land directly on the site with his Airforce One.

GM aims to avoid 1 million metric tons of carbon emissions that would have been produced between 2025 and 2030.  Earlier this year, GM announced its Science Based Targets, as well as plans to become carbon neutral in its global products and operations by 2040 aligned with the aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.   The company has committed to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles and plans to introduce more than 30 electric vehicle models globally by 2025.  In addition, GM Thursday said that it is collaborating with PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization, and TimberRock, a technology-enabled energy company, to track the real-time carbon emissions at GM's facilities associated with electricity use.  GM also announced that it has signed on to participate in Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, an initiative that brings together public and private sector partners to help advance the commercialization of technology that GM believes supports its equitable climate actions goals.   The commitment to Catalyst rounds out the other sustainability initiatives GM has established through the company's $25 million Climate Equity Fund, which supports grassroots and community organizations that are working on the front lines of climate justice.      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-163301342600619AFU0619</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63RD-2S31-J9XT-N25P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"263\"/><timeReceived>4:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 30, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

About 88 per cent of the 412 people who cast votes in the online gathering gave their backing to the platform, which will now guide the party into September's federal elections. The paper is titled \"Time to Act: For social security, peace and climate justice!\"  The party, whose name literally means \"The Left,\" is looking at the polls with worries that it might only take between 6 and 7 per cent of the vote. Party leaders used the weekend session to argue that this shows how important it is to show unity going into the elections.  \"As of now, we are in an election campaign,\" said Janine Wissler, one of the party's lead candidates. Dietmar Bartsch, who leads the ticket with her, called for \"discipline and determination.\"  \"Our idea of a world with solidarity and social justice is and remains right up to date,\" he said.
