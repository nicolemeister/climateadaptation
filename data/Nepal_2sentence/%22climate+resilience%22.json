This high-level event brought together over 600 participants from 11 countries, including more than 40 distinguished speakers representing the climate, finance, and technology sectors. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The forum served as a key platform for aligning Mongolia's climate-related policies with global goals, attracting investment, strengthening multi-sector partnerships, and promoting innovative solutions to environmental challenges. The gathering also focuses on advancing United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 by fostering international cooperation on urgent issues such as land degradation, desertification, deforestation, and biodiversity loss.</p><p>President U.Khurelsukh, in his opening remarks, emphasized that tackling the global climate crisis requires regional collaboration, shared responsibility, and unified action. He reiterated Mongolia's commitment to working openly and effectively with international partners, development organizations, and donor institutions. 'Let us work together, with shared purpose and vision, to protect Mother Earth and secure a greener future for generations to come,' the President urged.</p><p>One of the central themes of the forum was Mongolia's 'Billion Trees' national movement, launched in response to pressing environmental issues. Over the past three years, the initiative has led to the planting and nurturing of 84 million trees, the cultivation of 86 million saplings, and the protection of 1.9 billion trees from harmful pests. The campaign is a core part of Mongolia's broader climate resilience strategy, which aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 through sectoral reforms in energy, transport, agriculture, mining, and urban development.</p><p>Former United Nations Secretary-General and founder of the Ban Ki-moon Foundation for a Better Future, Ban Ki-moon also joined the event and addressed the forum. He praised Mongolia for spearheading the 'Billion Trees' initiative, calling it a concrete contribution to meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement. 'The implementation of climate action and sustainable development has reached a new stage,' he said. 'Now is the time for united, unwavering commitment that includes innovation, research, and inclusive partnerships.'</p><p>In addition to national efforts, Mongolia has taken climate leadership to the international stage. It has introduced two UN General Assembly resolutions, designating 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives and 2026 as the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists. Furthermore, as part of the upcoming UN Convention to Combat Desertification COP17 in Ulaanbaatar in 2026, Mongolia proposed the umbrella initiative 'Global Alliance on Sustainable Rangelands and Land for the Future'. This alliance seeks to channel investment into over 100 countries that practice traditional pastoralism, aiming to protect the livelihoods and ecosystems of nearly 500 million people worldwide.</p><p>As the 'Sustainability Dialogue 2025' concludes, the message became clear: global environmental resilience demands unified vision, bold action, and long-term collaboration.</p><p>The forum was co-organized by the Office of the President of Mongolia, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ban Ki-moon Foundation, Stanford University's Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, and the Mongolian Sustainable Finance Association. It also receives support from international bodies such as the United Nations and the Asian Development Bank, alongside civil society groups and private sector contributors like Oyu Tolgoi LLC.</p><p>Growing global leadership in climate action commended </p><p>During his visit to Ulaanbaatar for the occasion of 'Sustainability Dialogue 2025 - Climate Action: Billion Trees' International Forum, President of U.Khurelsukh welcomed Ban Ki-moon in a separate meeting. </p><p>At this high-level meeting, President U.Khurelsukh praised Ban Ki-moon's distinguished legacy in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), protecting the environment, and leading global climate efforts during his tenure at the United Nations. The president expressed particular appreciation for Ban's continued engagement through initiatives like the current forum. </p><p>Ban Ki-moon, who holds Mongolia's highest honor, the Order of Chinggis Khaan, thanked President U.Khurelsukh for organizing the forum and for his visionary leadership on climate and sustainability. He expressed confidence that Mongolia's example would inspire other nations to strengthen their own commitments to environmental protection and SDG implementation.</p><p>In a gesture of strong support, Ban Ki-moon announced a donation of 180 million MNT to Mongolia's 'Billion Trees' national movement, an reforestation effort initiated by President U.Khurelsukh to combat desertification, restore ecosystems, and build climate resilience. Ban also proposed expanding the initiative into a regional movement, signaling deeper future collaboration between Mongolia and his foundation.</p><p>As part of the forum's activities, President U.Khurelsukh and Ban Ki-moon joined members of civil society and youth organizations in planting trees at the Peacekeepers' Grove in the National Garden Park. The grove honors the contributions of more than 20,000 Mongolian peacekeepers who have served in United Nations missions worldwide. Ban Ki-moon, who met many Mongolian peacekeepers during his time at the UN, commended the initiative, calling it a meaningful tribute to their service.</p><p>Participants in the tree planting included members of the Northeast Asian Climate Change Youth Council, the United Nations Association of Mongolia, the Forest Department, the National Environmental Youth Advisory Council, and staff from the National Garden Park.

Once the primary provider of capital across much of the world, Beijing now finds itself at the receiving end of record repayments, particularly from some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2025 according to the report, developing countries are expected to repay around $35bn to China, with $22bn of this total coming from 75 of the poorest nations - many in East and Central Asia. This marks the highest debt servicing total to China on record, as legacy loans under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are\u00a0due.  </p><p>According to recent data cited by\u00a0LI, Chinese disbursements have dwindled significantly of late, while repayment obligations have soared, in the process transforming Beijing from capital provider to a singular net financial drain on developing country budgets as loan disbursements are now being outstripped by repayments.  </p><p>Despite the general pullback in lending, though, China continues to finance a number of select and highly strategic partners. These include neighbours such as Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia in addition to further off resource-rich countries including Argentina, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa and Indonesia; all key allies in terms of mineral supply seen as essential for battery production.  </p><p>Financial burden</p><p>For many developing nations, these rising debt repayments to China are exerting considerable strain on public finances. The costs, analysts warn, are crowding out essential investments in health, education and climate resilience.  </p><p>But as China's influence as a creditor surged rapidly over the last two decades - in 2005, it held less than 5% of the external debt in low-income countries compared to over 40% by 2015 - it has hit a lending peak in excess of $50bn in 2016, lending has in recent year steadily declined, with just $18bn in new loans agreed in 2019 and a continued fall during the pandemic years.  </p><p>By 2023, China held a dominant position: 26% of external bilateral debt in developing countries and more than half of such debt in the poorest and most vulnerable economies.  </p><p>The report states that in 54 of 120 countries with available data, debt repayments to China now exceed those owed to the entire Paris Club of Western creditors.  </p><p>Net lender no more</p><p>As a result, the contraction in new Chinese lending has reshaped its role in the global financial stratosphere. Loan commitments have stabilised at around $7bn annually since 2023, back down to levels last seen in the late 2000s. Meanwhile, repayments continue to surge.  </p><p>While Western lenders provided countercyclical support during the pandemic, China's lending patterns have been \"sharply procyclical\" - receding precisely when many countries needed assistance most.  </p><p>The terms of many Chinese loans, which is typically a three to five year period of grace followed by 15 to 20 year maturities, has seen repayments begin to mount since the early 2020s.  </p><p>China's participation in the G20's Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) during 2020-21 though did provide temporary relief at the time COVID was spreading, in the process postponing $4.2bn in repayments.  </p><p>However, this effect was short-lived and these payments are now coming in.  </p><p>Select lending continues</p><p>Not all Chinese lending has ground to a halt though. Strategic and diplomatic considerations still drive new loans, especially in areas linked to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) or in regions Taiwan is active as China works to buy its way into the good books of diplomatic allies of Taipei in exchange for infrastructure investments. This has been demonstrated most clearly in loans to Honduras, Nicaragua, the Solomon Islands, Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic since 2018 when an independence minded government came to power in Taipei.  </p><p>At present, China also remains the largest bilateral lender to seven of its nine land neighbours for which data is available. These include Laos and Myanmar in Southeast Asia and Kyrgyzstan to the west.  </p><p>Mineral-rich countries have also continued to attract funds. In 2023 alone, they accounted for 36% of China's total disbursements over $8bn.  </p><p>End result</p><p>The financial burden on many is becoming increasingly unsustainable, however, as more than half of the world's poorest countries are now classified by the International Monetary Fund as either in debt distress or at high risk of it.  </p><p>At the same time, Western powers are retreating from the global aid stage as an increasingly inward-looking United States and preoccupied Europe put the blinkers on.  </p><p>To this end, while some analysts in Asia in particular have characterised earlier Chinese lending as a form of \"debt-trap diplomacy\", evidence remains limited even with clearly defined debt crises in several countries, including Sri Lanka, Laos, DR Congo and Zambia.  </p><p>In addition, China's hesitance to embrace debt forgiveness reflects a broader institutional culture according to\u00a0LI. Those perhaps more aware of Chinese culture on lending to any degree will have attributed this lack of sympathy for debtors as culturally ingrained rather than part of a bigger scheme.  </p><p>As such, with repayment volumes now eclipsing new lending, China has effectively become the world's largest bilateral debt collector.

Therefore, it is designed to support businesses to unlock investments, thereby fostering innovation, generating jobs, and contributing to sustainable development.</p><p>To prove this commitment, ADB has helped 47.5 million micro and small sized enterprises across the region and financed 1.1 billion USD in total to the private sector with focus on climate financing, reports the bank's Private Sector Operations in 2022 report. The bank's private sector investment ranges from agribusiness to health and education to infrastructure.</p><p>With regards to its commitment, the bank has discussed private sector matters with international delegates. Sustainability in financing private sector as well as role of Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) in capital markets was touched upon as the first of the series of discussions and main driving force behind the seminar was the keep supporting the rise of ESG themed capital markets which used as a key mechanism for directing climate finance to sustainable projects and member countries shared their own experiences.</p><p>Next on the line was a seminar focusing on private sector participation and financing climate finance projects, especially in developing member countries.

The event exchanged great deals of opinions on issues around civil society organizations' participation, AI, climate crisis survivors and finding ways to help one another. Accordingly, the bank and its donors have agreed to a replenishment of 5 billion USD for ADB's Asian Development Fund and Technical Assistance Special Fund to support the most vulnerable groups of the region, especially climate change survivors. ADB's annual meeting in Georgia's capital city brought together finance ministers, central bank governors, senior government officials, and representatives from the private sector, academia, media, and civil society from ADB's 68 members and from Mongolia, officials from Finance Ministry, Khan Bank delegation and The UB Post's Editor participated in the meeting. Georgia's hosting of ADB's annual meeting coincided with the country's month-long demonstrations against the government's \"Foreign Agents\" bill, which is considered by the demonstrators authoritarian and inspired by similar legislation in Russia that has been used to clamp down on dissent there. The peaceful, yet active demonstration throughout the country in the evening and ADB's busy annual meeting encounters in the daytime was definitely something interesting for the meeting participants to see.</p><p>ADBHELPSMONGOLIA ENABLE CLIMATE-CONSCIOUS BUSINESS</p><p>In Mongolia, ADB has been present for more than the last 30 years and it aims to help support climate-conscious development, and improve infrastructure to help diversify the economy. The bank supports the country in every sector that needs perfection and the private sector has been the strong focus recently. Mongolia's private sector generates nearly 80 percent of GDP, says the ADB's 2017 Country Partnership Strategy. However, the sector is largely constituted by MSMEs who cannot take affordable credit. Removing obstacles to private sector development is obviously very central to the government's drive to diversify the economy. The bank has been working closely with the government to achieve its aforementioned goal. Since it has started financing the private sector, ADB has committed 182.1 million USD in loans for seven significant projects.</p><p>These projects included commercial banks and allowing them to extend long-term finance to larger businesses, MSMEs with their desperately needed affordable finance, trade financing, food and agriculture, consumer goods and automotive sectors, cashmere and textile and renewable energy businesses.</p><p>ADBMongolia</p><p>ADB's assistance is targeted at underserved segments, with at least 30 percent earmarked for women-led businesses and 40 percent for businesses outside Ulaanbaatar. This assistance involves stronger pushback against COVID-19 pandemic disruption.</p><p>The companies that received support during and after the pandemic were Ulaanbaatar Flour Limited Liability Company, Mongolia's leading wheat miller, Tavan Bogd Foods and Milko LLC and many more. The bank also has supported the cashmere industry with creation of the Mongolian Noble Fibre certification mark.</p><p>ADB loans to these companies ensure that they can maintain production and inventory, preserving thousands of jobs and supporting the country's basic supplies and overall food security.</p><p>As a climate bank, it knows that the private sector is one of the main spheres to achieve a climate-conscious world and therefore, ADB has been paying strong attention to the private sector.

Our team developed a patented technology to filter out harmful air pollutants using bio-fibers such as sheep wool.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People always ask, why sheep wool? People have mixed feelings about it. Some people think it smells, some people think it makes sense because they've seen felt collect soot. The short answer is wool is pretty good at filtering gas. A slightly longer answer is that wool is known to adeptly filter volatile organic compounds, which are common pollutants in indoor air. You</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">can think of paint, building/furniture varnishes, room deodorizers, and if you live closer to the road, car exhaust and other combustion pollutants. We tweaked its properties such that it filters fine particulate matter, without sacrificing its ability to let air in and out easily. We piloted using air purifier devices and because we saw that it works, we're now working to scale and become a filter material manufacturer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We all know air pollution is a dire issue in Mongolia, especially in Ulaanbaatar. What caused you to become interested in this, and what prompted you to become an entrepreneur?</p><p>We have the coldest capital city in the world, so people burn coal to stay warm. It's most akin to London air pollution because most other air pollution problems around the world are related primarily to cars, power plants, or cooking stoves. 2015 studies show that ger district is responsible for 80 percent of the air pollution. I spent some childhood years in the ger district myself, and I'm young enough to not know a winter when there was no air pollution.</p><p>Immediately after I graduated from high school, I was snowboarding from atop a hill, and I 'discovered' air pollution. I thought the coal mine next to the city had exploded, and my dad told me it was the city that we lived in 24/7. I couldn't believe my eyes. I started learning more about it and at the time, the Clean Air Fund that was publicly run had a corruption case. I was frustrated and thought that a lot of 'somebodies' had to do a lot of 'somethings' about it. So, I enrolled into an environmental science major and started learning about it. When I first started out in 2016, I thought people would act more and protect themselves from air pollution if only they knew how bad air pollution was. So together with the admins of Mongolia Live Facebook page, we created a nonprofit called Breathe Mongolia. The nonprofit aimed to increase public awareness about air pollution, teach people how to protect themselves from it, and ways they could contribute, and act as a policy watch dog for decisions being made by the government.</p><p>The reason I wanted to do it was because at that time, the narrative was that the government wasn't doing anything, and the public was the victim. It is, in some sense, true, but I didn't like this narrative because it removed agency from individuals. It makes the problem so big that people feel like any individual action is just a drop in the bucket. So, we demonstrated, in New York, in California, and in Ulaanbaatar, and tried to educate people with a one-stop shop for air pollution knowledge. But I realized that although people wanted to do something about it, they didn't have the financial means to.</p><p>Shortly after I graduated from the university, I started working for the Mongolian Sustainable Finance Association where we piloted Mongolia's first sector-wide energy efficiency mortgages in the ger district. It was originally an initiative that started in 2013 where financial institutions were conducting environmental and social risk management systems, to ensure businesses complied. Later, when I joined, we had become an organization and the paradigm had started moving beyond compliance into green additionality. There, I was privileged to work with extremely competent and caring people who were attempting to establish a green impact fund of 50 million USD to finance energy-efficiency, in industries and in the ger district to build new homes or retrofit existing ones. This meant that we worked on designing green loans and worked with the government to provide incentives for people to choose green products. I had been trying to tackle the source of the problem and work efficiently, working on lack of accessibility to finance and infrastructure problems.</p><p>But at the same time, people were getting sick, especially pregnant women and young children. Miscarriages are 3.5 times more likely to happen during polluted seasons (UNICEFMongolia, 2018) and I think almost everybody knows somebody close to</p><p>them who has had miscarriage/lung cancer/pneumonia during the polluted season. We bought air purifiers, but we couldn't find replacement filters. They didn't sell them. If they did sell them, they would cost 200 USD per filter for some models, which is insane. Breathing clean air shouldn't be this expensive. So, in 2021, when my co-founder approached me with a project idea to develop algae oxygen generators I said yes, and we participated in the competition called Greenpreneurs by GGGI. By the end of the year, when the competition ended our team decided to continue it and make it into a business and we have been studying about sheep wool, so that's how we started.</p><p>Currently, more and more people are choosing to live abroad instead of staying and helping the development of Mongolia. How do you feel about them? What do you see is stopping them from staying? Why are you still here?</p><p>It's impossible to blame them. Some people say they're being selfish, but you can't call somebody selfish for deciding to prioritize their personal health.</p><p>You know who's objectively selfish? It's the people who were proven of embezzlement but go unpunished. It's so disrespectful when they make poor decisions and abuse our hard-earned tax money. When I used to work for the Mongolian Sustainable</p><p>Finance Association, to establish the green revolving fund, we asked for 18 million USD from the government, and they haven't finalized it. Yet, they decided to 'experiment with improved coal' for 50 million USD, or the bus scandal. I'm trying to work to improve the lives of others, not pay for a politician's son's Ferrari. But in reality, that's what I'm doing. And if I don't make this decision to stay and 'work for my country', I'm selfish? This narrative needs to change.</p><p>One thing that prevents me from leaving is the fact that I haven't contributed much to education yet. My biggest fear is this. People are products of their time, and we can understand why the generation in power right now acts this way. But I want to</p><p>believe that products from our time, these kids, are well educated and that the future we're shaping, is filled with people who have agency and not tethered to welfare, and for that to happen, we need to invest more in our youth and adult education systems.</p><p>What are people's comments on your products?</p><p>We've sold 300 air purifiers with wool filters over the last year and people are especially noting how well it filters odors. When people cook, or when they have car exhaust from opening windows, that's what wool filters are great at filtering. Almost 80 percent of our purifiers have been sold to pregnant women and families with children under three years of age. It's when children's lungs are still developing, so we provided a 20 percent discount to this demographic that needs purifiers the most. The fact that we won't run out of filters and can provide cheap replacement filters is something our customers also love.</p><p>What is the legal environment to develop products such as Airee? Does the government show any sort of support to entrepreneurs such as yourself?</p><p>In the last two years, the legal environment has improved significantly, so Airee is lucky in some ways. The government has clarified the regulation on how to define and be registered legally as a 'startup', the legal status of coworking spaces, introduced VAT and customs tax levies and exemptions for equipment and raw materials of 'innovation projects', and has been organizing startup competitions with grant funding. We're able to benefit from a discounted office space thanks to Innovation Hub, the municipality backed coworking space. All of these are so new and I'm so happy the government set up this legal framework to promote entrepreneurship. Mongolia is not a value creating economy and the system almost discourages it. I hope these initial support mechanisms encourage other businesses and we can shape a future system that rewards value creation.</p><p>I know that these efforts have been ongoing since I was in university. So, I'm really thankful for the people in this ecosystem who have worked to develop it, as well as the creators and the startup owners who come before us and set a good precedent. I'm really inspired by their determination. It's equally important for people to get the opportunity and open doors but keep them open for the next person and future generations.</p><p>What have been the biggest challenges you faced to develop your products and extend the market further?</p><p>We faced many internal and external challenges. When we first ordered our air purifier device, two weeks later the Chinese border closed. So, we had our money locked for one whole year and couldn't pilot as we wanted to. That's the first biggest challenge. Second, investment is always a big challenge, because Mongolia has a very small market and the number of investors who are experienced, and investing are relatively few. Investors who are well equipped or who have experience with physical products, such as manufacturing, are very hard to find. These are all issues that startups generally face but it's a bit harder because, firstly it's hard to find investors, and secondly, it's hard to scale into a very small market. That is a big market challenge.</p><p>You also won the Youth Ecopreneur awards from the International Trade Center, and 5,000 USD. What do you plan to do with it?</p><p>We were able to win the Youth Ecopreneur awards during the World Expert Development Forum held in Ulaanbaatar city in June. It hasn't only been 5000 USD; they gave us a pro bono legal service from a multinational law firm called Sidley Austin. We are enrolled into the Google startups for sustainable development program, and we have the right to talk to people</p><p>from the World Intellectual Property Office. In addition, the International Trade Center has been promoting us in the media extensively. So, the fact that I was at the UN and speaking at two events was all thanks to the International Trade Center. We were lucky to have won it and I'm glad it was organized in Mongolia. Also the YE! Community is very supportive and very loving, which is great.</p><p>You also recently attended the Clinton Global Initiative and UNSDG Summit. Can you tell more about it?</p><p>Last year, we participated in a six-month incubation program called Unleash. It's a community of SDG and impact driven companies. When we enrolled there, we got accepted into stage three and we went to an in-person competition in Mysuru, India. We were exposed to a lot of mentors and experts in the fields of fundraising, global supply chains, product development, storytelling, and other things. One of the mentors we got acquainted with referred us to the Clinton Global Initiative to participate in their Greenhouse event. The greenhouse event convened 30 businesses in three tracks. The three tracks were climate resilience, inclusive economic development, and health equity. Out of 200 who were referred by the Clinton Foundation community to apply to this event, 30 were chosen, including us. So, these people were competing for 25,000 USD and an exposure to the Clinton Foundation network. It just goes to show how much all these international startup competitions and events help you and it was an amazing event to be at and participate in. This year's theme was Keep Going.</p><p>I did two events at the UN. First, I was there for SDG Action Weekend which happens before the SDG Summit. At the Action Weekend, I was on a panel that was focused on closing the financing gap for women and missionaries. Second, I was at the Good Trade Summit, where I was privileged enough to sit next to the US Department of State chief global partnerships officer and have him interview us and ask him questions as well. During the Action Weekend, I was interviewed, and they ended up posting my interview on the beginning launch day of the SDG Summit, where a lot of like country leaders were. So, it's almost like it was orchestrated by the International Trade Center.</p><p>Lastly, what are your future plans?</p><p>We are now in the process of setting up a factory to manufacture 100-percent biodegradable air filters. We're producing that filter material for filter manufacturers who will then take it into different shapes and fitted for various applications. We want to export and explore beyond the wool only as a raw material. As for me, I will continue to spread more climate education and try to contribute to education more in general.</p>", "publisher": "The UB Post", "instances": ["One of the mentors we got acquainted with referred us to the Clinton Global Initiative to participate in their Greenhouse event.

Tell us your thoughts on the event?</p><p>Today, the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of ADB is taking place on the island of Fiji. I'm participating as the governor representing Mongolia. The main aspect of the meeting concerns ways to attract investment for the private sector and ways to contribute to the development of countries. These are the focus of the main sessions. In the session that happened today I understood that the financial resources are available among countries. There are many ways we can raise funding to support the development of Mongolia and these opportunities are fully open.</p><p>In some sectors, it is possible to attract investment for the private sectors just by making policy and legal environment adjustments. In the tourism sector, for example, there is the liberalization of the aviation sector. If we improve the legal environment in this sector and create competition, the private sector can enter the industry. There are many ways to attract massive investments this way, as demonstrated by the examples of other countries.</p><p>In the Ipotek market, we have the eight percent interest mortgage in the Mongolian market. For instance, when the private sector wants to invest, they say the rate is not a market rate. Making it market-based, and finding the correct method and mechanism to lower interest rates, there is an opportunity bring in substantial investment from the private sector.</p><p>Therefore, if we can adopt good policies and establish a mechanism that is in congruency with the international standard, there is the full opportunity to speed up development in many sectors of Mongolia. The main sessions will be held tomorrow (May 4).</p><p>Fiji is a beautiful country that managed to develop its tourism sector extremely well. What can Mongolia learn from Fiji with regard to investment in the tourism sector?</p><p>Obviously, this is done by the private sector. For instance, in the aviation sector, there are direct flights to San Francisco and the USA. A country with 900,000 or so people is making direct flights to large cities in the USA. Direct flights to big cities of Asia are also available. This means that when tourists who will spend money in this country come, they are given the opportunity to come at a low cost. I view this as a very important thing.</p><p>There is also the fact that big international hotel chains are already here. Practically all of the big names are here and operating. Therefore, in my view, first we must achieve liberalization in a fast and efficient manner in Mongolia. There are those who say we must protect the interests and rights of national companies such as MIAT Mongolian Airlines, but expanding the tourism sector is more beneficial to these national companies. All sides need to realize and acknowledge this fact, and make correct political decisions will less hurdles.</p><p>'A' for ADB</p><p>The '2018 Development Effectiveness Review' (DEfR), the 12th in the series of annual performance reports prepared by ADB, was launched in Nadi, Fiji, at the 52nd ADB annual meeting. The report, based on ADB's corporate results framework, assesses the bank's performance and progress in implementing its strategy across various results indicators.</p><p>'The 2018 DEfR highlights ADB's efforts, and successes, in delivering on its mission of helping the Asia and Pacific region become more prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable,' said the Director General of ADB's Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department Tomoyuki Kimura. 'ADB will continue enhancing its operations to help more people in the Asia and Pacific region.'</p><p>ADB operations in 2018 continued to grow, with commitments including loans and grants, reaching 21.6 billion USD, up 10 percent from the 19.7 billion USD committed in 2017. Direct value-added co-financing signed last year hit a record high of 14 billion USD, up from 11.8 billion USD in 2017, while disbursements also reached its highest ever at 14.2 billion USD in 2018, which is 2.7 billion USD more than the previous year.</p><p>'ADB's new lending and grant operations in 2018 grew to a record 21.6 billion USD, an increase of nearly 10 percent from 19.7 billion USD in the previous year. Compared to 13.9 billion USD in 2013 when I became ADB President, this is an increase of 55 percent. Such an expansion became possible thanks to the much larger equity from the successful merger of the ordinary capital resources balance sheet and Asian Development Fund (ADF) concessional lending operations in 2017,' said ADB President Nakao. 'Going forward, I am of the view that ADB should intensify its focus on quality and innovation in our operations, while maintaining moderate volume growth.'</p><p>ADB's response to climate change and support for gender equality accelerated, according to the report. The share of ADB operations supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation during the 2016-2018 review period reached 56 percent, surpassing the 2020 target of 45 percent. Meanwhile, the share of committed sovereign operations supporting gender mainstreaming increased to 52 percent, exceeding the 2020 target of 50 percent of overall ADB operations. Achievement of gender equality results also remained above target, with 76 percent of completed operations successfully delivering their intended results in this priority area.</p><p>Financing for private sector operations also reached new heights, with commitments increasing by 37 percent to 3.1 billion USD in 2018 from 2.3 billion USD in 2017. Private sector operations' share of the total signed ADB financing, meanwhile, rose to 19.3 percent in 2018 from 13.3 percent in 2017, putting it on track to reach the 2020 target of 20 percent.</p><p>Education and health financing are also on track to meet their 2020 targets. Education commitments reached a record 7.5 percent share of total commitments in 2018 -achieving for the first time, the six percent to 10 percent 2020 target range - with volume of commitments more than doubling to 1.6 billion USD, comprised of 13 loans and grants. Financing for health rose to 2.4 percent of total operations, the highest figure since 2010 and on track to meet the three percent to five percent 2020 target range. Health financing also more than doubled to 515 million USD in 2018, with 13 loans and grants committed. ADB's social protection support, however, declined to 4.9 percent in 2016-2018 from 5.1 percent of the bank's total operations in 2015-2017, remaining short of the six percent target.</p><p>In 2018, ADB operations in the Asia and Pacific region have helped 1.2 million students receive training and education under improved quality assurance systems; built and upgraded 8,400 kilometers of roads; reduced 2.4 million tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions; provided new or improved water supplies for 413,000 households; improved people's and businesses' access to finance through 2.4 million microfinance loan accounts opened; and enhanced regional and international trade with 6.7 million tons of annual cross-border cargo volume facilitated.</p><p>South Korea's Incheon will host the 53rd ADB annual meeting in 2020 under the theme 'Asia 2020: Innovation, Inclusiveness and Integrity.
