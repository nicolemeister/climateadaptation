They also have implications for food security issues in Asean.</p><p> Health and nature-based solutions are two other sectors which philanthropies can support, as they show potential for commercial viability. The education sector, however, remains challenging. </p><p> Besides philanthropic capital, another source of funding that remains relatively untapped in South-east Asia is public finance, said Thakkar. </p><p> Government funds have traditionally been used in the form of grants via welfare schemes. </p><p> But Thakkar said there are opportunities for public finance to be deployed through local development finance institutions. </p><p> While multilateral development banks and international development finance institutions are traditionally the entities helping to arrange blended finance transactions, they usually provide financing solutions only in hard currencies, rather than local currencies.</p><p> This could increase the costs of capital, making it harder for projects to take off. </p><p> Home-grown solutionsLocal development finance institutions, however, are able to provide more home-grown solutions in local currencies, by working with the local government and other stakeholders in a way that aligns with their own policy priorities and national climate targets.</p><p> \"The governments can set the direction for the country itself, and then look at what solutions, products or sectors should be catalysed through the local development finance institutions,\" said Thakkar. </p><p> Local mobilisation is even more important now, with foreign aid being cut on several fronts. The United States has dismantled its foreign aid agency USAid, while the United Kingdom and several European governments have also reduced their funding for Official Development Assistance. </p><p> Donor agencies from these developed markets have been one of the most frequent investors in blended finance. </p><p> Several South-east Asian countries -- including Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines -- already have their own local development finance institutions. </p><p> \"What role could they play, which can then catalyse more of these home-grown solutions, local currency solutions, to work in that direction? So I think, to me, the answer is really a whole aspect of local mobilisation,\" said Thakkar. </p><p> He added that Convergence is currently working with the United Nations Development Programme to develop a framework for blended finance for emerging Asian markets so that there can be more local capital mobilisation suited to their country's context. </p><p> Given that South-east Asia has a healthy gross domestic product per capita, decent savings rate, strong financial sector with ample liquidity, as well as relatively developed capital markets, Thakkar said that the region already has the right mix of ingredients to pull local pools of capital into areas where it is not currently flowing. </p><p> \"I think a bit of a regulatory intervention, a bit of thinking through this very strategically -- both from the concessional as well as the commercial actors -- and... looking at some form of platforms that standardise ways to do blended deals would be a good recipe,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Agriculture is one sector which could be the gateway for philanthropies to play a bigger role towards decarbonisation of the economy.

But these just serve to prevent waves from eroding the shores. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Research is under way to develop the most effective solutions against rising sea levels for the different parts of Singapore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> National water agency PUB said Singapore's coastal protection challenges require innovative solutions that go beyond conventional approaches.</p><p> \"As a small island nation with limited land, we need to develop solutions that are not only cost-effective but also multifunctional to maximise land use,\" said PUB.</p><p> In 2023, the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore was set up to bring together expertise from various universities, research institutes and industry players to advance knowledge and create innovative solutions for coastal protection and flood management.</p><p> There are now 17 research projects under the institute, which are funded by PUB's $125 million Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme. </p><p> The Straits Times looks at the different solutions Singapore is considering to protect its coastlines. </p><p> Using nature as an ally Engineered solutions such as seawalls can offer predictability and control, but natural ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs can also contribute to protection from sea-level rise. </p><p> Mangroves, for example, can serve as a living defence, as their roots trap sediment from the tides, allowing them to keep pace with rising seas. </p><p> They also act as a carbon sink, as their water-logged soils allow these habitats to soak up more planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than land-based forests.</p><p> At CFISingapore, some projects are dedicated to the research of solutions that combine nature and hard structures -- so-called hybrid solutions.</p><p> For example, a three-year project by NUS Faculty of Science Associate Professor Peter Todd looks into identifying optimal combinations of \"green\" solutions such as mangroves and corals and \"grey\" solutions like seawalls and breakwaters, and the feasibility of their integration for Singapore. </p><p> \"A concrete sea wall provides little in the way of ecosystem services and does not contribute very much to the natural marine environment,\" said Prof Todd. </p><p>NUS marine biologist Huang Danwei said natural ecosystems such as mangroves and seagrass can help to dissipate wave energy and lower the impact of storm surges and coastal erosion, especially with the increase in frequency of extreme weather events.</p><p> Nature-based solutions are also more cost-effective and adaptive than hard engineering solutions, said Professor Huang. </p><p> This is because they are naturally regenerating and provide a slew of other ecosystem services, generally without the need for much man-made interference or enhancements, he added. </p><p> Ecosystem services include their ability to improve water quality and support populations of marine life, among others. </p><p> \"These solutions are more cost-effective than hard coastal protection in the long run. It is very costly to try to out-engineer nature all the time,\" Prof Huang said. </p><p> The National Environment Agency told ST it is looking into the possible use of mangroves as a nature-based solution to protect Semakau Landfill against coastal erosion and sea-level rise.</p><p> Predicting extreme weather Developing the most optimal coastal protection solutions requires an understanding of how bad flooding could get. </p><p> Seven of CFI's projects are dedicated to coastal science and predicting extreme events. </p><p> In one of the projects, Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) researchers are building a model that can predict storm surges within five days, so that residents and businesses can take emergency measures. </p><p> These measures could include staying indoors, moving vehicles to higher ground and installing barriers to prevent losses caused by coastal flooding. </p><p> Storm surges are higher-than-usual tides caused by offshore storms. Areas in Singapore that are most at risk from storm surges are likely to be the East Coast and Jurong Island, said Associate Professor Tay Zhi Yung from SIT's engineering cluster. </p><p> Current-wave and storm-surge models near Singapore's coasts are based on physics and mathematical equations.</p><p>SIT's model integrates machine learning with existing weather data, such as wind forecasts, to improve the accuracy of storm-surge predictions.</p><p> \"A data-driven model can provide much faster predictions when compared with physics-based models,\" said the project's lead, Associate Professor Victor Wang of SIT's engineering cluster. </p><p> The four-year project is currently 1 1/2  years in, and the team is looking to incorporate other elements like sustained wind speed and rainfall to improve the model. </p><p> The other related projects are looking at predicting intense rain and other extreme coastal events more accurately. </p><p> \"The eventual goal is to develop reliable early warning and operation response for coastal-related flooding occurrences,\" said Prof Wang. </p><p> Separately, since 2021, PUB has been building a $13.4 million model that can simulate and evaluate inland and coastal floods in tandem, based on the latest climate projections. </p><p> When high tide happens to coincide with an intense deluge, coastal flooding worsens. This coastal-inland flood model is currently being validated and undergoing pilot testing, said Ms Hazel Khoo, director of the coastal protection department at national water agency PUB. </p><p> Flexible, multi-use optionsSingapore is also looking at flexible structures that can help it tackle sea-level rise across a range of different scenarios. </p><p> This could include, for example, flexible seawalls with adjustable heights or modular units that can be added to seawalls.</p><p> Existing structures used for coastal protection typically do not allow provisions for subsequent add-ons or modifications to adapt to rising sea levels. </p><p> But innovative engineering solutions can be deployed to better utilise land. They can also be adapted to future requirements and have multiple uses beyond protecting against sea-level rise. </p><p> Flood risk expert Matthijs Bos -- who works at global engineering consultancy Haskoning -- said Singapore could take reference from a sea-facing boulevard in The Hague, Netherlands, which doubles as a recreational spot on good weather days. </p><p> The popular Scheveningen Boulevard sits on top of a hidden sea wall -- replacing a former sand dune ridge -- and in front of it lies a widened beach that was topped up with sand. </p><p> The nourished beach acts as a buffer to weaken waves, and the sea wall prevents the boulevard from flooding during storm events. </p><p> Mr Bos envisions the future Long Island having a similar concept. </p><p> \"For the outer edge facing the sea of Long Island, they will make sure it's not only a coastal protection but maybe a nice recreational area to go to. It could be a new waterfront,\" he said. </p><p> Researchers are also studying whether a flexible seawall with adjustable heights can support a concrete structure that allows for multi-function uses, such as a road or a park.</p><p> The flexible seawall can also be used to separate water bodies to form a coastal reservoir that can be used as a water catchment area to reduce inland flooding and for freshwater storage. </p><p>Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Professor Chu Jian, the project's principal investigator, said the flexible seawall will also be more cost-effective as less material is needed to build it.</p><p> \"If you integrate it for other uses, the overall cost will be much cheaper as it also provides infrastructure,\" he said. </p><p> The three-year project, which started in November 2023, mainly focuses on the design and modelling of the wall. </p><p> Existing coastal protection structures can also be retrofitted with innovative solutions such as adding modular, watertight units on top of seawalls. </p><p> PUB is working with Delta Marine Consultants to explore the use of modular blocks known as XblocPlus -- a single layer concrete armour unit placed in a regular pattern along the shoreline -- on Singapore's coastlines. </p><p> It is a flexible and scalable design that minimises land take, as well as has the potential to be integrated with urban developments or natural habitats. The firm is looking forward to potentially test-bed and pilot these blocks here.</p><p> While the aim is to protect every corner of our coastline from flood waters, there might be a situation where some parts of the island -- more remote and with lower footfall -- may be left to flood once in a while, suggested Mr Bos and Mr James Lam, Surbana Jurong's executive director for coastal engineering. </p><p> These floodable areas could be coastal parks, nature spots and beach areas. </p><p> Mr Lam said: \"Certain places could tolerate flooding for a few hours before it subsides. If it's a parkland, you just have to close it for a few hours... It doesn't mean that you have to stop every centimetre of flooding. You cannot protect everything.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Researchers are studying whether a flexible seawall with adjustable heights can support a concrete structure that allows for multi-function uses, such as a road or a park.

Public feedback on the guide is welcomed until July 20.</p><p> One carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that is either removed from the atmosphere, such as through carbon capture, or prevented from being released. There are two main types of carbon credits -- nature-based ones like reforestation, and technological ones that include switching from pollutive firewood to cleaner cooking stoves.</p><p> In the draft, the authorities also emphasised that the credits that companies buy will not be counted into the country's climate targets. This is because companies will be buying credits from the voluntary carbon market (VCM).</p><p> Carbon credits can be bought and traded in the voluntary market or the compliance market -- which is regulated by the authorities.</p><p> For example, carbon-tax-paying firms are subject to compliance because they are allowed to use eligible credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions each year. These credits will be counted under Singapore's emission reductions, and they can be bought only from carbon projects hosted by countries that Singapore has bilateral agreements with.</p><p> The seven countries include Paraguay, Bhutan and Ghana. </p><p> In contrast, credits from the voluntary market are not legally required or regulated to be used to offset carbon emissions, and this has led to criticisms about the effectiveness and quality of such credits.</p><p> In 2023, The Guardian reported that more than 90 per cent of rainforest credits did not represent genuine carbon reductions.</p><p> The Singapore Government is therefore putting out this guidance document to help raise the standards of the VCM. </p><p> The authorities have received feedback from the industry on the need for the Government to provide guidance on the voluntary market and how companies can use carbon credits as part of a credible decarbonisation plan.</p><p> \"The growth of carbon markets has been constrained by a few factors. One of the main challenges in the VCM is the lack of standardisation which has led to confusion around various industry-led standards. This has undermined market confidence, and companies concerned about reputational risks are holding back from the VCM,\" said the three government bodies in a joint statement.</p><p> To address these, the eight-page draft guide defines what a high-quality carbon credit should be, emphasising that there should be no double counting of credits or fraud, where one credit is claimed by more than one firm.</p><p> Firms should buy credits that have been registered with a reputable registry that keeps count of the trading, and claim each credit only once.</p><p> The authorities also encouraged companies to transparently disclose their use of credits and make known the amount and type of credits they bought, why they chose to use credits, the project location and which registry they used.</p><p> Mr Rueban Manokara, global lead of the carbon finance and markets task force at conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature, said of the draft: \"By offering clarity on what that high integrity means, including highlighting that credits are not a substitute for real emissions cuts... it may give companies more confidence to include carbon credits as part of their climate action.\"</p><p> He noted that the guide could go further in recognising how high-integrity credits can help firms raise their climate ambition, invest in nature-based solutions and deliver greater impact. </p><p> Associate Professor Daniel Lee, director of the Carbon Markets Academy of Singapore at Nanyang Technological University, said the document underscores the Government's support for the role of the voluntary carbon market in helping firms decarbonise.</p><p> \"Such clarity is important because there are many conflicting opinions out there on the role of carbon credits, including views that suggest carbon credits are simply greenwashing,\" he added. </p><p> The draft guidance can be found on NCCS' website.

While Pulau Tekong is located north-east of the mainland, the others lie south in the Singapore Strait. </p><p> A quick getaway for leisure seekers, many of the islands in the southern waters are also biodiversity havens, home to most of the country's remaining intact coral reefs. </p><p> Pulau Senang and Pulau Pawai serve as military live-firing areas. </p><p> \"The offshore islands are rich in biodiversity and may have very different terrain profiles compared to mainland Singapore,\" added PUB, noting that solutions have to be tailored to accommodate their unique characteristics.  </p><p> Experts said the elevation of the islands is similar to Singapore's, and parts of their coastal areas and reclaimed portions are generally low-lying. </p><p>Singapore's average sea level is projected to rise by up to 1.15m by 2100, according to its third national climate change study released in 2024. This could further jump by 4m or 5m when sinking land, storm surges and daily tidal activity are taken into account. </p><p> Mr Matthijs Bos, who assesses flood risk for global engineering consultancy Haskoning, noted that the offshore islands will mostly be exposed to extreme storm surges that can cause coastal flooding when seawater flows over land. Impacts can be worsened if intense rain happens at the same time, affecting assets on the islands and land use. </p><p> Sea-level rise can drown shallow habitats like coral reefs, mangrove forests and seagrass meadows, said marine biologist Huang Danwei, deputy head of the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. </p><p> \"Mangroves, seagrasses and their associated flora and fauna may not be able to tolerate the increasing depths as seawater submerges the intertidal zones deeper and for longer durations,\" he added. </p><p> Storm surges can scour the seabed and suspend more sediments, which will affect deeper corals. </p><p> The rustic offshore islands will need a mix of hard engineering solutions while harnessing nature's existing defences. For example, a seawall could be set up behind a beach or mangrove patch, said Mr Bos.</p><p> Associate Professor Huang said: \"Nature-based solutions that allow coastal habitats to shift and migrate landward work best. As the sea covers more of the coastal areas, urbanised areas that are lined with seawalls or infrastructure can impede the ability of existing wetlands to migrate landward.\" </p><p> Pulau Tekong already has coastal protection in the works: A polder -- including a low-lying tract of land -- is being created north of the island. This reclaimed land will have higher barriers called dikes around it, to protect parts of the island from rising seas. </p><p> The study of Singapore's coastline is at an advanced stage. It has been divided into eight sections for a deeper look into the most suitable coastal protection solutions for each stretch.</p><p> Four of these site-specific studies are ongoing -- the City-East Coast stretch, Jurong Island, and two sections in the north-west of the country. </p><p> The 2026 study will serve as a foundation for future site-specific studies on the eight islands, said PUB. </p><p>Singapore has 63 offshore islands and islets. </p><p> Pulau Semakau in the southern waters -- home to the nation's only landfill -- will be separately assessed by the National Environment Agency (NEA), said PUB. </p><p> In April, the NEA launched a tender for a consultant to conduct a study on bund improvement and development options for Semakau Landfill to sustain operations, documents on government procurement portal GeBiz showed. </p><p> A 7km perimeter rock bund encloses part of the sea off Pulau Semakau to create space for the landfill and prevent ash from spilling to the sea. </p><p> The heritage-rich Pulau Ubin and its neighbouring Pulau Ketam will not be part of the islands study. Instead, they will be included in the upcoming site-specific study of the north-east coast, which will include Punggol and Pasir Ris. </p><p> Ms Hazel Khoo, director of PUB's coastal protection department, said: \"Rising sea levels will pose risks to Singapore's offshore islands.

They are deeply intertwined. They're actually not three different markets-they're really one challenge we face in the shifting ecology of the planet.</p><p>That challenge of global warming, water scarcity (and) the fact that the global water cycle is out of kilter, and the progressive loss of biodiversity, are reinforcing each other. And they now form a vicious cycle. If we don't manage water well-if we let soil health deteriorate, lose moisture in the soil, and degrade the wetlands-we also reduce carbon sequestration, which accelerates global warming. And global warming then dries the soil, leads to further problems with the forests, and you get that vicious cycle. So, we are dealing with something that the science is very clear on, but it must be reflected in our governance approaches, our policies, and our financing strategies. Including one of the important areas of potential, which is in developing the market for credits. Just like we've got carbon credits, we need to develop the market for water credits and biodiversity credits. I'll come back to that in a moment.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are an extremely important part of climate change mitigation. You can argue about exactly what percentage of mitigation should come down to nature-based solutions, but we know that there's much good that arises from nature-based solutions. It's not just about reducing carbon emissions or capturing more carbon, but also about the co-benefits of nature-based solutions: reducing heat, reducing the spread of diseases, and a whole set of other benefits.</p><p>But think of nature-based solutions not just in terms of carbon. Think of nature-based solutions as a way of managing water, reducing carbon emissions, and preserving biodiversity. Because when you put them together, the ripple effects give them a much larger impact.</p><p>To give you an example. We need to transform the agri-food industry. Regenerative agriculture, which is already well underway in many parts of the world, will help preserve soil health, preserve carbon in the soil, and improve yields with appropriate incentives and technologies. They help farmers and consumers. And you have to remember that the agri-food industry is also the biggest source of deforestation and the loss of biodiversity.</p><p>Think of rice, which is a major issue in Asia especially, but also in some other parts of the world. We have to move, fundamentally, from the predominant system of rice cultivation-the flooding of padi fields, which leads to high methane emissions, farmers pumping water from underground using energy, and a significant amount of water being wasted.</p><p>With more sustainable rice production-using techniques like direct seeding of rice, and alternate wetting and drying, you can save 50 percent of methane emissions, 30 percent of water, and some 60 percent of energy. And improve yields at the same time. So, it's an example of how you can address several problems at the same time.</p><p>This brings me to financing, because nature-based solutions are significantly underfunded. It's rested largely on governments. The private sector is still at the nascent stage of getting into nature-based investments as a way of addressing climate change.</p><p>The carbon credits market already has an ecosystem. There are integrity issues and greenwashing issues, but improvements are being made. The ICVCM, the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets, and the SBTI, the Science-Based Targets Initiative, and others -there's a lot of good work taking place to improve integrity and trust in the markets. And I believe this is going to be a significant source of financing for nature-based solutions.</p><p>Now, we can't-I think it will be very difficult-to create a whole ecosystem for sustainable water credits, and biodiversity credits, side by side with carbon credits. It can be done in theory, but it's going to exhaust the private sector, and it's going to exhaust negotiators.</p><p>Much better that we work on a reliable carbon credit system. And have water and biodiversity credits stapled on. They are still in their infancy. There are biodiversity credits that are currently being stapled on, but it's being done qualitatively because we don't yet have precise, quantitative ways of assessing biodiversity benefits in a way that can be compared across different projects, regions, and geographies.</p><p>In other words, there's no common currency. But even the qualitative approach has led to a premium on carbon credits that have biodiversity stapled onto it. We can do the same with water.</p><p>And remember: water will not just enhance the value of the carbon credits. The benefits of sustainable water practices can be reaped earlier and in a way that local communities see as benefiting themselves. It's not just for the markets-people see the benefits.</p><p>I think the WEF should work with other coalitions to develop some rigor in this process. How do we develop the biodiversity and water credit markets? And ideally, from a practical point of view, how do we then staple them onto carbon credits in a new, high-integrity, nature-based carbon credits market?</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: The Istana, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065642710</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYT-3H33-S35G-3262-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 23, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS59</classCode><className>SOIL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0TN</classCode><className>WATER CRISES &amp;

Ocean decade actions are science-based programmes, projects or activities endorsed by the UN to improve ocean health.</p><p> \"Small island developing states have been the subjects of ocean research for too long, the observation points in data sets, the case studies in reports, and the vulnerable communities in impact assessments,\" Dr Balakrishnan said on the first day of the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France. </p><p> \"Small island states are rarely the lead researchers, rarely the owners of our own ocean data. We believe that it is time to change that narrative,\" he added. </p><p> A large part of the summit, which ends on June 13, focuses on boosting support for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and marine resources. Representatives from 193 countries are expected to attend.</p><p> Dr Balakrishnan, who is leading a Singapore delegation, was speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) on the need for scientific cooperation for ocean health. Aosis groups 39 small-island and low-lying coastal developing states including Singapore, Palau, the Maldives and Belize. </p><p> Ocean-related scientific research tends to be dominated by Western scientific institutions and groups, which have access to large  research vessels and instruments that can withstand the inhospitable conditions of the deep sea. Tropical marine habitats like coral reefs are also well studied by scientists from other parts of the world. </p><p> However, the High Seas Treaty adopted in 2023 made it clear that such research would benefit from being more collaborative, calling on countries to provide \"opportunities for scientists of all states, in particular scientists from developing states, to be involved in or associated with the project\". </p><p> The treaty is a historic agreement that lays the groundwork for international collaboration to protect oceanic areas outside national jurisdictions.</p><p> Dr Balakrishnan said: \"Ocean science is not an academic luxury. Instead, it is an existential necessity for all of us small island states. The well-being of our communities, cultures, ecosystems, food security and livelihoods are dependent on a healthy and thriving ocean.\"</p><p> The ocean is also a treasure trove of information yet unknown, with unique organisms offering scientists the chance to obtain valuable scientific data that can improve life on land. A glow-in-the-dark jelly--fish, for instance, inspired the development of a fluorescent dye that enabled doctors to track the movement of cancer cells. </p><p> Dr Balakrishnan said Aosis member states are calling for more capacity-building initiatives based on their needs, and the need to include traditional and indigenous knowledge into global frameworks from the outset. </p><p> Aosis is calling for a \"fundamental rebalancing of ocean science leadership\", he said. \"We need dedicated funding mechanisms and institutional support to ensure small island developing states' research institutions can lead initiatives that address our specific challenges.\"</p><p>Singapore has a thriving marine research community, with a national facility -- the St John's Island National Marine Laboratory -- and a research institute focusing on marine science, the Tropical Marine Science Institute at NUS.</p><p> Researchers from these institutions, the National Parks Board (NParks) and NTU's Asian School of the Environment and Earth Observatory of Singapore are active in initiating and conducting  studies of the marine environment. </p><p> These include research on marine creatures such as reef fish and giant clams, as well as in coral reefs, seagrass meadows and other marine ecosystems. Underwater robotics and studies on oceanographic parameters like waves are also done in Singapore. </p><p> The focus on the need for a strong scientific basis in ocean policy was further underpinned by an event held ahead of the UN Ocean Conference that served as the scientific foundation of the summit. </p><p> The One Ocean Science Congress, held in Nice from June 3 to 6, was attended by Dr Karenne Tun, group director of the National Biodiversity Centre at NParks.</p><p> She told The Straits Times that the congress offered NParks, Singapore's lead agency for marine conservation, the opportunity to both learn and contribute to the global scientific community. </p><p> \"As a small island city-state, Singapore is surrounded by coastal and marine areas that are vital not only to our own environment, but also integral to the broader South-east Asian region,\" she said.  </p><p>Singapore's waters are home to some 250 hard coral species and about 700 marine fish species. Studies have also shown that hawksbill turtles migrate between Singapore and Malaysia. </p><p> Dr Tun said: \"Our investment in multi- and transdisciplinary research -- for example, in  taxonomy (the science of classification), environmental monitoring, habitat restoration, nature-based solutions and climate change impact science -- can contribute to finding solutions beyond our shores.\" </p><p> She added: \"Through multilateral platforms such as the One Ocean Science Congress, Singapore can leverage scientific research outcomes generated by the global research community to complement local research efforts to guide the conservation and management of our blue spaces, while sharing our knowledge with others.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>NUS marine biologist Huang Danwei checking on an autonomous reef monitoring structure off Pulau Semakau.

This was a stark contrast from the previous year, when only 30 per cent were from foreign sources. </p><p> Out of the six South-east Asian markets studied in the report -- which was also authored by Google, Standard Chartered, as well as Temasek-backed decarbonisation investment platform GenZero -- it found that Malaysia and Singapore took the lion's share of the US$8 billion. </p><p> Green investment into Malaysia increased by 124 per cent to US$2.3 billion, making up about 29 per cent of the total sum of investments. Green fund flows into Singapore accounted for 33 per cent, as they jumped 194 per cent from the previous year to US$2.7 billion. </p><p> The other four markets -- the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam -- saw a reduction in green investments. </p><p>Indonesia suffered the worst decline, dropping 22 per cent to US$1.2 billion. This was followed by Vietnam, which had a 19 per cent reduction to US$161 million. </p><p> Green investments into the Philippines went down by 12 per cent to US$1.3 billion, while Thailand experienced a drop of 10 per cent to US$355 million. </p><p> When analysing the allocation of green investments across different project types, about two-thirds went into clean power projects, particularly solar which saw capital flows doubling from the previous year and accounted for 21 per cent of the total green investments in 2024. </p><p> Investments into industrial waste management, which made up 9 per cent of the total fund flows, also increased, primarily driven by water treatment and recycling projects. </p><p> In contrast, electric vehicles (EVs) and agricultural productivity experienced a decline in investments. </p><p> Despite the jump in green investments, the report noted that there is still a funding gap of about US$50 billion for these six Asean markets to meet their stated climate pledges by 2030. </p><p> To make good on these promises by 2030, South-east Asia has to reduce its emissions by another 600 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). </p><p> Solutions to accelerate the green transitionTo accelerate the clean energy transition, the report advocates for a systems-based approach that involves identifying systemic barriers, finding high-impact solutions and prioritising those with the highest ability to drive lasting change.  </p><p> This is because the region's green economy is a set of linked systems, where changes in one area can affect others. </p><p> The report identified three systems-level solutions that are important for South-east Asia to decarbonise: a sustainable bio-economy, an EV ecosystem, as well as growing its renewable energy along with developing the Asean Power Grid. </p><p> A sustainable bio-economy would involve leveraging South-east Asia's natural capital for economic benefit and carbon reduction through sustainable agriculture, expanding nature-based solutions, and scaling bio-waste utilisation. </p><p> EV adoption could be accelerated by implementing buyer incentives, developing the necessary infrastructure as well as its regional supply chains. </p><p> Investing in grid infrastructure can help eliminate a critical bottleneck in scaling up renewable power generation, with long-term positive impacts on regional energy security and affordability. </p><p> The report estimates that such an approach could help these Asean economies grow by US$120 billion by 2030, potentially bring about 900,000 green economy jobs, and close the emissions gap of 600 million tCO2e by half to 300 million tCO2e. </p><p> It also noted that these three systems-based solutions may also attract up to US$55 billion in annual investments by 2030, which could potentially serve to shore up foreign direct investments during an economic slowdown. </p><p> Climate and transition finance, carbon markets, as well as green artificial intelligence (AI) have also been identified in the report as key enabling solutions.</p><p> Growing the sum of sustainable and transition financing requires expanding access to capital through innovative financing models, regional financing frameworks and enhanced risk-sharing mechanisms. </p><p> To grow the region's carbon markets, the report said there was a need to establish domestic and regionally connected carbon markets, put in place stronger carbon policies to drive demand, as well as increase the supply of large-scale verifiable credit projects. </p><p> As for green AI, it involves advancing AI-driven sustainability solutions while ensuring viable data-centre growth. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-MMI6N9J</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRM-2W53-RT5P-Y06X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"780\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

demand</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About 49ha of land will be reclaimed in the waters off Lorong Halus in Pasir Ris by industrial developer JTC Corporation to meet future needs, including for industrial use, The Straits Times has learnt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The creation of the plot -- roughly the size of 11 Padang fields -- is expected to affect visitors to the Pasir Ris and Lorong Halus jetties, with a small impact on nearby seagrass and mangrove patches, according to an environmental impact assessment (EIA) that ST viewed in March. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The jetties -- one of which serves fish farms in Pasir Ris and the East Johor Strait -- will be replaced by two new ones for marine access and operations, JTC said on May 16 in response to ST's queries.</p><p> It said no date has been set for the reclamation, as it is reviewing the findings and recommendations of the assessment, as well as feedback from the public about the report.</p><p> \"The reclamation works will only proceed after both the EIA report and development plans are finalised -- there is no fixed timeline yet.</p><p> \"This is to ensure all environmental considerations and planning requirements are comprehensively addressed before the commencement of works,\" it added.</p><p> The new land has been designated for industrial and special purposes in the Urban Redevelopment Authority Master Plan, which guides Singapore's development over the next 10 to 15 years. </p><p> When completed, one of the new jetties will be located along the western boundary of the site, with an access route running alongside the present shoreline connecting Pasir Ris Coast Industrial Park 6 and the new jetty. </p><p> The other jetty to replace the jetty in Pasir Ris will be built south-east of the site. </p><p> JTC said the reclamation is forecast to have a small impact on the natural connections between nearby seagrass and mangrove patches, which enable these habitats to thrive. </p><p> This is expected to be beneficial for some of these affected ecosystems, with the formation of new connections for seagrass to migrate, and stronger currents caused by the development are expected to help increase the spread of mangroves in northern and southern Pulau Ubin, it added.</p><p> The assessment had concluded that the proposed works will not result in any loss of conservation-significant flora species along the Lorong Halus and Pasir Ris coastlines. </p><p> The beach at Pasir Ris Park is unlikely to be affected by changes to the long-term deposition of sediments and erosion resulting from the reclamation.</p><p> JTC plans to develop and implement measures that minimise impact on wildlife and the surrounding environment. </p><p> For instance, during the construction period, noise pollution will be minimised through hoarding and noise mufflers, dust emissions will be controlled through canvas covers and water, while animals found at the site will be relocated.</p><p> JTC said: \"To enhance the biodiversity in the area, nature-based solutions will be assessed for suitable locations within the reclamation site.</p><p> \"Solutions being studied include creating a gentler shoreline slope or increasing its roughness and number of crevices to encourage intertidal and marine biodiversity growth.\"</p><p> One concern for nature advocates is the potential impact of the reclamation project in the East Johor Strait on the elusive dugong. </p><p> The site coincides with a hot spot for sightings of the marine mammal that faces a high risk of extinction in the wild.</p><p> In 2022, researchers found that despite high shipping traffic and land reclamation works over the decades in the East Johor Strait, 42 of 60 dugong observations in Singapore occurred around Changi Beach, Pulau Tekong and Pulau Ubin.</p><p> JTC said that while the herbivore was not seen in the area where surveys for the assessment were conducted, it will take steps to prevent harm to the animal. </p><p> These include requiring vessels to observe speed limits within 100m of wildlife sightings and maintain a safe distance until the animals naturally move away from the work zone.</p><p> Marine biologist Toh Tai Chong said it is unsurprising that dugongs were not spotted when the assessment was conducted, as there are very few of these gentle grazers left here. </p><p> The developer can include other methods in its assessment, like looking out for feeding trails and collecting genetic material as part of its monitoring plan to establish the impact that the reclamation will have on the population, added the senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore.</p><p> Dr Toh also called for more clarity about developmental works in the area in the next five to 15 years. </p><p> \"If there are future plans to continue reclaiming the area, then the potential positive impacts on seagrass or mangroves may be negated,\" he said.</p><p> Currently, the Singapore Food Agency also has plans to develop the East Johor Strait by expanding aquaculture operations there.</p><p> Due to the proximity of the JTC reclamation and the planned development, the impacts of both projects were assessed together. </p><p> JTC said reclamation works and other land-based works have been optimised to minimise land clearance where possible.</p><p> The statutory board noted that reclamation had last occurred near the site some 30 years ago, with the existing Lorong Halus coastline originally reclaimed in the 1980s, followed by reclamation of the southern coastline of Coney Island in the 1990s.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Why are investors hesitant, and what needs to be done to get climate-aware investing into the mainstream'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Helge Muenkel: We have witnessed continuous improvement and strong efforts to transition our global economies to a net-zero future. According to the International Energy Agency, last year's global investments in clean energy were around double the amount going into fossil fuels. Ten years ago, fossil fuel investments were about 20 per cent larger than clean energy investments. Meanwhile, India is projected to achieve a major milestone in 2025, with renewable electricity providing for more than half of the country's power capacity, while China added more renewable power capacity in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notwithstanding this, current investment flows are still insufficient to allow us to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, complexities in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape have understandably made investors more cautious in recent times. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Importantly, sustainable investing is not a short-term but a structural trend. Climate risk is increasingly recognised as a major driver of financial risk. Hence, most major investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their overall decision process.</p><p> Encouragingly, Asian regulators are stepping up. Across the region, many policies and regulations have been put in place that create an enabling environment, which supports climate action and related financing flows. This includes green and transition taxonomies and ESG disclosure standards.</p><p>  These developments bolster investor confidence and embed greater transparency in sustainable investing -- important steps in shifting these financing flows into the mainstream.</p><p> More work needs to be done. For instance, there is some ambiguity around what qualifies as transition and transition finance. The vast majority of assets and economic activities globally and in Asia are not yet green, and DBS believes it is critical to also allocate capital to support their transition to becoming greener. Beyond financing those assets and activities, transition finance can also help companies transform their entire businesses, all of which will contribute to the greening of the entire economy. </p><p> We see progress across the region on several fronts. Localised taxonomies are evolving to reflect regional contexts and developmental needs. Markets like Singapore are evolving disclosure rules and incentives for credible transition finance. </p><p> At DBS, we have observed growing sophistication in how capital is being deployed. For instance, we saw strong investor appetite for two green bonds DBS brought to the market recently. The first was the issuance of Equinix's S$500 million green bond in March 2025, its first Singapore dollar issuance. </p><p> The second was Asia's first public sustainability-linked securities offering by ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in January 2024. Both bonds were meaningfully oversubscribed, signalling growing investor demand for credible climate instruments.</p><p> Victor Wong: Investors' hesitation around sustainable or climate-aware investing, despite growing interest, often stems from structural challenges and other key concerns. </p><p> For example, the lack of standardisation and transparency in how ESG factors are assessed and reported. Without consistent metrics, it becomes difficult for investors to compare ESG investment products and evaluate their true impact. Additionally, some investors are concerned that corporates and governments may scale back their climate commitments which affect the short-term viability of such investments.</p><p> At UOB Asset Management, we view ESG integration as a strategic tool for value creation and risk mitigation. By embedding ESG considerations into our investment process, we aim to support long-term sustainability for our investees and their businesses. We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p> Mike Ng: One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns. In addition, some investors may be hesitant given concerns about low-quality ESG data, greenwashing, as well as the perceived trade-off between sustainability and returns.</p><p> While interest in sustainable investment may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments and the geopolitical context, we believe that the overarching trend towards investments that take ESG factors and risks into consideration is here to stay. The challenges of sustainable investment are also being actively addressed. </p><p> Collaboration between stakeholders -- asset managers, data providers and regulatory bodies -- is paving the way for more standardisation in reporting frameworks and taxonomies, which will help mitigate concerns on data quality and greenwashing. Meanwhile, leading financial institutions are developing diverse and accessible products catering to varying preferences and risks appetites, and -- over time -- are also showing that sustainable investments can deliver required returns. </p><p> Sometimes, enabling investors with information can also make a big difference in mainstreaming sustainable investing. Take, for example, the OCBC Sustainability Hub, launched in 2024.</p><p>  The innovative platform empowers investors with a personal ESG rating, enabling them to track, understand and act on their investments, and to make informed financial decisions.</p><p>  Within just six months of its launch, the Sustainability Hub achieved a 2.3x year-on-year increase in sustainability-themed investments.</p><p> BT: What do you see as the most promising areas of investments for corporates and individuals that will address climate risks and reap a </p><p> return'</p><p> Helge Muenkel: The business case for climate-aligned investing remains robust particularly in Asia, where climate risk is acute, economic growth is rapid, and the green transition is gaining momentum.</p><p> We see strong opportunities emerging across several areas that offer both meaningful climate impact and attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p> One such area is energy. Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption. </p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods. </p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions. </p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p>  For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls. </p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p> Victor Wong: Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p> Mike Ng: In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors. </p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals. </p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> BT: Plugging the funding gap to </p><p> mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical </p><p> tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help? </p><p> Helge Muenkel: Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting. </p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments. </p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation. </p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia. </p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> Victor Wong: As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital. </p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy. </p><p> Mike Ng: There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors. </p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation. </p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows. </p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p>  As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects. </p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. </p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion. </p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Nature-based solutions include protection and restoration of mangrove areas which help shield coastal communities from storm surges.

The next bound of The Ubin Project builds on the first tranche of projects that have been completed since 2014.</p><p>These updates were shared at Ubin Day 2025, which was graced by Guest-of-Honour Minister for Education and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee. He was hosted by Minister of State for National Development Alvin Tan. To celebrate the occasion and in commemoration of SG60, they joined FUN members and the community to plant 60 trees at Jalan Jelutong earlier today.</p><p>Good progress for next bound of The Ubin Project<br/><br/>The next bound of The Ubin Project, which was launched last year, is a holistic and long-term plan that charts efforts to ensure that Pulau Ubin's natural and cultural heritage continues to be conserved in partnership with the community in the coming 10 years.</p><p>In 2021, NParks, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and FUN kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin. Focus group discussions with FUN members were carried out from 2022 to 2023, where they shared their suggestions on developing the next bound of The Ubin Project for the next decade (2024 to 2034).</p><p>NParks has been working closely with FUN to implement the proposals, and good progress has been achieved across various pillars of The Ubin Project:</p><p>1. Biodiversity Conservation</p><p>Introduction of Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin</p><p>The Cinnamon Bush Frog is a nocturnal species that mainly lives in terrestrial forests and breeds in phytotelms . It was selected for NParks' Species Recovery Programme due to its Vulnerable status in the Singapore Red Data Book.</p><p>Previously, this native rainforest species was mostly confined to the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves and their surrounding Nature Parks. Following the successful introduction of the species into Singapore Botanic Gardens between 2017 and 2018, species recovery efforts for the Cinnamon Bush Frog were extended to Pulau Ubin.</p><p>Two batches of Cinnamon Bush Frog tadpoles, which were collected from the successfully translocated population from Singapore Botanic Gardens as well as the natural population from the Nature Reserves, have been introduced at two sites on the island where artificial phytotelm habitats were installed.</p><p>The first batch, which was introduced in June 2024, have matured into adult frogs and are living outside the artificial phytotelm habitats. This serves as an early indication that suggests Pulau Ubin may be a suitable habitat for this vulnerable species and that a population may be established outside of mainland Singapore. The second batch, which was introduced at another site on the island in March 2025, is still being monitored.</p><p>If the introduction of the Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin proves to be successful, this would expand its local distribution in Singapore and boost the chances of long-term survival for this vulnerable species.</p><p>Ongoing reforestation and habitat enhancement programmes</p><p>a. OneMillionTrees movement</p><p>As part of the Nature Conservation Masterplan, NParks has been carrying out reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin, and has planted more than 20,000 trees on the island since 2020.</p><p>This year, more than 3,600 trees of over 145 native species will be planted progressively across 15 sites, including Chek Jawa Wetlands, Jalan Durian, Ketam Mountain Bike Park and Sensory Trail Pond, as part of reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin. They include Critically Endangered species such as the Paku Raja (Cycas edentata), Bayur Jantan (Pterospermum diversifolium) and Mengkudu Laut (Timonius finlaysonianus).</p><p>Such reforestation efforts will help provide more sites for food and shelter for native biodiversity on Pulau Ubin such as the Greater Mousedeer (Tragulus napu), Mainland Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Sunda Pangolin (Manis javanica), as well as various species of pollinators such as birds, bats, bees and butterflies. At the same time, this will further the OneMillionTrees movement to plant one million more trees across Singapore and help enhance ecosystem resilience against the impacts of climate change in the longer term.</p><p>b. Shoreline restoration works</p><p>In line with NParks' broader efforts to harness nature-based solutions for enhancing coastal resilience, restoration works are currently underway to address ongoing erosion along Pulau Ubin's northern coastline and to prevent the loss of valuable coastal beach and mangrove habitats.</p><p>Preparation works are in progress to restore approximately 2.2 kilometres of the island's northern shoreline. As part of these efforts, headlands will be built near the coast to protect existing natural beach shorelines that are vulnerable to erosion and to encourage the accretion of sand over time. In addition, rock revetments will be installed beneath eroded mangrove undercuts to prevent further erosion and support the natural growth of mangroves along these structures.</p><p>2. Community, Heritage and History</p><p>FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration</p><p>As part of efforts to revitalise kampung life on Pulau Ubin and retain its heritage and rustic kampung charm, NParks has been working with FUN and the community since 2017 to progressively restore kampung houses on the island.</p><p>For more information on NParks' initiatives to enhance liveability for Ubin's community, please refer to the Media Factsheet.</p><p>In 2024, NParks announced that it would develop a Kampung House Restoration Programme, which would kick off with the restoration of five non-residential houses for community and commercial use. To do so, NParks will be establishing the FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration, which will comprise several FUN members as well as stakeholders from architecture and heritage-related fields.</p><p>NParks will work closely with the workgroup to explore the adaptive reuse of the restored kampung houses. The five kampung houses to be restored under the programme are: No. 6-J, No. 25, No. 27, No. 31 and No. 425-B.</p><p>Interested parties are invited to share proposals on how these kampung houses can be restored and used.</p><p>3. Education and Research</p><p>The Ubin School initiative was rolled out in 2024 to promote environmental education and stewardship among youths through multi-disciplinary programming and experiential learning. The initiative's programmes incorporate projects under The Ubin Project, involve the Pulau Ubin community, and celebrate the island's rich natural and cultural heritage.</p><p>Tapping on citizen science for habitat enhancement efforts<br/><br/>To transform Pulau Ubin into a learning classroom set in nature, the Ubin School initiative is tapping on citizen science to support habitat enhancement efforts for Pulau Ubin. For example, in 2024 and 2025, students from Meridian Secondary School contributed to the monitoring of reforestation sites on the island by tagging the planted trees and measuring their height and girth, supporting long-term ecological data collection.</p><p>To foster greater student involvement in environmental stewardship, these efforts will also be extended to more schools such as Anchor Green Primary School and Raffles Girls' School this year. This will also complement other ongoing habitat enhancement efforts with students, such as coastal clean-ups and invasive species management.</p><p>Experiential learning through interactions with Ubin villagers</p><p>Several learning journeys conducted this year have involved members of the Pulau Ubin community. For instance, as part of their learning journey on the changing landscapes of Pulau Ubin and the relationship between the island and its villagers, students from North Vista Secondary School's Outdoor Activities Club visited a kampung house and interacted with a villager to understand the Ubin way of life. During their visit, students learnt about the cultivation of fruit trees and medicinal herbs and had the opportunity to experience drawing water from traditional wells.</p><p>Similarly, as part of Commonwealth Secondary Schools STEM Elective, which aims to nurture scientific thinking and environmental stewardship, Secondary 3 and 4 students observed the daily routines and eco-friendly practices of the island's villagers.</p><p>Furthermore, schools are encouraged to cater meals from the island's eateries, with additional time allocated for meals to allow students to visit shops and interact with villagers at the Main Village and form deeper connections with the island and its community.</p><p>Ubin as an outdoor classroom</p><p>To further position Pulau Ubin as an outdoor classroom for experiential learning, NParks has extended the Ubin School initiative to include biology student teachers from the National Institute of Education (NIE).</p><p>A pilot cohort of biology student teachers participated in the Ubin School initiative in 2024, with a second batch taking part earlier this year. Through the initiative, these student teachers are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the logistical and pedagogical aspects of planning and conducting educational activities on Pulau Ubin to deepen students' understanding of the island's rich biodiversity, heritage and culture.</p><p>4. Nature-based Recreation</p><p>Upgrading and enhancing amenities on Pulau Ubin</p><p>NParks has completed trail improvement works on the earth tracks leading up to Puaka Hill and to Chek Jawa Wetlands from Jalan Durian, enhancing the visitor experience for those on foot or bicycles. In addition, NParks worked closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to repave roads and carry out rehabilitation works on Pulau Ubin's bridges.</p><p>To alleviate flooding during high spring tide periods, a new drain was created at the back of the Main Village earlier this year to divert rainwater away from the low-lying kampung houses. The drain beside the Wayang Stage has also been widened, improving drainage flow to the sea.</p><p>NParks will continue to work with FUN to provide and enhance amenities on Pulau Ubin, while ensuring they are in harmony with the island's natural environment. This includes ongoing efforts to upgrade and enhance interpretive displays and signage to improve wayfinding for visitors.</p><p>Shaping the future of Ubin with the community</p><p>Under the next bound of The Ubin Project, NParks has been working with FUN to engage stakeholders on charting the future direction of Pulau Ubin. To date, most villagers have been engaged through interviews to seek their views and ideas. Their feedback reflects broad support for enhancing Pulau Ubin's attractiveness while conserving its cultural heritage and natural environment.</p><p>In 2024, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) also presented the plans for the next bound of The Ubin Project as part of their Recreation Master Plan roving exhibition, to seek the public's suggestions. These suggestions will be taken into consideration as the plans for Pulau Ubin are developed.</p><p>As Singapore transforms into a City in Nature, NParks will continue to build on the first tranche of The Ubin Project and work closely with FUN to engage stakeholders on how to best preserve Pulau Ubin's rustic charm and heritage, natural environment and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p>Ubin Day 2025</p><p>Ubin Day is a culmination of Pesta Ubin, a festival organised by NParks, FUN members and the community. First held in 2002, this is the 14th edition of Ubin Day, celebrating the different facets of the island. During the two-week-long Pesta Ubin this year, close to 1,000 participants took part in over 40 activities on Pulau Ubin. Participants learnt more about Pulau Ubin's rich biodiversity and natural history through themed guided walks for photography and birdwatching, kampung heritage tours, cycling tours, mangrove kayaking and more.

The first phase was completed in 2012 but other earlier phases are in different stages of development by other companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"When completed, it will be the longest riverfront project in the world, with a total length of over 38km,\" said Mr Abhishek Malhotra, Surbana Jurong's regional director for South Asia.</p><p> While the riverfront projects have given residents a much-needed public space, a key challenge for Ahmedabad and other cities with riverfront plans, however, is the extremely polluted rivers, which are clogged with sewage, toxic chemicals discharged by factories and rubbish from rapidly growing cities.</p><p> Along the 371km-long Sabarmati River, which flows from the north-western state of Rajasthan into Gujarat, multiple cleaning operations have taken place but with limited success, said environmentalists.</p><p> In the latest initiative to clean up the river, some 60,000 residents of Ahmedabad have since May 15 picked up 945 tonnes of waste from the riverbed after water was drained to repair the Vasna Barrage, which controls the flow of water into the Sabarmati River near the riverfront. </p><p> This is among other initiatives, both short and long term, to clean up the river -- from using trash skimmers to collect floating rubbish to tackling the problem of untreated sewage. However, the pollutants going into the river have continued to outpace clean-up efforts, noted environmentalists. </p><p> \"The cleanliness drive is also to ensure wider awareness so that people don't throw waste into the river. We want river waters to be clean,\" said Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Banchhanidhi Pani.</p><p> But it is not just the discarded rubbish that is the problem.</p><p> A report released recently by Toxics Link, an Indian environmental research and advocacy organisation, said high levels of nonylphenol -- a chemical with carcinogenic properties that can cause prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women -- were detected in the surface water of four rivers including the Sabarmati, downstream of the riverfront project. </p><p> The chemical, which also kills aquatic life, is used in the textile industry in particular. </p><p> \"It is not enough to keep the riverfront water clean and not the rest of the stretch,\" said Mr Mahesh Pandya, director of Paryavaran Mitra, a Gujarat-based non-governmental organisation dedicated to protecting the environment. </p><p> In September 2024, the Gujarat High Court rebuked the local authorities for failing to come up with a concrete plan for cleaning up the river. The court initiated public interest litigation on its own and has kept a close scrutiny over the clean-up efforts. \"All your claims are on paper,\" the court noted, according to a report in the Gujarat Samachar newspaper.</p><p> Contamination from untreated sewage is a common problem for India's rivers.</p><p> According to some estimates, 38,000 million litres of wastewater enter Indian rivers due to the lack of functioning sewage treatment plants and poor waste disposal.</p><p> Many riverfront projects in the pipelinePolluted rivers present a jarring challenge to local governments' plans to spruce up riverfronts and turn them into attractive urban community spaces.</p><p> A report by the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said 61 riverfront projects have been initiated under the Smart Cities Mission, an urban renewal and retrofitting programme by the government to improve facilities and infrastructure in Indian cities. Many more are being developed outside the mission. </p><p> Along the Sabarmati, the first 11.25km of the riverfront development, completed in 2012, has been held up as an exemplary instance of riverfront development in India.</p><p> Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, hosted world leaders like Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014 and the late former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2017 at the riverfront.</p><p> Surbana Jurong, which has joined the further development of the riverfront, aims to foster \"a vibrant and engaging urban-river interface\", said Mr Malhotra. </p><p> He said the masterplan \"embraces the natural slope of the riverbanks to create a convenient transition from the street level to the lower terrace, enhancing the connection between riverfront and the surrounding urban fabric\".</p><p> The firm would be using a \"blend of design strategies -- from landscaped stepped terraces to natural, soft edges\", he added, allowing \"inclusive public access for people of all abilities\". </p><p> The Gujarat government is also proposing to build a Singapore-style Cloud Forest -- a greenhouse-like structure with exotic trees and plants under a dome -- covering an area of over 2,500 sq m, which is smaller than a football field.</p><p> The trend to develop riverfronts in India is part of a larger push to boost urban infrastructure and make cities liveable. </p><p> A study on waterfront development projects by the SPA, a public higher education institution, noted that such projects are significant as cities are \"grappling with multiple issues of pollution, biodiversity loss and extreme pressure on open spaces\". </p><p> It added that these developments lead to \"an increase in available and usable open spaces, re-establishing the lost connection between the people and the water body, an increase in livelihood options and property prices\". </p><p> The SPA study noted that the development of the Ganga riverfront in the eastern city of Patna in Bihar state had led to significantly enhanced recreational facilities, improved public transport connectivity, and addressed waste management issues. </p><p> It further noted that anecdotal evidence suggested a potential increase in property values and economic activity. </p><p> Clean up rivers before developing riverfronts In some cities, residents are putting pressure on the authorities to pay as much attention to environmental concerns as developing the riverfront.</p><p> Angry citizens of Pune, a city in the western state of Maharashtra, have staged protest marches, filed lawsuits and planted trees to demand that the Mula River be cleaned up and that riverfront developments take environmental concerns into account.</p><p> A concrete-heavy riverside development would affect the natural aqueducts that charge the groundwater and the biodiversity along the river, said Pune-based environmentalist Mukund Mavalankar. </p><p> \"We have pointed out that the river is dying because of untreated sewage going into the river. This needs to be tackled first,\" said Mr Mavalankar. </p><p> The capacity of sewage treatment plants along the Mula River is 500 million litres per day, when the required capacity is 1,000 million litres, he added.</p><p> While the protests and legal cases have not stalled plans as yet, they have brought focus on the issue of rejuvenating rivers and ensuring that wanton construction does not take place along their banks.</p><p> A key problem has also been the lack of a holistic approach to cleaning rivers that flow through multiple states, water experts noted, arguing that piecemeal efforts are often unsuccessful despite the best intentions. </p><p> Ms Jaya Dhindaw, the executive programme director of Sustainable Cities at WRI India, an independent research organisation, said important initiatives and institutional mechanisms have been set up by the government, like the National Mission for Clean Ganga to clean the river Ganga and the surrounding areas.</p><p> The Ganga is a 2,525km-long river that crosses multiple states in India before flowing into Bangladesh.</p><p> She said: \"A data-led approach which helps identify the sources of pollution, strong enforcement of pollution control, integrating nature-based solutions to manage water quality, and enabling community ownership and stewardship of rivers are essential to the long-term success of clean-up efforts.\"</p><p> Test case in DelhiA test case for whether river rejuvenation can happen with riverfront development is in the capital city.</p><p> The Delhi government, which like Gujarat's is led by Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, has promised a Sabarmati-type riverfront makeover along the Yamuna River.</p><p> Plans include creating a central piazza, topiary park, shopping centre and river promenade along a 22km stretch of the river.</p><p> The Yamuna flows through multiple states, with the stretch in Delhi among its most polluted. Between 2017 and 2022, the Delhi government spent more than 68 billion rupees (S$1 billion) to clean the Yamuna, but it still has high levels of pollutants from untreated sewage and industrial waste. </p><p> The Delhi government recently announced a 30-point action plan to clean up the river, which includes building 40 sewage treatment plants.</p><p> For residents, a riverfront to go to for a stroll or a cruise down the river is an attractive proposition.</p><p> \"It would be great to have a riverfront,\" said Ms Ritu Sharma, a Delhi resident, who added that she would love to take a walk along the riverfront. \"But I hope they can clear the pollution too.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Thousands of people celebrating World Yoga Day on June 21, 2024, along the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad, India's western state of Gujarat.

In doing so, emissions from the impending deforestation are prevented from being released, and are sold as carbon credits. </p><p> Each credit represents one tonne of planet-warming emissions that is prevented from being released into the atmosphere, and buyers are companies who want to offset their carbon footprint.  </p><p> There are about 4.7 million ha of mangroves in South-east Asia, but only 2.1 million ha can be protected as carbon projects as they are at risk of being cut down.</p><p>  A forest that is not threatened cannot supply carbon credits to the carbon market. </p><p> If a forest does not face a deforestation threat, issuing credits for its conservation is not considered \"additional\", and is akin to paying for an outcome that would have happened anyway. This concept of additionality is used to assess the quality of a carbon project. </p><p> For the analysis, the researchers used a base price of US$29.72 (S$40) per mangrove carbon credit. This was the selling price in June 2023 for carbon credits from  a mangrove protection project in Pakistan.</p><p> A higher carbon price could help to lower the risk of mangroves being converted for production, said the researchers, although the study did not attempt to calculate a price floor. </p><p> Other approaches, including ensuring that local communities have alternative livelihoods, could also help to lower the risk of land conversion for socio-economic reasons, the researchers added. </p><p> Assistant Professor Zeng Yiwen from NTU's Asian School of the Environment, who supervised the study, said local communities should receive benefits fairly and equitably from the establishment and running of a carbon credit project. </p><p> \"If projects can incorporate mechanisms for benefit sharing with local stakeholders, some of the socio-economic permanence risks can be mitigated,\" said Prof Zeng. \"This can help to increase the project's ability to provide long-term biodiversity and climate benefits.\" </p><p> The study was published on Jan 28 in the journal Communications Earth And Environment. </p><p> It spotlights a critical issue in global discussions on protecting nature -- the \"permanence\" of nature-based solutions, or how securely ecosystems can store carbon for the long term without the risk of it being released back into the atmosphere.</p><p> Nature-based solutions refer to efforts to protect natural habitats so their carbon-sucking abilities can be tapped in humanity's fight against climate change.</p><p> But many factors could affect the permanence of a nature-based carbon project, where the stored carbon in the ecosystem does not remain sequestered indefinitely. </p><p> Besides land clearance, other factors that could affect permanence include climate change impacts over the longer term -- 75 to 100 years.</p><p> For the study, the researchers also looked into how rising sea levels and tropical cyclones could threaten the permanence of mangroves -- coastal ecosystems that exist where land meets sea -- in South-east Asia.  </p><p> Previous studies have shown that tropical cyclones rated Category 3 and above can cause mangrove forest structure damage, said Ms Kwan. </p><p> Climate scientists have predicted that climate change and warming oceans will fuel more intense cyclones. </p><p> Mangroves have a unique ability to keep pace with sea level rise, since their tangled webs of roots allow them to trap sediment. But Ms Kwan said this ability hinges on there being adequate sediment brought in by the tides.  </p><p> She noted that an earlier study had found that sediment delivery at almost 70 per cent of study sites within the Indo-Pacific was inadequate for supporting high rates of sediment accretion, due to dams and other human activities. </p><p> At these sites, the rate of sea level rise will likely be faster than soil surface elevation gain in mangroves, compromising the permanence of these ecosystems, she said.</p><p> The study recommended that mangrove carbon projects factor in future climate impacts by allowing mangroves to migrate inland -- a process that can happen naturally, as long as there are no infrastructural projects blocking their landward path. </p><p> Overall, the study found that 1.8 million ha -- or 85 per cent of mangrove areas that are considered \"investible\" as mangrove carbon projects -- are likely to experience some form of permanence risk from both socio-economic and climate factors. </p><p> Prof Zeng said: \"Our study suggests that socio-economic and climate change permanence risks to blue carbon projects can be potentially extensive, and that some areas could experience greater risk than others.\" </p><p> Blue carbon refers to carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems, including mangroves. </p><p> Prof Zeng said the loss of mangroves in a carbon project will not only impact a carbon project developer's profitability, but will also compromise the services that nature provides to people and biodiversity -- such as by removing carbon from the atmosphere or providing habitat for wildlife. </p><p> \"Addressing the risks to a mangrove's permanence can help to improve the likelihood of a project remaining conserved in the long term,\" he said. </p><p> \"Ultimately, this will impact the benefits to local communities and biodiversity, which tends to require the long-term persistence of these natural ecosystems.\" </p><p> Ms Hoon Ling Min, investment director at Temasek-backed investment platform company GenZero, which invests in decarbonisation solutions including nature-based ones, said permanence is a critical factor in assessing carbon projects. </p><p> Other factors -- including additionality and leakage considerations -- are also taken into account, she added. Leakage in the implementation of nature-based solutions occurs when efforts to protect one area shifts deforestation to another location.</p><p> \"These factors affect the durability and integrity of the carbon projects, which, in turn, impact investor and buyer demand for the carbon credits generated from these projects,\" said Ms Hoon. </p><p> Ensuring permanence requires thoughtful project design, given that various physical and human factors could affect the long-term stability of carbon sequestration, Ms Hoon said, pointing to how forests can also face fire and illegal logging risks. </p><p> She said that carbon registries and methodologies require the allocation of a portion of carbon credits from projects towards a buffer pool, to cater for potential reversal risks. </p><p> To create this buffer pool, a proportion of carbon credits generated must be withheld from sale and released only if project integrity is maintained for a fixed number of years. </p><p> Ms Hoon added: \"Project developers are also required to implement land use management practices and involve local communities through stakeholder engagement, to ensure that the interventions are maintained throughout the entire project duration.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-PKG1SSC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F3B-SGM3-RRJ7-T32M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1282\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Climate change is rarely considered when we consider the need for greater gender equality. </p><p> We should draw a tighter connection between empowering women and addressing climate change.  </p><p> Consider the evidenceGreater female representation correlates with superior environmental performance -- at the country, corporate and household levels.</p><p> Scientists have documented a statistically significant association between female parliamentary representation and the stringency of a country's climate policies. Countries with a higher proportion of women in Parliament are more likely to ratify environmental treaties and implement policies aimed at addressing climate change, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> At a corporate level, companies whose boards included at least three women directors for at least three years achieved greater reductions in carbon-emissions intensity versus their peers in the same sector. </p><p> Such companies were also more likely (16 per cent versus 6.3 per cent) to have environmental targets linked to executive compensation, according to research by investment research firm Morgan Stanley Capital International.</p><p> A 2018 study by Yale University in the US also showed that women are more likely to be concerned about the climate crisis than men. In developed economies, women drive 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all consumer purchasing decisions, and are leading the transition to more sustainable lifestyles. </p><p> Women are more likely to recycle, minimise waste, and save water and energy in the household.  </p><p> This care for our planet has deep roots. </p><p> In rural and indigenous communities, women have played a traditional role as managers and stewards of natural resources and agricultural systems for generations. One study demonstrated that women hold greater plant knowledge than men and, more importantly, share this knowledge more widely, with horizontal knowledge transmission measured at 73 per cent for women and 61 per cent for men.  </p><p> That expertise and sharing of knowledge improves conservation on the ground, as demonstrated by the success of women-only forest protection groups, shown in multiple studies done in India. </p><p> For example, a study in India in 2006 showed that female participation in forest management is associated with a 24 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit grazing, a 28 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit felling, and a 28 per cent increase in the probability of forest regeneration. </p><p> The evidence is compelling: When women are empowered in environmental projects, their deep knowledge of local ecosystems and resource management practices, as well as their centrality to community dynamics, leads to a substantial increase in the efficacy of such projects. </p><p> This is an important factor to note for investors into nature-based solutions that protect, restore and manage natural ecosystems with the aim of mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing biodiversity. </p><p> Combining gender goals with nature-based solutions serves a dual purpose: It improves environmental outcomes while ensuring that women are allowed to fairly access and benefit from natural resources.</p><p> The emergence of  new solutionsWe are beginning to see nature-focused investors take this connection seriously. </p><p> The Kiwa Initiative in the Pacific Islands, for example, integrates gender equality into land restoration projects. It not only revitalises degraded landscapes, but also elevates women into leadership roles traditionally dominated by men.</p><p> In Nepal, a ground-breaking initiative has put women at the helm of managing the country's vast forests. This shift has led to more sustainable forestry practices, reduced deforestation and improved community livelihoods. </p><p> In Tajikistan, a women-led snow leopard conservation project has integrated species preservation with female empowerment, creating jobs and ecotourism revenues while protecting biodiversity. </p><p> Integrating gender considerations into nature investments requires deliberate strategies and innovative financial instruments. Investors now have a wider suite of investment structures to consider, from green bonds with gender criteria to investment funds prioritising female-led sustainability projects. </p><p> The Climate Bonds Initiative, a non-profit organisation working to mobilise global capital for climate action, and UN Women are partnering on new guidance to integrate gender considerations within green finance tools promoting climate resilience. </p><p> Remember the bottom lineDespite the environmental dividends, mainstreaming gender equality within sustainable finance will require continued education on the financial benefits of empowering women. </p><p> We must remember that companies with more women in senior management score higher in all dimensions of organisational performance. At a global level, a White House report published during US President Donald Trump's first term in February 2020 estimated that the value of removing legal restrictions on women globally could boost global gross domestic product by US$7.7 trillion (S$10.4 trillion), or 8.3 per cent.  </p><p> Limited data, entrenched biases and policy gaps impede progress. However, these challenges also highlight the vast potential for growth. The UN estimates that US$360 billion a year is needed to bridge the gender gap. With the promise of a US$7.7 trillion payoff, that looks like a bargain.  </p><p> It is a collective responsibility to drive gender equality, given the shared benefits that accrue to all. </p><p> Business leaders and decision-makers in all industries can take action by developing programmes and earmarking funds to promote inclusive policies and prioritise gender diversity at all levels of their organisations. </p><p> Adopting a gender-lens approach is not about being woke -- it is an economically and environmentally astute move. Doing more to connect gender equality and sustainable development will help unlock additional benefits for all. </p><p> Let us shift the narrative from \"why\" we should invest in women to how quickly we can scale these investments. The dividends are too significant to ignore -- for our economies, our environment and our shared future.</p><p> Ms Kimberly Tan is the head of investments at GenZero, an investment platform company that aims to accelerate decarbonisation. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-7QGF8AN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F7V-5BY3-RRT9-P0BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Beyond the obvious problem that this arrangement does nothing to deter new emissions or preserve vital environmental systems by registering the costs of pollution or damage to biodiversity, it also means there is no immediate bottom-line return on investment in sustainable business practices.</p><p> This poses a significant challenge when it comes to encouraging businesses to support nature-based solutions to address issues such as climate change, human health, food and water security, and reduce the risk of natural disasters by protecting, preserving, or restoring natural ecosystems.</p><p> The connection between protecting the environment and saving costs is well established. A report published by the Nature Conservancy and others estimated that mangroves alone protect property from damage valued at US$82 billion each year, but in the short term, there is greater profit in cutting down the mangroves and using the land for fish farming or other agricultural production.</p><p> Although the transition to a net-zero future will cost tens and possibly hundreds of trillions of dollars, the money seems to be available: The 450 firms which joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in April 2021 between them manage US$130 trillion in assets, and many individual savers are starting to insist that their pensions schemes or college funds are invested in sustainable assets. The problem is less a shortage of money than a shortage of projects that are both sustainable and bankable.</p><p> The growing -- if largely still voluntary -- market for carbon credits, driven by governments and companies like HSBC which have made fixed pledges to transition to carbon-neutral operations, is an encouraging development. These range from Gabon's recent offering of 90 million tonnes of sovereign carbon credits; to Norway's new agreement to pay Indonesia to preserve forests under the United Nation's REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) scheme; to more ambitious debt-for-nature swaps where creditors forgive debt in return for undertakings to preserve or expand natural assets.</p><p> But all these schemes have struggled with definitional loopholes and enforcement issues. Climate-related agreements and financial instruments are still evolving, and there is no generally agreed consensus on terms or terminology. Various groupings in Europe, Asia and the Americas are working to come up with what is known as a \"taxonomy\" -- a framework that defines what is a green asset and what is not.</p><p> This lack of consensus is limiting the expansion of the market for green bonds, many of which have a nature-based component, if only as a carbon offset. To be fair, the issues are complex. If a company is raising money to build a new factory and is promising to compensate for its carbon output by planting trees, is it going to plant millions of the same species and are those species native or not, either of which would be detrimental to biodiversity? What are they going to replace? Where is the water going to come from'</p><p> The market is hungry for green financial products, many of which will have nature-based components, but until asset managers have the confidence that the funding will be used sustainably, they will be reluctant to commit at anything close to the scale we need to contain and reverse climate change.</p><p> Clear taxonomies also hold the potential to unleash the power of central banks. Central banks, with their remit to preserve and enhance the long-term health of the economy, have a clear interest in limiting global warming.</p><p> Ma Jun, a former member of the People's Bank of China monetary committee and current co-chair of the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, has suggested that central banks could increase green lending by offering commercial banks cheaper financing for their green loan book, and others have suggested offsetting green loans against reserve requirements.</p><p> The profit from investing in strengthening natural systems is real, but rarely registers on our national or corporate balance sheets. But if we are to limit and eventually reverse our impact on the environment, we must find ways to mobilise the investment we need to preserve and enhance nature's powers.</p><p> The writer is head of sustainable finance and investments, Asean, at HSBC and board member of Pentagreen Capital.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Flooding in the Maribyrnong suburb of Melbourne.

Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat launched the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Draft Master Plan 2025 (DMP2025) Exhibition this morning - a showcase of Singapore's land use development blueprint for the next 10 to 15 years. The DMP2025 is shaped through URA's most extensive public engagement exercise to date. As Singapore celebrates 60 years of independence (SG60), DMP2025 presents a milestone in our development as a city-state. It is an opportunity to reflect on our shared journey as a nation and collective citizenship in overcoming challenges and shaping a future together.</p><p>2. The DMP2025 showcases islandwide land use plans and strategies for more inclusive, accessible homes and neighbourhoods; refreshed business nodes and vibrant workspaces; and a more resilient Singapore that is better able to respond to economic, social and climate challenges in the years to come. Together, these proposals aim to create a more liveable, inclusive and endearing Singapore, by offering Singaporeans from all walks of life with more choices for living, working and leisure, as well as a deepened sense of identity and place.</p><p>3. Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer, URA, said \"Over the past two years, we have engaged Singaporeans and communities across generations and backgrounds to better understand their aspirations. Their feedback has helped to shape a more holistic plan that reflects the priorities and concerns of our people, while addressing key challenges such as climate change and an ageing population. We thank all who have contributed to shaping the next chapter of Singapore's story. URA will continue working closely with the community to ensure that the Master Plan remains a living blueprint, rooted in our shared values and responsive to Singapore's evolving needs.\"</p><p>Building our future, together</p><p>4. Singapore's long-term and integrated planning approach is underpinned by two key frameworks: the Long-Term Plan, which sets strategic directions for the next 50 years and beyond; and the Master Plan, reviewed every five years, which translates these strategies into detailed land use proposals. The DMP2025 builds on the strategies developed in the last Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) in 2022, translating them into detailed land use plans that will guide Singapore's physical transformation over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>5. Since October 2023, URA has engaged almost 220,000 people for their feedback on development plans of varying scales in the DMP2025, shaped around four themes: (i) Shaping A Happy Healthy City; (ii) Enabling Sustainable Growth; (iii) Strengthening Urban Resilience and; (iv) Stewarding Nature and Heritage. Through multiple platforms, including exhibitions, dialogues, focus group discussions and surveys, URA carried out its most extensive public engagement effort to date, to ensure that the DMP2025 balances diverse priorities at the national, community and individual levels.</p><p>6. See Annex A [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32a.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32a.pdf</url>] for more information about the DMP2025 and engagement journey.</p><p>(I) Shaping a Happy Healthy City: Building stronger communities and catering to diverse aspirations</p><p>7. The DMP2025 presents plans for a more vibrant and inclusive city where everyone can have better access to essential services, lead more active lifestyles and move around with ease. A variety of housing options will be introduced islandwide to cater to different needs, ages and backgrounds. They will enable more Singaporeans to benefit from convenient access to transport connectivity and a good range of amenities. At the same time, the DMP2025 plans will also create endearing neighbourhoods with lively public spaces, pedestrianised streets and cycling connections that support social bonding, ageing-in-place, wellness and active lifestyles. Each neighbourhood will also be shaped with a distinctive identity to anchor residents' sense of place.</p><p>8.  In addition to the plans for new neighbourhoods in more central locations at Pearl's Hill, Marina South, Bukit Timah Turf City, the former Keppel Golf Course site and Mount Pleasant that URA showcased at the 'My City, My Home' exhibition in November 2023, the DMP2025 outlines plans for more new homes and neighbourhoods across the island.</p><p>New neighbourhoods for every need and lifestyle</p><p>9. A mix of public and private homes, along with amenities will be introduced at Dover-Medway along Dover Road in the Greater one-north area. The new Dover-Medway neighbourhood will support residents who wish to stay close to work and learning spaces in the knowledge hub. It is home to leading technology, media and biomedical firms and Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>10. Up in the north at Kranji, the site occupied by the former Singapore Racecourse will be redeveloped into a new housing estate that capitalises on its rustic surroundings to blend recreation and leisure attractions with daily living. After the relocation of existing uses from 2028, the Sembawang Shipyard area will be progressively transformed into a distinctive mixed-use waterfront district where the design of the future housing estate will take into consideration the area's coastal and maritime character.</p><p>11. Following the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base from the 2030s onwards, the site and its surrounding areas will gradually undergo a major transformation into a community-centric and future-ready town. It will feature an extensive network of green and blue spaces, well-connected mobility options and a distinct aviation character.</p><p>12. The development of the new neighbourhoods will be paced out, to allow for flexibility to review and adjust plans regularly in tandem with evolving needs and trends. At the same time, existing towns such as Pasir Ris and Yishun will also be rejuvenated with new homes and amenities, adding to the range of housing options for different preferences and needs.</p><p>13. There will also be more opportunities to live in and near the city centre, with a new Newton neighbourhood planned next to the Newton MRT station. Comprising three clusters at Newton Circus, Scotts Road and Monk's Hill, the neighbourhood will be shaped as a vibrant mixed-use 'urban village' with new homes set amidst greenery. At the doorsteps of Orchard Road, the new Paterson neighbourhood will be transformed into a bustling mixed-use hub with new residential developments, shops and public spaces.</p><p>14.In addition to planning for inclusive homes and neighbourhoods that cater to residents of all ages and abilities, we will provide more assisted living options and active ageing centres, to support seniors in ageing actively and independently across more neighbourhoods. This includes Community Care Apartments (CCA), which is a public assisted living typology jointly developed by MND, MOH and HDB, that pairs senior-friendly housing with on-site social activities and care services. Private assisted living apartments such as the upcoming Parry Avenue project will also present other options for senior-friendly homes with care services and wellness amenities.</p><p>Bringing recreation and amenities closer to all</p><p>15. Planning for recreational spaces to support residents' well-being and a good quality living environment has always been a priority. At the roving exhibitions for the Recreation Master Plan from April to September 2024, URA received feedback from more than 66,000 people on their recreational aspirations. In response to feedback for more affordable and inclusive recreational options near homes as well as spaces that support wellness and active lifestyles, URA will plan for better access to recreational spaces and amenities such as sports facilities, retail and community spaces, in addition to every household being a 10-minute walk from a park.</p><p>16. The DMP2025 provides for new integrated community hubs in several towns, including proposed hubs in Woodlands, Yio Chu Kang and Sengkang. Conveniently located near transport nodes, these integrated community hubs will bring together sports, recreational, healthcare and retail facilities under one roof to better serve residents' needs. Residents can also look forward to six new Sport-In-Precinct (SIP) projects islandwide that are currently being built in Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong, Ulu Pandan, Whampoa, Tampines North and Pasir Ris East, with more being studied by agencies.</p><p>17. Besides integrating recreational facilities into new neighbourhoods, we are working with agencies to activate underutilised areas such as spaces below MRT viaducts and the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks for social and recreational activities. Examples include the Bukit Gombak MRT viaduct that has been turned into a space for community art installation, and an upcoming SIP facility atop the multi-storey car park of 19A Dover Crescent.</p><p>More efficient, greener journeys</p><p>18. Singapore is on track to have 8 in 10 households be within a 10-minute walk from a train station by the 2030s, as part of the national objective to enhance connectivity while reducing car dependency. Additionally, our cycling network will be expanded to around 1,300km by 2030 to encourage healthier and greener journeys. In support of the goal of shaping Singapore as a more connected city for walking and cycling, the DMP2025 showcases plans for a new pedestrian bridge connecting Marina Centre and Bay East Garden, providing pedestrians and cyclists with a more direct connection between the city and the East Coast along the Round Island Route by 2029.</p><p>19. See Annex B [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32b.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32b.pdf</url>] for more details of the initiatives under 'Shaping a Happy Healthy City'.</p><p>(II) Enabling Sustainable Growth: Sustaining a thriving, open economy to meet evolving needs of our nation, businesses and workers</p><p>Strengthening economic gateways and business nodes</p><p>20. URA's decentralisation strategy aims at sustaining a competitive and open economy for Singapore while creating vibrant workspaces and opportunities across the island for Singaporeans to thrive. Since decentralisation commenced in the early-1990s, we have progressively established a hierarchy of economic gateways and business nodes islandwide, bringing jobs and amenities closer to homes, while spreading transport flows and reducing the need to travel to the city centre. The focus of the DMP2025 is to continue driving Singapore's economic growth by strengthening our economic gateways and business nodes, rejuvenating key precincts, and supporting innovation.</p><p>21. The Northern, Eastern and Western Gateways will continue to grow as important economic hubs. Upcoming developments in Woodlands Regional Centre will capitalise on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and upcoming Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link, which is targeted to be ready by end-2026. The opening of Changi Airport Terminal 5 in the mid-2030s will reinforce Singapore's position as a global aviation hub, the PSA Supply Chain Hub and Tuas Port, scheduled to be completed in 2027 and 2040s respectively, will enhance Singapore's logistics capabilities and port capacity.</p><p>22. Agencies will embark on plans to redevelop Town Centres to support decentralisation efforts. Bishan Sub-Regional Centre for example, will undergo rejuvenation with the introduction of new workplaces, amenities, and pedestrian-friendly streets. Agencies are studying the potential of transforming Bishan Place into a landscaped pedestrian mall as well as plans for a new polyclinic and potential hawker centre that could be integrated with an upgraded bus interchange. In addition, a few government agencies are currently exploring the feasibility of relocating their offices here to jumpstart the development of this business node.</p><p>Revitalising our city centre</p><p>23. Our city centre remains a vital destination for business, tourism and culture, anchoring Singapore's status as a global hub. Rejuvenation plans are underway for our Orchard and Downtown areas. This includes plans to create a new destination park in the heart of the city by merging Istana Park and Dhoby Ghaut Green with a 500-metre stretch of Orchard Road. In addition, an elevated pedestrian link bridge between Dhoby Ghaut Green and Fort Canning Park is also being planned. When implemented, these enhancements will create a refreshed and well-connected green space offering visitors a family-friendly area to gather in the city centre.</p><p>24. Over at Marina Bay, new attractions will be introduced to boost our city's capacity to host international events in a vibrant environment for locals, businesses and leisure travellers alike. This includes a planned wellness destination and recreational spaces in the bay such as NS Square and PAssion Wave Outpost @ Bayfront, as well as the expansion of Marina Bay Sands. These efforts will further enhance Marina Bay as an inclusive and welcoming destination.</p><p>25.

As part of efforts to involve the public in shaping vibrant and endearing workspaces for the future, JTC and URA launched the \"Reimagining Former Jurong Bird Park and Jurong Hill\" ideas competition in October 2024 to seek innovative ideas that reimagine the site for both work and play. The DMP2025 has unveiled the winners of the ideas competition, who envisioned the area as a mixed-use precinct that blends work and leisure and is anchored by the site's unique terrain and industrial identity. This complements the proposed conservation of Jurong Hill Tower, as a symbol of Singapore's industrial transformation since independence. Agencies will distil suitable ideas and concepts into planning and design principles to guide the site's future redevelopment and uses.</p><p>27. See Annex D [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32d.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32d.pdf</url>] for more details of winning submissions of the ideas competition.</p><p>(III) Strengthening Urban Resilience: Safeguarding a liveable future by protecting against effects of climate change and leveraging innovative solutions to optimise land</p><p>28. The DMP2025 outlines strategies to address the impact of climate change, such as rising temperatures and sea level rise, and presents further efforts in optimising land use both above and below ground. These initiatives will continue to be expanded and refined to ensure that Singapore remains liveable and adaptable in the face of future challenges, alongside ongoing efforts to redevelop the city in response to the changing needs of our people.</p><p>Leveraging technology to protect against climate change</p><p>29. With Singapore's mean temperature projected to rise significantly by 2100 due to climate change, efforts are underway to design a cooler and more comfortable urban environment, even as we continue to develop. Environmental modelling tools are being developed in collaboration with local universities to facilitate more data-driven and scenario-based urban planning. These include digital technology to simulate wind and heat conditions, helping us create more climate-sensitive urban design, which contribute towards a more comfortable environment for precincts.</p><p>Progressing with plans for 'Long Island'</p><p>30. With rising sea levels posing a critical threat, Singapore is advancing plans for 'Long Island' - an integrated solution along the East Coast that will meet multiple national objectives. Beyond coastal protection, water and flood resilience, 'Long Island' will create land for future needs and recreational opportunities. Over 3,000 members of the public and stakeholders have contributed their ideas and feedback for this long-term project, and technical studies are currently ongoing to explore potential engineering and nature-based solutions that could be introduced, amongst others.</p><p>Exploring further possibilities for underground space</p><p>31. We will continue to tap on our underground space to free up valuable surface space for people and build robust infrastructure to support long-term growth. Significant progress has already been made over the past few decades, with underground infrastructure such as MRT tunnels, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System and Jurong Rock Caverns helping to free up valuable surface land, while supporting the development of infrastructure.</p><p>32.As part of the DMP2025, we will expand the strategic use of underground space, including exploring deep caverns at sites like Gali Batu for storage of construction aggregate, while identifying more possibilities for new underground developments through research and capability-building to enhance technical expertise in this field.</p><p>33. See Annex E [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf</url>] for more details of the initiatives under 'Strengthen Urban Resilience'</p><p>(IV) Stewarding Nature and Heritage: Anchoring our sense of belonging and enhancing our natural capital</p><p>34. Striking a balance between social, economic and environmental considerations remains a key tenet of the DMP2025. Beyond enhancing our heritage spaces, we will leverage innovative approaches to ensure that Singapore continues to develop sensitively as a City in Nature.</p><p>A greener city</p><p>35. Our vision towards becoming a City in Nature has progressed steadily. Since 2021, 130 ha of new parks have been added and our Park Connector Network has grown to about 390km. Over the next five years, we will target to implement more than 25 new parks and over 50km of park connectors. The upcoming Kranji Nature Corridor for instance, will strengthen ecological connectivity in the northern region of the island between the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and provide new nature-based recreation opportunities for all.</p><p>36. See Annex F [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32f.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32f.pdf</url>] for more details of the new Kranji Nature Corridor.</p><p>Celebrating our built heritage and enhancing familiar places</p><p>37. Building on the Heritage &amp; Identity Plan conceptualised in the last LTPR, URA has engaged stakeholders over the past year to develop a new thematic narrative framework covering key pillars of Singapore's history and development as an independent nation: Economy, Housing, Social and Defence. The framework aims to illustrate the roles that our built heritage plays in charting Singapore's more recent history, and guides strategies to recall heritage as Singapore continues to develop, whether through adaptive reuse of selected buildings, or enhancing the characters of areas through sensitive urban design and placemaking initiatives. Agencies will continue to review the feasibility of adapting these buildings for new uses to serve our needs as well as integrate them with future developments to make them more accessible to the public.</p><p>38. In addition to the five sites and buildings1 which were announced in May 2025 to be proposed for conservation as part of the DMP2025, URA has further proposed conserving the NatSteel Steel Pavilion, the former Pasir Panjang English School as well as selected buildings at Bukit Timah Turf City.</p><p>39. See Annex G [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf</url>] for more details of the new thematic narrative framework and buildings proposed for conservation.</p><p>40. Apart from conservation, we will also pursue other ways of recalling heritage to strengthen our sense of identity. URA has engaged over 2,300 residents and stakeholders to co-create proposals to enhance the three Identity Corridors2 of Historic East, Kallang River and Inner Ring.</p><p>41. Following public and communities' feedback and ideas, URA has identified three new identity nodes at Siglap, Moonstone Lane Estate, and Newton. They add to the 18 existing identity nodes which URA previously identified based on their distinctive local character and identity and progressively enhanced over the years. The extensive public consultations have also led to plans to enliven the Identity Corridors with more inclusive spaces, including a new pedestrian mall at Katong and new parks along Kallang River, such as at the Moonstone-Bendemeer and Potong Pasir-St Andrew's areas.</p><p>42. See Annex H [PDF, 153kb] for more details of the Identity Corridors and upcoming initiatives.</p><p>Be part of the DMP2025: Peek into the plans for tomorrow and visit the islandwide DMP2025 Exhibition</p><p>43. URA invites the public to visit the DMP2025 Exhibition to learn about the plans for Singapore and their neighbourhoods. The exhibition will be held at The URA Centre Atrium at 45 Maxwell Road from 25 Jun 2025 to 29 Nov 2025.

Even then, it covers only industrial facilities with direct greenhouse gas emissions of at least 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year. </p><p> This means that the majority of companies in Singapore have no incentive to purchase credits, except out of their climate commitments. </p><p> Banks themselves are also cautious about financing the development of carbon projects, given the reputational and liquidity risks to which they could be exposed. </p><p> Developers need to first show that their projects are of high quality, transparent and verifiable before banks will step in and act as an intermediary, said Anton Ruddenklau, partner and head of financial services at KPMG in Singapore.</p><p> \"Banks only want to be involved in projects that have got really strong governance, risk and control management. They don't want to be involved in things that are somewhat flaky,\" he said. </p><p> \"With some of the frauds and the scams and the poorly conceived projects, the banks will say the jury is out. So they'll be looking for really good evidence on verification -- some type of rating or some type of feasibility and ground truth around the carbon credits that can be generated,\" he added. </p><p> That being said, banks' participation in the sector could help accelerate the development of a more robust ecosystem in South-east Asia, said Lee Bing Yi, a partner specialising in financial services assurance, sustainability and climate change at PwC.</p><p> This would ultimately benefit the region, which is home to a huge potential supply of carbon credits due to its rich natural carbon sinks and renewable energy sources. </p><p> \"However, this development will take time as the necessary regulatory frameworks for carbon trading gradually develop and mature,\" said Lee. </p><p> Edwin Seah, lead for the non-profit group Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solutions Coalition, also believes that local banks entering carbon markets is a positive development, and is an indication of their confidence in the growth potential. </p><p> \"Banks provide a level of credibility and assurance, which could help further build credibility and demand in carbon credits generated from high-quality nature-based solutions projects in the region. These developments should support the growth of carbon markets and contribute to rebuilding trust, confidence, and integrity within them,\" he said. </p><p> Despite the lack of demand in credits and credibility concerns on their supply, banks here see the need to build up the capabilities in this space first, so that they are able to quickly take advantage of the opportunities that may arise if the market eventually does turn the corner. </p><p> So while banks are interested, the onus is on the developers, verifiers and standard setters to give financial intermediaries that assurance. </p><p> \"They want to see the numbers. They want to see the controls and the quality in the governance. And they want evidence that these things will produce what they need to, and then they will be 'game on',\" said Ruddenklau. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ultimately, ensuring that carbon credits generated and sold are of high quality is what will eventually reverse the fortune of the market, observers say.

The country also has similar pacts with Bhutan, Ghana and Papua New Guinea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Under the Paris Agreement, countries can buy carbon credits generated in other jurisdictions to meet domestic climate targets. </p><p> One carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that is either removed from the atmosphere, such as through a restoration project, or prevented from being released, such as when a forest is saved from the axe. Buyers of carbon credits can include countries or companies. </p><p>Singapore has indicated that it plans to use such credits to meet its climate change targets, although it has not yet purchased any offsets. </p><p> Credits used to offset national emissions can be purchased only from carbon projects in countries that Singapore has bilateral pacts with. </p><p> At the same time, carbon tax-liable companies here can also buy carbon credits from projects in these partner countries to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. </p><p> The pact between Singapore and Peru was signed virtually by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Peruvian Environment Minister Juan Carlos Castro Vargas.</p><p> In a statement, Mr Castro noted that Peru is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, home to vast Amazon and Andean forests that play a crucial role in stabilising the global climate. </p><p> \"The implementation agreement between Peru and Singapore underscores our shared dedication to fostering high-integrity carbon markets as a tool to achieve our ambitious climate goals, protect our natural resources and support local communities,\" he said. </p><p> The Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement on April 1 that under this pact, the carbon projects in Peru will promote sustainable development and deliver tangible benefits to local communities, such as creating jobs, improving access to clean water and energy security, and reducing environmental pollution. </p><p>Singapore has also agreed to voluntarily contribute 5 per cent of proceeds from the carbon credits it purchases to help Peru finance ways to reduce the impact of climate change. In the pact with Bhutan, for example, the 5 per cent will go to the country's heat management measures and climate-resilient agriculture. </p><p> There are two main types of carbon credits -- nature-based ones and technological ones, such as switching from pollutive firewood to cleaner cookstoves. Nature-based credits could come from projects such as forest restoration and conservation, as well as sustainable agriculture.</p><p> News of the signing of the implementation agreement between Singapore and Peru comes as the Republic looks to buy its first set of nature-based carbon offsets to meet its 2030 climate change target. </p><p> The Government had in September 2024 called on carbon project developers and credit suppliers to propose nature-based projects that can deliver at least 500,000 credits each. </p><p> This request for proposal drew 17 submissions before it closed in mid-February. It is not immediately clear whether any of the submissions included proposals to purchase carbon credits from projects in Peru. </p><p> Of the three other implementation agreements that Singapore has, most progress has been made with Ghana. </p><p> In September 2024, Singapore and Ghana called for project developers to submit applications for their carbon credit projects in Ghana to be authorised. These applications are now being assessed. </p><p> A Singapore Government spokesperson told The Straits Times that some possible project types that may be authorised in Ghana are related to clean water supply and clean cooking. </p><p> The Republic is also progressing on negotiations with more than 15 other countries on this front, in the hope of advancing those partnerships into implementation agreements. These include Malaysia, Cambodia and Colombia.</p><p> Dr Kim Jeong Won, a senior research fellow at the NUS Energy Studies Institute, said it is quite likely that high-quality nature-based projects will emerge from the Peru-Singapore pact.</p><p> Possible projects could be related to rainforest restoration and the conservation of watersheds -- land areas where rainwater drains into a final lake or river -- given that Peru has been recently leveraging nature to address water scarcity and climate resilience issues, she said.</p><p> But successful nature-based projects need stringent measures and environmental and social safeguards, she cautioned. </p><p> \"Poorly planned nature-based solutions may have adverse impacts on ecosystems and human communities, as well as exacerbate climate change by releasing more carbon than sequestering -- harming indigenous species, and displacing local residents,\" added Dr Kim. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The implementation agreement between Singapore and Peru was signed virtually by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Peru's Environment Minister Juan Carlos Castro Vargas on April 1.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.</p><p> Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.</p><p> Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.</p><p> Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.</p><p> With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.</p><p> Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.</p><p> Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub. \"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.</p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.</p><p> Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.</p><p> In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.</p><p> Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.</p><p> While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.</p><p> Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.</p><p> For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.</p><p> Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.</p><p> Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.</p><p> One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.</p><p> This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.</p><p> Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.</p><p> Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.</p><p> \"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.</p><p> Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.</p><p> The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.</p><p> However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.</p><p> In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.</p><p> Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.</p><p> The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.</p><p> \"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mangrove trees on Singapore's Semakau island; beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers say.

Why are investors hesitant, and what needs to be done to get climate-aware investing into the mainstream'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  We have witnessed continuous improvement and strong efforts to transition our global economies to a net-zero future. According to the International Energy Agency, last year's global investments in clean energy were around double the amount going into fossil fuels. Ten years ago, fossil fuel investments were about 20 per cent larger than clean energy investments. Meanwhile, India is projected to achieve a major milestone in 2025, with renewable electricity providing for more than half of the country's power capacity, while China added more renewable power capacity in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notwithstanding this, current investment flows are still insufficient to allow us to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, complexities in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape have understandably made investors more cautious in recent times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Importantly, sustainable investing is not a short-term but a structural trend. Climate risk is increasingly recognised as a major driver of financial risk. Hence, most major investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their overall decision process.</p><p> Encouragingly, Asian regulators are stepping up. Across the region, many policies and regulations have been put in place that create an enabling environment, which supports climate action and related financing flows. This includes green and transition taxonomies and ESG disclosure standards.</p><p> These developments bolster investor confidence and embed greater transparency in sustainable investing -- important steps in shifting these financing flows into the mainstream.</p><p> More work needs to be done. For instance, there is some ambiguity around what qualifies as transition and transition finance. The vast majority of assets and economic activities globally and in Asia are not yet green, and DBS believes it is critical to also allocate capital to support their transition to becoming greener. Beyond financing those assets and activities, transition finance can also help companies transform their entire businesses, all of which will contribute to the greening of the entire economy.</p><p> We see progress across the region on several fronts. Localised taxonomies are evolving to reflect regional contexts and developmental needs. Markets like Singapore are evolving disclosure rules and incentives for credible transition finance.</p><p> At DBS, we have observed growing sophistication in how capital is being deployed. For instance, we saw strong investor appetite for two green bonds DBS brought to the market recently. The first was the issuance of Equinix's S$500 million green bond in March 2025, its first Singapore dollar issuance.</p><p> The second was Asia's first public sustainability-linked securities offering by ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in January 2024. Both bonds were meaningfully oversubscribed, signalling growing investor demand for credible climate instruments.</p><p>  Investors' hesitation around sustainable or climate-aware investing, despite growing interest, often stems from structural challenges and other key concerns.</p><p> For example, the lack of standardisation and transparency in how ESG factors are assessed and reported. Without consistent metrics, it becomes difficult for investors to compare ESG investment products and evaluate their true impact. Additionally, some investors are concerned that corporates and governments may scale back their climate commitments which affect the short-term viability of such investments.</p><p> At UOB Asset Management, we view ESG integration as a strategic tool for value creation and risk mitigation. By embedding ESG considerations into our investment process, we aim to support long-term sustainability for our investees and their businesses. We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p>  One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns. In addition, some investors may be hesitant given concerns about low-quality ESG data, greenwashing, as well as the perceived trade-off between sustainability and returns.</p><p> While interest in sustainable investment may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments and the geopolitical context, we believe that the overarching trend towards investments that take ESG factors and risks into consideration is here to stay. The challenges of sustainable investment are also being actively addressed.</p><p> Collaboration between stakeholders -- asset managers, data providers and regulatory bodies -- is paving the way for more standardisation in reporting frameworks and taxonomies, which will help mitigate concerns on data quality and greenwashing. Meanwhile, leading financial institutions are developing diverse and accessible products catering to varying preferences and risks appetites, and -- over time -- are also showing that sustainable investments can deliver required returns.</p><p> Sometimes, enabling investors with information can also make a big difference in mainstreaming sustainable investing. Take, for example, the OCBC Sustainability Hub, launched in 2024.</p><p> The innovative platform empowers investors with a personal ESG rating, enabling them to track, understand and act on their investments, and to make informed financial decisions.</p><p> Within just six months of its launch, the Sustainability Hub achieved a 2.3x year-on-year increase in sustainability-themed investments.</p><p>  What do you see as the most promising areas of investments for corporates and individuals that will address climate risks and reap a return'</p><p>  The business case for climate-aligned investing remains robust particularly in Asia, where climate risk is acute, economic growth is rapid, and the green transition is gaining momentum.</p><p> We see strong opportunities emerging across several areas that offer both meaningful climate impact and attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p> One such area is energy. Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption.</p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.</p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions.</p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p> For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls.</p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p>  Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p>  In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors.</p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals.</p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Plugging the funding gap to mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help'</p><p> Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting.</p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments.</p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.</p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia.</p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital.</p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy.</p><p>  There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors.</p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation.</p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows.</p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p> As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects.</p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation.</p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion.</p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles.</p><p> This supplement was first published in The Business Times on June 5.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-5QIT4S7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G0F-4KF3-RRMP-9374-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Two standout initiatives-Scentian Bio's VOC maturity assessment and the Biochar Field Trial 2024-already show promising results and potential long-term impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scentian Bio's pilot transforms traditional fruit maturity testing, which is typically slow and labour-intensive. Instead, the company is developing biosensors inspired by insect olfactory systems to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by ripening kiwifruit. The technology, paired with AI models, enables fast, accurate, and non-destructive maturity assessment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We see this as a game-changer,' says Jiunn Shih, Zespri's Global Chief Marketing, Innovation &amp; Sustainability Officer, in an email to e27. 'Growers can make more informed decisions, increase productivity, and deliver fruit at peak ripeness-while reducing post-harvest waste.'</p><p>Beyond operational efficiency, this innovation supports sustainability by improving harvest timing and resource use across the supply chain.</p><p>The Biochar Field Trial 2024 by M.B. Horticulture Ltd is another key climate tech initiative. It explores using biochar-a carbon-rich material made from organic waste-to enhance soil health, increase productivity, and store carbon in kiwifruit orchards.</p><p>'Think of it as a nutrient battery,' says Shih. 'Biochar improves nutrient retention, reduces leaching, and supports long-term soil vitality, while locking carbon in the soil for hundreds of years.'</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/wavemaker-impact-invests-in-zentide-to-scale-sustainable-seaweed-based-agriculture-20250304/\">Wavemaker Impact invests in Zentide to scale sustainable seaweed-based agriculture</url></p><p>Although biochar has been trialled in other crops, its use in perennial vines such as kiwifruit remains limited. This project offers growers practical, evidence-based guidance for adopting the method.</p><p>Early results are positive, highlighting environmental and economic benefits that align with Zespri's broader sustainability goals.</p><p>'These pilots give our growers the confidence to adopt practices that strengthen orchard resilience and deliver climate-positive outcomes,' adds Shih.</p><p>Through ZAG, Zespri is proving how climate tech and sustainability-focused innovation can future-proof agriculture and deliver lasting value to growers and the planet. In this interview, find out more about how they are doing it and what insight they can share about the climate and agritech sector.</p><p>The following is an edited excerpt of the conversation.</p><p>What are some of the most compelling agri- and climate-tech trends you see emerge across the Asia Pacific region? How do you plan to seize this opportunity?</p><p>In recent seasons, we have seen the impact of climate change more clearly through our growing systems and around the world. Working with solution providers, ZAG is focused on creating solutions that will help create sustainable, long-term value for our growers. These initiatives will examine how we can enhance productivity while caring for the land, enabling it to grow sustainably.</p><p>Agri- and climate-tech are booming, and there will be more developments in these sectors as we move forward in 2025. Precision agriculture is becoming more accessible, not just for large-scale farms but increasingly for smallholders too. At the same time, we are seeing a surge in nature-based solutions-agroforestry, soil carbon capture, water-efficient systems-all aligned with food security and decarbonisation goals.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/how-biotech-is-changing-the-global-agriculture-game-for-investors-20211202/\">How biotech is changing the global agriculture game for investors</url></p><p>Therefore, with ZAG, we plan to use these emerging technologies to tackle some of the industry's biggest sustainability challenges, such as automation, big-data value extraction, soil regeneration, supply chain optimisation, and packaging.</p><p>For instance, Zespri is collaborating with M.B. Horticulture on a biochar field trial, which explores the application of biochar as a stable form of carbon storage in kiwifruit orchards. Biochar has the potential to enhance soil health and productivity, directly contributing to Zespri's climate-positive goals. The ZAG fund is providing an opportunity for innovative new ideas, like using biochar in kiwifruit orchards, to be tested on a small scale to evaluate whether more in-depth work is warranted.</p><p>In essence, ZAG is a strategic investment to foster innovations that directly contribute to reducing Zespri's environmental footprint.</p><p>How do you see the intersection of data, automation, and sustainability shaping the future of food production in this region?</p><p>The intersection of data, automation, and sustainability is becoming the backbone of the next-generation food system in Asia Pacific. Data enables traceability and transparency across the entire value chain, from soil to shelf. That is critical, especially as consumers, regulators, and partners demand greater accountability around environmental and social impact. Automation is helping address labour shortages and increase operational efficiency, while reducing inputs like water, energy, and chemicals.</p><p>We are already seeing this come to life through the ventures we have supported via ZAG. Scentian Bio, for instance, is a pioneering initiative using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to transform kiwifruit maturity assessment. By replacing labour-intensive and time-consuming methods, this innovation could reduce operational inefficiencies and enhance supply chain planning. Growers could benefit from improved productivity and better decision-making, while customers and consumers receive consistently high-quality fruit delivered at peak ripeness.</p><p>How is climate change influencing how growers and producers in Asia Pacific adopt new technologies, particularly in sustainability and crop resilience?</p><p>Climate change is not just a future threat in Asia Pacific. It is a present reality globally, and growers across the region are already feeling the impact.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/agriaku-raises-seed-funding-round-led-by-arise-to-tap-into-indonesias-agriculture-market-20211221/\">Agriaku raises seed funding round led by Arise to tap into Indonesia's agriculture market</url></p><p>As we transition into the second year of ZAG, we are committed to not just maintaining the momentum we have had, but also amplifying our impact. The next phase will focus on strengthening climate resilience across food systems by advancing productivity and carbon-positive practices. By leveraging the successes and learnings from our first year, the next stage of ZAG aims to accelerate sustainable innovations that benefit the environment, communities, and people as we meet the growing demand for kiwifruit.</p><p>While our core priorities remain the same-strengthening climate resilience across food systems and creating solutions that advance productivity and carbon-positive practices-we are always open to exploring new partnerships that align with global and regional advancements in sustainability.</p><p>What are some key challenges agritech founders face in Asia Pacific, and how is ZAG helping them navigate these?</p><p>As with many in agriculture, we operate in a dynamic environment that drives us to innovate, adapt, and build greater resilience for the future. From climate change and increasing labour and input costs to the pressing need to boost productivity, these realities are why innovation is no longer optional; it is essential.</p><p>One of the most common hurdles for agritech startups in Asia Pacific is proving the commercial viability of their innovations. Many have strong ideas and prototypes, but limited access to funding or commercial environments to test them in real-world settings.</p><p>ZAG helps bridge this gap by funding pilot projects and proof-of-concept trials without taking equity. We offer startups direct access to Zespri's grower network, allowing them to validate their solutions in-market. If the technology proves successful, we will support scale-up efforts across our global supply chain.</p><p>This approach reduces early-stage risk for founders while helping Zespri explore innovations that could potentially create meaningful enhancements to sustainability and efficiency across orchards and operations.</p><p>[Another challenge is] climate change, which already impacts the kiwifruit industry. For Zespri, kiwifruit cultivation is highly dependent on specific climate conditions, wherein our kiwifruit needs around 1,000 hours of winter chill between two and four degrees Celsius.</p><p>Historically, New Zealand could reliably provide that. But today, we see increased climate variability, impacting flowering, bud break, and fruit development. More recently, we have experienced more extreme weather events.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-green-tech-wave-southeast-asias-agritech-stars-shine-bright-20250324/\">SEA's US$48B agritech revolution: Startups cultivating a smarter future</url></p><p>ZAG actively seeks solutions that help us and our growers adapt to these shifting conditions through orchard innovations, climate-resilient crop strategies, or technologies that improve planning and risk management.</p><p>By working with innovators worldwide, we are tackling these challenges head-on with a future-focused mindset. We are not only interested in solving problems for today; we're investing in resilience for tomorrow.</p><p>The ZAG Innovation Fund connects bold ideas with the infrastructure, expertise, and credibility needed to scale in Asia Pacific's unique agri-environment. We are not just funding pilots, we are building bridges between founders, growers, and global opportunities.</p><p>Looking ahead, what role does Zespri's ZAG Innovation Fund hope to play in advancing the agriculture and climate tech ecosystem across Asia Pacific?</p><p>Looking ahead, ZAG aims to support the best solutions in the agriculture and climate tech ecosystems, regardless of where they originate. As a global business, Zespri works with more than 4,000 growers across New Zealand, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and France, while our kiwifruit is enjoyed in over 50 countries worldwide.</p><p>Since our  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/zespri-wants-to-work-with-agritech-innovators-to-improve-kiwifruit-production-and-distribution-20231207/\">launch in November 2023, ZAG has united innovators worldwide to harness the power of collaboration and combine their ingenious ideas with ours.

They published their research on Jan 9, in the journal Conservation Science And Practice.</p><p> Unagi is the Japanese word for freshwater eels, which are often consumed in East Asia as a grilled and glazed delicacy. High consumer demand for these eels, which belong to the family Anguillidae, have resulted in their being overfished. </p><p> There are about 19 species of freshwater eels, although it is mainly three species that are consumed in Singapore. </p><p> They include the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), European eel (Anguillaanguilla) and American eel (Anguilla rostrata), said the study's principal investigator, Mr Joshua Choo.</p><p> The European eel is critically endangered, while the other two are endangered. </p><p> For the study, Mr Choo -- a Yale-NUS environmental studies undergraduate at the time of the research -- and his team collected 266 freshwater eel meat samples from retailers and online shops that ship products to Singapore in July 2023.</p><p> The researchers then identified the species of eel in each product by extracting its DNA and comparing it against known genetic sequences of different eel species. </p><p> But instead of European eels, the researchers found that a large proportion of eels sold in stores here were American eels. </p><p> Among the 257 unagi products for which DNA was obtained, 217 (84.4 per cent) were identified as the American eel. </p><p> Another 36 samples (14 per cent) were of the Japanese eel, while only three samples were found to contain the European eel. </p><p> One sample turned out to be the pink cusk-eel, a saltwater species incorrectly labelled as unagi.</p><p> According to Mr Choo, this signals a worrying shift -- towards the American eel as a substitute for already depleted European eel stocks. He added that this cycle of exploitation, depletion, and moving on to another species is well-documented in the eel trade.</p><p> The Japanese eel had been the first target species for unagi dishes, but its overconsumption led to population decline, and consequently a rise in its cost.</p><p> But now that population numbers of the European eel are plummeting too, industry preferences are shifting once again to the American eel populations. </p><p> Citing a different study, Mr Choo said: \"East Asia has been importing more and more American eels -- from two tonnes in 2004, to 53 tonnes in 2021 and 157 tonnes in 2022.\"</p><p> Mr Choo said young eels hatch in the open ocean, and swim to freshwater, where they mature into \"glass eels\", as they are known in this stage of their life cycle. </p><p> Subsequently, they change into elvers, yellow eels, then silver eels -- sexually mature adults -- that return to the open ocean to mate and spawn.</p><p> He said: \"The eels only mature and breed after encountering certain environmental conditions during migration -- a journey that is hard to simulate in captivity.\"</p><p> The youngest eels, known as leptocephali, also often die in captivity, Mr Choo said. </p><p> Farmers have thus turned to using wild-caught glass eels as broodstock, and raising them till they grow into yellow and silver eels -- which are then sold to retailers. As with silver eels, yellow eels -- which are the immature adult stage of eels -- are also seen as a delicacy.</p><p> As many are siphoned to aquaculture farms, fewer juvenile eels reach maturity in the wild, resulting in inadequate replacement rates.</p><p> The fishing pressure on these eels is exacerbated by their high value, and the ease of smuggling them, especially as juveniles.</p><p> According to Europol's estimates, the illegal glass eel trade rakes in profits of \"up to EUR3 billion (S$4.36 billion) in peak years\" -- more than that of the illegal arms trade, which generates between EUR125 million to EUR236 million each year, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p><p> Trafficked glass eels are also translucent and small, growing up to only 7cm in length. This makes them difficult to detect, and allows a large quantity of them to be transported at once.</p><p> Aside from fishing pressures, freshwater eels' migration to the ocean may also be impeded by other factors, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams, and changing ocean currents attributed to climate change.</p><p> Mr Choo suggested reducing the consumption of eel meat, or completely eliminating the fish from one's diet. </p><p> Local eel retailers have a role to play as well, said Mr Chester Gan, senior manager of conservation for oceans and nature-based solutions at the World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore.</p><p> He said: \"Making responsible food choices can be challenging for consumers when eel products lack clear labelling -- often missing key details like species, origin and production methods.</p><p> \"But by adopting clearer labelling and ensuring greater transparency in sourcing, they can empower consumers to make informed choices.\"</p><p> Mr Choo also emphasised a need for stronger transboundary cooperation, including efforts to list more endangered eel species on the Cites agreement -- a multilateral treaty to safeguard threatened species from international trade. </p><p> Currently, only the European eels are listed on Cites.</p><p> Mr Choo also said that more research is needed on other eel species, especially understudied tropical anguillid eels like the Celebes longfin eel (Anguilla celebesensis). </p><p> He said: \"The eel trade could expand its reach to include regional relatives to the American and European eel -- which are found in places like Malaysia and the Philippines. But yet there's still a lot that is unknown about them.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-TJH6BOJ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FFT-6463-RRMF-54NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"968\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Distinguished guests, speakers, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>2. Good afternoon, and welcome.</p><p>It is my pleasure to join you today for this seminar, jointly organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Banque de France, as part of the France-Singapore Joint Year of Sustainability (JYOS) - a year-long initiative to deepen collaboration between our two nations on this existential issue.</p><p>3. Since its launch in April 2024, Singapore and France have embarked on a series of collaborations across areas such as the circular economy, renewable energy and sustainable shipping.</p><p>4. Today, we are gathered to discuss what it means to build bridges between Climate and Nature in relation to finance.</p><p>After years of focused attention on addressing the issue of climate-related risk, there is increasing recognition that the loss and degradation of nature represents a similarly significant and interconnected challenge.</p><p>Balance</p><p>5. Apart from our joint commitment to sustainability, one thing that unites the people of Singapore and France is our love of food. And as all foodies will appreciate, a great sauce never happens by accident.</p><p>Whether it is a creamy hollandaise sauce or a rich laksa sauce, it is all about keeping the salt, fat, acid and heat in careful balance. If there is too much reduction or too little acidity, a sauce will break. This happens when the fat separates from the water and other ingredients, turning the sauce from a smooth liquid to something oily and curdled.</p><p>6. Our natural systems work the same way. Climate, biodiversity, forests, oceans, soil - these are not disparate elements, but interdependent units that work in concert to keep the system stable. Forests are crucial carbon sinks and also critical for sustaining biodiversity and maintaining soil health.</p><p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather can accelerate ecosystem loss, releasing stored carbon in a negative feedback loop.</p><p>7. Cooking is as much art as it is science. You don't need to get the balance of elements precisely right, as there is a range of tolerance where the ingredients will still come together beautifully.</p><p>Likewise, maintaining balance in an ecosystem is not about perfection, and more about keeping things within an acceptable range.</p><p>8. Unfortunately, our current trajectory will lead us out of that acceptable range. Last month, the Net Zero Banking Alliance voted to relax its rules to allow members to adopt a more flexible goal of keeping warming well below 2C, as opposed to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The fact is that average global temperatures have already exceeded 1.5C last year.</p><p>9. The change in climate is a key driver of nature loss. Along with other human pressures like land conversion, pollution, and invasive species, ecosystems are degrading faster than they can recover - threatening food, water, and climate stability.</p><p>10. The risks arising from climate change and nature degradation are not academic theories - they are manifesting with increasing frequency and severity:</p><p>a. Last year, record ocean temperatures driven by climate change intensified Typhoon Yagi[1], contributing to heavier rainfall and higher storm surges, which resulted in close to 15 billion USD indamage across eight countries and territories in the region..</p><p>b. At the same time, sustained marine heatwaves triggered the fourth global coral bleaching event, affecting 77% of the world's coral reefs.[2] These events are happening with reduced recovery windows, undermining reef resilience and threatening the fisheries and coastal economies dependent on them.</p><p>NOAA confirms 4th global coral bleaching event. These events are happening with reduced recovery windows, undermining reef resilience and threatening the fisheries and coastal economies dependent on them.</p><p>11. Looking ahead, GDP losses in Asia Pacific are projected to reach 16.9% by 2070 under a high emissions scenario, according to the Asian Development Bank.[3] While there still is a cone of uncertainty in relation to final outcomes, the direction of travel is clear. Financial institutions must be adequately prepared. To be clear, this is about risk management, not altruism or corporate social responsibility.</p><p>Challenge of Addressing Nature Risk</p><p>12. In 2020, the MAS issued a set of Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM). These guidelines will shortly be complemented with additional guidance on transition planning that we had earlier consulted on.</p><p>13. Despite references to risks beyond climate, we have taken a climate-first approach as the understanding of best practices to address nature risk is still developing. Singapore-based FIs have made meaningful progress in integrating climate-related risk into their risk management frameworks.</p><p>14. In contrast, most financial institutions are still at an early stage of systematically measuring and addressing nature-related risks. This is due to the complexity and diversity of ecosystem services - such as water, pollination, and soil health. FIs have to consider all these elements from a dependency and impact lens as part of their risk assessment.</p><p>15. For climate-related risk, a single CO metric - despite all its limitations as a point-in-time measure - allows different stakeholders to have a common point of reference. Measuring nature is much more complicated. One study suggests that up to 3,000 distinct ecosystem services may need classification for effective economic modelling.[4]</p><p>16. Nonetheless, we draw inspiration from Victor Hugo, who said that \"perseverance (is the) secret of all triumphs\". European FIs - and notably French institutions - are among the most advanced in integrating nature-related considerations into their governance, risk management frameworks, and disclosures. We have much to learn from them.</p><p>17. Singapore is also moving forward. Last month, the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) released a whitepaper entitled \"Financing Our Natural Capital\" to help FIs in Singapore and the region address nature-related risks and opportunities. The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks and tools to the region. This enables FIs to identify sectors with material nature impact and dependencies in their portfolios; and take practical steps to incorporate nature into their business activities. MAS will continue to support the financial sector, through the SSFA, in building capacity to address nature-related risks and unlock financing opportunities.</p><p>18. I also commend the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) - in particular its Taskforce on Nature-related Risks - for developing scenarios for nature-related financial risks[5] and guiding the actions of central banks and supervisors through a conceptual framework[6]. MAS has had the privilege of working alongside Banque de France on several NGFS initiatives, and we look forward to our continued collaboration.</p><p>Carbon Markets a stabilising force</p><p>19. As financial institutions address these risks by adjusting portfolios, engaging clients, and enhancing risk assessments, carbon markets can serve as an additional lever to motivate firms to take action and allow parties to better hedge exposures.</p><p>20.From a climate angle, carbon markets provide a price signal for emissions and allow firms to invest in mitigation beyond their immediate operations, even as they work toward internal abatement. From a nature angle, credits from nature-based solutions - such as reforestation, peatland restoration, or mangrove conservation - offer a way to finance conservation at scale. Done well, these projects can deliver both climate mitigation and biodiversity benefits.</p><p>21. Demand for high-quality carbon credits is expected to grow. By some estimates, global voluntary carbon markets could grow to 1 trillion USD annually by 2050.[7] Much of that opportunity is right here in Southeast Asia, which is rich in nature resources, offering significant potential for carbon projects, such as forestation and blue carbon.</p><p>22. While challenges remain amid geopolitical volatility, we are confident in the medium-term growth potential of carbon markets. The finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing acceptance of carbon credits by governments, can lend credence and renew confidence in international carbon markets.</p><p>23. Well-functioning carbon markets complement the decarbonisation efforts of firms, while channelling capital into sustainable and often nature-positive projects. They can serve as a stabilizing force, strengthening the delicate balance between climate and nature.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>24. In conclusion, just as a great chef watches the sauce, a wise society watches the planet.</p><p>25. A chef does not wait for a sauce to break before taking action. Likewise, we cannot wait for ecosystems to collapse before we act. We are already seeing the early signs of deterioration and should not take false comfort that the tipping points have not been breached. A sauce that breaks can be saved in certain circumstances, but not always - so prevention is the better path.</p><p>26. Do we continue to stir the sauce and lament that it is difficult to do anything differently? Or do we recognise the risks and take active steps to maintain the delicate balance that we may have taken for granted? Carbon markets will be part of the solution to support the coming transition, and we need more good ideas and courage if we are to make this transition well.</p><p>27. Today's panels will delve deeper into these critical issues. We believe that by working together, we can move beyond short-termism and create a system that is stable, sustainable, and built to last.</p><p>28.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub.\"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. </p><p>So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus\u00c2\u00a0resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.\"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.\"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:697T-88G1-JCF2-817V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

In addition to the informative panels, there are also interactive panels, where users can play mini games or vote on which animal they feel is most threatened in the rainforest.</p><p> There is also an activity zone where users can write messages about nature or the rainforest. </p><p> CDL reached out to Kong Man Jing, also known by her online persona Biogirl MJ, as a programme partner for the EcoTrain.</p><p> Kong, founder of science and sustainability social media platform Just Keep Thinking, said: \"The objective was to gamify learning so that it's fun and exciting for kids.\"</p><p> She added: \"South-east Asian rainforests are often overlooked, so we wanted to put more spotlight on that. And we have forests in Singapore, but people don't know about it. So we wanted to showcase the forest ecosystem in Singapore, and try to make it fun.\"</p><p> On weekends, children and young people can sign up for free workshops conducted by Just Keep Thinking in a classroom setting at the back of the train. </p><p> Kong said: \"Children can participate in activities like crafting with recycled materials, identifying native species and understanding the importance of conservation through interactive games.\"</p><p> The last few panels in the EcoTrain focus on how people can contribute to conserving and saving the rainforest, by raising awareness or making sustainable choices. She added: \"Education transforms abstract statistics into relatable stories, empowering the younger generation to recognise the impact of their choices.\"</p><p> After completing all the stages, users receive a QR code, which they can scan on a gacha machine to receive an EcoTrain pin. </p><p> The EcoTrain was repurposed from a decommissioned SMRT train cabin. It has eco-friendly features, such as solar panels, rubber flooring and is built from low-carbon materials.</p><p> Esther An, chief sustainability officer of CDL, said the group decided to repurpose the old train cabin \"for circularity and to reduce waste -- otherwise all this metal will become waste\".</p><p> This is part of the Land Transport Authority's upcycling initiative to repurpose decommissioned train cabins.</p><p> A forest in the heart of the cityIn line with the EcoTrain's rainforest theme, CDL also launched a regenerative tropical MicroForest outside City Square Mall. </p><p> Kong said: \"This living exhibit showcases native flora, offering visitors a tangible connection to rainforest vegetation and the benefits of urban greening... It is a project that we can use to teach people the importance of innovative measures that are suited for Singapore's landscape and climate.\"</p><p> The MicroForest spans 2,800 square feet and was developed in collaboration with professors from the National University of Singapore, with input from the National Parks Board.</p><p> An said: \"How can we use nature-based solutions to cool the temperature? When you cool the temperature, you reduce the use of energy and air conditioning, and that is how we decarbonise.\"</p><p> CDL chose to build the MicroForest in an urban setting, so that it could have an impact in the city -- where there is a lack of forests.</p><p> \"If you build a forest in a faraway suburb -- in our case, Mandai or Choa Chu Kang -- it doesn't help to cool urban spaces. So what we wanted to do is to bring the forest to urban spaces. We were lucky that in December 2024, City Square Mall was at the tail end of a major asset enhancement initiative,\" she added. </p><p> The MicroForest was built within three months. Trees that contribute to biodiversity were conserved, and native species were planted. Native species are well-adapted to local climate conditions and help to maintain biodiversity.</p><p> \"Within three months, we built the MicroForest because of how urgent the climate crisis is -- we couldn't wait,\" An said.</p><p> Sensors to measure factors such as temperature and humidity were added to the MicroForest, as well as outside the EcoTrain. </p><p> These compare the forest environment versus an urban setting, to observe the impact of the MicroForest.</p><p>  \"This is a very research-driven initiative -- not just for beauty or aesthetics. Once we have the data, we can scale up,\" she added.</p><p> An hopes to one day see more MicroForests in both residential and commercial developments.</p><p> She said: \"The most important thing is you plant it where it matters. It can create an impact on urban spaces. How do you bring it to the high-density city to improve thermal comfort, air quality and biodiversity'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Left: At the EcoTrain, visitors can play a game to learn more about rainforests.

That experience sparked emotions which I've come to understand as \"eco-anxiety\" -- a deep sense of distress at the environmental devastation we are witnessing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This eventually let me to start WorkWell Leaders, a leadership-focused charity advocating for well-being and sustainable growth in the workplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I was able to channel my anxiety into action, but many might not be so lucky. Studies show that eco-anxiety is rising, particularly among young people. Social media amplifies this distress, making it feel as if the future is already beyond repair. Those with eco-anxiety often experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and report lower overall mental well-being. The stress of knowing what is happening to our planet can breed powerlessness and even apathy.</p><p> A young woman I know had to quit her job due to eco-anxiety, coupled with the guilt of complicity in \"greenwashing\" -- conveying a false impression that a company's products are environmentally sound -- at one of the top employers in Singapore. \"I was feeling more and more depressed, and dreaded going to work every day,\" she said. </p><p> She is not alone. More than a few young working adults have reached out to me in recent times to share how conflicted and in despair they felt working for companies that simply did not care about the climate crisis. This inevitably leads to presenteeism -- physically present but mentally absent -- and quiet quitting.  </p><p> Yet, the dual crises of mental health and climate change have long been viewed as separate challenges. As we gain a deeper understanding, it becomes clear that they are intricately interconnected. Mental health, once sidelined, is now receiving the attention it deserves. Similarly, climate change is not just an environmental issue but a public health and humanitarian emergency.</p><p> As both of these crises intensify, we must approach them not as isolated issues, but as two sides of the same coin. Initiatives including the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and the Green Plan 2030 are a step in the right direction as mental well-being is being introduced in climate resilience discussions, and vice versa, but Singapore must do more in this nexus of climate change and mental health.</p><p> Integrating mental health, climate approaches We cannot build resilient societies without addressing the trauma and displacement caused by climate change, nor can we create a healthy environment without a mentally healthy population. </p><p> As such, we must deal with the two biggest crises of our time in concert, not in silos. </p><p> However, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) under the Prime Minister's Office does not include the Ministry of Health, which leads the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in 2024 to tackle mental health, now recognised as a significant health and social issue. </p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health Office (NMHO) -- to be fully established in 2025 -- is co-led by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and comprises officers from the ministries of Education and Manpower -- but notably without any representation from the environment and sustainability agencies. </p><p> What are we missing here? With mental health a national priority and climate change an existential threat, the absence of integration in these national organisations creates a critical gap. </p><p>Singapore may not have to contend with the severe psychological impact of frequent natural disasters and climate-related migration that other countries are dealing with. However, rising temperatures and its mental health impact -- such as heat stress, especially for rental flat households and essential workers -- must be urgently considered. Some studies have found that a rise in temperature is associated with aggressive behaviour and suicidality. </p><p> The rise of eco-anxiety, particularly among Singapore's youth, also highlights the urgency of this cross collaboration and representation in NCCS and NMHO. A group of young people I spoke with at a university questioned whether it would be even responsible of them to bring children into a world grappling with climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Such significant attitudinal changes could have far-reaching implications for Singapore's policies, particularly in areas such as public health, social development and economic sustainability. </p><p> It is also important to note that climate change doesn't just affect mental health -- it can also be worsened by poor mental health. When people are struggling with their mental health, they may feel overwhelmed, helpless or disconnected, making it more difficult for them to engage in proactive measures to address climate issues.</p><p> By ensuring that climate policies include mental health considerations, and vice versa, we can better support vulnerable populations and equip individuals with the resilience, motivation, and hope to confront climate challenges. </p><p> As well, the intersection of climate change and mental health presents new opportunities for research, policy and practice. This could include integrating mental health support into climate adaptation plans, extending climate finance to mental health services, and fostering community-led initiatives and creative approaches to address climate-induced stress. </p><p> How to survive and thrive'Mental health has worsened in Singapore since 2020, according to the Ministry of Health's National Population Health survey. Singaporeans have identified mental health as the biggest health problem, surpassing concerns about cancer and diabetes. Worryingly, one in three between the ages of 15 and 35 experiences severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.</p><p> Experts found that youth mental well-being depends on connections in their social and environmental contexts. It's no wonder these same experts warn that the price of climate inaction will be the mental health of young people. </p><p> We must build environments where individuals can thrive, not just survive. Healing happens in ecosystems of care -- not in isolation. Such an ecosystem ranges from workplaces that prioritise psychological safety to schools that nurture emotional intelligence, to policies that embed mental health into broader social systems.</p><p> In this way, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy was a significant step towards addressing the crisis here, moving beyond crisis intervention to a full spectrum of care: prevention, early intervention, resilience-building, and community-based well-being.</p><p> The link between community well-being and nature is especially crucial in urban settings like Singapore, where green spaces play a vital role in fostering mental health and social cohesion. Shared experiences in nature can strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of community. As climate change threatens the environment, these natural spaces are at risk. When nature is degraded, not only is the physical environment compromised, but the mental and emotional resilience of the community is also weakened. </p><p> While working towards creating thriving individuals and communities, we must also focus on ensuring a thriving planet. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for over 50 per cent of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In Singapore, we are experiencing rising sea levels, extreme heat and climate-related health risks. A deteriorating natural environment undermines efforts to foster mental and emotional resilience. So protecting our ecosystems is not just about preserving biodiversity, but safeguarding the mental health of our future generations. </p><p> Reasons for hopeI was delighted when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched in 2021 included the creation of spaces that promote mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance resilience.</p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy includes nature-based solutions, such as creating 30 therapeutic gardens across Singapore by 2030. These spaces will provide restorative environments for people with conditions like ADHD and dementia. </p><p> Furthermore, building codes now prioritise occupant well-being, with the Green Mark certification scheme and the Building Control Act playing key roles in promoting healthy, sustainable buildings.</p><p> And more recently, the Mercury Taskforce, comprising 37 public agencies led by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and National Environment Agency, announced the first National Heatwave Response Plan for Singapore. </p><p> The intersection of mental health and sustainability within environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks is increasingly critical for businesses. Investors are placing greater emphasis on companies that prioritise not only environmental sustainability but also the well-being of their employees and communities. </p><p> Healing from eco-anxietyThe way we treat our planet mirrors the way we treat ourselves. A world that exhausts its natural resources is the same world that exhausts its people. The burnout we feel individually is a reflection of the unsustainable systems we have created. If we want to heal the planet, we must also heal ourselves.</p><p> For me, healing has always come from nature. As a child, trees were my refuge from bullying. Thirty years later, amid a series of personal crises including a broken marriage, shattered career and financial ruin, I found myself hugging a tree again. And since then, I have hugged a tree every week after my regular run. </p><p> There's no single way forward, but there is hope in both individual and collective action. By building bridges between mental health professionals, environmentalists, policymakers, researchers and business and community leaders, we can create a future that is both sustainable and resilient for people and planet.</p><p> Anthea Ong is a former Nominated Member of Parliament, social entrepreneur, mental health advocate and author.

And the demand would not just be from companies looking to voluntarily offset their emissions, but also driven by compliance requirements set up by governments taking steps to fulfil their national climate targets, he added. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Concerns around the integrity of carbon projects are also being addressed, noted Conrad Kwok, head of forex derivatives, commodities and emissions reduction for global financial markets at DBS. </p><p> The adoption of global carbon trading rules at the United Nations COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, at the end of last year has renewed hopes that there will soon be a universal standard carbon projects must comply with to be seen as credible.</p><p> Under its transition finance framework, UOB is offering financing for clients developing carbon projects, or helping clients looking to purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions. </p><p> OCBC established an emissions trading desk in 2023 and is offering compliance and voluntary carbon credits as well as energy attribute certificates. </p><p> As for DBS, it provides trading and structuring capabilities for its clients not just for voluntary carbon credits, but also for companies that have to comply with the European Union's emission trading system, which is the world's largest carbon market. </p><p> DBS' Kwok added that its ability to buy and store carbon credits provides clients the flexibility to tailor their purchases and retirements according to their needs, compared with carbon exchanges and platforms that have fixed predetermined transaction sizes. </p><p> This would provide smaller businesses -- which may not have the scale to open accounts directly with exchanges, registries and platforms -- access to credits, he added. </p><p> These are some of the carbon credit-related products and services that banks have been adding to the suite of decarbonisation solutions for corporate clients, in addition to the more mainstream sustainable financing services, including sustainability-linked loans or green bonds. </p><p> The offerings by Singapore banks follow that of other global banks, such as Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Barclays, which have also been building up carbon trading and finance desks. HSBC, however, has abandoned plans to set up a similar team, according to a Bloomberg report in November last year. </p><p> Getting a foot in While the size of the voluntary market is still small at US$1.4 billion according to index provider MSCI -- compared with the sustainable bond market which is approaching US$1 trillion -- banks that manage to get a foot in the door and build capabilities in this space will have created a competitive advantage for themselves as trusted intermediaries, said market watchers. </p><p> By offering services in this space, banks can position themselves as key players in the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as tap into a new and expanding asset class with significant long-term growth potential, said Edwin Seah, lead for the non-profit group Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solutions (Scene) Coalition. </p><p> Given that carbon projects and markets are complex, banks need to develop competencies in identifying and sourcing high-quality projects, as well as in risk management, noted Lee Bing Yi, a partner specialising in financial services assurance, sustainability and climate change at PwC. </p><p> Banks can also establish relationships with ecosystem players and position themselves to capture opportunities in offering carbon trading, hedging and structuring solutions for clients as the market evolves, he added. </p><p> It's not just about leveraging the opportunities arising from Singapore's aspirations to be a carbon services and trading hub. Financing and investing in carbon credits generated from nature-based solutions could help mitigate the impact of climate change in South-east Asia, said Anton Ruddenklau, partner and head of financial services at KPMG in Singapore.</p><p> South-east Asia's huge potential in unlocking revenues from carbon credits is well-known, given its abundant forest and coastal ecosystems. </p><p> \"There is a lot of validity in the fact that if you invest in nature and do that in the right way, there is a better, longer-term benefit to be had. But this is part of the challenge. We're still trying to work out what is the right set of pathways for net zero and transition,\" said Ruddenklau. </p><p> \"There's no debate that carbon credits will become much more valuable or viable in the future. But again, we're without any consistent standards and policies and without enough evidence that these work over a long period of time. We are very much iterating as we go,\" he added. </p><p> Risk managementGiven the lack of standardisation, liquidity and transparency of the market, Lee noted that carbon credits are subjected to permanence, leakage and additionality risks as well as policy and regulatory risks arising from evolving government regulations. </p><p> They also carry unique risks related to environmental outcomes, community impact, and long-term sustainability, unlike other asset classes, noted Seah. </p><p> Banks need to ensure thorough due diligence of both projects and developers, including ensuring that projects meet or even exceed existing carbon project standards and that the credits are priced in a way that reflects the true cost of developing high-quality projects, he added. </p><p> Although integrity concerns over carbon credits have not fully subsided, OCBC's Tan said that these are growing pains that are currently being worked out by the market. </p><p> \"Rather than abandoning carbon credits and similar mechanisms due to these challenges, the focus should be on improving their integrity through robust standards, enhanced verification processes, and greater transparency,\" he said. </p><p> Bonar Silalahi, head of sector solutions group at UOB, said that the bank conducts stringent reviews of carbon credits project design documents, and obtains independent validations by acceptable monitoring, reporting and verification auditors during the initial review and on an annual basis. </p><p> Auditors also would be required to confirm that the carbon credits are in line with best practices and recommendations from the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market. </p><p> \"As carbon markets continue to grow, we are monitoring the development of international standards and benchmarks for carbon credit issuance, monitoring, reporting and verification. Such standards will be instrumental in providing clear and objective guidelines on how credits are being measured,\" he added. </p><p> DBS' Kwok said that the bank includes reputable third parties, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X and carbon-credit rating agencies, into the decision-making process when assessing eligible registries and credits. </p><p> Ruddenklau added that banks would have to hire professionals with a combination of skill sets including science, economics, capital and regulation -- some of which are relatively new for financial services.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The adoption of global carbon trading rules at the United Nations COP29 climate summit last year has renewed hopes that there will soon be a universal standard carbon projects must comply with to be seen as credible.

Beyond the obvious problem that this arrangement does nothing to deter new emissions or preserve vital environmental systems by registering the costs of pollution or damage to biodiversity, it also means there is no immediate bottom-line return on investment in sustainable business practices.This poses a significant challenge when it comes to encouraging businesses to support nature-based solutions to address issues such as climate change, human health, food and water security, and reduce the risk of natural disasters by protecting, preserving, or restoring natural ecosystems.The connection between protecting the environment and saving costs is well established. A report published by the Nature Conservancy and others estimated that mangroves alone protect property from damage valued at US$82 billion each year, but in the short term, there is greater profit in cutting down the mangroves and using the land for fish farming or other agricultural production.Although the transition to a net-zero future will cost tens and possibly hundreds of trillions of dollars, the money seems to be available: The 450 firms which joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero in April 2021 between them manage US$130 trillion in assets, and many individual savers are starting to insist that their pensions schemes or college funds are invested in sustainable assets. </p><p>The problem is less a shortage of money than a shortage of projects that are both sustainable and bankable.The growing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if largely still voluntary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c market for carbon credits, driven by governments and companies like HSBC which have made fixed pledges to transition to carbon-neutral operations, is an encouraging development. These range from Gabon's recent offering of 90 million tonnes of sovereign carbon credits; to Norway's new agreement to pay Indonesia to preserve forests under the United Nation's REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) scheme; to more ambitious debt-for-nature swaps where creditors forgive debt in return for undertakings to preserve or expand natural assets.But all these schemes have struggled with definitional loopholes and enforcement issues. Climate-related agreements and financial instruments are still evolving, and there is no generally agreed consensus on terms or terminology. Various groupings in Europe, Asia and the Americas are working to come up with what is known as a \"taxonomy\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a framework that defines what is a green asset and what is not.This lack of consensus is limiting the expansion of the market for green bonds, many of which have a nature-based component, if only as a carbon offset. To be fair, the issues are complex. If a company is raising money to build a new factory and is promising to compensate for its carbon output by planting trees, is it going to plant millions of the same species and are those species native or not, either of which would be detrimental to biodiversity? What are they going to replace? Where is the water going to come from'The market is hungry for green financial products, many of which will have nature-based components, but until asset managers have the confidence that the funding will be used sustainably, they will be reluctant to commit at anything close to the scale we need to contain and reverse climate change.Clear taxonomies also hold the potential to unleash the power of central banks. Central banks, with their remit to preserve and enhance the long-term health of the economy, have a clear interest in limiting global warming.Ma Jun, a former member of the People's Bank of China monetary committee and current co-chair of the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, has suggested that central banks could increase green lending by offering commercial banks cheaper financing for their green loan book, and others have suggested offsetting green loans against reserve requirements.The profit from investing in strengthening natural systems is real, but rarely registers on our national or corporate balance sheets. But if we are to limit and eventually reverse our impact on the environment, we must find ways to mobilise the investment we need to preserve and enhance nature's powers.Kelvin Tan is head of sustainable finance and investments, Asean, at HSBC and board member of Pentagreen Capital.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The value of our natural environment does not appear as an asset on our national accounts or corporate balance sheets; nor does pollution or diminishing biodiversity appear as costs.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66NR-4721-JCF2-8000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This initiative, developed collaboratively by SC Ventures, Standard Chartered's fintech and innovation arm, and ENGIE Factory, the startup studio of French utility multinational ENGIE Group, promises to streamline investment processes in support of global climate goals.</p><p>Qatalyst's platform was incubated and developed in collaboration with carbon teams from both ENGIE and Standard Chartered. The goal is to simplify and expedite the identification, due diligence, and oversight of carbon abatement projects, thereby addressing longstanding inefficiencies in the sector.</p><p>As Poyan Rajamand, Venture Lead at SC Ventures, explains, 'Financiers currently face extensive due diligence requirements to ensure projects deliver the promised carbon impact. Qatalyst brings credibility to this market, enhancing funding opportunities.'</p><p>The platform leverages advanced technology, including AI-enabled tools, to provide investors with greater confidence in project outcomes. By integrating requirements from external registries, internal compliance needs, and evolving regulations, Qatalyst seeks to address the credibility gap that has long plagued the carbon finance market.</p><p>Addressing key pain points</p><p>Carbon abatement projects often suffer from fragmented workflows, prolonged documentation processes, and challenges in aligning with regulatory changes.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/urban-solutions-sustainability-take-centre-stage-at-smus-lkygbpc-startup-challenge-in-2025-20250114/\">Urban solutions, sustainability take centre stage at SMU's LKYGBPC startup challenge in 2025</url></p><p>Rajamand notes, 'A misconception exists that generating carbon credits from nature-based solutions simply requires allowing nature to grow. In reality, significant funding is needed to kickstart these projects.'</p><p>Qatalyst tackles these pain points by providing a streamlined digital environment where financiers and project developers can efficiently exchange information and make informed decisions.</p><p>This efficiency has already been demonstrated during the platform's development phase, where it enabled ENGIE and Standard Chartered to conduct evaluations in a fraction of the usual time. Such time savings open doors for financiers to consider smaller or unconventional projects previously deemed unfeasible due to resource constraints.</p><p>Rajamand highlights, 'As more financiers join, projects seeking funding will increasingly turn to Qatalyst, creating a virtuous cycle.'</p><p>A growing market for carbon offsets</p><p>The global carbon market is poised for substantial growth as awareness of climate challenges intensifies. Developing nations have significantly increased funding commitments to carbon projects, with figures tripling to US$300 billion.</p><p>Despite these positive signals, Rajamand acknowledges that challenges remain: 'The road ahead will be bumpy, but the signs point to a bright future for carbon markets.'</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/need-of-the-hour-how-agri-technologies-can-protect-farmers-from-climate-change-20210312/\">Need of the hour: How agritech platforms can protect farmers from climate change</url></p><p>The urgency to achieve 2030 climate targets is another driving factor. As the deadline approaches, reliance on carbon credits and offsets is expected to grow. 'Reducing carbon footprints will become increasingly challenging, making offsets a critical component of the transition,' Rajamand explains.</p><p>Qatalyst's inception and development underline the importance of collaboration in addressing complex global challenges.</p><p>Rajamand also highlights the role of digital strategies in scaling the platform's impact. As legislative and market awareness around carbon credits grows, Qatalyst is positioned to attract stakeholders through both traditional networks and digital outreach.</p><p>-</p><p>Image Credit: Qatalyst</p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/qatalyst-launch-20250114/\">SC Ventures, ENGIE Factory launch Qatalyst to transform carbon finance market appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/qatalyst-launch-20250114/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG11931453769962546125217200061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DWM-XGC3-RS4P-625V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>8:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Indonesia is also expected to strengthen electric vehicle (EV)-related ties with markets such as China, Japan and South Korea, so it can establish itself as an EV production hub.</p><p> Shilpa Gulrajani, head of sustainability at DBS' institutional banking group, said that Asia's decarbonisation pathway is distinct from that of other regions. Both public and private sector players -- including governments, financial institutions and businesses -- recognise the need to balance social, environmental and economic priorities.</p><p> Rahul Sheth, global head of sustainable bonds at Standard Chartered, expects ESG bond volumes in South-east Asia to remain robust, with issuers increasingly well-versed in ESG themes and labelling.</p><p> \"We expect issuers to continue to explore thematic formats such as blue bonds, orange bonds, transition bonds, as well as sustainability-linked loan financing bonds,\" he added. </p><p> Blue bonds are marine-related, while orange bonds have gender-based targets.</p><p> While market volatility is to be expected, issuers would likely seize pockets of stability to access the bond markets, said Sheth.</p><p> ESG bondsThe 46.1 per cent year-on-year growth of South-east Asia's ESG bond market outpaced both the global and Asia-Pacific ones. The global market increased 8.9 per cent to US$772.9 billion in 2024, while proceeds in Asia-Pacific rose 4.2 per cent to US$167.5 billion.</p><p> Green bonds remained the most popular ESG-labelled debt instrument in South-east Asia, with US$9.1 billion raised for the year.</p><p> There was a marked increase in funds raised through sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs), where interest rate payments are linked to the achievement of sustainability targets. Proceeds jumped to US$2.7 billion, almost 40 times the US$67.9 million recorded in 2023.</p><p> Sheth said SLBs made up 16 per cent of all of StanChart's ESG transactions. SLBs make up about 13.2 per cent of all labelled bonds issued in South-east Asia -- a much higher proportion than in the global market, where SLBs account for about 3.5 per cent.</p><p> This demonstrates continued interest in this format of financing, said Sheth.</p><p> \"What is interesting is that the SLB issuances in the region take place in a multitude of currencies, which shows the wide degree of acceptability and interest from the investor base in such structures,\" he added. </p><p> The main drivers of ESG bond volumes in 2024 were issuers from the Philippines and Singapore.</p><p> Sheth noted that these two markets saw a marked increase in ESG-labelled issuances, compared to other regional markets where volumes declined or remained constant. In Singapore, sovereign entities -- including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Housing and Development Board and national water agency PUB -- supported the increase in ESG-labelled bond issuances.</p><p> As for the Philippines, growing financing needs for renewable energy projects facilitated a larger volume of ESG bond issuances.</p><p> Besides sovereign issuers, financial institutions were also a notable group of issuers, contributing more than US$3 billion to ESG bond proceeds in the country between 2023 and 2024, said Sheth. </p><p> In 2024, the top bookrunners for ESG bond deals in South-east Asia were StanChart (US$3.5 billion), HSBC (US$1.7 billion) and Citi (US$1.4 billion).</p><p> ESG loansESG loan proceeds in South-east Asia tracked the global market, with the latter seeing loan issuances rise 24.5 per cent to US$703.5 billion in 2024. </p><p> However, South-east Asia's 27.2 per cent jump outperformed the wider Asia-Pacific region, where proceeds rose 12.2 per cent to US$120.5 billion.</p><p> One important factor is government regulation that requires companies to report sustainability disclosures, thus compelling them to decarbonise, said bankers.</p><p> DBS' Gulrajani said that corporates with a presence in the wider Asia-Pacific region have strengthened their sustainability goals and targets. </p><p> These companies came from various sectors, including real estate, energy, renewables and infrastructure, as well as financial institutions, she added.</p><p> There was a rise in transition financing among high-emitting industries in 2024, beyond the more conventional green financing structures, she noted.</p><p> OCBC's Tan identified another theme: incorporating elements of a just and inclusive transition. He noted growing interest in social loans, as well as integrating social key performance indicators -- such as gender equality, education, and support for smallholders -- in sustainability-linked loans (SLL).</p><p> The quality of SLL structures also improved, as companies set more material and ambitious sustainability performance targets, he added. These included addressing indirect emissions arising from a company's value chain, known as Scope 3 emissions.</p><p> Some companies are also going beyond standard carbon-reduction metrics to integrate broader sustainability goals such as biodiversity conservation and nature-based solutions into their financing frameworks, said Gulrajani. </p><p> More small and medium-sized enterprises are also showing more interest in sustainable finance as they face growing pressure from buyers, regulators, investors and stakeholders to transition their businesses, said Tan. </p><p> OCBC was the top arranger for ESG loans in South-east Asia in 2024, with US$6.1 billion raised. DBS came second at US$4.9 billion. UOB was third with US$4.8 billion raised.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-5MGED6S</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6B-C1K3-RRM7-F4XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1180\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The floods and mudslides killed more than 440 people, leaving thousands homeless and houses and infrastructure in ruins.</p><p> \"This is part of the new normal that a city like mine is going to have to deal with,\" said Dr Roberts in her keynote speech on Monday at SIWW on how climate change is affecting water systems.</p><p> Scientists believe the south-eastern coast of Africa is becoming more vulnerable to violent storms and floods as greenhouse gases are warming the Indian Ocean.</p><p> Dr Roberts, 61, co-chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Working Group 2, which released its major report in February. She highlighted the sobering implications that rising temperatures, sea-level rise and other indicators will have.</p><p> \"Our report shows very clearly that two-thirds of all adaptation is in response to water-related hazards,\" she said. Adaptation refers to implementing ways to reduce climate risks, such as building seawalls to keep out rising sea levels.</p><p> In an interview with The Straits Times yesterday on the sidelines of SIWW 2022, Dr Roberts noted that nature-based solutions play a key role in managing water-related impacts. For example, restoring floodplains and wetlands can help to reduce flood risks, as wetlands enable more natural water retention. Restoring mangroves will help mitigate climate change impacts with their ability to soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide.</p><p> But nature-based solutions will start to fall off the table as the temperature increases beyond the 1.5 deg C threshold, she warned.</p><p> Limiting warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels is a key goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p> \"By the time we reach global warming levels of 1.5 deg C, we will probably experience irreversible losses of warm water coral reefs and coastal wetlands, so they won't be able to play that (adaptation) role,\" she noted.</p><p> Moreover, poor planning can cause adaptation measures to backfire and spark other environmental issues, she warned. For example, sea walls at some coastal sites can cause coastal erosion further down the coastline.</p><p> She also emphasised that science and technology, and the knowledge of indigenous people should be brought together to tackle the climate crisis since those local communities know their land well.</p><p> Dr Roberts recounted how an Inuit hunter from Canada had noticed that an ice sheet was about to break off. However, satellite images did not spot anything wrong with the glacial ice.</p><p> \"But that ice sheet broke away. It's that combination of (having) people who understand their environment from the soles of their feet, (and using) sophisticated technology. That brings us to our best state of knowledge of the world.\"</p><p> She said putting together the just over 3,000-page Working Group 2 report was no small feat, with 270 scientists labouring over it for five years. It is the second of three that collectively make up the IPCC's sixth assessment report.</p><p> Dr Roberts hopes the three reports will communicate the urgency of finding different ways to make deep cuts in emissions, and raise climate justice and equity.</p><p> SIWW 2022 is being held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre until tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1040815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6588-H891-DYX4-01VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It uses data to generate new things, such as text, images or code. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Singapore, one of the first institutes of higher learning that embedded forms of AI, such as machine learning, in its curriculum is the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), which opened in 2009.</p><p> Established as Singapore's fourth public university, it aims to advance knowledge and nurture technically grounded leaders and innovators to serve societal needs with a focus on design and technology.</p><p> Professor Khoo Peng Beng, Head of Pillar at SUTD's School of Architecture and Sustainable Design, joined the university earlier in 2025. He says AI has light and dark sides -- such as job displacement and ethical uses -- that need to be rigorously addressed through the university's curriculum.</p><p> While the university is inventing AI systems of the future, it is also conducting research on the philosophy and ethics of AI, called \"Design AI\". This is an intentional approach, as it is widely accepted that AI and human intelligence are partners in innovation. </p><p> \"As newer technologies like AI evolve, we have to increasingly sharpen our ability to discern what is good, what is the truth and what is beauty,\" says Prof Khoo, 56.</p><p> He says that AI itself is agnostic to either good or evil applications, and is dependent on the intention of the human user.</p><p> \"Of overarching importance is to keep human and AI goals aligned,\" he notes.</p><p> As futurists and inventors, design students speculate on all sorts of future possibilities.</p><p> For instance, they conduct research about the design of greener cities, the future of work and the future of healthcare. </p><p> These thought experiments, and the examination of both AI's light and dark sides, allow students to constantly create provocative scenarios that spark engagement and stimulate debate.</p><p> Students in Singapore also have some of the best teachers. About 20 SUTD lecturers are ranked among the \"World's Top 2%\", a list of leading scientists compiled by Stanford University in the US. </p><p> \"Our students are exposed to an exceptional research environment from their first year in university,\" says Prof Khoo. </p><p> \"Every project is a thought experiment about a speculative future or an exploration of experimental possibilities of existing phenomena. This then allows us to steer ourselves and our world to a better and brighter future.\"</p><p> This approach of embracing state-of-the-art AI, as well as striking a balance with its impact on society, has helped groom SUTD students to excel in the real world. Since 2009, SUTD graduates have commanded top dollar in the job market. </p><p> In a Straits Times report in April 2023, nine out of 10 SUTD graduates found jobs within six months of completing their final examinations, based on the school's 2023 graduate employment survey of 300 new graduates. </p><p> More than half of SUTD graduates secured full-time permanent employment in the sectors of information and communications, financial and insurance, and scientific research and development.</p><p> In February, the results of the Joint Graduate Employment Survey revealed that graduates of information and digital technologies courses continued to take home the highest monthly pay at $5,600, up from $5,500 in 2023. </p><p> ST scopes out five of SUTD's most ground-breaking AI projects.</p><p> Helping students flesh out bright ideasA new AI-powered design software converts doodles, sketches or simple shapes into layered architectural renders for pitching to design clients or for buildable architecture. </p><p> This is the invention of SUTD's Carlos Banon, associate professor of architecture and sustainable design. </p><p> For the past three years, he has integrated advanced diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) and conducted cutting-edge training in SUTD's first-year design workshops or \"studios\".</p><p> Advanced diffusion models are sophisticated machine learning algorithms that generate high-quality data. The application improves the connection between students' intuition and their visual output, boosting their creativity while helping them maintain control and ownership. </p><p> Prof Banon experienced first-hand the problem that designers grappled with to maintain control of and execute their vision using AI. His user-friendly application, which he christened FORMAS.AI -- \"formas\" is Spanish for \"forms\" -- turns sketches, coloured shapes and 3D images into textured visualisations and 3D-printable geometry with one click. </p><p> More than 2,000 architects, interior designers, educators and students globally are early users in the private beta version of the application, ahead of its end-Maypublic launch.</p><p> By making each step of the AI-driven creative process more transparent and controllable, users transition from being led by the AI's creations to actively guiding its development. This helps preserve their personal style while leveraging data-driven tools.</p><p> \"Since 2022, we have been integrating image-based diffusion models to enhance foundational design skills from the first semester at SUTD,\" says Prof Banon, 46. He is also the co-founder of Spanish architectural firm Subarquitectura Architects and co-founder of research laboratory AirLab@SUTD.</p><p> In his classes, students still draw on tracing paper and use cardboard study models, as they are encouraged to nurture primary thoughts and intuition. </p><p> But the moment a spark of brilliance takes shape, they sketch the idea and feed it into the FORMAS.AI model. It generates a realistic building image with materials and the surrounding environment for context.</p><p> \"In that way, our students develop a new kind of intuition, connecting very basic, abstract shapes and simple operations to complex spatial structures,\" says Prof Banon. \"They then develop new ways to operate in the world, reducing production time and focusing on vital areas revealed during the design process.\"</p><p> Currently, most AI image generators such as Midjourney are able to produce stunning visuals but drift far from the original vision or sketches, says Prof Banon. </p><p> On the other hand, FORMAS.AI's intuitive interface empowers designers to experiment and iterate using basic shapes. The output ranges from a high-resolution architectural rendering to an image that can be fed to 3D printers to produce a prototype.</p><p> \"Innovative architectural design often starts with a personal vision -- something only you notice about a site, the climate, a pattern of living,\" Prof Banon says. </p><p> \"It is that 'trained vision' that architects develop over time, something that can be transformative as we consider many factors -- combining science, art and technological intuition. AI should amplify and sharpen that hunch, not overshadow or replace it.\"</p><p>  Info: To see examples of what users globally are generating, go to FORMAS.AI </p><p> An AI-powered Design Brain for architectsWhen humans draw up architectural plans, they bring a lifetime of lived experiences, sensory input and emotional understanding to the table. They intuitively grasp spatial relationships, human needs and the feeling a space should evoke. </p><p> Currently, AI is unable to do this. An AI program needs to be fed large amounts of data which it identifies as patterns, recombining existing elements and optimising results within clearly defined parameters.</p><p> AI also lacks the physical and emotional experiences that shape human intuition about space and form. </p><p> Assistant professor Immanuel Koh of SUTD's Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar and Design and Artificial Intelligence programme is working on changing that. </p><p> His \"Design Brain\" project was conceived in 2024 with the aim of developing AI models capable of digesting, perceiving, understanding, learning, remembering, generating and evaluating designs -- specifically, architectural designs.</p><p> This is despite architecture being one of the most complex design disciplines in the world, demanding both creativity and logic.</p><p> Prof Koh has found that while there are many aspects to the project, the problem of spatial design reasoning -- and creative \"unreasoning\" -- is the most critical and difficult to solve.</p><p> For AI to truly power the design process and production, both humans and AI need to first communicate why, when and how specific design decisions are made during the iterative process.</p><p> \"It is difficult because it requires a transdisciplinary conceptual understanding and technical skills that lie at the intersection of design and AI,\" says Prof Koh, who also directs Artificial-Architecture at SUTD. </p><p> Artificial-Architecture is an interdisciplinary research laboratory that focuses on the design and development of deep learning models for artificial creativity, neurocognitive design, generative architecture, predictive urbanism and defence intelligence.</p><p> Artificial-Architecture has a slate of funded projects that include tie-ups with industry, academia and government agencies, such as AI Singapore and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p><p> Design Brain tries to create visible parallel chains of reasoning design actions throughout the process that can be performed, observed and augmented by human designers and autonomous software agents. An autonomous software agent is capable of making design decisions on its own.</p><p> \"I see AI as having the potential to not only automate or 'compress' existing design workflows that are currently conceived by human architects in a top-down manner, but also, even more radically, to un-automate or 'expand' existing design thinking habits that are yet to be conceived, using AI in a new bottom-up manner,\" says Prof Koh. </p><p> He worked with London-based design practice Zaha Hadid Architects from 2011 to 2014 before joining SUTD in 2019 to teach what he says is the world's first dedicated \"AI x Architecture\" module. </p><p> On Design Brain, Prof Koh says: \"The importance of this research lies in gaining a deeper mutual qualitative and quantitative understanding of the evolving gap between the intelligent architectural capabilities of AI and those of human architects. </p><p> \"At this point in time, it functions as a litmus test to see if an AI model can acquire the design skillsets of a human architect.\"</p><p> Analysing the ear canal through light imaging and machine learningAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), customised hearing aids can help cut the rate of cognitive decline by nearly half in seniors at a higher risk of dementia. </p><p> WHO says that nearly 2.5 billion people globally may have some degree of hearing loss by 2050, and more than 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation. </p><p> To create a more accurate mould of the outer ear for hearing aids, ear specialists in Singapore led by Dr Kenneth Chua, formerly from Changi General Hospital (CGH), collaborated with SUTD associate professor Stylianos Dritsas from 2020 to 2023. </p><p> Prof Dritsas teaches design computation and robotics, combining design, geometry, computing and manufacturing methods. </p><p> He worked with the CGH team to improve the way hearing aids are made, using machine learning. This is a field of study in AI centred on the development and study of algorithms that can learn from data and go on to create scenarios without relying on explicit instructions.</p><p> Fitting hearing aids typically involves injecting silicone into patients' ears. This produces ear canal moulds which are then scanned using 3D imaging to create digital ear canal impressions. </p><p> But before digital impressions can be used by doctors, the printouts require a lot of manual 3D editing. </p><p> Prof Dritsas and his team at SUTD helped Dr Chua -- now a principal audiologist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre -- with computational methods to pre-process ear canal impressions. The project ended earlier in 2025, but there are plans for an extension to conduct more studies.  </p><p> The goal is to develop automated tools to help design better hearing aids. This will improve manufacturing and fitting the aids, and help standardise ear canal data for research purposes.</p><p> Prof Dritsas points out that in traditional computer programming, tasks that require visual intelligence and a qualitative assessment are very difficult to express via simple rules fed into a computer.</p><p> However, with AI, it is possible to provide enough examples for the computer program to understand the trends and patterns, and enable it to perform these tasks without explicitly being guided by a human.</p><p> \"The key finding of the ear canal project is that, unlike classical geometric analyses which require 'clean' or comprehensive data, the machine learning models are able to work with 'noisy' (incomplete) data from the real world,\" says Prof Dritsas, 48, a founding member of SUTD.</p><p> \"During the process, something unexpected happened,\" he recalls. </p><p> \"The machine learning model scrutinised the team's main printouts of the outer ear shapes thoroughly and was able to spot errors. This occurred because some of our data samples were off the general trend.</p><p> \"So, it provided highly intelligent guesses to improve the end-product.\"</p><p> Prof Dritsas says the machine learning model is a pioneering technology. One of its \"superpowers\" is the ability to make hyper-intelligent assessments for a final read-out that is more than 90 per cent accurate. </p><p> \"The model learnt something objective by combining subjective opinions of experts and collective knowledge from the team,\" he adds.</p><p>  \"This is something very powerful about machine learning that is not yet well understood, and which has enormous potential.\"</p><p> Sharing knowledge about coastal protectionProtecting coastlines from rising sea levels due to climate change is a top priority, says SUTD professor of practice Eva Castro from the Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar.</p><p> As the director of the Centre for Climate Adaptation (CCA), housed within the Upper Changi campus, she uses AI to generate visualisations of projected scenarios faster than in previous years, when the technology was not so advanced.</p><p> Instead of manually selecting chart types and visual encodings, AI-powered tools can automatically suggest the most effective visualisations to represent data and highlight key insights. </p><p> This allows Prof Castro to ideate and iterate large-scale infrastructure proposals for coastal resilience that can be shared across borders to help stakeholders such as overseas researchers, scientists and government agencies.</p><p> AI has also helped to break down complex design concepts for stakeholders to access and comprehend information that would otherwise be understood only by specialists or experts.</p><p> \"The CCA agenda is centred on archipelagos, so we have been working with coastal areas, developing a new understanding of the meaning of coastal resilience and the role the ocean plays within it, designing hybrid as well as nature-based solutions to inhabit possible futures,\" says Prof Castro, 53.</p><p> One of CCA's ongoing research programmes is the Long Island project, which involves reclaiming land at higher levels off East Coast and placing them in the form of \"islands\" located a distance away from the existing coastline.</p><p> The programme, aimed at helping Singapore's efforts in coastal protection, is expected to reclaim about 800ha of land off East Coast.</p><p> It will be progressively implemented from 2030 and will stretch over a few decades, according to national water agency PUB.</p><p> Prof Castro says the aim of her work is to produce more inclusive processes of design that help in sharing knowledge and engaging society at large.</p><p> \"As designers, we want to promote the importance of our role within the infrastructural projects that define the cities we inhabit,\" she says. \"In doing so, we believe we are strategists who know how to operate across diverse scales and typologies.\"</p><p> Collaborative intelligence, instead of artificial intelligenceArchitecture graduate and PhD candidate Daryl Ho believes AI will not take over the jobs of humans, but will be more of a reliable assistant to designers. Think collaborative intelligence rather than artificial intelligence, he says.</p><p> The 30-year-old is working on a few \"wonder\", or speculative, projects, which look into how the medium of extended reality (XR) can augment the way humans interact with AI beyond the standard user interface. </p><p> The way humans engage with AI should not be limited to buttons and text prompts, he says. Through XR, users can make use of space for new forms of interaction and collaboration with AI.</p><p> \"One of my projects looks into how AI can be a creative partner that helps users design their own virtual environments,\" says Mr Ho, whose research is in understanding XR through the perspective of an architect designing spaces for people to interact in. </p><p> His goal is to find ways for people to curate their own spaces within the metaverse or virtual world, not only through appearance, but also via interactivity with the environment. </p><p> In this project, AI collaborates with the users, responding to their actions through sounds, colour and placing design suggestions of its own. </p><p> This allows designers within a virtual environment to create together with AI in a social, embodied manner.</p><p> Another project looks at how AI can redefine how people interact with information, not as static elements taken from a webpage, but as dynamic agents that respond to the user and one another. </p><p> \"Much of the information we find online is presented to us through search engines, websites and online repositories that for the large part remain static 2D interfaces,\" he says.</p><p> \"Through XR and AI, we can change the way a person receives and makes sense of information.\"</p><p> Imagine information as little AI helpers living inside a virtual world. Instead of just looking at words and pictures on a screen, one can interact with these AI helpers directly. </p><p> This allows the individual to explore information in a dynamic 3D way, beyond the flat screen of the computer.</p><p> \"The metaverse is still a nascent force,\" adds Mr Ho, highlighting that its implications make it an important future for designers to speculate about. If XR and AI become ubiquitous at a scale akin to that of the internet now, how does one engage with such spaces'</p><p> \"My research looks into tapping the principles of the metaverse to find novel ways in which we might be able to work, create and play with an ever-evolving digital landscape.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associate professor Carlos Banon's FORMAS.AI software can transform basic sketches and shapes into textured visualisations.

These solutions could provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, said GenZero, an investment platform dedicated to decarbonisation solutions. </p><p> According to a report by state investment firm Temasek in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and strategic economics consultancy AlphaBeta, nature-based opportunities across 3 systems -- food, land, and ocean; infrastructure and the built environment; as well as energy and extractives -- could deliver US$4.3 trillion of annual economic value and generate 232 million jobs by 2030 in Asia-Pacific. </p><p> Opportunities for such solutionsThe phrase \"nature-based solutions\" may be relatively new, but the concept behind it is not. Humans have been planting trees for centuries to control erosion, for example. Suvro Sarkar, analyst at DBS Group Research, said forest and wetlands conservation as well as active afforestation and reforestation still remain key focus areas. Others include blue carbon projects, which involve harnessing the power of carbon sequestration through algae, mangroves, seagrasses and other plants in coastal areas. Soil carbon and agriculture projects could also help in reducing emissions from soil degradation and food production practices. </p><p> But new opportunities have risen in today's modern economy. The development of carbon markets can play a major role in financing these nature-based solutions. </p><p> Koh said that governments and businesses are sourcing for\u00a0nature-based carbon credits mainly from international voluntary carbon markets or from carbon project developers directly. \"Most of these credits derive from forest conservation projects and reforestation projects, which generate carbon emission avoidance credits and carbon dioxide removal credits, respectively.\" </p><p> According to global asset manager BlackRock, there is tremendous growth potential for voluntary carbon markets, as corporates, industries and governments race to meet their net-zero commitments. The total addressable market for voluntary carbon markets is expected to grow by between 15 and 60 times by 2030. </p><p> Based on forecasts from Trove Research, a data and advisory company specialising in climate strategy and carbon markets, the value of carbon offsets will grow from US$2.8 billion in 2021 to US$63 billion in 2030.</p><p> It also projected that the carbon credit price has to at least double from US$10 per tonne in 2020 to between US$20 and US$30 per tonne in 2030 in order to incentivise sufficient investment in carbon offset projects for the demand. Singapore has jumped on this growing market via the launch of Climate Impact X, a carbon exchange jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered Bank, and Temasek.</p><p> Ho Pei Hwa, analyst at DBS Group Research, said that companies developing tools and platforms to make the trading of carbon credits easier and more transparent in the future will be keenly watched. </p><p> Similar to nature-based solutions, reusing and recycling are not new ideas. But the focus now on environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations has created market opportunities in areas such as product redesign and waste management. </p><p> Meghan Sharp, head of Decarbonization Partners -- a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek that invests in decarbonisation solutions -- said they are looking at an opportunity in the synthetic leather space, where the material is made out of mushrooms. </p><p> Mycellium, which is a part of a fungus from which mushrooms grow, is said to be able to reduce carbon footprint by 5 times as it is bio-degradable. </p><p> Ellen Martin, director of impact and insights at The Circulate Initiative -- the non-profit arm of investment management firm Circulate Capital -- noted that global players such as PepsiCo and Unilever have committed to having all of their plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. \"This in turn creates demand for recycled products and materials and encourages innovations in the waste management space that may not have otherwise been realised,\" she said.</p><p> DBS Group Research said Internet of Things solutions could be used to manage waste collection, whereby devices could be used to sort out waste for efficient recycling. Artificial intelligence could also be utilised to better predict demand for goods and services, so that companies can better manage their inventory to minimise use of resources or wastage. It added that the sharing economy could be digitalised through the development of mobile applications that promote the donation of used items, as well as the repairing and recycling of electronic items. </p><p> An emerging technology-based approach to the circular economy model is the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) capabilities. </p><p> CCUS is a collective term that refers to a range of solutions that essentially allow carbon dioxide, produced through the burning of fossil fuels, to either be stored underground or converted into other useful substances, thereby preventing it from reaching the Earth's atmosphere. According to Ho, CCUS is one of the most cost-effective solutions available for the large-scale reduction of emissions. </p><p> Currently, about 40 million tonnes of carbon is captured each year. However, CCUS deployment must increase by about 140 times for the amount of carbon captured to reach 5.6 Gigatonnes, said the Global CCS Institute. This amount would account for a fifth of emissions reductions needed by 2050.</p><p> Due to Singapore's limited land space, Sarkar pointed out that the use of waste-to-energy plants and CCUS could be key tools in carbon recycling. </p><p> The issues inhibiting the scaling of CCUS are down to costs and uncertainties around its performance. While the technology has been around for decades, it is still considered immature, and the cost to capture and store post-combustion emissions remain very high, said Ho. \"This needs to be resolved through incentivising and ramping up research and development in this field and implementing carbon taxes worldwide. Higher prices of carbon compliance could act as a tipping point towards reaching economies of scale for CCUS technologies.\" </p><p> Making that transitionAccording to a 2021 survey conducted by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 51 per cent of a sample of 51 cities and regions from 21 OECD countries do not yet have a circular economy initiative, though they are planning to. Only 12 per cent indicated that they did not have plans to develop one, while the remaining 37 per cent already have programmes in place. </p><p> Some of the biggest obstacles cited by respondents to transiting to a circular economy include the lack of financing, financial risks, and an inadequate regulatory framework. \"Focusing on a more sustainable way of living has never been more urgent, with global temperatures on the rise, more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and more,\" said DBS Group Research. \"In our view, a circular economy can alleviate the challenges that come about with global warming, though significant progress is still needed.\" </p><p> However, moving from a linear economy to a circular one requires a transformation of global supply chains, and this cannot be accomplished in isolation, said Martin. </p><p> While companies are working with suppliers to pilot new materials and production methods, governments can support the growth of\u00a0circular solutions and influence the way businesses operate through enabling policies such as regulations defining recycled-content requirements, she said. </p><p> \"Policymakers also have the opportunity to facilitate more private investments into the circular economy by introducing financing mechanisms that reduce or share risk,\" added Martin. She also suggested companies can start their transition with small steps before advancing to more significant business model shifts: \"From a product development perspective, companies can look at replacing hard-to-recycle materials such as multi-layer plastic film with more sustainable alternatives. This in turn ensures that end-products can be reintroduced into the economy and are kept out of landfills.\"</p><p> On top of the long-term challenge of mitigating climate change, governments are also tackling other more-present problems, such as supply chain disruptions, energy security concerns and inflation woes. Koh said many will have to reconcile and, in some cases, triage these competing priorities: \"However, there are opportunities to leverage science and technology to help inform government and business decisions on which solutions to prioritise, where to target our actions and how to execute them for maximum benefit while minimising trade-offs.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-6BH1JA</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667B-TJK1-DYX4-00SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1650\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

There will be coach drop-off points at the nature park. </p><p> Linking the new nodes are coastal trails with bird hides for bird watchers to observe feathered creatures feeding on the mudflat from a distance. </p><p> The trails also tap nature-based solutions such as slope-regrading to help restore and reinforce the coasts, as well as support the growth of mangroves. </p><p> As one of the richest wetlands in Singapore, the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat site is home to over 380 fauna and 190 flora species and is an important feeding ground for migratory shorebirds. </p><p> Between August and March yearly, migratory birds escaping the winter chill from the Arctic Circle and Russia stop and refuel in Singapore en route to Australia and New Zealand.</p><p> NParks' studies show that the majority of the shorebirds that roost at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve at high tide will fly to Mandai Mangrove during low tide to forage at the mudflat, which is a rich feeding ground for them. </p><p> \"This means that both sites are ecologically interdependent habitats for shorebirds and are important for shorebird conservation in Singapore,\" said NParks.</p><p> The Mandai Mangrove forest is also one of the few remaining mangrove habitats in Singapore with an extensive mudflat exposed at low tide.</p><p> To minimise impact on biodiversity and other parameters such as water quality and sediment quality, NParks, which conducted an environmental impact assessment to guide the development of the site, will avoid heavy construction works during the bird migratory season.</p><p> The assessment report will be published in February and the public can give their views. </p><p> At the Bukit Batok Nature Corridor, first announced in December 2020, visitors can look forward to enhanced trails, a new exercise plaza and an enhanced stream. These will be rolled out progressively in 2028. </p><p> Such corridors help to support ecological connections between biodiversity-rich areas like nature reserves and parks, which are important for wildlife to move around to find food and mates in other green areas. </p><p> Movement of animals like birds and butterflies is also facilitated by 18km of new nature ways -- routes planted with specific trees and shrubs that replicate the natural structure of forests -- that have been added since 2020 along the corridor. More nature ways will be added, said NParks. </p><p> Dr Shawn Lum, a senior lecturer at NTU's Asian School of the Environment, said enhancing connectivity for wildlife across the areas will help them mitigate isolation amid \"a sea of concrete structures and roads\". It will also help less mobile animals, which may also be seed dispersers, to move across landscapes, he added.</p><p> The new enhancements to the corridor will be made at Bukit Batok Nature Park, Bukit Batok Town Park and the upcoming Bukit Batok Hillside Nature Park.</p><p> At Bukit Batok Nature Park, existing trails will be refurbished with a new boardwalk and view deckings over the quarry. There will also be a new passenger drop-off point for vehicles and shelter at the carpark, in addition to new exercise plazas and a play area for visitors amid a lush setting.</p><p> The Bukit Batok Town Park will have its existing trails upgraded, plus a new arrival node  with a toilet for visitors entering from Bukit Batok Avenue 5.</p><p> The new Bukit Batok Hillside Nature Park -- at the site of a former park and closed to the public for now -- will have a new arrival node and trails.</p><p> NParks also plans to enhance the existing stream within the park to provide proper drainage and prevent erosion of the stream's banks. This will allow visitors to get close and learn about the ecology of the stream. </p><p> As part of the environmental impact assessment to guide the development of the site, studies carried out between February 2022 and April 2023 found that at least 200 of the more than 1,200 flora and fauna species recorded are of conservation significance. These include critically endangered plants like the Singapore nervilia orchid and animals like the Sunda pangolin. </p><p> The assessment report is available on NParks' website and is open to public feedback.</p><p> To minimise disturbances to the natural environment, mitigation measures, such as avoiding works in forested areas with high conservation value and salvaging plants of conservation significance, will be put in place.</p><p> One suggestion, Dr Lum said, is to introduce large seeded plant species, such as wild nutmeg tree species, at these parks as they can help increase the diversity and resilience of the forests.</p><p> \"More species will increase diversity, and ecological studies have shown that greater diversity makes these forests better able to recover from minor disturbances such as tree falls following strong winds,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-IMFNDA2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYH-94P3-RRN9-24XB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Under the bucket of climate finance, most funds have flown to mitigation. </p><p> At COP29, discussions on the global goal on adaptation are likely to be closely intertwined with discussions on the new climate finance target. The indicators of the global goal will be discussed at COP29 and adopted at COP30.</p><p> Why it mattersSouth-east Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, with an estimated 77 per cent of the region's total population of 2.62 billion living in coastal areas. </p><p> This makes them susceptible to climate change impacts such as coastal flooding, and typhoons that are expected to strengthen as the world warms.</p><p> The IPCC has warned heatwaves are expected to become more frequent, intense and longer-lasting as temperatures rise. </p><p> But taking steps to soften the impact can be costly. Singapore, for example, has estimated the cost of protecting its coastlines from sea-level rise to be more than $100 billion over 100 years. </p><p> In 2023, the UN estimated adaptation costs in developing countries to be in the range of US$215 billion per year this decade. </p><p> \"As a result of the growing adaptation finance needs and faltering flows, the current adaptation finance gap is now estimated at US$194 billion to US$366 billion per year,\" noted the UN in its 2023 Adaptation Gap report. </p><p> \"At the same time, adaptation planning and implementation appear to be plateauing.

We know that they are a very important part of the equation. And so this motion will really be about how we can support businesses, especially the SMEs in this green transition.\" </p><p> The upcoming motion -- which will be tabled some time in 2025 -- aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with more resources on how to decarbonise and get access to sustainability consultants, and to encourage firms to report on their carbon emissions and waste. </p><p> Mr Ng said that many large multinational companies have made commitments to reduce their emissions, and may sometimes expect their suppliers -- which include SMEs -- to meet certain sustainability standards. </p><p> But smaller firms may not have the resources to do so, or lack the awareness of how to get there. </p><p> This is why it is important to ensure that these smaller businesses are not left out of the green transition, he said. </p><p> He noted that only a fraction of SMEs have tapped the $180 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme, which was introduced in 2021 to help local firms go green by providing training workshops, project support and financing. </p><p> He said only about 20 to 30 per cent of the companies that applied for the programme are SMEs. </p><p> \"From our dialogues and on the ground, (we heard) that a lot of them are unaware of all the different programmes that we put out there to help them. </p><p> \"And so awareness is a critical component,\" added Mr Ng. </p><p> It was previously reported that only a third of SMEs have made significant decarbonisation progress, as compared with 80 per cent of larger enterprises. </p><p> \"This motion will call for stronger support to help enterprises navigate the green transition, and ensure a just and inclusive transition towards a low-carbon society,\" said PAP assistant secretary-general Desmond Lee, who launched the climate action group on Jan 21 at the Singapore Sustainability Academy at City Square Mall. </p><p> Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon co-leads the new group alongside Mr Ng, who also chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Sustainability and the Environment. </p><p> The nine recommendations that will be proposed in the parliamentary motion are:</p><p> This will be the fourth climate change motion in Parliament since 2021. </p><p> Some 80 per cent of Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions come from about 50 facilities in the manufacturing, power, waste and water sectors. </p><p> While smaller firms are not major emitters, Mr Ng noted that they \"form a huge part of our business community\". </p><p> \"If you want a just and inclusive transition, it must include the SMEs as well,\" he added. \"Rather than wait for a few years when we might mandate that everybody has to do climate reporting, I think it's much better if we are proactive.\" </p><p> From the 2025 financial year, all listed companies in Singapore must submit climate-related disclosures.</p><p> The climate action group is one of two groups which the PAP has created to address key national issues that cut across traditional demographic lines. </p><p> The second, a mental health group, was launched in late 2024. </p><p> Concerns about mental health and climate change came to the fore during an exercise in the past year to refresh the ruling party, and also over the years in conversations with activists and Singaporeans. </p><p> Apart from the parliamentary motion, PAP's climate action group will advocate for policy reforms to fight climate change and further move the needle on the 2030 Singapore Green Plan. To that end, five committees have been formed under the group to align with the five Green Plan pillars.</p><p> The City in Nature committee, led by Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC), will push for the conservation of nature spaces while striking a balance with urban development. </p><p> Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang GRC) leads the Energy Transition committee that will propose policy changes to help industries, homes and the transport sector increase their use of greener energy. </p><p> The Green Economy committee, led by Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang GRC), aims to develop policy recommendations that support the country's transition to a low-carbon economy. </p><p> Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) will helm the Resilient Future committee, which will look at boosting the country's food security and integrating nature-based solutions in buildings.</p><p> The Sustainable Living committee, led by Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC), will introduce initiatives to encourage citizens to make more eco-friendly choices.</p><p> With the next general election set for no later than November 2025, Dr Koh was asked whether climate change resonates with voters and is expected to be a hot topic during the election season. </p><p> He said the climate action group is not tied to the election, but is a signal that the party is continuing to place climate action at the forefront of what it does.</p><p> \"The future of Singapore depends on our policy actions that will actually make concrete changes to help mitigate some of the impacts of climate change,\" he added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>(From left) Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng and Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Koh Poh Koon, both of whom co-chair the PAP climate action group, alongside Sembawang GRC MP Poh Li San, East Coast GRC MP Cheryl Chan and Nee Soon GRC MP Carrie Tan, at a dialogue with SME representatives during the group's launch on Jan 21.

Well over 100,000 people have been subject to mandatory evacuation orders, while early estimates have put the likely insured losses at US$20 billion and the potential overall economic loss as high as US$57 billion. Quantifying the human suffering and emotional loss is impossible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the cause of the fires is yet to be established, it is likely that last year's heavy rains from the El Nino weather system fuelled vegetation growth, which has since dried during a recent prolonged dry spell. Combined with strong winds, this has created the ideal conditions for wildfires to spread. </p><p> The broader science is clear -- climate change and today's methods of landscape management are accelerating the wildfire risk globally. </p><p> A key challenge in California -- as also in the Mediterranean, which too has seen a rising threat from wildfires in recent years -- is the rural-urban interface where the town meets the countryside, with a disproportionate number of residences now located in high wildfire-risk areas. </p><p> Holistic strategies neededAs residential areas expand deeper into wilderness, the risk to homes and businesses rises. It is estimated that, globally, insurance claims due to wildfires have risen to US$10 billion annually, a figure that now looks set to be dwarfed in 2025. Indeed, many homeowners caught up in the LA fires are without home insurance, after insurers hiked costs or simply cancelled provision altogether in recent years due to the escalating wildfire risks.</p><p> In addition to urban spread, climate change and the way we plan and manage our landscapes are thought to be the key factors. </p><p> As temperatures rise, and droughts become more frequent, the tinderbox conditions that spark and spread wildfires are increasingly common. </p><p> Across the world, this new generation of wildfires are exceeding our capacity to suppress them. As we face mounting environmental, economic and social threats, we must move from tactical suppression to holistic mitigation-adaptation strategies, to minimise the risk of extreme fires breaking out, and create resilient landscapes that are capable of recovering quickly should a fire occur. </p><p> Recent years have seen substantial scientific and technical advances in how land management practices can integrate prevention-preparedness, detection-response, and restoration-adaptation. </p><p> Climate-smart forestry, for instance, which puts resilience and climate benefits at the forefront of forest management, is emerging as an effective tool for creating landscapes that are resilient to wildfires and other extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. </p><p> One major issue, however, is -- how do we finance these strategies'</p><p> The key to achieving this goal is the growth of the circular bioeconomy -- in essence, by replacing today's extractive, fossil-based economy with an economy based on nature's regenerative power, we can cut the emissions that lead to global heating and reduce the risk of extreme weather events while attracting the necessary investments to transform landscapes and businesses in an integrated manner. At the local level, the bioeconomy flourishes where nature thrives, meaning that economic growth goes hand in hand with the creation of healthy, biodiverse, climate- and fire-resilient landscapes.</p><p> Forests and agroforestry, with their multifunctional roles and wide range of ecosystem services, offer great opportunities to build this new economic model. New technologies are creating unprecedented opportunities to transform plant-based compounds into many of the fossil-based materials we use today, including construction materials, textiles, plastics, and chemicals. Managing forests to produce these resources regeneratively also enhances the ecosystem services that forests provide, improving carbon sequestration, soil health, and water retention, and reducing a forest's susceptibility to fire. </p><p> The same can be said for agroforestry and regenerative farming, which provide us with food while enhancing ecosystem services. </p><p> This is not the case in conventional agriculture, which provides food while generating environmental externalities.</p><p> Seize the opportunity As the bioeconomy grows, so does the economic opportunity. In the Amazon alone, the bioeconomy could be worth up to US$4 trillion, while globally the bioeconomy is expected to be valued at US$7.7 trillion by 2030.</p><p> For investors, the growth of the circular bioeconomy is creating an opportunity for private finance and public-private partnerships to target returns while creating fire-resistant and resilient landscapes through nature-based solutions, such as regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and sustainable forestry, which can target better long-term economic profits and a rise in land values while enhancing biodiversity- and water-, soil- and climate-related ecosystem services. </p><p> Whether this is through companies that are turning monoculture coffee plantations into healthy agroforests, producing coffee that sells at a premium, grown on climate-resilient farms that sequester more carbon than they emit, or carbon and biodiversity credit markets that give investors the chance to target sustainable returns and diversify their portfolios, opportunities abound. However, to bring these and other mechanisms to scale, innovative financial tools will be needed. </p><p> Think out of the boxFrom real asset strategies that deploy capital to transform degraded or non-adapted land assets to resilient and regenerative assets, to schemes such as the Australian Emissions Reduction Fund, and the USA's Forest Resilience Bond -- which allows private capital to play a role in public land management -- such mechanisms must become the norm rather than the exception. </p><p> To do that, the finance industry needs to build a better understanding of the key role of nature as the true engine of our economy. Bringing scientific experts to the investment and finance industry needs to be the norm in the coming years.</p><p> In a world where losses from environmental disasters are growing -- in total, climate disasters cost the global economy US$320 billion in 2024 -- urgent action is needed, and investors have an essential role to play. </p><p> As we search for new ways to finance the fight against wildfires, we must take a multifaceted approach, integrating science, finance and policy to build a circular bioeconomy that addresses the root causes of extreme events. </p><p> In today's era of climate change, we must take our lead from nature and build resilience from the ground up. </p><p> The writer is chief nature officer at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

(Keppel) announced today that the new Keppel Coastal Trail at Labrador Nature Park is now open to the public. The trail's development is supported by a S$1 million donation from Keppel's philanthropic arm, Keppel Care Foundation, to the Garden City Fund.</p><p>The trail passes through the coastal beach forest habitat, located between Labrador Nature Reserve and the sea and provides visitors with a coastal view as they walk along it. As part of the trail development, the coastal beach forest has undergone active restoration under the Forest Restoration Action Plan. This helps provide a significant physical and ecological buffer for the coastal hill forest within the adjacent Labrador Nature Reserve, one of the last few remaining patches of such habitat on mainland Singapore. The trail offers a new option for nature-based recreation for visitors and more opportunities to get close to biodiversity while boosting the ecological resilience of the nature reserve. The opening of the trail and the continued habitat restoration efforts within Labrador Nature Park are part of Singapore's efforts to transform into a City in Nature, with community stewardship as a key pillar.</p><p>To mark the opening of the trail, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Mr Desmond Lee, together with Mr Danny Teoh, Chairman of Keppel, Mr Loh Chin Hua, CEO of Keppel, and Keppel Volunteers, joined members of the community in planting 55 native coastal trees along Keppel Coastal Trail.</p><p>Strengthening the ecological resilience of Labrador Nature Reserve</p><p>Keppel Coastal Trail is home to around 100 species of trees and shrubs, including native coastal species such as Ormocarpum cochinchinense, Common Putat (Barringtonia racemosa), and Sea Mango (Cerbera manghas). These species were planted along the trail to increase sources of food and places for fauna to seek shelter. This includes pollinators and dispersers such as birds, bats, and butterflies, potentially increasing the resilience of the adjacent coastal hill forest within the nature reserve.</p><p>In 2020, Keppel pledged to donate S$3 million to plant 10,000 trees in parks and nature reserves in Singapore in support of the OneMillionTrees movement, around half of which are slated to be planted in and around Labrador Nature Reserve. As of end-2024, about 8,000 trees from Keppel's pledge have been planted across Singapore, with around 3,800 trees planted in Labrador Nature Reserve and Labrador Nature Park, including along Keppel Coastal Trail, with the help of over 350 Keppel staff volunteers.</p><p>Enhanced recreational experience for park visitors</p><p>The 340-metre-long trail offers a serene walking experience through Labrador Nature Park, away from more active recreational areas and connects visitors to the jetty at its southern end.</p><p>It comprises two main sections, an approximately 90-metre-long elevated wheelchair-accessible boardwalk which provides unblocked views of the sea from an elevated vantage point, and a 250-metre-long rustic path, which brings visitors through a coastal beach forest habitat. Along the rustic path, three swales which serve as natural drainage solutions for the trail and complementary habitats for fauna, were designed with inputs from youths from NParks' Youth Stewards for Nature (YSN) programme. The youths helped propose the landscape design concept for the swales, taking into consideration the background of the area and ecological and design concepts that were suitable for the site.</p><p>Interpretive signage along the trail provides visitors with information about the biodiversity that can be sighted within the park, including species such as the White-bellied Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus leucogaster), Paradise Tree Snake (Chrysopelea paradisi), and Painted Bronzeback (Dendrelaphis pictus). During the bird migratory season, visitors may even spot birds like the Yellow-rumped Flycatcher (Ficedula zanthopygia) or the Oriental Honey Buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus).</p><p>Mr Danny Teoh, Chairman of Keppel, said, \"The Keppel Coastal Trail reflects our commitment to environmental stewardship, and serves as an important platform for preserving nature and biodiversity in Labrador Nature Reserve, while strengthening its ecological resilience. Keppel will continue to support the efforts of Singapore and the international community to address the challenges posed by climate change, including through nature-based solutions.\"</p><p>\"We are deeply grateful to Keppel for their generous contribution towards the development of Keppel Coastal Trail and the forest restoration efforts at Labrador Nature Reserve and Labrador Nature Park. Their support has enabled the creation of a trail that allows the community to learn about these vital coastal forests and their crucial role in mitigating climate change impacts. While this is a significant step forward, there is still much work to be done to protect and enhance our natural environment. We hope that more organisations and individuals will be inspired to step forward and play their part in leaving a living legacy for future generations,\" said Mr Guy Daniel Harvey-Samuel, Chairman of Garden City Fund.</p><p>Enhancing parks in the southern region to provide more nature-based recreation opportunities</p><p>The completion of the trail complements efforts to transform Labrador Nature Park into a Destination Park, with its own thematic identity and unique features. Labrador Nature Park, together with HortPark and West Coast Park, were previously identified to be enhanced into Destination Parks, and are part of a larger cluster of 13 parks in Singapore's southwestern region. These will be enhanced to expand the variety of experiences for visitors of all ages in the Southern Ridges and west coast and offer the public greater access to recreational features set amidst nature.</p><p>One of these parks is Pasir Panjang Park, which stretches from West Coast Park to Pasir Panjang. NParks will be enhancing the park further by adding a node to the park, at the former industrial waterfront of the Pasir Panjang Power District. This new park node will complement the rejuvenation of the Power District. The node will add around 2 ha to Pasir Panjang Park, expanding it from 6 ha to 8 ha. When completed, the extended Pasir Panjang Park will link other green spaces via the Park Connector Network to Labrador Nature Park. These include West Coast Park, Jurong Lake Gardens and Jurong Central Park. NParks will be calling for the tender for the detailed design consultancy this year to welcome proposals for this park node.</p><p>These are all part of NParks' efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature, where we bring people closer to nature, while bolstering the ecological resilience of our habitats.</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp;

Industry experts shared with The Business Times that their outlook for Singapore's reinsurance sector remains optimistic, citing favourable conditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Singapore Reinsurers' Association chair Kenrick Law attributes his optimism to several factors such as the country's supportive regulatory environment, proactive policies aimed at attracting and retaining global reinsurers, and its growing focus on green financing and climate risk management.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Developing talentHe emphasised that the government's regulations promoting transparency, risk management and compliance will continue to attract more global reinsurers to the market. Additionally, the government's focus on developing both local and international talent has enhanced the Republic's appeal as a reinsurance hub.</p><p> \"This, coupled with its stable political environment and well-established financial ecosystem, (provides) a strong foundation for reinsurers looking to establish their regional headquarters or expand their operations,\" he explained. </p><p> In 2023, Singapore's reinsurance premiums grew 31 per cent year on year to S$27.6 billion, accounting for approximately 21 per cent of Asia's reinsurance market. Although figures for 2024 are not yet available, the momentum is expected to have continued.</p><p> Chris Lim, associate director at credit rating agency AM Best, highlighted that the country benefits from a \"strategically advantageous geographical location within Asia-Pacific\" which allows Singapore-domiciled reinsurers to transact overseas easily.</p><p> \"Vibrant ecosystem\"\"Singapore is a well-established insurance and reinsurance hub, made up of a vibrant ecosystem of reinsurance players, reinsurance brokers and other financial service providers,\" he added.</p><p> Currently, the Republic serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for 12 of the world's top global insurers and reinsurers. Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 have established their regional hubs in Singapore, covering markets in Asean, North and South Asia, as well as Australia.</p><p> More specialty insurers and international insurance firms are choosing the city-state as their regional hub, noted Justin Ward, managing director of Asia-Pacific capital advisory at reinsurance specialist Guy Carpenter. He likened Singapore's strategic position to that of London in Europe and New York in North America.</p><p> For example, Ward said, Singapore serves as the hub for Guy Carpenter's South-east Asia and South Korea operations.</p><p> The company follows a hub-and-spoke model, with smaller offices in Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, but Singapore remains central for key functions such as actuarial services, capital management, market strategy and client management. He added that this strategic focus has allowed the firm to effectively deploy capabilities and attract offshore business to the Republic.</p><p> Ward foresees that reinsurers will increasingly focus on strengthening their capabilities in the Singapore market this year.</p><p> He said: \"We see a concerted effort (by) the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore government to ensure that Singapore may remain at the forefront of insurance and reinsurance innovation in the region. We don't see that abating. We see that increasing speed post-Covid and (with) further innovation coming through.\"</p><p> Deputy Prime Minister and MAS chairman Gan Kim Yong noted that the Singapore government has committed to doubling down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers, in a speech at last year's Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).</p><p> He added that the government will also work with insurers and reinsurers in the city-state to deepen their capabilities, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p> \"Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub,\" he said.</p><p> Victor Kuk, head of property and casualty reinsurance for South-east Asia, India, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Swiss Re, pointed out that Singapore's stable political and financial environment is another incentive for many companies to conduct business activities here.</p><p> With Singapore being a gateway for many businesses to international as well as South-east Asian markets, the firm can leverage this unique geographic location to support its clients throughout the region more effectively, he added.</p><p> Looking at recent regulatory developments in Singapore, Kuk anticipates that these will help \"position the reinsurance industry for long-term resilience\" and bring about \"an opportunity for the market to align with global standards\".</p><p> Last August, the MAS imposed stricter oversight for insurers with reinsurance contracts, requiring them to submit terms and conditions for review, with the possibility of audits.</p><p> This move followed a report from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, which raised concerns about the growing allocation of capital to alternative assets and the increasing use of cross-border, asset-intensive reinsurance.</p><p> Alternative risk transferSingapore has been focusing on expanding its insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments, such as sovereign insurance solutions and insurance-linked securities (ILS). </p><p> ILS are financial instruments tied to risks such as natural disasters, specialty insurance risks, and life and health insurance. They provide an alternative way for insurers and reinsurers to transfer large risks to capital-market investors.</p><p> Gan previously noted that the government is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to increase the available financial capacity for covering major catastrophe risks, especially since Asia currently represents less than 5 per cent of the global catastrophe bond market.</p><p> To further these efforts, MAS is collaborating with the ILS industry to promote these instruments as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios, in a drive to channel growing investments from both private wealth and institutional investors in Asia into ILS.</p><p> Among the most well-known forms of ILS are catastrophe bonds -- or cat bonds -- which transfer specific risks, usually from natural disasters, from sponsors to capital-market investors. </p><p> Cat bonds are becoming increasingly important as they help address protection gaps that are widening, due to the growing impact of climate change, when traditional insurance coverage is often insufficient. </p><p> Currently, there are 14 ILS listed on the Singapore Exchange, including cat bonds issued by global specialty insurer and reinsurer MS Amlin Asia Pacific.</p><p> Guy Carpenter's Ward, however, stressed the need for greater interest in ILS from asset managers in Singapore and the wider region, which would contribute to a more vibrant alternative risk transfer market.</p><p> \"What will be interesting, moving forward, is how we continue to gain momentum around alternative sources of capital that can be made available to reinsurers and insurers, whether through the presence of fund managers (or) the insurance sector's focus on ILS, and how that will change the sources of capital available for insurers and reinsurers.\" </p><p> Climate transition in Asia is expected to drive growing demand for reinsurance, creating significant opportunities that Singapore can leverage.</p><p> Catastrophe coverageWhile the region is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, it also faces a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage. In 2023, economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region totalled US$65 billion, with 91 per cent of these losses uninsured, compared with a 30 per cent protection gap in the US.</p><p> Kuk of Swiss Re highlighted that climate change will lead to an increased risk of natural catastrophes across Asia-Pacific, particularly in coastal areas and urban centres located in flood-prone river zones.</p><p> \"Protective measures need to be taken for insurance products to remain economical for such properties at high risk,\" he said.</p><p> He added that the reinsurance industry plays an important role in building resilience before an event strikes through mitigation efforts as well as after, especially in emerging markets at risk of natural catastrophes and where insurance penetration may not be as high.</p><p> Gan noted in his SIRC speech that Singapore's focus on sustainable finance and green insurance products has further positioned the country as a preferred hub for reinsurers, particularly as the sector confronts climate-related risks.</p><p> \"With the country actively building its research on physical impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, climate-impact modelling and nature-based solutions, reinsurers can leverage these insights to improve their risk assessment models, portfolio management strategies and climate disclosures,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singapore serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for 12 of the world's top global insurers and reinsurers; among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 have established their regional hubs in the Republic. photo: AFP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-RLFSCE0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F0T-46F3-RSPK-M0K7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Devan Nair, 43, heads down to her void deck three to four times a day to seek reprieve from the still air of her home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> She lives in a one-room rental flat in Bukit Merah with her grandmother and several cats. She has no air-conditioning at home, and rarely opens the windows for her cats' safety.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I rely on plenty of ice water, and a wet towel when sleeping. I'm asthmatic, and attacks are triggered during the hot weather,\" added Ms Subasheny, a former security guard who is currently unemployed. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As Singapore and the broader Asia region enter the warmest months of the year, which are typically from April to June, Ms Subasheny could be making more frequent trips to her void deck to enjoy the outdoor breeze. </p><p> Fuelled by climate change, temperatures are rising globally. </p><p> The year 2024 has been declared the hottest year on record, and temperatures are expected to continue rising as planet-warming emissions go up. </p><p> But heat does not impact all segments of society in the same way, especially for those who have no easy access to air-conditioning. </p><p> Some, like Ms Subasheny, have health conditions that are triggered by rising temperatures. </p><p> In other parts of the region, outdoor workers, women and people living in informal settlements will also be susceptible to indirect impacts of heat that make their experience in a warmer world worse. </p><p> For example, heat stress affects outdoor and factory workers' productivity, and can lead to workplace accidents. </p><p> Now, a growing number of organisations -- including research groups, humanitarian organisations and multilateral banks -- are trying to understand how heat is experienced by various segments of society. </p><p> New solutions are also being rolled out, to help vulnerable members of the community keep their cool. </p><p> Monitoring the heat experienceIn February, two researchers from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) visited Ms Subasheny's home, armed with a handheld weather station -- which measures things like temperature and wind speed -- and a 360-degree camera. </p><p> Their aim is to find out how her household is impacted by the heat, and how the occupants cope with the discomfort. </p><p> While local studies have been done on the heat risk of construction workers and soldiers, this is the first time researchers are heading into homes to find out if residents and their living spaces are resilient to hotter weather and humidity. </p><p> For smaller units, placing a fan near the window could optimise air circulation, and keeping heat sources away from the living room area could help, SUTD's Assistant Professor Samuel Chng said. </p><p> Prof Chng, the study's principal investigator, said of the research: \"People spend at least 10 hours a day in their own homes. So how do we make it as comfortable as possible? The end goal is to help residents adapt well to rising heat.\" </p><p>Ms Subasheny's flat is one of more than 300 HDB units islandwide that the researchers have visited since September 2024. The aim is to survey 500 HDB flats in total under the research project. </p><p> The eventual goal is to come up with a menu of low-cost, yet effective, cooling options -- beyond air-conditioning -- that are accessible to all. </p><p> This could be as simple as switching from polyester bedsheets to cotton ones, which offer more cooling, said Prof Chng. Cotton bedsheets feel cooler than polyester sheets mainly due to differences in breathability, moisture absorption and heat retention. </p><p> He co-leads the four-year study, which started in 2023 and also involves the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore-ETH Centre, spanning two fieldwork projects. The project involving the 500 households is funded by the Social Science Research Council. </p><p> Concurrently, the second project involves tracking the thermal comfort of residents for two weeks, while documenting the measures they take to stay cool. Of the 100 households covered in this project, half of them will be rental flats, and this portion is funded by the Tote Board.  </p><p> In the first project, participating residents are surveyed on a range of things, from the size of their utility bills to their perceptions on whether heat has worsened their moods or existing health conditions. </p><p> Researchers also conduct a home audit where they scrutinise features that could influence the dwellers' exposure to heat, from the type of flooring to the types of lights used. </p><p> For example, fluorescent lights emit more heat than LED lights and a house that is heavily cluttered would block wind flow. The data is further analysed so researchers can measure wind flow patterns within the flats. </p><p> In Ms Subasheny's home, the researchers measured indoor temperatures, humidity and wind speed, which are plotted against a thermal comfort standard, which defines the acceptable range of conditions of thermal comfort for building occupants. </p><p> They found that the air temperature was 30.1 deg C -- warmer than the 28.7 deg C outdoors. Humidity indoors was 71 per cent. Her home also had no air flow -- since the windows are kept closed to keep the cats indoors -- except for her bed which has two standing fans pointed at it. </p><p> Overall, her home did not meet thermal comfort standards. </p><p> The researchers observed that older rental units like hers also tend to have lower ceilings. For these flats, it is more challenging to install ceiling fans which circulate air more effectively than stand fans, said Prof Chng. </p><p> The situation in Ms Subasheny's home, where it is hotter indoors than out, has also been detected elsewhere. </p><p> \"During some visits, we found some homes to be warmer than the outside. That's quite worrying. Outside was about 25 deg C and inside was 30.1 deg C,\" said Prof Chng, who is from SUTD's Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities. </p><p> Air-conditioning can exacerbate the warming problem. </p><p> The researchers said that the excessive use of air-conditioning further contributes to global warming due to the release of planet-warming refrigerants, and worsens the urban heat island effect. This refers to the phenomenon where urban areas are warmer than rural areas, as buildings and roads retain heat, and vehicles and air-cons emit waste heat.  </p><p> \"Adaptation to thermal comfort and urban heat does not necessarily mean you need to turn on the air-con,\" said Dr Zheng Kai, one of the co-leads of the research and a lecturer in the architecture and sustainable design pillar at SUTD.</p><p> Prof Chng added: \"We don't want to make air-conditioning the villain, it is a great invention. But how do we use it responsibly? When should we use it'\"</p><p> From push to shove Elsewhere in Asia, where temperatures can soar to over 40 deg C -- a town in Myanmar experienced 48.2 deg C days in April 2024 -- heat can be a double whammy for some communities. </p><p> This is because not only do they have to deal with the threat of scorching temperatures but they also face other factors like socio-economic status and cultural gender expectations which can make their situation worse. </p><p> Mr Mohammad Shahjahan, from the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, said rickshaw drivers, street hawkers and slum dwellers were among those hardest hit by the relentless heatwave that affected the South Asian country in April 2024.</p><p> Temperatures across Bangladesh exceeded 42 deg C during the month-long heatwave -- the country's worst in 76 years. Fifteen deaths directly linked to the heat were reported, although many other casualties could have slipped under the radar.  </p><p> Rickshaw pullers, street hawkers and those in informal trades, who are usually able to work for more than 10 hours a day, could be on the ground for only up to six hours before the heat took a toll on them, said Mr Shahjahan. </p><p> Excessive sweating and dehydration caused the outdoor workers to seek drinking water from unhygienic sources such as municipality waterlines and ponds, which were not properly purified. </p><p> This led to a rise in waterborne diseases as well, added Mr Shahjahan, who is the assistant director and coordinator of the anticipatory action technical working group. </p><p> Workers whose jobs require them to be outdoors all day, such as street vendors or agricultural workers, are also highly susceptible to heat stress, which can lead to heat-related illness or lower their productivity.</p><p> They also tend to press on during periods of excessive heat, since not working means a loss of income. </p><p> For female workers who have caregiving duties to fulfil, knocking off work does not mean they get to rest. </p><p>Ms Zonibel Woods, senior social development specialist at the Asian Development Bank (ADB), told The Straits Times that women are often responsible for fetching water, cooking and caring for children and elderly family members. </p><p> During hot periods, they also face higher workloads as they have to help manage the household's cooling needs, care for sick relatives and cope with water shortage. </p><p> In the city of Kampot in Southern Cambodia, where Kampot pepper is a vital economic crop, heatwaves destroy yields and threaten farmers' livelihoods.</p><p> More than 60 per cent of the pepper farmers are women, many of whom are affected by heat stress, according to Banteay Srei, a Cambodian non-governmental organisation working with vulnerable women and rural communities. </p><p>Ms Phearong Sdeung, executive director at Banteay Srei, said: \"They notice that they find it hard to breathe, feel stressed and have a headache when it is hot... However, they keep working hard regardless of the temperatures.\"</p><p> Beating the heat Amid growing awareness of the need to protect vulnerable members of society from rising temperatures, new solutions are being developed to help protect these groups. </p><p> These solutions range from the roll-out of new technology, to the development of new financial instruments, such as heat insurance. </p><p> In Cambodia, for example, Banteay Srei is working with other groups to pilot a solar-powered cooling and drip irrigation system that can help farmers reduce losses of their Kampot pepper crops. </p><p> The system, which uses sprinkler techniques and a more water-efficient irrigation, helps to lower surrounding temperatures and reduce farmers' working hours under the extreme heat. </p><p> Organisations like ADB are also tapping more innovative forms of protection from heat such as parametric insurance, which is a type of insurance that triggers coverage payout if and when predefined event parameters are met or exceeded. </p><p> This is different from traditional insurance products, which require assessments of individual damage before payouts are made. For example, for a heat parametric insurance, pre-determined payouts are triggered when certain temperature thresholds are breached. </p><p> \"Unlike typhoons or floods, heatwaves do not cause visible destruction which makes it difficult to claim losses,\" said Ms Woods from ADB.</p><p> \"The trigger for payouts would be determined based on historical weather patterns and local climate risks, to guarantee that the system reflects conditions most relevant to affected communities,\" said Ms Woods. </p><p> ADB is looking to implement these policies for female informal workers, such as farmers and outdoor workers, who often suffer income loss during extreme heat events. </p><p> Pilot programmes are slated to be rolled out later in 2025 in Bangladesh, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, though the scheme is still being researched and developed, Ms Woods added. </p><p> While payout amounts have yet to be determined, the insurance is designed to offset short-term income loss or provide immediate financial relief to help women avoid precarious working conditions.</p><p> Since many informal workers often do not have traditional insurance, ADB will team up with local groups, including women's organisations and social support networks, to find ways to develop a model that makes parametric insurance accessible, Ms Woods added.</p><p> ADB will also look at how to make the insurance premiums affordable such as through subsidies or partnerships with the government and private insurers. </p><p> In August 2024, a heatwave parametric insurance for outdoor workers was rolled out by insurance firm AXA Hong Kong and Macau, in what the insurance provider called a market-first. </p><p> AXA said it introduced the heatwave parametric insurance to provide benefits for heat stress prevention and to protect affected practitioners. </p><p> Policyholders would receive a payout of HK$100 (S$17) or an \"anti-heatwave kit\" of equivalent value if temperatures exceeded 36 deg C for three consecutive days between August and October in 2024. </p><p> The premium was HK$19.90 per person and insured individuals would not have to prove damage or loss and were not required to apply for additional claims or submit claim forms and supporting documents to receive the payout, according to the release.</p><p> Taking action early Other than just reacting to heatwaves when they happen, the movement for governments to have in place early action plans and early warning systems is also picking up steam. </p><p> In 2022, the UN launched its Early Warnings for All initiative which aims for every person on earth to be protected by early warning systems by 2027. </p><p> The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has also highlighted the urgency for countries to develop early action plans against the heat crisis. Such a plan would require some details to be worked out, including defining what a heatwave is, and developing a threshold for when early action plans kick in. </p><p> Such early preparation can warn communities of an impending heatwave, which can help to reduce deaths and economic losses when disasters strike. </p><p> One early action plan was rolled out by the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society in Dhaka city, primarily, in the April 2024 heatwave. </p><p> The society activated the early action plan on April 21 for Dhaka city as it was forecast that the temperature threshold of at least 38 deg C over two consecutive days would be reached from April 28 to 30. The society also reached out to more than 20 severely impacted districts, covering over 400,000 people.  </p><p> The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society activated 250 volunteers to help distribute umbrellas, caps and bottles of water to vulnerable groups, such as rickshaw pullers and street hawkers. </p><p> Three makeshift cooling centres were set up, each equipped with six stand fans, water and paramedics, in case people were coming in with heat exhaustion. </p><p> The Red Crescent Society also secured funds to distribute cash to 4,000 families in informal settlements. </p><p> Each household received 5,000 Bangladeshi taka (S$55) to tide them over the month and compensate for their loss in income, so they would not have to work outdoors in the heat. In those families, persons with disabilities received another 2,500 Bangladeshi taka. </p><p> However, Mr Shahjahan felt that the society has only scratched the surface with the cash distribution.</p><p> \"We provided support, but it was not enough because we provided for only 4,000 households. Dhaka is a mega-city,\" he said. Dhaka has more than 5,000 slums with more than four million inhabitants. </p><p> The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society is working with various agencies to develop a national-level heatwave early action plan. </p><p> While early action plans can help to avert a crisis before a heatwave hits, taking a long-term view of the crisis is also critical, experts say. </p><p> \"It's not just about having an emergency response. It's also being prepared for it, introducing adaptation measures and actions for extreme heat,\" said ADB's Ms Woods. </p><p> \"The heat action plans we develop need to look at the short-, medium- and long- term interventions that need to be taken to build the resilience of countries, communities and sectors to increasing temperatures.\"</p><p> For example, a long-term heat action plan may see the incorporation of green spaces and nature-based solutions in a city where the urban heat island effect is prevalent, Ms Woods said.</p><p>Singapore, for example, is moving on this front, with its City in Nature ambitions to infuse more greenery into the city. </p><p> By 2030, all HDB estates will also be coated with heat-reflective paint, that has shown to be able to reduce ambient temperatures by up to 2 deg C. </p><p> SUTD's Prof Chng acknowledged that Singapore has good urban planning practices and design that can mitigate some impacts of heat among urban dwellers. </p><p> But his team's ongoing research has shown that at the household-level, some families could be disproportionately affected by rising temperatures.</p><p> He said: \"We shouldn't take our eyes off the heat. It's very likely that it's a warming world that we are living in. So how do we help residents in Singapore adapt better'\"</p><p> \"Our research focuses on how people can adapt in a sustainable manner in your own homes.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Subasheny R.

Iceland is also part of the Green Group. </p><p> Water is a major source of transboundary conflict between countries. </p><p> In 2020, Mexican farmers seized a dam in its border state to prevent water from being diverted from their parched fields and sent to the US. They also ambushed hundreds of soldiers during the conflict. </p><p> \"As essential resources like water often cross national boundaries, adopting a transboundary approach to their management is necessary to ensure fair and equitable access for all,\" the ministers said. </p><p> As global climate pressures intensify, the need for innovative solutions and significant investments in water management becomes paramount, they added.</p><p> The Green Group put out the statement as 2024 marks a year of three environment-related UN conferences. While COP29 is under way in Baku, Azerbaijan, the UN biodiversity summit in Colombia wrapped up in early November. In December, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification will be held in Saudi Arabia.</p><p> \"These three COPs are key forums that contribute to addressing the interconnected elements of the ongoing triple planetary crisis -- biodiversity loss, climate change and pollution,\" said the country leaders, highlighting that delegates at the conferences must ensure that policies and actions taken are timely and comprehensive in addressing the environmental challenges. </p><p> The ministers noted that addressing climate change and environmental issues requires global effort beyond any single country's capabilities. Environmental challenges can influence each country's peace and security.</p><p> \"Since climate change exacerbates resource scarcity and extreme weather events, displaces communities and heightens the risk of conflict over vital resources such as water, land and food, it consequently deepens existing inequalities and weakens social resilience,\" they added. </p><p> The Green Group cited nature-based solutions as a way to protect ecosystems while addressing social inequalities. For example, reforestation projects or the planting of mangroves can be helmed by local communities, and can also create jobs. </p><p> They also highlighted the role of young people and women in addressing the planetary crises. Existing inequalities make women the most vulnerable to environmental impacts, but having them step up as leaders and participate in climate action initiatives can help to create impact while tackling gender inequality. </p><p> The ministers also emphasised that climate finance must be available and accessible to developing countries to achieve their decarbonisation targets. This is a nod to COP29's main deliverable, which is to adopt a global climate finance goal that will channel money from developed countries to less developed countries.</p><p> The amount of this finance pot will be the key political question on the negotiating table.  </p><p> \"Developed countries must continue leading efforts to mobilise resources, ensuring that financial mechanisms are transparent and equitable,\" the ministers said. </p><p> They added that collaboration between the public and private sectors -- with a focus on increasing private investment -- will be key to accelerating innovative finance solutions for climate action. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Children performing at the opening ceremony of the United Nations climate change conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, on Nov 12.

But what of damage that eludes precise measure'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Two oil-slicked collared kingfishers, for example, died after they were rescued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is also not yet clear how Singapore's coral reefs, already weakened by a marine heatwave, could be affected by the incident in the longer term.</p><p> Marine Honour could be held accountable for the consequences.</p><p> But the quandary of how to price nature -- and whether that accurately reflects its value -- is one that a growing number of governments and companies are grappling with as awareness grows of humanity's reliance on nature, and the declining health of natural ecosystems. </p><p> \"Free of charge, nature provides countless services and resources that we depend on, such as fresh air and water,\" said Mr Vikalp Sabhlok of global environmental organisation The Nature Conservancy (TNC). </p><p> Yet, many of those resources are being recklessly depleted, with about a million plants and animals at risk of extinction, compromising the multitude of services that nature provides to humanity.</p><p> About US$44 trillion (S$57.4 trillion) of economic value generation -- a bit less than half the world's total gross domestic product in 2022 -- is moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services, according to one estimate from the World Economic Forum.</p><p> \"These resources are often exploited because the true value of natural capital is not accounted for or priced into the markets -- this has clearly contributed to its deterioration,\" added Mr Sabhlok, who is the Asia-Pacific director of NatureVest, TNC's impact investing arm. </p><p> The United Nations has estimated that the biodiversity financing gap -- referring to the difference in the amount available for nature's protection currently and the amount needed -- to be at US$700 billion a year. </p><p> How this gap can be narrowed is expected to be a major theme in discussions at the COP16 UN biodiversity conference, to be held in Colombia, from Oct 21 to Nov 1. </p><p> The good news is that a bevy of financial schemes has blossomed in recent months to address this financing gap.</p><p> In July, for example, the US government said it would forgive US$35 million of Indonesia's debt over the next nine years in return for the latter undertaking coral reef conservation efforts. </p><p> And in August, the World Bank announced a US$225 million Amazon reforestation-linked outcome bond -- a new kind of bond that aims to save the Amazon rainforest by linking investors' financial returns to the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere. </p><p> There are others, too, including rhino bonds, coral reef bonds and blue bonds, which focus on financing freshwater or ocean-related sustainable projects. </p><p> Buyers of these bonds tend to be corporations. </p><p> The development of such novel financial products points to the growing involvement of the private sector in funding nature's conservation. </p><p> The business case for natureCorporate interest in nature is being driven by different factors, including the adoption of international agreements by countries, the growing understanding of how nature loss is affecting supply chains, as well as greater awareness about the interlinks between the climate and nature crises, say financial institutions, conservation groups and experts interviewed. </p><p> The adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022 -- UN treaties that require signatories to take action to cut emissions and protect nature -- has forced governments to implement stronger regulatory stances to prevent environmental decline. </p><p> For instance, England has a law that requires land developers to deliver a biodiversity net gain of 10 per cent -- meaning the development should result in more natural habitats or better quality ones than there was before development.</p><p> Companies are also increasingly facing pressure from regulators and customers to disclose their nature-related risks and impacts via reporting initiatives such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. </p><p> While usually voluntary, these developments have prompted the private sector to be more conscious of the impact of their business on the planet.</p><p> Nature's value to basic economics should not be underestimated.</p><p> Think about the necessity of healthy soils to growing crops -- from wheat to rice and palm oil. Or the role played by forests as sources of water for city reservoirs. Pollinators, including bees and butterflies, are also vital for crops. In South-east Asia, bats are important pollinators of the durian, the region's spiky delicacy. </p><p> As Ms Jan Yoshioka, vice-president of sustainable finance at non-profit organisation Conservation International's (CI) Asia-Pacific region, put it: \"It is in the self-interest of corporations to adopt environmentally and socially sustainable business practices and to invest in the conservation of the natural resources they depend on.\" </p><p> The realisation that healthy natural ecosystems are key to thriving businesses has put new wind in the sails of the nature conservation movement, widening the circle of those involved beyond just conservationists and governments to include the private sector too. </p><p> Mr Carlos Pagoaga, president of the Coca-Cola Foundation, said nature often offers the best mechanisms for restoring watershed health and reducing water stress for communities.</p><p> \"The Coca-Cola Foundation, the Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners invest in nature-based solutions, such as forest protection and floodplain management, which build on natural processes to manage water systems,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"Through this work, we recognise that nature-based solutions often have multiple co-benefits, such as better water quality, carbon sequestration, increased climate resilience, and enhanced richness and variety of life of natural habitats,\" Mr Pagoaga added.</p><p> Do more with nature-based solutionsWhile the intention to contribute to nature's restoration is there, the question is how companies can do so in a more sustained manner than a one-time donation in the name of corporate social responsibility. </p><p> Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Singapore, said: \"In our current market environment, in order to ensure better conservation, we either have to put a price on nature or make it a rule -- or both.\"</p><p> Mr Sivaprasad, who is BCG's South-east Asia lead for climate and sustainability, added: \"This means defining the economic value of things like clean water, air, food security, carbon storage that are enabled by nature and/or creating government regulations that make conservation a requirement.\"</p><p> The close links between the climate and biodiversity crises mean that some financial instruments developed to help companies address climate change are also having positive effects on nature. </p><p> This is most clearly seen in the carbon markets. </p><p> Habitats such as forests and mangroves have the ability to sequester carbon -- or capture and store planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. This locks the carbon away from the atmosphere, contributing to climate mitigation. </p><p> One carbon credit represents 1 tonne of planet-warming greenhouse gases that is either prevented from being released, such as when a forest is saved from the axe, or removed from the atmosphere, such as through a forest restoration project.</p><p> Mr Law Heng Dean, managing director of the Singapore office of the Pollination Group, a global climate change investment and advisory firm, said that nature-based solutions to sequester carbon or prevent it from being emitted in the first place could contribute to around 30 per cent of global mitigation needed to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement. </p><p> Companies buy carbon credits to offset their carbon footprint so that they can meet their commitments of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 -- the timeline that could help the world avoid the harshest impacts of climate change, according to the UN's climate science body. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said a key driver of the increased interest shown by the private sector in nature is its demand for nature-based carbon credits. </p><p> And when companies buy carbon credits to meet their climate targets, nature reaps the dividends: In one area, a forest is saved from the axe. In another, a mangrove is restored. </p><p> Amid the growing consensus that the world cannot achieve net-zero emissions without nature-based solutions, private and public sectors are becoming increasingly involved in nature conservation, said Ms Hoon Ling Min, investment director at investment firm GenZero.</p><p> But between 2010 and 2022, voluntary carbon markets managed to unlock only a fraction of the potential of nature-based solutions, said Pollination's Mr Law. </p><p> Figures from Ecosystem Marketplace, a global environmental finance news and markets analysis site, show that the global voluntary carbon market was worth about US$2 billion in 2022. </p><p> This is nowhere near the US$700 billion the UN says is required every year for nature's protection. </p><p> For the nature funding gap to be narrowed, the private sector needs to be motivated to loosen their purse strings further.</p><p> \"Today, more than 80 per cent of finance to nature comes from public sources; private financing, whether by corporates or financial institutions, remains an under-tapped source,\" Mr Law noted.</p><p> Can companies be convinced that investing in nature is not just about meeting regulatory requirements or avoiding potential losses, but that it could actually help to turn a profit too? </p><p> People, profit and planet As nature's true value -- to lives, livelihoods and bottom lines -- starts to come into focus, attempts are now being made to put a price on nature. </p><p> This ability to capture value in instruments that can be invested in and traded is what the financial sector excels in, said GenZero's Ms Hoon. </p><p> Take, for example, the World Bank's rhino bond, which was issued in 2022 to increase the population of the critically endangered black rhinoceros, native to Africa. </p><p> The five-year US$150 million bond -- the first wildlife conservation bond of its kind -- will pay investors returns based on the rate of growth of black rhino populations at South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park and the Great Fish River Nature Reserve.</p><p> The bond was sold to institutional investors, such as investment firm Nuveen and Mackenzie Investments, and high-net-worth clients from Credit Suisse International and Citi private banking arms. </p><p> Similarly, a newly proposed Indonesia Coral Bond -- another initiative of the World Bank -- will see investors receiving a \"success payment\" at maturity.</p><p> Mr Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer at DBS Bank, said: \"Beyond providing essential funding, financial expertise is instrumental in developing innovative financial products that can support nature-based solutions.\"</p><p> Another instrument gaining traction is biodiversity credits.</p><p> These credits come from projects that seek to provide measurable improvements in biodiversity, be they focused on a specific species or across an entire ecosystem.</p><p> The credit is a certificate that a corporate buys representing a specific outcome, such as a measurable improvement to a hectare of forest over 10 years. </p><p> For example, Colombian project developer Terrasos has issued credits that each represents the protection of 10 sq m of conserved or restored ecosystems in a high-conservation area of Colombia for 30 years. </p><p> \"Governments are interested in leveraging biodiversity credits as a mechanism to help drive private sector investment into positive outcomes for nature,\" said Ms Laura Waterford, executive director at the Pollination Group in Australia. </p><p> Corporates and financial institutions were also starting to think about buying biodiversity credits on a voluntary basis as part of their broader nature strategies, she added.  </p><p> Ultimately, the goal is to have a global market in tradeable biodiversity credits, though this will take some more time, given the complexity of measuring the benefits. Ms Waterford said the foundations for effective voluntary biodiversity credit markets could be in place by 2030. </p><p> The pricing complex The emergence of innovative financial instruments like rhino bonds can help to unlock new sources of funding from the private sector for nature's conservation, since firms now have a financial -- not just regulatory -- incentive to do so. </p><p> But these tend to be project-specific, and are challenging to implement on a wider scale. </p><p> Observers point to a few obstacles to scaling them up: the difficulty in measuring impact; the uniqueness and complexities of each and every ecosystem, which makes it difficult to develop replicable models that can be implemented quickly across different regions; and the difference in timelines for nature's recovery against investor expectations. </p><p> \"Where there is a globally agreed upon unit for measuring emissions, reductions and removals, there is currently no common unit of measurement for nature and biodiversity,\" said CI's Ms Yoshioka. </p><p> For carbon credit projects, the unit of measure appears to be straightforward. </p><p> Closing down a coal plant in favour of a solar farm prevents the release of a quantifiable amount of carbon dioxide. </p><p> But developments over the past two years have shown that even the suggestion that a carbon project will not truly deliver climate benefits -- such as carbon credits sold for protecting a forest that was at low risk of being cut down in the first place -- can send carbon markets into turmoil, as buyers fear accusations of greenwashing and reputational backlash. </p><p> This has triggered a major shift towards stronger standards and methodologies that back only high-quality carbon projects -- a much-needed reset for the market, experts say. </p><p> Measuring the impacts of a conservation initiative is much more complicated. </p><p> For example, should the focus be across an entire ecosystem or habitat or specific species? Or should protecting what is left be prioritised, over restoring the degraded parts of the land? </p><p> DBS' Mr Muenkel pointed to how nature conservation projects are influenced by unique cultural, societal and environmental factors. </p><p> Restoring a mangrove in Indonesia, for example, would be vastly different from doing the same in India or Colombia, owing to different species compositions, different drivers of deforestation, different environmental conditions and so on. </p><p> Yet, being able to measure outcomes of conservation interventions will be critical to get investor buy-in. </p><p> \"Scientific robustness, impact measurement and risk management are some of the key factors considered by private entities and financial institutions before making a decision on biodiversity-linked financial products,\" Mr Muenkel said.</p><p> Monitoring mechanisms are also needed to measure the impact of conservation efforts, and independent third-party verification processes help to prevent greenwashing and manage any related reputational risks, he added. </p><p> The Coca-Cola Company, for example, said it is partnering with other organisations to develop a methodology to help it quantify and test the co-benefits of nature-based projects, which can help to provide a means to value social return on investment. This, said a spokesperson, can help to build the business case for nature-based solutions. </p><p> This is all part of efforts by academic institutions, companies and standards bodies to develop common frameworks to govern biodiversity investments to ensure they boost nature, can bring social benefits and that this can be measured and verified. </p><p> Further complicating the situation is that nature's progress is oblivious to investor timelines. </p><p> Mr Mike Ng, group chief sustainability officer at OCBC Bank, said: \"Some nature-related projects also come with long timelines and uncertainty, which may require longer financing timelines than traditional loan tenures. These factors contribute to the lack of bankability for nature conservation projects globally.\" </p><p> A coral reef, for example, can take up to 10,000 years to develop. As the reef accretes, habitat complexity deepens -- providing creatures like shrimp, baby fish and flatworms -- with nooks and crannies to hide and rest in. </p><p> But if that reef is destroyed by trawling or bomb fishing, and reef restoration efforts are needed to help it recover, how long would it take to restore the life that it once held? </p><p> Overcoming roadblocks Despite -- or perhaps because of -- these challenges, new schemes that attempt to put a price on nature continue to bloom. </p><p> One area being explored is to leverage the success of the carbon market and tie biodiversity benefits more closely to carbon financing. </p><p> Carbon credit projects have benefited nature and developing nations for decades, said Mr Duncan van Bergen, co-founder of Calyx Global, which rates carbon credit projects. </p><p> He added that recent innovations focusing on shoring up the climate integrity of credits will help the market scale up, \"maximising its impact and enabling companies to participate with greater assurance\". </p><p> In other words, buyers want to be certain that credits can hold up to scrutiny. Add in nature and social benefits, such as health and education support for local communities, and it is a winning combination. </p><p> For any land-based carbon project, it is now mandatory to include biodiversity and community components, said Mr Pablo Fernandez, chief executive of ecosecurities, a global carbon project developer and advisory firm. </p><p> TNC and its Indonesian partner, Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara, are studying a project concept in East Kalimantan on Borneo island that would conserve a large area of forest but also generate money to compensate several land concession owners. </p><p> Revenue would come from sustainable timber production, carbon credits and payments for biodiversity conservation. </p><p> \"It is hard to change the behaviours in the landscape, whether that is corporate behaviour or a small holder or a government if you are not bringing a viable financial alternative to the table,\" said Mr Will McGoldrick, TNC's managing director for the Asia-Pacific. </p><p> Also in Indonesia, a new effort between CI and its local partner, Yayasan Konservasi Indonesia, aims to combine marine conservation with sustainable fishery practices under its Blue Halo S initiative. </p><p> A grant funding mechanism under the initiative, to be implemented from 2025 to 2031, has received interest from private sector groups, including fisheries and aquaculture technology start-ups, business incubators and impact investors. </p><p> CI's Ms Yoshioka said: \"The (grant facility) aims to improve the climate resilience of around 162,000 Indonesian coastal communities while contributing to the sequestration of more than half a million tonnes of... emissions through restoration of blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangrove and seagrass, and improved management of marine protected areas.\"</p><p> Another idea to bridge commercial returns with societal benefits is that of ecotourism, said BCG's Ms Alia Kaz, a knowledge expert in sustainability. </p><p> Scientists, ecologists and organisations involved in nature conservation usually focus on improving a public good. \"They are often funded on the basis of grants with no or limited expectation of economic return. Their work results in societal returns, not commercial returns,\" she said. </p><p> \"But individuals in the private sector and financial sector are measured on commercial returns,\" Ms Kaz added. \"Nature conservation can generate ecotourism and ecotourism-related revenues.\"</p><p> Reining in destructionIncreasing funding for nature conservation, however, is just one part of the picture. </p><p> Figures show that the world is spending much more on activities that damage nature. For one thing, subsidies that drive the destruction of nature -- such as tax breaks and cheap diesel that fail to account for the cost of environmental damage from the fossil fuel, agriculture, water and forestry sectors -- amount to an estimated US$1.8 trillion, a study in 2022 found.</p><p> Activities that cause harm to nature and the subsidies they receive must also be re-evaluated, said Dr Francesco Ricciardi, an environmental specialist working at a developmental organisation. </p><p> Speaking in his personal capacity, Dr Ricciardi said he is doubtful the market can solve environmental issues, since much of nature's degradation is the result of the pursuit for economic growth. </p><p> \"Mining, building roads in pristine rainforests to push mining and logging interests, constructing large dams that bring fish to extinction, these are all still happening now in a bid for more economic growth,\" he said. </p><p> The global reckoning of the value of nature must also consider that the cost of destroying nature -- whether it be clearing a forest for a plantation, discharging pollution into a freshwater stream or spilling oil into the ocean -- is no longer free.</p><p> To move the nature needle, said TNC's Mr McGoldrick, the right regulatory environment is critical. </p><p> \"You have to get the government policy settings right to both incentivise the right type of investment, but also limit or prevent the wrong type of investment,\" he added. </p><p> Where the private sector can come in is in the realm of innovation.</p><p> Dr Alfredo Giron Nava, head of the Ocean Action Agenda at the World Economic Forum, said: \"We cannot achieve the scale needed to increase financing for nature without the private sector. There simply isn't enough development or philanthropic money.\" </p><p> What is needed is a common language between the profit-driven motives of the private sector and conservationists, he added.</p><p> \"Our job is to come up with realistic models, and collaborate with one another to create them, to show that there can be models that are good for nature, are good for business too,\" said Dr Nava. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>After a collision on June 14, Singapore- flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour's damaged cargo tank leaked oil into the sea.

Industry experts shared with The Business Times that their outlook for Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance sector remains optimistic, citing favourable conditions.Singapore Reinsurers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Association chair Kenrick Law attributes his optimism to several factors such as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supportive regulatory environment, proactive policies aimed at attracting and retaining global reinsurers, and its growing focus on green financing and climate risk management.He emphasised that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulations promoting transparency, risk management and compliance will continue to attract more global reinsurers to the market.Additionally, the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on developing both local and international talent has enhanced the Republic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal as a reinsurance hub.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This, coupled with its stable political environment and well-established financial ecosystem, (provides) a strong foundation for reinsurers looking to establish their regional headquarters or expand their operations,\u00e2\u20ac he explained.In 2023, Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance premiums grew 31 per cent year on year to S$27.6 billion, accounting for approximately 21 per cent of Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance market. Although figures for 2024 are not yet available, the momentum is expected to have continued.Chris Lim, associate director at credit rating agency AM Best, highlighted that the country benefits from a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategically advantageous geographical location within Asia-Pacific\u00e2\u20ac which allows Singapore-domiciled reinsurers to transact overseas easily.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore is a well-established insurance and reinsurance hub, made up of a vibrant ecosystem of reinsurance players, reinsurance brokers and other financial service providers,\u00e2\u20ac he added.Regional hubCurrently, the Republic serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters for 12 of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top global insurers and reinsurers. </p><p>Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 have established their regional hubs in Singapore, covering markets in Asean, North and South Asia, as well as Australia.More specialty insurers and international insurance firms are choosing the city-state as their regional hub, noted Justin Ward, managing director of Asia-Pacific capital advisory at reinsurance specialist Guy Carpenter. He likened Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategic position to that of London in Europe and New York in North America.For example, Ward said, Singapore serves as the hub for Guy Carpenter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s South-east Asia and South Korea operations.The company follows a hub-and-spoke model, with smaller offices in Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea, but Singapore remains central for key functions such as actuarial services, capital management, market strategy and client management. He added that this strategic focus has allowed the firm to effectively deploy capabilities and attract offshore business to the Republic.Ward foresees that reinsurers will increasingly focus on strengthening their capabilities in the Singapore market this year.He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see a concerted effort (by) the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Singapore government to ensure that Singapore may remain at the forefront of insurance and reinsurance innovation in the region. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that abating. We see that increasing speed post-Covid and (with) further innovation coming through.\u00e2\u20acDeputy Prime Minister and MAS chairman Gan Kim Yong noted that the Singapore government has committed to doubling down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers, in a speech at last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).He added that the government will also work with insurers and reinsurers in the city-state to deepen their capabilities, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI).\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading reinsurance hub,\u00e2\u20ac he said.Victor Kuk, head of property and casualty reinsurance for South-east Asia, India, South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan at Swiss Re, pointed out that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stable political and financial environment is another incentive for many companies to conduct business activities here.With Singapore being a gateway for many businesses to international as well as South-east Asian markets, the firm can leverage this unique geographic location to support its clients throughout the region more effectively, he added.Looking at recent regulatory developments in Singapore, Kuk anticipates that these will help \u00e2\u20ac\u0153position the reinsurance industry for long-term resilience\u00e2\u20ac and bring about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an opportunity for the market to align with global standards\u00e2\u20ac.Last August, the MAS imposed stricter oversight for insurers with reinsurance contracts, requiring them to submit terms and conditions for review, with the possibility of audits.This move followed a report from the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, which raised concerns about the growing allocation of capital to alternative assets and the increasing use of cross-border, asset-intensive reinsurance.Alternative risk transferSingapore has been focusing on expanding its insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments, such as sovereign insurance solutions and insurance-linked securities (ILS).\u00c2\u00a0ILS are financial instruments tied to risks such as natural disasters, specialty insurance risks, and life and health insurance. They provide an alternative way for insurers and reinsurers to transfer large risks to capital-market investors.Gan previously noted that the government is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to increase the available financial capacity for covering major catastrophe risks, especially since Asia currently represents less than 5 per cent of the global catastrophe bond market.To further these efforts, MAS is collaborating with the ILS industry to promote these instruments as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios, in a drive to channel growing investments from both private wealth and institutional investors in Asia into ILS.Among the most well-known forms of ILS are catastrophe bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or cat bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which transfer specific risks, usually from natural disasters, from sponsors to capital-market investors.\u00c2\u00a0Cat bonds are becoming increasingly important as they help address protection gaps that are widening, due to the growing impact of climate change, when traditional insurance coverage is often insufficient.Currently, there are 14 ILS listed on the Singapore Exchange, including cat bonds issued by global specialty insurer and reinsurer MS Amlin Asia Pacific.Guy Carpenter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ward, however, stressed the need for greater interest in ILS from asset managers in Singapore and the wider region, which would contribute to a more vibrant alternative risk transfer market.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What will be interesting, moving forward, is how we continue to gain momentum around alternative sources of capital that can be made available to reinsurers and insurers, whether through the presence of fund managers (or) the insurance sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on ILS, and how that will change the sources of capital available for insurers and reinsurers.\u00e2\u20acClimate transitionClimate transition in Asia is expected to drive growing demand for reinsurance, creating significant opportunities that Singapore can leverage.While the region is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, it also faces a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage. In 2023, economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region totalled US$65 billion, with 91 per cent of these losses uninsured, compared with a 30 per cent protection gap in the US.Kuk of Swiss Re highlighted that climate change will lead to an increased risk of natural catastrophes across Asia-Pacific, particularly in coastal areas and urban centres located in flood-prone river zones.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Protective measures need to be taken for insurance products to remain economical for such properties at high risk,\u00e2\u20ac he said.He added that the reinsurance industry plays an important role in building resilience before an event strikes through mitigation efforts as well as after, especially in emerging markets at risk of natural catastrophes and where insurance penetration may not be as high.Gan noted in his SIRC speech that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus on sustainable finance and green insurance products has further positioned the country as a preferred hub for reinsurers, particularly as the sector confronts climate-related risks.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the country actively building its research on physical impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, climate-impact modelling and nature-based solutions, reinsurers can leverage these insights to improve their risk assessment models, portfolio management strategies and climate disclosures,\u00e2\u20ac he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In 2023, Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance premiums grew 31 per cent year on year to S$27.6 billion, accounting for approximately 21% of Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinsurance market.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F0T-46F3-RSPK-M0K5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Working Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II with climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and Working Group III with climate change mitigation. </p><p> Working Group II is split into two offices, one in Singapore and one based in Delft, Netherlands. </p><p> We, in the Singapore-based technical support unit of the IPCC, together with Delft, have been tasked to lead the report and are keen to ensure that this special report is as inclusive as possible. </p><p> That aspiration underpins our aim to actively involve experts, urban practitioners and civil society in developing the report. </p><p> There are multiple opportunities to participate, and we are inviting early-career scientists, urban planners and regional policymakers to contribute insights and perspectives, ensuring that the report reflects the unique challenges and opportunities faced by cities in diverse physical, spatial and social contexts.</p><p> We hope that these efforts will foster a stronger sense of ownership among urban stakeholders in the region and beyond, to ensure that they feel represented by the report, and make its findings more relevant for action.</p><p> A call to action A report that offers solutions is key as we need science to be translated into decisions that can help cities achieve their sustainability targets. </p><p> Cities will not reach their climate goals without the support and active engagement of those who live, work and make decisions within them. </p><p> For policymakers, the responsibility of building sustainable cities lies largely with those who shape policies and allocate resources. </p><p> The special report will encourage policymakers to implement progressive policies that both reduce physical climate risk and promote low-emissions living by default. </p><p> Imagine a city where energy-efficient housing is the standard, public transportation is widely accessible and affordable, and green spaces are integrated into every neighbourhood. Such environments reduce the need for individual emissions-related decisions and make climate-friendly living the norm.</p><p> For urban practitioners, such as architects, engineers and urban planners, and scientists, they have the expertise to reimagine cities in ways that are functional, resilient to climate risk and sustainable in lifestyle. </p><p> The IPCC report will provide these professionals with the scientific evidence needed to design and implement urban infrastructure resilient to heat, droughts, floods and other hazards, ensure energy efficiency and renewable energy, and incorporate nature-based solutions into urban landscapes. </p><p> Cities are made by and for the people who live in them, and urban residents can play a crucial role by supporting sustainable local initiatives, advocating for green policies and making low-carbon choices in their daily lives. </p><p> By sharing regional insights, the special report will provide a toolkit of best practices, showing cities how to tackle climate challenges in ways that resonate with local contexts.</p><p> Now is the time for urban residents, businesses, civil society organisations, policymakers and professionals to get involved. </p><p> For residents, this means staying informed, advocating for policies that prioritise sustainability and participating in local climate initiatives. </p><p> For policymakers and urban practitioners, it means contributing to the report's recommendations to create environments where people and nature can thrive together. </p><p> Ultimately, the cities we shape today will determine the lives we lead tomorrow. </p><p> The IPCC special report on cities is a call to action for all of us to harness the full potential of our cities in the climate fight, ensuring that they are resilient, inclusive and sustainable for generations to come.</p><p> Dr Winston Chow is the co-chair  of Working Group II of the UN's leading climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Dr Mukesh Gupta is the science officer of the working group, which focuses on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation. Both authors are based at Singapore Management University, and their research looks into climate resilience and strategies to adapt to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A resident wading through flood waters at a convenience store in Chiang Mai on Oct 6 after Typhoon Yagi swept through Northern Thailand in September.
