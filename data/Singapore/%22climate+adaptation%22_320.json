Thus far, climate mitigation has been the main focus of governments, companies and financial institutions. </p><p> AIGCC -- which engages its members including major investors on climate change matters -- assessed nine markets in the region on their adaptation plans: China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. </p><p> It found significant gaps. </p><p> What investors want Based on the report, investors in Asia want to see new policy frameworks and multi-stakeholder partnerships on building climate change resilience. This is amid greater demand and necessity to integrate investor perspectives into adaptation plans.</p><p> For instance, to build an investment case for climate adaptation, investors need to quantify the financial implications of physical risks to their assets and operations, including indirect impacts via value chain exposures.</p><p> However, existing data and methods to do so remain nascent and insufficiently credible, granular or consistent for decision-making.</p><p> Climate adaptation has typically been viewed as the responsibility of the public sector, even though public funding cannot meet the scale of investment needed in most markets. </p><p> In addition, private investors usually consider such investments as not meeting their risk-return profiles. They must often contend with the real or perceived low cash flows from resilience investments, a lack of strategic policy direction, uncertainty around financing needs, and poor investor confidence in the transparency and predictability of capital.</p><p> To obtain a comprehensive view of risk exposure and impacts, the report said that companies and investors should examine physical risks and impacts by sectors and across the value chain. </p><p> However, it added that impacts at the sectoral level and across boundaries are poorly understood or quantified.</p><p> What governments need to do The report found significant gaps around the availability and accessibility of climate data and risk information. While four out of the nine markets have developed physical risk data platforms, access to some of these is presently restricted.</p><p> These include a climate crisis vulnerability assessment tool developed by South Korea, and a climate change adaptation information platform in Japan. </p><p> Developing open and granular information platforms on physical risk and vulnerabilities would facilitate a comprehensive view of risk among finance-sector participants and real-economy stakeholders, the report said. This would accelerate adaptation and resilience efforts, it added. </p><p> While all nine markets have evaluated the long-term projections of climate variables across scenarios and time horizons, AIGCC's report found that detailed quantification of impacts and vulnerabilities across sectors is still lacking. </p><p>Hong Kong and Singapore are the only two markets which have yet to quantify and communicate climate impacts or vulnerabilities across specific sectors. </p><p> For investors to analyse the physical risks to their holdings, governments should mandate climate disclosure and ensure that disclosure frameworks present investors with information useful for decision-making.</p><p> However, the report noted that the implementation of mandatory climate risk disclosures aligned with international standards remains inconsistent across the region. </p><p> For instance, only Hong Kong and Singapore have announced clear timelines for disclosures in line with the International Sustainability Standards Board. </p><p> Given that the effects of climate change cut across national boundaries, the report said there is a need to integrate interregional aspects into national climate risk assessments and adaptation plans.</p><p> This will help direct resources towards reducing risks across borders, and building systemic resilience to climate change globally.</p><p> Although six markets have indicated some form of participation in regional adaptation platforms, only Japan stands out in this area. Besides considering interregional risks in its plans, it has contributed to climate adaptation across regions. </p><p> The report also found that most markets have not established financing pathways and mechanisms to mobilise private capital in adaptation planning. There is a general lack of visibility of the national process from a financing perspective, and the roles investors can play.</p><p> Moreover, detailed financing mechanisms, investable project opportunity pipelines, and road maps that lay out ways to collaborate with financiers have not been adequately developed. </p><p> Among the nine markets, only Indonesia and China have started outlining action plans and implemented pilot initiatives to facilitate private-sector engagement and funding in adaptation planning. </p><p> The report said a detailed national adaptation plan should include financing strategies, as well as a clear delineation of the roles and engagement strategies of investors across the various stages of planning. </p><p> An advisory group comprising government officials, multilateral development banks, philanthropies and the private sector should also be established to develop a range of financial products to co-fund resilience and adaptation projects. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Climate adaptation has typically been viewed as the responsibility of the public sector, even though public funding cannot meet the scale of investment needed in most markets.

Now that responsibility is more vital than ever. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The forces shaping today's investment environment go beyond any market cycle or structural trend. They strike at the foundations of the global order. They are rewriting the rules of global investing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Our response relies on two pillars: top-down portfolio construction and bottom-up asset selection. We diversify with intent, deploy with granularity, act with agility, and invest in partnerships, always taking the long view, protecting against permanent impairment, and preparing rather than predicting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> PerformanceFor the 20-year period from Apr 1, 2005, to Mar 31, 2025, the annualised US dollar nominal return of our portfolio was 5.7 per cent.  Adjusting for global inflation, the annualised 20-year real return was 3.8 per cent.  Our long-term returns remained stable, though in recent years a confluence of factors have affected this performance, which we detail in the Investment Report.</p><p> A world in fluxCyclical shifts in growth, inflation and interest rates continue to influence markets. However, these cycles now produce a wider cone of outcomes and interact with deeper, longer-term forces playing out over years rather than quarters.</p><p> We group these forces into two categories: structural and foundational. Structural shifts evolve within the existing system; they can often be analysed and prepared for. Foundational shifts, by contrast, fundamentally transform the system itself, challenging long-held assumptions and requiring a basic rethinking of portfolio construction and investment management.</p><p> Structural shifts include rising public debt, demographic changes, growing global imbalances between savings and spending, and widening gaps in technology adoption. These are already altering capital flows across borders, weighing on productivity in some regions and influencing long-term returns. </p><p> Foundational shifts go even deeper, redefining the post-war world order once based on free trade, capital mobility, and institutional trust. Long-standing assumptions about safe havens, liquidity and asset correlation are being challenged. Politics and geopolitics now influence economies and financial markets directly and immediately. </p><p> In an increasingly more volatile and fragmented trade system, policy decisions can quickly reverse advantages. Similar fragmentation is unfolding in capital markets. Financial systems are dividing along geopolitical fault lines, complicating cross-border investing. </p><p> Finally, artificial intelligence (AI) and the climate transition are also unfolding in ways that signal not only long-term transformation, but also foundational change, reshaping how economies function, how capital is deployed and how future value will be created. </p><p> Investment approachFaced with these profound changes, it is tempting to chase the short-term hype or retreat in the face of the unknown. At GIC, we do neither. We focus on long-term value, with an emphasis on avoiding permanent loss. We apply \"inversion\" -- studying the typical causes of permanent impairment in order to steer clear of them. Historically, such losses have stemmed from poor fundamentals, disposals due to an inability to service debts, exogenous shocks or even fraud. Our investment process is designed to guard against such pitfalls. </p><p> Less obvious but equally damaging is overpaying. Situations such as the Nikkei bubble in the late 1980s, the Nasdaq collapse in the early 2000s, and the periodic bursting of meme stock bubbles all illustrate the dangers of valuation overshoot. Even if asset prices eventually recover, the time lost will have been too great. This is why we remain disciplined on price. </p><p> From the top down, we focus on harvesting long-term risk premia in a diversified manner -- building a resilient and flexible portfolio that can withstand market stresses, adapt across cycles and long-term shifts and compound value over time. While concentrated markets can make diversification feel costly in the short term, it remains essential to long-term portfolio resilience. GIC diversifies across asset classes, geographies, sectors and time. For example, in private markets, we spread investments across multiple years -- known as time or vintage year diversification -- to avoid overexposure to any single time period. </p><p> Amid unprecedented shifts, we also need granularity and agility. Within broad themes such as AI or climate, opportunities vary widely across value chains. We need to break these down into investible segments. For instance, in AI, we distinguish between enablers such as chipmakers or data centre providers, monetisers like cloud platforms and software companies, and adopters integrating AI into their operations. This enables our investments to be more targeted. </p><p> Similarly, in climate, we recognise long-term opportunities in electrification, energy efficiency and climate adaptation. However, investments vary in risk profile, policy support and relevance across markets. In the global energy landscape, exponential demand growth and persistent supply disruptions have renewed focus on energy security and affordability. This has resulted in more fragmented investment trends, with each country charting its own path to secure, cost-competitive energy sources.</p><p> Agility requires us to act decisively as these trends evolve. In volatile markets, dislocations arise when market participants are forced to buy or sell, creating mispriced assets. By preserving liquidity and flexibility, we can respond when others can't -- whether in private credit during bank lending crunches or secondaries where liquidity-seeking investors sell at discounts. We also see agility as the ability to spot underappreciated themes early. Climate adaptation, a vital but historically overlooked part of the climate response, is gaining urgency as physical risks rise. It is becoming both an inevitable need and a complementary investment theme alongside decarbonisation. GIC research estimates that the investment value for a select set of adaptation solutions will grow from US$2 trillion today to US$9 trillion by 2050, with US$3 trillion attributed to incremental growth driven by global warming. This opens up opportunities across both established solutions, including weather-resilient building materials and emerging technologies such as weather intelligence.</p><p> PartnershipsAt GIC, we believe that navigating uncertainty requires deep, robust collaboration. We invest in relationships as we do in assets -- for the long term. Our global presence across more than 40 markets reinforces this commitment, providing on-the-ground insights and the continuity needed to build trusted, lasting partnerships. </p><p> AI capabilitiesOne area demanding concerted effort and commitment across the organisation is technology integration. Like many, GIC is actively building its AI capabilities. In internal audit, for instance, we leverage AI to detect anomalies in both structured and unstructured data, automating the analysis of large and diverse data sets to identify risk trends and focus areas. </p><p> We are also integrating AI more deeply into our investment process. Drawing from more than 40 years of investment data, we are developing prototypes such as a virtual investment committee member, which taps into GIC's institutional knowledge to generate probing questions, challenge assumptions, and surface contrarian insights in real time.</p><p> Looking aheadThe year 2025 may be a turning point in markets -- and in history. As the investment world grows more complex, our responsibility to steward Singapore's reserves -- with integrity and foresight -- remains our guiding purpose.</p><p> The writer is chief executive officer of GIC.

Larger amounts of water vapour in the atmosphere act as fuel for severe storms, while heatwaves and wildfires are related to drought.</p><p> South-east Asia needs to prepare quickly for the impacts of climate change, yet these adaptation efforts remain under-prioritised and under-supported, said the report, which was released on June 23. </p><p> A major hurdle is the difficulty in grasping adaptation, as it is often perceived as broad and all-encompassing, noted the paper. </p><p> Climate adaptation involves protecting people from the impacts of climate change, such as building sea walls to guard against rising sea levels, and cooling centres during heatwaves. </p><p> \"Because it is difficult to measure, the returns on investment in climate adaptation are challenging to define,\" said the report.</p><p> It aims to shift the perception of adaptation by highlighting the importance of the move and quantifying the investment needed. </p><p> For example, an investment of about US$13 billion (S$16.8 billion) is needed by 2030 to fortify South-east Asia's adaptation and resilience to various types of flooding, beyond existing methods such as irrigation systems and controlling stormwater flow. </p><p> \"Businesses and investors have a direct interest in backing (adaptation) strategies. It reduces their exposure to risk and ensures business continuity when crisis strikes,\" said the report. </p><p> In climate action, adaptation has long been the overlooked sibling of mitigation, or emissions-cutting efforts. But it has started to gain traction in recent months amid worsening climate impacts. In 2024, global temperatures exceeded 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. </p><p> The 2025 UN climate change conference, to be held in Brazil in November, will have climate adaptation as a central theme.</p><p>Singapore is among countries preparing a national adaptation plan to guard against climate impacts like sea-level rise and extreme heat. </p><p> South-east Asia remains under-represented in global adaptation efforts, despite facing some of the highest risks, noted Professor Khoo Teng Chye, chair of the South-east Asia Partnership for Adaptation through Water coalition, who was consulted for the report. </p><p> Overall, many projects in South-east Asia still face constraints in demonstrating bankability and producing revenue and tracking measurable impact, he noted. </p><p> To help policymakers design water-centric adaptation measures, the report outlined a framework focusing on four key areas: reducing damage brought by floods, enhancing alternative sources of water, incorporating technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), and developing financial tools to raise money for adaptation projects. </p><p> The framework focused on case studies that the region can emulate, such as Belize's five-year project to protect its coasts and reduce pollution and wastewater discharge into the ocean, while protecting the nation's coral reefs. </p><p> The Central American project, announced in early 2025, will include mangrove planting and harnessing of wetlands to help clean wastewater. </p><p> While US$32.23 million has been raised -- which includes funding from the World Bank's International Development Association -- other forms of innovative financing such as carbon credits and blue bonds are expected to be unlocked. </p><p> Blue bonds are a form of loans given out specifically to protect the ocean, and green bonds are similar loans for environmental projects.</p><p> Between 2020 and 2023, water-related green bonds grew 30 percentage points faster than the overall green bond market. </p><p> The Belize project could inspire similar ones in the coastal cities of the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, added the report. </p><p> On the use of AI, the report highlighted an 11-year-old project in the region called Servir-Mekong, which provides satellite data to help countries along the Mekong River predict and prepare for floods and droughts. </p><p> The AI system has helped more than 60,000 households in Vietnam's Ninh Thuan province plan and optimise their water usage in the fields. </p><p> The report comes on the heels of a few other climate adaptation-focused papers published in 2025, which quantified the global investment potential of protecting people from climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-AVJA6AA</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3V-NGX3-RRP8-2054-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

With citizens having shared faith in each other, the nation will break new ground and mark new milestones \"not with loud fanfare, but with quiet confidence\".</p><p> In a sense, quiet confidence has characterised PM Wong's leadership since he took the reins last May.</p><p> On Sunday, too, he struck an upbeat tone despite laying out formidable external challenges, reiterating that Singapore can shape its own future instead of being a resigned bystander.</p><p> \"Singapore's progress will never be left to chance,\" he said, as he outlined the government's efforts to overcome the adversities ahead. \"We are -- and have always been -- a nation that adapts, reinvents and dares to dream.\"</p><p> Such positivity permeated his speech as he touched on issues that have dominated recent discussions.</p><p> He highlighted the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) even while acknowledging resultant worries about job security, and promising workers that they remain the top priority.</p><p> Similarly, Singapore's ageing society was not framed as a threat. Rather, PM Wong focused on how seniors can lead healthy and active lives, announcing moves to build \"Age Well Neighbourhoods\".</p><p> From AI and the economy to worries about graduate jobs, PM Wong's choice of topics may reflect a close reading of what resonates with the ground.</p><p> Yet, this year's speech marks a departure from past NDRs in several ways. </p><p> First, PM Wong arguably spent less time on regional matters than his predecessor.</p><p> When Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong was prime minister, he often devoted several minutes of his speech to an overview of Singapore's relations with its close neighbours.</p><p> While PM Wong did briefly discuss geopolitics in this year's rally, the lack of an update on foreign relations was particularly stark, given that he had just completed his round of introductory visits in the region.</p><p> Second, NDRs have typically been expected to feature marquee announcements.</p><p> In the past, the NDR has often been used as a platform for major announcements: Project Jewel and the Pioneer Generation Package in 2013; the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme (Vers) in 2018; the government's S$100 billion commitment to climate adaptation measures in 2019; and the Kallang Alive master plan in 2024, just to name a few.</p><p> In theory, this year's NDR could have been used as a platform for announcements such as the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Draft Master Plan 2025 -- released in June -- or an update to Vers.</p><p> The fact that it was not could reflect PM Wong's \"first among equals\" leadership style. Important announcements are not necessarily \"saved\" for the leader; instead, team members are given the opportunity to be in the limelight.</p><p> This is exemplified by the involvement of both experienced and new ministers in the Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce, chaired by his \"right-hand man\", Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong -- who got a shout-out at the rally.</p><p> PM Wong might well be saving some announcements for when the 15th Parliament opens in just over two weeks -- and perhaps also allowing the respective ministers to deliver them.</p><p> On Sep 5, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam will deliver the President's Address that traditionally marks the opening of Parliament. This will be followed by a five-day debate, about two weeks later, where the various ministries will lay out their plans for the term ahead.</p><p> Pundits will be watching these plans -- known as Addenda to the President's Address -- for the big announcements that NDR did not bring.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PM Lawrence Wong might well be saving some announcements for when the 15th Parliament opens in just over two weeks -- and perhaps also allowing the respective ministers to deliver them.

There is a sizeable market for such investments today, he said, noting: \"They are highly profitable, and they are companies that you can act on as an investor.\"  </p><p> The BCG and Temasek report identified seven areas where climate change is currently having the greatest impact -- food, infrastructure, health, businesses and communities, water, energy, and biodiversity.  </p><p> The authors looked at the groups of solutions that can help to reduce the impact of climate change on these sectors, and zoomed in on specific solutions that exist or are being developed. </p><p> For example, the report pinpointed \"climate-adapted agricultural inputs\" as helping to improve the resilience of food systems. It cited specific examples of such input, such as climate-resilient seeds and crop varieties. </p><p> The investment opportunity of six \"families\" of solutions is further elaborated on in the report. </p><p> They are climate intelligence solutions such as hazard warning providers or catastrophe risk modelling, climate-resilient building materials, flood defence solutions, urban and industrial water efficiency, emergency medical products and services, and climate-adapted agricultural input.</p><p> These sectors, noted the report, are expected to grow by between 4 per cent and 15 per cent over the next five years. </p><p> Climate intelligence solutions, in particular, have the highest growth potential of around 15 per cent. Flood defence solutions have a growth projection of between 7 per cent and 10 per cent, while emergency medical products and services are expected to grow by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. </p><p> With the impact of rising temperatures and extreme weather events intensifying, the market for climate adaptation and resilience solutions will only continue to grow, the authors noted. </p><p> \"By investing in this space, private equity firms can position themselves to capture a rapidly expanding market and contribute to global climate resilience across industries, communities and ecological systems,\" BCG and Temasek said. </p><p> \"By acting now, investors can help build a more resilient world while securing a stake in one of the defining markets of the future.\"</p><p>Singapore is moving to counter climate change. For instance, studies are ongoing to determine the best sea-level-rise protection efforts for different segments of the coastline. The Republic is cushioning food supply chain shocks by diversifying import sources and increasing the capacity of local farms. </p><p> The 11th edition of Ecosperity Week gathers business leaders, policymakers, investors and civil society to discuss how Asia's efforts to tackle climate change can be accelerated. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>With the impact of rising temperatures and extreme weather events intensifying, the market for climate adaptation and resilience solutions will only continue to grow, said the report by BCG and Temasek.

Was it hotter than usual? One's answer is most likely in the affirmative, whether you were in Asia, Europe or the US, and regardless of whether the question was asked this year or last.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An analysis by the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service found that 2023 was the hottest year in data records going back to 1850, with an\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record\">average temperature</url>\u00a0of 1.48\u00b0C warmer than the pre-industrial average. Unfortunately, this has persisted in 2024, with June 2024 being the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/global-climate-summary-june-2024\">warmest June on record</url>\u00a0worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, over 1,300 people died as a result of heat-related illnesses during the Hajj pilgrimage. In the nine days between 16 to 24 June, nearly 5 billion people were\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatecentral.org/report/global-heat-review-june-2024\">exposed</url>\u00a0to extreme heat, including 620 million people in India and 579 million in China.</p><p>Climate change has made extreme weather events such as heatwaves more frequent, intense, and prolonged. Extreme heat adversely\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40641-019-00121-2\">affects</url>\u00a0one's cognitive abilities and emotional responses,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/extreme-heat-linked-with-reduced-cognitive-performance-among-young-adults-in-non-air-conditioned-buildings/\">making us</url>\u00a0less logical, more angry and more aggressive. It exacerbates pre-existing conditions and can be deadly.</p><p>In addition to mortality rates and public health, it also has a huge impact on businesses and economies. Take infrastructure as an example: vital infrastructure such as power grids, mobile networks, data centres, roads, and airfields may fail as a result of intense heat stress, leading to power outages, loss of communications, and flight cancellations, causing significant economic losses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate adaptation in extreme heat\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>The rising threat of heatwaves highlights the urgent need to focus on climate adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Following the 2003 European heat wave that killed an estimated 70,000 people, France became one of the first countries to create a national heatwave plan that incorporated early warning systems, mandatory insulation in construction regulation, and the replacement of tarmac with other reflective materials.</p><p>Since then, many cities around the world have formulated plans to future-proof their communities and infrastructure to make them climate resilient. One example is Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India, which launched its heat action plan in 2013, one of the first in South Asia. In addition to building community awareness, initiating an early warning system and capacity building among healthcare professionals, the plan also includes a low-cost cool roofs programme for commercial and residential buildings, with the purpose of saving energy, increasing thermal comfort and reducing cooling demand. A\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ahmedabad-heat-action-plan-2018.pdf\">study</url>\u00a0that evaluated the effectiveness of the Ahmedabad plan found that an estimated 2,380 deaths were avoided as a result.</p><p>The above examples highlight that, if done right, adaptation initiatives can bring multiple benefits by reducing future losses, delivering economic benefits through risk mitigation and management, and bringing better social and environmental outcomes. However, despite its importance, climate adaptation initiatives received only 5% of total climate finance in 2021 to 2022. The 2023 UN Adaptation Gap Report puts the adaptation financing gap at USD 194 to 366 billion per year.</p><p>While governments and international development banks have been key in financing some of these initiatives, it is clear that private financing will become increasingly important in achieving rapid and ambitious adaptation. For companies and investors, this creates potential opportunities in a range of critical sectors, such as infrastructure, transportation, energy, and agriculture.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Supporting climate adaptation\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>Investing in adaptation not only reduces risks and economic losses, but also boosts productivity and sparks innovation, providing net economic benefits of between two to ten dollars for every dollar invested,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://files.wri.org/s3fs-public/uploads/GlobalCommission_Report_FINAL.pdf\">according</url>\u00a0to the Global Commission on Adaptation. Further,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afire.org/summit/climateopportunity/\">research</url>\u00a0by Climate Alpha suggests that \"investing early in climate-resilient geographies will generate more than 70% higher returns on real estate portfolios by 2030 alone\".</p><p>As the urgency to avoid climate-related losses grows -\u00a0and taking into account factors such as changing consumer demand, emerging technologies and operational necessities - there will be additional opportunities for the private sector to invest in adaptation. A deeper understanding of climate impacts and risks would allow the integration of climate risks into business models and guide investment decisions.</p><p>One often cited challenge in achieving scale in climate adaptation, and indeed in climate mitigation initiatives, is a lack of expertise in mobilising climate finance. An understanding in sustainable finance taxonomy, sustainability disclosures, climate risk management, policy incentives, and the latest financing products structures are among the most sought-after skillsets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The importance of capacity building\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>In view of this, the Capacity-building Alliance of Sustainable Investment (CASI) was set up with the aim of delivering high quality, high impact sustainable finance capacity building services in emerging markets, in order to accelerate the market development of sustainable finance and create more investable and bankable climate projects.</p><p>Since its inception in 2023, CASI's membership has grown to include international knowledge providers from supranational agencies, climate think tanks, international consultancies, and global financial institutions. Collaborative initiatives like CASI play a pivotal role in capitalising on these opportunities by fostering knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and strategic partnerships across global markets. By offering targeted programmes, seminars, and bespoke capacity-building services, CASI's target is to train 100,000 people globally by 2030.</p><p>As a founding member of CASI, the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://rpc.cfainstitute.org/en/\">CFA Institute</url>\u00a0will\u00a0leverage\u00a0on its expertise in\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://store.cfainstitute.org/climate-finance/\">sustainability research</url>\u00a0and educational offerings to accelerate capacity building, raise professionalism, and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/climate-risk-valuation-investing\">promote</url>\u00a0efficient capital allocation. Our research on climate and net zero investing is available to all and can be accessed on the CFA Research and Policy Centre. This research is further supported by a suite of\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/esg-investing\">educational offerings</url>.</p><p>So, as we brace for yet another sweltering summer, it is clear that climate adaptation and its financing is a pressing necessity. The private sector has an important role to play, and with proactive capacity building and strategic initiatives, these scorching challenges can be transformed into opportunities for a more resilient future.</p><p>--</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Mary Leung, CFA, Senior Advisor, Research and Advocacy, Asia Pacific, CFA Institute</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REGSIA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REGSIA2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CKJ-X9V1-DXH6-C359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1115\"/><timeReceived>11:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 inAsia Media Pte Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Regulation Asia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>July 28, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Contributed Article</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ESG / Sustainability</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CASI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CFA Institute</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>climate adaptation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Alpha</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>climate change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>climate finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>climate risk management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>climate risks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>net-zero</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sustainability disclosures</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sustainable Finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxonomy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Initiative &amp;

US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion by 2030, with the amount expected to grow even larger thereafter amid worsening extreme weather events, a report has found.</p><p> The study, The Private Equity Opportunity in Climate Adaptation and Resilience, was launched by Boston Consulting Group and Temasek on Wednesday (May 7) at Ecosperity Week 2025, a sustainability event.</p><p> The rising need for financing is evident, as 87 per cent of countries now have at least one national-level climate adaptation policy, strategy or plan in place, the report showed. </p><p> Despite the projected growth in expenditure, current global spending on climate solution projects is only about US$76 billion a year, with public sources contributing the bulk of the amount.</p><p> \"To meet the rising needs by 2030, there is an opportunity for private investment in the current gap,\" the authors of the report said, also noting that the need for solutions is generating emerging value pools across value chains. </p><p> Such projects range from flood defence and wildfire protection to climate intelligence and water efficiency technologies. </p><p> Motivated to clear the misconception of climate projects being complex and nascent, lead author Daniel Oehling, a managing director and partner at BCG's Singapore office, said the report laid out the different types of investment opportunities in seven impact themes. </p><p> \"There are many companies that are sizable today, are specialised in what they do, highly profitable and fit to build for private industry networks,\" he said. </p><p> Examples with opportunities for both investments and exits include the flood defence business. </p><p> High levels of investment activityIn particular, the market for flood defence products, estimated at more than US$2 billion in 2024, would grow by 12 to 15 per cent at a compounded annual growth rate over the next five years.</p><p>  Its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margin is estimated at 20 to 30 per cent, based on the report.</p><p> The segment is where several ventures, such as Germany's IBS Technics and Norway's AquaFence, are at different stages of growth.</p><p> The report also identified five factors that can help private equity investors determine the most promising projects, and assess their attractiveness in both the short and medium terms. </p><p> Projects that have pulled in high levels of investment activity but are putting out weak forward-looking signals include smart-grid management and precision agriculture. </p><p> On the other hand, projects in climate-resilient building design, as well as rainwater and run-off harvesting, are projecting strong forward-looking signals, but are getting limited investment traction. </p><p> At the same time, the report also warns investors to be mindful of potential conflicts in the environmental outcomes of some solutions. </p><p> For example, manufacturing of concrete and steel, while playing important roles in fortifying infrastructure assets against extreme weather, consumes large amounts of energy and carbon. </p><p> \"Investors in solutions such as low-carbon concrete and green steel, which address both climate adaptation and resilience and other environmental objectives, stand to benefit more in the long term,\" it said.</p><p> Speaking at a panel at the launch of the report, Jay Koh, co-founder and managing director of climate-resilience focused private equity firm The Lightsmith Group, highlighted the importance of investing in scalable solutions now, \"so that 15 years from now, when that inevitable future has arrived, we have the solutions available at scale to try to combat that\".

Initiatives that tap the green budget include Tuas Nexus, which is expected to be the world's first fully energy self-sufficient greenfield facility that integrates water treatment and solid waste management. The facility is estimated to cost about $6 billion. </p><p> The building of more cycling paths is also expected to cost about $1 billion, MOF said in its paper. </p><p> The ministry estimates that it has spent more than $2 billion on green initiatives in the 2021 to 2024 financial years. </p><p> To fund long-term green expenditure beyond 2030, the Government has also introduced measures such as a carbon tax to help fund decarbonisation efforts and support the transition to a green economy, MOF added. </p><p> The Government can also borrow money through green bonds to finance nationally significant green infrastructure projects. This will help to spread the costs across generations that will directly benefit from these projects. </p><p> As at January 2025, the Government has issued $9.2 billion of green bonds to finance the expansion of the electric MRT network, MOF noted. </p><p> Money has also been set aside for coastal protection measures to protect Singapore against rising sea levels. These are estimated to cost more than $100 billion over the next 100 years, and MOF said it has put an initial $5 billion into this fund. </p><p> The ministry has also put $5 billion into a fund to invest in critical infrastructure needed for energy transition, such as undersea cables to import low-carbon electricity and new hydrogen terminals and pipelines. </p><p> Regarding state investors, the Government expects them to take into account the impact of climate change on their investments, said MOF. It noted that GIC, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and investment firm Temasek have integrated sustainability considerations into their investment processes, although the Government does not direct their individual investment decisions or prescribe specific sustainability outcomes. </p><p> MOF said in its paper: \"Climate change has significant interactions with public finances. Governments around the world need to facilitate the carbon transition and adapt nimbly to the effects of climate change, which require significant investments and fiscal resources. </p><p> \"At the same time, climate change can cause severe disruptions to human and economic activities, but also holds the promise of creating new economic opportunities. These, in turn, affect public finances.\" </p><p> It noted that governments face the problem of balancing three things: the pace of decarbonisation, the impact on economic competitiveness, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. </p><p> \"There is a need to balance these trade-offs while allocating finite resources to competing priorities,\" MOF said, adding that this problem is made worse by technological uncertainty and the high costs of decarbonisation pathways. </p><p> Hence, it said, it is important, now more than ever, for governments to incorporate sustainability considerations in the management of public finances. This ensures that budgets are aligned with national climate and sustainability strategies. </p><p> \"Finance serves as a crucial lever to support governments' climate goals, and enable a whole-of-society transformation to achieve optimal sustainability outcomes. If done well, climate mitigation and adaptation can create economic and social benefits,\" MOF said. </p><p> On Jan 23, MOF also released its refreshed Singapore Green Bond Framework. </p><p> First published in 2022, the framework lays out the requirements around sovereign green bonds issued to finance green public sector projects. It ensures that the public sector upholds a high level of green standards in line with best practices in the industry. </p><p> \"The addition of these science-based and robust thresholds ensures that the projects financed by public sector green bonds under the framework will contribute substantially to Singapore's climate ambition,\" MOF said. </p><p> The framework governs factors such as what the proceeds from the green bonds will be used for, what sort of projects will be funded, how the proceeds from the green bonds are tracked, and how the whole process is reported to investors. </p><p> The Singapore Government has planned to issue up to $35 billion in public sector green bonds by 2030 to support the growth of the sustainable finance market here. </p><p> These issuances will also help to attract green capital and investors, and anchor Singapore as a green finance hub in Asia, MOF said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In total, the Government expects to commit more than $10 billion in fiscal spending for projects like the management of climate-related risks in the decade up to financial year 2030, under the Singapore Green Plan.

Good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you today at this SEAPAW Ecosperity event.</p><p>Impact of climate change on Southeast Asia</p><p>2. It is fitting that this event is called \"Water at the Core: Accelerating Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia\", as climate change impacts are becoming more apparent worldwide in the form of more extreme weather events, such as droughts and storms. Although the world has made some progress in climate mitigation since the Paris Agreement, efforts remain insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. If global temperature rise overshoots this and reaches 2 degree Celsius, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that 50% more of the world's population would live under water stress.</p><p>3. Water stress arises from the extremes of too little and too much water. Too little water, and many of Southeast Asia's economic activities, such as agriculture and tourism which depend on water, will be severely affected. Too much water, and this could lead to sea level rise and flooding, threatening our people given our geography comprising long coastlines, low-lying islands, and dense urban centres.</p><p>Singapore Water Story</p><p>4. These are among the starkest environmental challenges facing Singapore. As a small island city-state with limited natural catchment, Singapore is amongst the most water stressed in the world. Our Water Story demonstrated that acknowledging our vulnerabilities can spur us to overcome them by leveraging technologies to diversify our water sources. Singapore began studying the feasibility of reclaimed water since the 1970s, and today NEWater has become one of our weather-resilient sources in Singapore's \"Four National Taps\" strategy.</p><p>5. At the same time, being situated in the tropics also results in the problem of too much water within a short span of time. In the 1960s and 1970s, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon season. While Singapore has invested in expanding our drainage infrastructure, it is not feasible to expand our drains to cater for every extreme rainfall event. We are thus enhancing community resilience by supporting our community to better prepare for and respond to flood incidents, such as by issuing early warnings of potential flood. The next chapter of flood resilience will be coastal protection to deal with rising sea levels. Many of you would have heard about initiatives such as our Long Island, which will not only protect our low-lying east coast from sea level rise, but also create new land for future opportunities.</p><p>Investing in Climate Resilience</p><p>6. Our experience has shown us that it is important to understand our risks clearly, start early and invest conscientiously to strengthen our climate resilience. However, there is serious underinvestment worldwide. According to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative, global investments in climate adaptation and resilience initiatives made up only 5% of total annual climate finance and 20-30% of projected annual climate adaptation financing needs. I would like to touch on two areas where there are opportunities to do better.</p><p>7. First, the private sector. We need to increase the private sector's awareness of physical climate risks and the cost-of-inaction. Understanding climate risks is key to business strategy and future-proofing your business. When it comes to addressing climate risks, prevention is better than cure. A small investment in climate resilience today can help to address broader risks, and mitigate potentially larger future losses. There are many ways to help companies tackle climate risks. First, we need better climate projections, such as the findings from Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3), which we completed last year. V3 provides the highest resolution of climate projections over Southeast Asia for parameters such as rainfall and temperature. Through our recently launched V3 Data Sharing Portal, companies can tap on V3 climate projections to understand the climate risks in their supply chains under future conditions. Next, climate disclosure frameworks can encourage companies to pay closer attention to their climate risks across geographies and supply chains. Beginning Financial Year (FY) 2025, there will be a move towards mandatory climate-related disclosures for listed companies and large non-listed companies in Singapore. These disclosures will be aligned with the framework developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This will raise companies' awareness and spur them to take a more informed view of addressing climate risks. I encourage companies to leverage climate projections such as V3 for your climate risk assessment, and to undertake climate disclosure seriously.</p><p>8. With climate disclosure, the risks become more apparent, and companies would seek to reduce their climate exposure. One way would be to relocate their operations to another place with less climate risk. A more beneficial approach would be for companies to invest in where they operate, increasing the community's climate resilience while also strengthening their supply chain resilience. For example, Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) is Singaporean wafer fabrication company who has been recycling water at an average of 67%, above the industry average of 45%. This improves onsite water efficiency and decreases water consumption, leading to a more water-resilient supply chain, especially during the dry months of the year. I would like to challenge companies to explore how you can do likewise for your operations throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p>9. The second area we can focus on is to enhance adaptation finance. We can do so by making climate adaptation projects more bankable through blended finance, and also by building capability in climate finance.</p><p>10. Collectively, we should explore how to support blended finance in climate adaptation, so that we can create more bankable projects that crowd in private capital to plug the gap in adaptation financing. This is important as only about 2% of adaptation finance comes from private and philanthropic sectors. Blended finance can make adaptation projects more bankable through a combination of concessional capital, technical assistance and de-risking mechanisms. Concessional capital could comprise grants or guarantees, with technical assistance covering areas such as project development to strengthen investor confidence and project bankability. We need to reduce the project risks sufficiently to attract private commercial capital.</p><p>11. Putting these altogether, we should also recognise the critical role that local partners and NGOs like SEAPAW play. SEAPAW builds on the Singapore International Foundation (SIF)'s track record over the past 34 years, whose projects have created community benefits in more than 28 countries. Through SEAPAW's network of partners, it can localise global solutions and partner them with the right financing options which are suited to the needs of communities. One example is SEAPAW's project in Sarawak, Malaysia, which aims to bring clean water to rural communities. The project uses advancements in membrane technology in the water purification process to enhance water resilience and address the issue of clean water supply. At the same time, it is powered sustainably by a renewable energy source. Once the pilot is successful and partnered with the right financing, it can be scaled up to benefit many more communities within Southeast Asia. This multi-stakeholder approach taken by SEAPAW allows them to harness the strengths from across the public, private and philanthropic sectors, and bring them to bear in addressing the climate challenges we face in our region.</p><p>Closing</p><p>12. In closing, similar to how Singapore made early investments in NEWater, which is now a key pillar for our water resilience, we need to invest now for the future for our climate resilience. We need to act decisively today for the long-term, by increasing the knowledge on risks and encouraging climate adaptation finance.

Bayan Group is spearheading cooperative governance training, while Mayani will deliver climate-smart and sustainable agriculture modules.</p><p>Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Facility: This facility is designed to finance climate-resilient infrastructure, including smart greenhouses, precision irrigation, rainwater harvesting systems, drought-resistant seed varieties, and bio-fertilisers. These upgrades aim to enable year-round, adaptive production while reducing vulnerability to environmental shocks.</p><p>The initiative also includes creating a cooperative development manual to ensure scalability and replicability across other regions.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/trumps-trade-barriers-and-crypto-bets-rewriting-the-rules-of-global-markets-20250711/\">Trump's trade barriers and crypto bets: Rewriting the rules of global markets</url></p><p>'This important partnership will aim to support local farmers and fishermen to adapt climate-resilient practices and strengthen their businesses, while also striving to contribute towards the improvement of food security in the Philippines,' said Sandeep Uppal, CEO of HSBC Philippines.</p><p>For Mayani and Bayan, the strategy is both grassroots and systems-oriented. 'If agricultural cooperativesare effectively mobilised to serve as agents of climate adaptation, social, economic, and even environmental benefits could potentially be delivered to its millions of members,' said Prof. Carlo Sagun, CEO of Bayan Group.</p><p>Mayani co-founder Ochie San Juan framed the intervention as a response to intensifying climate risks: 'We see [climate hazards] as known constants in agriculture, and it's high-time we tackle them head on.'</p><p>The program will begin in vulnerable food corridors in Luzon and Visayas this year and plans to expand into the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in 2026. The latter phase integrates peacebuilding and economic revitalisation into the agricultural agenda, addressing ecological and socio-political fragility.</p><p>In a country where over 70 per cent of the food supply is produced by smallholders, climate change has emerged as a compounding threat to livelihoods and food security. Vulnerable to increasingly erratic weather patterns yet under-resourced for adaptation, Filipino farmers face a dual crisis. The situation is especially acute for women smallholders, who face disproportionate challenges due to limited access to training, financing, and agricultural inputs.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/profitable-ai-driven-and-ipo-ready-inside-carros-next-chapter-20250711/\">Profitable, AI-driven, and IPO-ready: Inside Carro's next chapter</url></p><p>Against this backdrop, Mayani and Bayan's collaboration aims to operationalise clustered, smallholder-led cooperatives that integrate regenerative farming practices and climate-smart technologies to future-proof rural food production.</p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/hsbc-funding-to-scale-climate-smart-agriculture-for-filipino-smallholders-20250711/\">Mayani, Bayan tap HSBC funding to scale climate-smart agriculture for Filipino smallholders appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/hsbc-funding-to-scale-climate-smart-agriculture-for-filipino-smallholders-20250711/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG11931401JZWH4VKJVQERPW3TJEK23YBS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G7M-2GG3-RTFS-Y4FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><timeReceived>10:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Surely there's money to be made there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's sovereign wealth investors certainly think so. Two separate reports by GIC, which manages Singapore's foreign reserves, and Temasek, which mainly invests in equities, focus on investment opportunities in climate adaptation.</p><p> Growing interestGIC, which wants to determine the long-term investment value of climate adaptation, estimates that global annual revenues from a set of adaptation solution categories could grow from US$1 trillion today to US$4 trillion by 2050. </p><p> The investment opportunity from these categories could increase from US$2 trillion today to US$9 trillion by 2050, of which US$3 trillion can be attributed to global warming. </p><p> These assume that global warming will reach 2.7 deg C by the end of the century.</p><p> Temasek's report, which focuses on private equity opportunities, reckons that annual worldwide demand for adaptation financing could grow to between US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion from 2025 to 2030. </p><p> That is far more than current levels of adaptation financing, which averages around US$76 billion a year and is mostly from public coffers.</p><p> But interest is definitely growing. Temasek notes the launch of a number of dedicated adaptation and resilience investment funds since 2019, including the Lightsmith Climate Resilience Partners' US$185 million fund, the US$250 million Mirova Environment Acceleration Capital Fund and the targeted US$100 million InsuResilience Investment Fund Private Equity II fund.</p><p> Defining challengeClimate adaptation refers to the broad class of climate action that seeks to address the effects of climate change. It's distinct from climate mitigation, which is the type of climate action aimed at reducing climate change.</p><p> Global mitigation efforts have been insufficient so far to keep warming on track to stay below 1.5 deg C, a threshold past which catastrophic climate change becomes significantly more probable. That reality has made adaptation more important.</p><p> But what exactly counts as adaptation? Simple rules that investors can use to screen for potential investments are difficult to write. As Temasek explains, adaptation revenue streams \"tend to be embedded in pre-existing industrial sectors such as materials, engineering procurement and construction, and infrastructure\". This makes it difficult to clearly define adaptation solutions providers.</p><p> Temasek, with consultant BCG, maps the universe of investment opportunities into seven impact themes:</p><p> GIC, with Bain &amp; Co, identifies 14 categories of adaptation solutions that it deems to address the most likely and impactful climate hazards, and are investable:</p><p> Early bird benefitsBoth reports suggest that adaptation opportunities are still undervalued, and that it pays to invest early.</p><p> Temasek notes that due to the local nature of adaptation measures -- for example, North America uses detention and retention basis to curb inland flooding while Asia uses pipes and drains to divert floodwaters -- investors have the opportunity to enter at lower valuations before valuations account for the potential of market expansion.</p><p> However, pure plays might only comprise early-stage targets at this time; growth and buyout private equity investors might find only targets whose adaptation businesses are currently small but growing.</p><p> GIC estimates that 2050 revenues will exceed current business forecasts by 61 per cent largely because current models do not adequately price in growing demand for adaptation solutions.</p><p> Furthermore, GIC says its model's sensitivity to different climate scenarios is relatively low for the next 25 years because the impact of global warming only becomes more severe in the latter half of the century. This means that current investments can enjoy a fairly high level of confidence about returns.</p><p> Long-term investors have a \"unique opportunity to invest in a space where company earnings may positively surprise as demand for adaptation solutions increases\", GIC writes.</p><p> This article first appeared in BT's ESG Insights newsletter on May 9</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Exposed sandbanks due to drought at the Solimoes River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon River.

And the investment value is less volatile in different scenarios of severity of rising temperatures, the report found.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When it comes to climate action, decarbonisation, or cutting emissions, has been a key focus. But as climate change hits the world harder, adaptation efforts to prepare for impacts are also gaining traction. </p><p> Demand for adaptation strategies tends to increase after a climate-driven disaster. For example, Pakistan said it will build climate-resistant homes for flood victims after the country was hit by severe floods in 2022. </p><p> But the report, which included research input from global management consultancy Bain &amp; Company, said that if countries pay more attention to the physical risks of climate change and start taking action earlier, revenue growth and investment opportunities in this area could accelerate before 2050. </p><p> The report, released on May 2, offers insight into the role of the private sector in financing the development of  adaptation solutions.</p><p> Investing in climate adaptation -- or solutions to protect people from the impacts of climate change, like building sea walls to keep out rising tides -- is often assumed to be the responsibility of governments. </p><p> But the authors of the report said: \"We believe that companies offering these solutions present promising investment opportunities, enabling investors to contribute to building economic and community resilience.\"</p><p> For instance, the report pointed to firms offering weather intelligence, wind-resistant building components and flood-resistant construction materials as having growth potential. Weather intelligence allows companies to determine how weather data could impact their operations. Among other uses, this could help agricultural businesses with irrigation and harvesting planning, said the report. </p><p> Wind-resistant building components enhance resilience against storms and hurricanes -- disasters that accounted for over 55 per cent of global economic damage from climate-related events between 2000 and 2024, said GIC and Bain. </p><p> With the impacts of climate change being felt more keenly across the globe, multilateral organisations, including the UN and humanitarian groups, are calling for more sectors to get involved in adaptation planning to save lives and livelihoods.</p><p> For instance, as part of the international climate change negotiations, countries are urged to have in place national adaptation plans -- road maps to help them prepare for climate change impacts -- by 2025. </p><p> The World Meteorological Organisation has declared 2024 as the warmest year on record. The WMO has also said extreme weather, climate and water-related events caused nearly 12,000 disasters from 1970 to 2021, with reported economic losses estimated at US$4.3 trillion and rising.</p><p> Multiple scientific studies have pointed to the benefits of adapting to climate change over inaction. </p><p> For instance, a scientific study published in 2021 estimated that global climate risk can be halved through ambitious adaptation. A different study that year said US$16 billion invested in agriculture per year would prevent about 78 million people from starving or chronic hunger caused by climate change impacts. </p><p> The report's authors noted that while rising physical climate risks would have material financial impact on investment portfolios, there are few studies on climate-related investment opportunities focusing on adaptation.</p><p> \"This insight prompted us to expand our investment research to include climate adaptation alongside decarbonisation,\" they said, when asked what prompted GIC to embark on this research.</p><p> Other than adaptation, the other key prong of climate action is mitigation, which refers to activities that can reduce the amount of planet-warming gases in the atmosphere. There has been more research on mitigation investment opportunities, compared with that for adaptation.</p><p> \"Although our work in this area is still in its early stages, it indicates a growing demand for adaptation solutions across both established technologies and emerging innovations as the physical impacts of climate change become more pronounced,\" the authors added. </p><p> The report had also compared the investment opportunity for adaptation solutions across different climate scenarios. </p><p> The reference scenario assumes no further global warming beyond current conditions. The other three scenarios reflect different warming trajectories. </p><p> The temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, the world's climate pact, is to limit warming to not more than 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels to avert harsh climate impacts. </p><p> In the report, the \"base case\" assumes that all current climate policies are implemented, so warming reaches 2.7 deg C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The \"low case\" offers a more optimistic perspective, where the world reaches net-zero emissions by 2050, so warming is limited to 1.4 deg C by end-century.</p><p> The \"high case\" reflects the opposite scenario, where the global green transition fails, resulting in warming exceeding 4 deg C above pre-industrial levels. </p><p> The report found that compared with the base case, the estimated value of investment opportunity in adaptation strategies by 2050 in the low-case and high-case scenarios showed a variation of about 4 per cent. </p><p> This indicates that whether the world limits warming to below 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels or whether warming exceeds 4 deg C, the total investment value of the sector would not change much.</p><p> The report's authors said this finding indicates that, compared with mitigation, the climate adaptation theme is less exposed to volatility from climate policy changes. \"This suggests investors can build conviction in this space without needing to predict the precise climate scenario that will unfold.\" </p><p> Asked how investors could start positioning themselves to seize these opportunities, GIC said: \"Climate adaptation is a fast-changing space, with scientists advancing our understanding of climate hazards, engineers improving or inventing new adaptation solutions, and standard-setters creating new investment taxonomies.\" </p><p> Key areas for investors to monitor include the policy landscape, the economic viability and scalability of these solutions to ensure capital is deployed into opportunities that deliver good risk-adjusted returns over the long term, and the speed and severity of physical impact of climate change. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A seawall at Marina South Pier in Singapore.

Are companies doing enough to build resilience, for instance, so that they aren't hurt by climate change'</p><p> Adaptation is the other side of that coin. \"Obviously, this region (Asia-Pacific) needs to adapt to that physical impact. And climate change adaptation is an investment opportunity,\" she added. </p><p> Adaptation finance, however, is still nascent. Of the three investment pillars within abrdn's climate transition bond framework, climate adaptation projects have the lowest allocation. </p><p> The other two investment pillars are emission reductions from high-emitting sectors, and innovative climate solutions.</p><p> Climate adaptation projects have historically been under-invested because the climate community's focus was on containing climate impact through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> Last year's global stocktake -- a report card of the progress made in addressing the climate crisis since the Paris Agreement -- showed that adaptation finance made up 28 per cent of all financial support for climate purposes between 2019 and 2020.</p><p> Mitigation finance, in comparison, made up 57 per cent. The rest were for both mitigation and adaptation purposes. </p><p> Another reason adaptation projects get less financing: They tend to be public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems, which do not lend themselves to commercial financing models.</p><p> Climate mitigation projects tend to be productive assets. A solar power plant, for instance, can deliver an income upon completion, but a flood barrier will not.</p><p> Most of abrdn's debt investment in adaptation is in government-issued green bonds tied to a climate adaptation purpose, such as building flood mitigation infrastructure. </p><p> In the equity space, Welsh-Rose flagged potentially attractive investment opportunities among companies developing fire-resistant materials.</p><p> These materials could become important amid rising incidences of bushfires as the planet heats up.</p><p> Welsh-Rose said investors' earlier hesitation to focus on climate adaptation has been driven partly out of concern that doing so may take the focus away from mitigation. </p><p> \"It's also partly to do with a little bit of human nature. If we talk too much about adaptation, does that mean we expect that the world's going to be a terrible place'\"</p><p> Yet, all available metrics indicate that the world is not on track to meet the target of limiting global warming by 1.5 degrees Celsius. This means the urgency of financing and implementing adaptation solutions has increased.</p><p> There is concern that some institutional investors in the United States are no longer as committed to climate-driven investment principles, but Welsh-Rose disagreed with this interpretation.</p><p> Several investors, including State Street, have pulled out of climate-focused alliances over the last few months. These withdrawals are more likely because institutional investors are trying to avoid violating antitrust regulations, she said.</p><p> Various US regulators have indicated that collective action by companies and investors to reduce emissions or combat climate change could be in breach of antitrust laws. An agreement to impose net-zero emissions goals, for instance, could amount to a boycott.</p><p> The commitment to emissions reduction remains intact, she said, and there is little sign of spillover effects on other markets. </p><p> For abrdn, the regulatory environment means the fund has to be a lot more careful about the claims it makes around sustainability -- especially in the US market.</p><p> Welsh-Rose sees this as a positive development, though, as it helps maintain trust in the industry when fund managers exercise greater discipline around the environmental, social and corporate governance claims they make. </p><p> The global asset manager's assets under management (AUM) for investments stood at GBP366.7 billion (S$622 billion) at the end of 2023. </p><p> Funds categorised under Article 8 and 9 of the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation -- or funds that promote environmental or sustainability characteristics -- make up 14.7 per cent (GBP54 billion) of the total AUM.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Danielle Welsh-Rose, head of sustainability for Asia-Pacific at abrdn, says most of abrdn's debt investment in adaptation is in government-issued green bonds tied to a climate adaptation purpose, such as building flood mitigation infrastructure.

It's about understanding how deeply interconnected these risks are when you're running operations across multiple markets. </p><p> The numbers tell an interesting story: 61 per cent of global organisations admit they're unprepared for cyber threats, but in Singapore, businesses have developed what we see as an \"all-front defence strategy\", with remarkably consistent investment across all cybersecurity dimensions.</p><p> This balanced approach jumps out from the data. Singapore organisations maintain extraordinarily consistent cybersecurity investments (21 to 29 points across all measures), compared to the rather erratic patterns charted among regional neighbours like China (22 to 36 points), Hong Kong (17 to 34 points), and Japan (10 to 29 points). </p><p>Singapore's C-suite leaders seem to understand instinctively that you can't just shore up defences in one area when you're operating across multiple markets; that simply creates vulnerabilities elsewhere.</p><p> Climate change is perhaps the most telling example of this complexity. Singapore executives rate climate change concerns at 42 per cent -- significantly higher than in Hong Kong (16 per cent) and Japan (20 per cent). This isn't just about being environmentally conscious -- it reflects the hard reality that multi-market operations face climate risks that ripple across diverse geographies, regulatory environments, and supply chains. </p><p> One Singapore CEO put it rather bluntly: \"When a climate event hits one of our markets, the headache spreads through our entire regional operation in ways that single-market businesses just don't experience.\"</p><p> The same goes for navigating regulations: 71 per cent of global organisations confess they're not ready for international regulatory changes, but in Singapore, C-suite leaders have had to develop more balanced approaches to juggling technology resilience, data privacy, cybersecurity, ESG (environmental, social and governance) and AI regulations across multiple jurisdictions -- all at the same time.</p><p> This complexity conundrum demands a different sort of leadership. Singapore executives simply can't afford to become experts in one risk area while neglecting others. They need balanced competency across cybersecurity, climate adaptation, regulatory compliance and geopolitical navigation. Their leadership teams must be good at spotting connections between seemingly unrelated risks -- understanding how a climate event might trigger supply-chain problems while simultaneously creating regulatory headaches and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.</p><p> For C-suite leaders navigating Singapore's complex business environment, our research points to three essential strategies: First, resist the temptation to prioritise risks narrowly based on global trends. Second, approach risk management holistically, recognising that Singapore's position creates uniquely interconnected challenges. Finally, build leadership teams with diverse risk management capabilities rather than isolated specialists.</p><p> The Singapore complexity conundrum certainly makes life more difficult, but our data suggests it's also creating a hidden advantage. By mastering this balanced approach to risk, Singapore-based executives are developing skills that will become increasingly valuable as all global businesses face the interconnected challenges of tomorrow's business landscape.</p><p> The writer is partner, managing director and Singapore country leader at AlixPartners.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>C-suite leadership teams must be good at spotting connections between seemingly unrelated risks -- and understand how a climate event might trigger supply-chain problems while simultaneously creating regulatory headaches and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Water supply tends to be regulated utilities that operate in natural monopolies, which have defensive characteristics and stable cash flows.</p><p> Environmental services are generally engineering companies. This includes companies that design water and wastewater treatment plants, but also engineering and consulting companies that help industrial users of water map and reduce their water use.</p><p> In the water strategy portfolio are around 48 companies, the bulk of which are predominantly in North America. Positions, on average, are held for seven years, added Lecamp.</p><p> \"We think the best way to offer investors returns in the water universe is to stay with high-quality companies that have high return on invested capital,\" he elaborated, noting that these companies tend to be more in the US than the rest of the world.</p><p> As for returns generated for share investors in Pictet AM's water strategy, this is about 8.6 per cent per annum in euro terms, mainly driven by share prices appreciation of the listed equities, said Lecamp.  </p><p> Water reuse is one of four front of mind issues for Lecamp. He sees much untapped potential to address water availability challenges to meet growing needs for municipal drinking water and from industry. </p><p> He noted that by 2050, around 50 per cent of global water extraction could be reused, versus around 12 per cent today, as prospects for growth water reuse are being buoyed by technological disruptions and innovations.  </p><p> Lecamp's other front-of-mind issues are the growing penetration of professional waste management services, closing the water infrastructure spending deficit and the increase in private sector participation to achieve universal coverage of water and wastewater.</p><p> For one, public spending on water that averages 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product is insufficient to stop the ageing of water infrastructure, argues Lecamp. </p><p> Environmental opportunitiesMeanwhile, on the environment solutions front, Pictet AM is eyeing opportunities presented by what it estimates is a US$5 trillion market, which is growing at around seven to 8 per cent per annum.</p><p> Pictet AM's global environment opportunities strategy has around US$8 billion of AUM and is invested in around 40 to 45 companies, said senior investment manager Luciano Diana. </p><p> By geography, over 60 per cent of portfolio companies are in the US, while about 25 per cent are in Europe, said Diana. He added that some non-Asian portfolio companies have substantial Asian exposure in their business.   </p><p> For Pictet AM's environmental strategy, the focus is on investing in relatively mature technology and in companies that generate strong free cash flow, he said. The average holding period of investments is about 3.5 years. </p><p> Pictet AM breaks down environmental solutions into seven segments -- renewable energy, energy efficiency, dematerialised economy, sustainable agriculture and forestry, water supply and technology, waste management and recycling, and pollution control.</p><p> Currently, the largest segment of Pictet AM's portfolio in the environmental theme is in energy efficiency, which covers industrial efficiency, building efficiency and transportation electrification. </p><p> Diana said the exposure to renewable energy has been very low because \"there are a lot of companies that might grow revenues, but they operate in an industry that is very commoditised\".</p><p> Looking ahead, a growth driver that excites Diana is being in the early innings of a US investment wave which accelerates demand for power.  </p><p> He sees power demand growth in the US being spurred by demand for big data, increasing electrification and resurgence in industrial manufacturing. He noted US electricity generation could see a compound annual growth rate over the 2024-2030 period, which is six times that of the prior years this century.</p><p> The other big growth driver is growing demand for climate adaptation solutions, which is in turn being fuelled by extreme weather events, said Diana. </p><p> He sees a continued push for mitigation solutions to slow or prevent climate change, with an example being renewable energy, as well as for adaptation solutions to limit the damage that environmental changes cause such as flood defences.</p><p> Currently, Pictet AM's thematic equities platform has around US$70 billion in AUM across 16 strategies. There are over 70 investment professionals in thematic equities, led by its head Hans Peter Portner. </p><p> He views thematic equities as combining the liquidity benefits of listed equities with the tangibility of venture capital. </p><p> According to Portner, themes are pockets of economic activities underpinned by megatrends and that companies exposed to said pockets of economic activities have predictable value drivers as well as visibility on growth and margins.</p><p> The megatrends are in turn large social, economic, political, environmental or technological transformations, which represent tectonic shifts that occur over decades.</p><p> Pictet AM, which is part of Pictet Group, has been operating in the thematic equities space since 1995. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Cedric Lecamp, who leads Pictet Asset Management's water strategy, sees a US$1.4 trillion global water market growing at between 3 to 5 per cent annually, supporting a diversified investment universe.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you once again for the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources. I thank Simon and SIIA team for having me at this annual event again. This year's edition comes at a time of pivotal global geopolitical developments.</p><p>Climate change continues despite global headwinds</p><p>2. The rules based multilateral system is under pressure. Protectionism is rising, and trade barriers and supply chain disruptions are becoming more frequent. Governments and businesses are reassessing their priorities and strategies, including their environmental and climate ambitions.</p><p>3. We have also seen countries taking their foot off in climate action. Political support for decarbonisation is losing momentum and climate finance is becoming more elusive. Yet, we find ourselves confronted with an undeniable fact: climate change is here, and now. Its impact on lives is drastic and rising.</p><p>4. Many Southeast Asian countries have experienced extreme weather events recently:</p><p>* In the second half of 2024, intense floods swept across Malaysia and Thailand, displacing thousands of people and damaging infrastructure worth millions of dollars;</p><p>*Sweltering heatwaves are increasingly frequent across the ASEAN region. The Philippines experienced a severe heatwave throughout March and April this year, and Myanmar recording its highest ever April temperatures of 48.2C last year.</p><p>Importance of regional cooperation</p><p>5. As climate change intensifies amidst these uncertain times, the need for greater ASEAN cooperation to address the challenges faced by our region is more salient than ever.</p><p>6. ASEAN is making progress in climate action.</p><p>*Of the 10 ASEAN countries, eight have committed to an economy-wide net-zero target or carbon neutrality.</p><p>*The ASEAN Centre for Climate Change will be set up in Brunei Darulssalam to facilitate regional cooperation and coordination on climate change initiatives. All 10 ASEAN member states have signed the Establishment Agreement and the Centre will be officially stood up once the Agreement is ratified by member states.</p><p>*ASEAN is investing in renewable energy sources as the region's energy demand is expected to more than double by 2040. As a region, we are working towards integrating the power systems to form an ASEAN Power Grid, which will enhance regional energy security while decarbonising the power sector.</p><p>7. Many of us here today are from the agribusiness industry. Agribusiness and sustainable forestry practices have a pivotal role in ASEAN countries' climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.</p><p>Sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices</p><p>8. ASEAN countries are among the world's largest producers of agricultural commodities, contributing to about 80% of global palm oil, 80% of global rubber, and 20% of global rice production. The agriculture, forestry and fishing industries collectively contribute to about 10% of ASEAN's GDP, and remains a primary source of jobs for many people across the region.</p><p>9. Agriculture production is both a cause and a victim of climate change. According to a UN study, the various steps of farming, transportation, consumption and disposal emit a third of all human-caused greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, changing weather patterns such as intense heat and droughts decrease yield and productivity.</p><p>10. Hence, sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices are instrumental in climate action and resource conservation. By avoiding unsustainable farming practices, such as burning stubbles and slash-and-burn techniques, we could reduce the risk of deforestation and transboundary haze. Notably, Thailand, Lao PDR and Myanmar have made such efforts through the joint Clear Sky Strategy 2024-2030 launched last October.</p><p>11. Similarly, Indonesia's efforts to reduce deforestation through legislations and continued monitoring, as well as Malaysia's sustainable palm oil initiatives such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil Certification Scheme, show how we can balance economic needs with environmental protection.</p><p>12. Sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices is therefore an imperative, not an option. Besides positive impact on the environment, there are business advantages.</p><p>*Growing consumer awareness about environmental concerns has increased demand for certified-sustainable products. Certification marks such as the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) are helping the public to identify over 4300 products that meet eco-standards. In Singapore, the public sector has embarked on green procurement. Since 2016, the Singapore Government only buys paper that carry the Singapore Green Label, which gives assurance that suppliers practice sustainable forestry management.</p><p>*Commitment to sustainability also strengthens supply chain resilience and risk management. Sourcing from suppliers that practice sustainable agriculture reduces the risk of supply disruptions caused by environmental events or regulatory changes. It also helps companies mitigate reputational risk by ensuring that operations are environmentally responsible.</p><p>*There are also regulatory developments imposed by export markets. For example, the EU has announced its plans to introduce regulations on Deforestation-free Products (also known as EUDR). Companies that want to continue exports to the EU must therefore take compliance into consideration to maintain market access.</p><p>13. Singapore remains committed to supporting sustainable agribusinesses despite not having a significant traditional agriculture industry. We are a finance hub for many agribusinesses and commodity trades in the region, and we are growing our local agri-tech sector. We are also a very active centre in carbon services with many new carbon services company setting up headquarters and operations in Singapore.</p><p>14. We are collaborating closely with regional partners to develop climate-resilient crops and sustainable farming practices. Our researchers at the National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute are working closely with ASEAN countries to study the impact of climate change on ASEAN's agriculture sector to enhance regional food security. The study is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2026. The study will help ASEAN better manage the risks, so that we can plan our response to adapt to the impacts of climate change on crop production at national and local levels.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>15.In conclusion, I would like to summarise three key points:</p><p>* First, climate change waits for no one. We need to maintain the momentum of climate action in spite of the global headwinds, and keep a steady course in achieving the green transition.</p><p>*Second, it is imperative for ASEAN to deepen our cooperation in climate action. Fortunately, we are not starting from ground zero, and ASEAN countries must build on the work that has been done and continue the spirit of cooperation to take ASEAN forward.</p><p>*Third, sustainable agribusiness and forestry practices is good for business and the environment. We must ensure that our efforts to develop the agri-commodity sector align with our environmental commitments.</p><p>16. I hope that the 12th Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources catalyses thinking on the future of the agribusiness and forestry industry, and how they contribute to sustainability in ASEAN. I would like to thank SIIA once again for their efforts today.</p><p>17. I wish you fruitful discussions ahead. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066391764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FXF-Y4B3-RRW2-33X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1395\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 28, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Climate extremes are becoming the norm - heatwaves intensify, biodiversity is disappearing at alarming rates, urban systems strain under rapid growth, and energy grids buckle under unpredictable demand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These aren't isolated crises; they're interconnected stress points that demand an integrated, forward-looking response. Tinkering at the edges won't cut it anymore. What's needed is a fundamental rethinking of how we design systems - adaptive, intelligent, and built for long-term resilience.</p><p>Enter quantum technologies. Once confined to theoretical debates and high-security laboratories, quantum is rapidly shifting from abstraction to application. Its potential to reshape how we understand, model, and optimise complex ecological and economic systems is profound.</p><p>For a region as dynamic and diverse as Southeast Asia, quantum technologies offer a unique opportunity: not just to adopt the tools of the future, but to shape them with purpose.</p><p>Quantum tech: From Physics curiosity to sustainability catalyst</p><p>Unlike classical digital tools that struggle with multidimensional, probabilistic environments, quantum systems are intrinsically built for this terrain. Through phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and quantum coherence, they enable us to simulate molecular interactions with extraordinary precision, optimise energy systems in real time, and detect minute environmental shifts that were previously invisible.</p><p>For a region as ecologically rich, economically diverse, and digitally ambitious as ASEAN, quantum isn't just a technological leap - it's a strategic pathway to build resilience, sovereignty, and sustainability from the ground up.</p><p>As leading economies build out national quantum roadmaps, from the US and EU to China and Singapore, ASEAN has a unique window to define its own path. With the right coalitions, investments, and cross-sector partnerships, the region can go beyond catch-up. It can lead. The future of sustainability may well depend on it.</p><p>Five quantum applications with transformative potential for ASEAN</p><p>Smart energy systems optimisation</p><p>Quantum algorithms can supercharge how we model, balance, and distribute energy-critical for managing distributed renewables, urban demand, and rural micro-grids.

The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards 2025 showed how, across Asia and beyond, startups, NGOs, government agencies, and investors could come together to respond to the world's most urgent disasters. They are doing so not just with technology, but with the trust and coordination needed to scale impact where it matters most. From climate resilience in public health to real-time disaster mapping and comprehensive early warning systems, this growing community is redefining what it means to be ready.</p><p>Created by Prudence Foundation, the Awards drew 112 applications from 31 countries. Indeed, this shows that innovation in disaster technologies is gaining momentum. The seven finalists selected for the 2025 cohort reflected not just technical excellence, but deep relevance to on-the-ground needs. From drone-enabled healthcare logistics to wildfire detection AI, each offered a glimpse into what's possible when resilience is designed to serve people first. Far more than a competition, the SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards became a launchpad for partnerships and catalytic support to further develop and scale their solutions. It has become a catalyst for systems change and a proof point that resilience is a shared responsibility.</p><p>The challenge tracks: Building for now and what's next</p><p>This year, the Awards centered around two core challenge tracks: 1) Climate &amp; Health, and 2) Smart Resilience. Each track reflected a critical dimension of disaster response. The former addressed the compounding health risks driven by environmental change. Meanwhile, the latter focused on strengthening systems to better anticipate, withstand, and recover from crises.</p><p>The Climate &amp; Health track spotlighted technologies that confront the growing intersection of climate volatility and public health. From air quality deterioration and disease outbreaks to post-disaster medical access, these challenges demand solutions that work in both low-resource settings and high-impact zones. Finalists in this category brought forward ideas that made resilience tangible: drone logistics for essential healthcare supplies, solar-powered warmth for displaced families, and data-backed systems for clean indoor air.</p><p>Also read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/climate-health-under-threat-tech-life-saving-solutions-20250319/\">Climate and health under threat: How tech can provide life-saving solutions</url></p><p>The Smart Resilience track, on the other hand, explored how real-time information, community engagement, and infrastructure monitoring can reshape the speed and scale of response. These are systems that learn and adapt using AI, crowdsourced data, and IoT to close the gap between early warning and real-world action. From civic tech platforms to anticipatory action planning, these tools were grounded in the communities they serve and designed for long-term impact.</p><p>Each track was a reminder that resilience is never just about bouncing back. It is also about building forward, better and stronger.</p><p>Also read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/smart-resilience-harnessing-tech-disaster-preparedness-response-20250513/\">Smart Resilience: Harnessing tech for disaster preparedness and response</url></p><p>What real-world resilience really demands</p><p>Representatives of Climate &amp; Health category runner-ups Mat Zero and Nafas at Echelon Singapore 2025</p><p>The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards illuminates how innovation becomes impactful. One of the clearest takeaways? Resilience isn't just a technical challenge, but a systems challenge. The most effective solutions revealed a playbook for cross-sector alignment.</p><p>Startups, for one, must design with NGOs and responders in mind. The strongest tools weren't just cutting-edge-they were embedded in humanitarian operations. For instance, Smart Resilience winner  <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.petabencana.id/\">PetaBencana's real-time maps are part of Indonesia's national disaster protocol. The PetaBencana.id platform-and the open source software that powers not just PetaBencana.id, but also multiple platforms across Southeast Asia and beyond-is built entirely through a process of co-research with the widest variety of stakeholders. Every line of code is directly informed by the communities who use it, ensuring the technology evolves directly from the realities on the ground. It is proof that when the people who face disaster design the tools they use, resilience becomes not just possible but scalable.</url></p><p>In addition, first runner-up  <url normalizedValue=\"https://dastaa.anticipatoryaction.org/\">DASTAA's household-level risk assessment approach aims to shift the disaster management paradigm from response-based to data-driven and preparedness-focused. However, DASTAA itself is just a technology and it's the local governments that are in the driver's seat, implementing these data-driven solutions. Innovation works because it brings together data, technology, and people.</url></p><p>Representatives of Smart Resilience category runner-ups DASTAA (Naxa), YoujiVest, and Robotics Cats at Echelon Singapore 2025</p><p>Governments, too, must enable innovation through progressive regulation and procurement.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skyeair.tech/\">Skye Air, winner of the Climate &amp; Health category, has autonomous drone deliveries that are only possible because the Government in India supports drone delivery operations and has classified it's airspace in Green, Yellow and Red zones allowing likes of Skye Air to conduct various flight operations in Green and Yellow zones.</url></p><p>Similarly,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://caz.nafas.co.id/\">Nafas, the Climate &amp; Health second runner-up, designed its Clean Air Zone service to help organizations meet indoor air quality targets aligned with national and international standards. When regulation opens the door, the right technologies scale faster and safer.</url></p><p>Resilience also needs new thinking from investors and insurers. Smart Resilience second runner-up  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youjivest.com/en/\">YoujiVest's climate risk platform transforms dynamic climate analytics into actionable strategies-proving sustainability and profitability are not contradictory. By integrating real-time physical risk evaluation (e.g., wildfire/flood vulnerability) and transition risk pathways into underwriting and portfolio decisions, YoujiVest turns costly corporate responsibilities into cost-effective risk mitigation. For capital allocators, YoujiVest's insights enable resilience-focused investing-where climate adaptation isn't just ethical, but a core driver of competitive returns.</url></p><p>When communities lead, resilience follows</p><p>Building resilience also requires NGOs to move beyond aid distribution and into active adoption of emerging technologies. Climate &amp; Health first runner-up  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.matzero.com/\">Mat Zero's solar-heated mats, for instance, were field-tested in the Himalayas in Nepal, with plans to roll out further collaborative pilots internationally. Smart Resilience third runner-up</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://roboticscats.com/\">Robotics Cats' wildfire detection tech is deployed not only in public infrastructure, but also in conservation zones, where organisations like Hong Kong Bird Watching Society (HKBSW) use it to monitor both wildfire risks, wetland restoration, and wildlife behaviours. This signals a broader shift: NGOs aren't just delivery channels-they're becoming innovation partners.</url></p><p>Just as critically, survivors of disaster events are no longer passive aid recipients - they are co-creators of community-wide resilience. Platforms like  <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.petabencana.id/\">Peta Bencana are built on citizen-contributed data, turning everyday digital behaviour into real-time disaster intelligence. Other members of the community like</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/bikescoutsphilippines/\">Bike Scouts and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://alertoph.com/\">Alerto PH harness grassroots connectivity, enabling people to alert one another in places where infrastructure breaks down. These models prove that resilience works best when it's not handed down but built from the ground up.</url></p><p>The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Community shows that when each sector plays to its strengths and shares ownership of the outcome, resilience stops being a buzzword. It becomes infrastructure and part of a system that saves lives before, during, and after disaster events. And that's where real impact is materialised.</p><p>Also read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/safe-steps-d-tech-awards-2025-highlights-global-innovations-in-disaster-resilience-20250617/\">SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards 2025 highlights global innovations in disaster resilience</url></p><p>Join the community shaping what comes next</p><p>The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards 2025 is created by the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prudentialplc.com/en/prudence-foundation\">Prudence Foundation, in partnership with UNDRR (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifrc.org/\">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://avpn.asia/\">Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://mranti.my/\">Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology &amp; Innovation (MRANTI), and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.

Both countries are advancing sustainable urban living and there is growing scope for collaboration among businesses, researchers and policymakers to create solutions that make sustainability a reality today, she added.</p><p> Lastly, she noted the importance of supply chain resilience and building digital trade networks. As global supply chains face growing pressures from climate risks and geopolitics, she said that Singapore and the Netherlands as \"trusted, connected trading hubs\" can collaborate.</p><p> Anneke Adema, ambassador of the Netherlands to Singapore and Brunei, described the investment relationship between Singapore and the Netherlands as a \"two-way street\". </p><p> She highlighted four key similarities between Singapore and the Netherlands that contribute to the successful relationship -- both countries are outward-looking, driven by innovation, share a strong entrepreneurial spirit and have mutual trust.</p><p> Among the accolades presented at the awards ceremony organised by DutchCham was the Winsemius Red Orange Award, which highlights the longstanding partnership between the two nations. This was presented to sustainability consulting engineer Haskoning. </p><p> The Business Achievement Award recognises organisations for strong performance, sustained growth and meaningful innovation that has strengthened the Dutch business presence in Singapore.

Revenue would come from the sale of carbon credits to companies or governments, with each credit representing a tonne of emissions avoided by shutting a power plant early. </p><p> On May 7, it was announced that Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corporation had joined Singapore's Keppel and investment platform GenZero in a climate initiative that aims to retire a Philippine coal plant early using funds from a transition credit scheme backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. </p><p> The aim is to retire the plant by 2030 -- ahead of its scheduled closure in 2040 -- and replace it with renewable energy and battery storage.</p><p> The initiative, if successful, could be a model used to shut down dozens of other coal plants early around the globe, especially in Asia.</p><p> A report released on May 7 by global management consultancy BCG and Temasek showed that expenditure on climate adaptation and resilience is projected to rise to between US$500 billion (S$648 billion) and US$1.3 trillion a year by 2030.</p><p> This presents an opportunity for investors to put their money into growth sectors for climate adaptation solutions, such as hazard warning systems, climate-resilient crops and flood defences.</p><p> The importance of collaborations and partnerships -- between countries and sectors -- in tackling climate change was also repeatedly emphasised during the week. </p><p> This is notable given the inward-leaning policies being promoted in other parts of the world. </p><p> A planetary crisis like climate change cannot be tackled by one country alone, and collaborations can help to broaden the market for sustainable investments.</p><p> At Ecosperity Week and partner events like the GenZero Climate Summit and the Climate Group Asia Action Summit, at least three areas of collaboration were discussed: carbon markets, the Asean power grid and blended finance. </p><p> Carbon markets allow countries to collaborate on climate action, as they allow funds to flow from large emitters, usually developed countries, to countries where carbon projects are usually hosted, usually developing countries.</p><p> This can spark a whole industry -- carbon services -- offering a wide range of opportunities, from carbon project development to monitoring and verification services, and legal and regulatory consultancies. </p><p>Singapore had identified carbon services as an engine of growth for its green economy in the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the nation's sustainability blueprint launched in February 2021.</p><p> Regarding the Asean grid, Singapore has sent a strong policy signal with a goal that by 2035, some 30 per cent of its energy supply is expected to come from clean energy imports. </p><p> This commitment provides investors with some degree of revenue certainty. </p><p> But some investments, such as in subsea cables, can be costly and risky, which highlights the need for another form of collaboration between sectors.</p><p> This is where blended finance comes into play, leveraging public and philanthropic funding support to entice private funding to come on board.</p><p>Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action Ravi Menon summed it up well when he spoke about the importance of \"how to make money work harder, more effectively\". </p><p> Public funding is willing but insufficient, while private funding is ample but unwilling to commit owing to high risks or because returns are not commensurate with the risks, the former chief of Singapore's central bank said during a panel discussion at the Philanthropy Asia Summit, an Ecosperity partner event.</p><p> Collaboration among the public, private and philanthropic sectors on financing can significantly scale the amount of money available for sustainable investments.</p><p> The 11th edition of the annual sustainability conference comes amid significant global headwinds to climate action -- a far cry from some years earlier, when countries were racing to help their economies recover from the Covid-19 pandemic in an environmentally sustainable way. </p><p> Economic uncertainties and trade concerns are undoubtedly top of mind in the current geopolitical context. But climate change impacts will not spare us just because we are not paying attention. </p><p> As SM Teo said: \"We must be clear-minded...

Adaptation has historically been underfunded and receives much less financing from the private sector, which has generally channeled capital towards mitigation projects as these tend to be productive assets that can generate an income, such as a solar power plant.  </p><p> Besides the fact that the focus has been on reducing greenhouse gas emissions instead of adjusting to increasing risks of climate change impacts, climate adaptation tends to mean public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems, which do not lend themselves to commercial financing models.</p><p> However, Drew noted during a panel discussion that the investment case for climate adaptation projects comes from the increasing necessity of such goods and services -- with all metrics indicating that the world is not on track to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- and therefore demand for them. </p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Jay Koh, the co-founder and managing director of The Lightsmith Group, said the challenges brought about by climate change present \"unavoidable opportunities\". </p><p> Citing the sixth assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Koh, who runs a private equity firm that focuses on climate resilience solutions, said that the trajectory of climate change between the present day and 2030 is almost entirely baked in by greenhouse gas emissions that have already accumulated. \"So there is a great growth investment opportunity -- that is intertwined with the decarbonisation investment strategies that people are pursuing in the market -- for climate resilience and adaptation solutions,\" said Koh, who was speaking at the same panel. </p><p> One example is an artificial intelligence company that analyses vegetation management for utility companies. Given that many major wildfires in the United States and Australia are sparked by vegetation encroaching onto power lines, most utility companies are managing this problem by having workers manually cut down trees getting too close to the power lines. </p><p> With satellite drone imagery, utility companies are able to manage such risks in a much more efficient way. </p><p> Yet, Drew pointed out that there is still currently a low level of awareness and understanding among financial institutions on what constitutes adaptation finance.</p><p> In the midst of developing the guide, she was often asked by banks and asset managers: \"What do you mean by (adaptation finance)? Do you mean \"loss and damage\"? Isn't that the job of the government'\"</p><p> \"Loss and damage\" refers to a fund, established by countries at the United Nations climate change conference, that will be financed by developed countries to compensate developing countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change. </p><p> There is therefore a need for the industry to have a common definition of adaptation finance and the commercial opportunities arising from it, as well as an understanding of the financing mechanisms and the type of projects available, said Drew.</p><p> \"Inaction is not a world that you can conceive. It's loss of economic prosperity, it's loss of livelihoods, it's people's health, it's life, et cetera... We can either invest in it now and do it in a nice, orderly way. Or we can wait till it's disaster, and then it's chaos,\" she added.</p><p> The importance of taking adaptation and resiliency actions early is also highlighted by Lubomir Varbanov, Swiss Re's managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific.</p><p> Physical impacts from a climate event can be mitigated if climate resiliency is built into urban planning sufficiently early, he said at the same panel. </p><p> It is a misconception that disaster risk insurance only has a role to play in the aftermath of a climate disaster as a shock absorber, Varbanov noted.</p><p> He cited an example of Swiss Re partnering with local governments in Australia to financially quantify their natural hazard risks. This allows them to pre-emptively identify their highest risk assets across all types of natural disasters and their locations, so as to factor this information into their planning processes.   </p><p> If more action to increase climate resiliency is not taken, the rising costs of insurance will lead to affordability issues, especially for vulnerable communities.</p><p> Varbanov noted that four of the last five years have seen over US$100 billion of insured losses from natural disasters. </p><p> He said that there needs to be more public and private partnerships, where data is shared and common objectives are set. </p><p> An enabling environment, with regulations that promote an open market and optimal price setting that does not make the insurance industry more expensive, are also important. </p><p> Helping livelihoodsOn the issue of policy reforms, Drew noted that local governments often cite how policy suggestions, such as the redirection of subsidies, are politically challenging to implement. </p><p> However, she added that it is important for the private sector and development finance institutions to highlight to policymakers how these policy reforms \"are going to actually create an enormous amount of opportunity for the livelihoods of (their) people\".</p><p> \"So politically, (they're) helping (their) people. (They're) creating that longevity and that resiliency and that endurance.\" said Drew, referring to governments.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>StanChart's chief sustainability officer Marissa Drew (left), speaking at a panel with Swiss Re's managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific Lubomir Varbanov during Ecosperity Week on Apr 17.

You would expect politicians and businesses to tap into this and do something about it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Climate change is one such issue. Major surveys and academic research show that between 80 and 89 per cent of the world's people want their governments to do more to address a rapidly heating planet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But here's the paradox: many of these people think they are in the minority and feel their views and voices aren't being heard. They feel frustrated, sidelined and fear that others might disagree with them. So, many keep silent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That might seem hard to believe at first glance. After all, governments and businesses have pledged net-zero targets, imposed taxes or reduction targets on carbon emissions, corporations now have chief sustainability officers and renewable energy investment is soaring globally. </p><p> These are all vital steps forward. Sounds like governments are listening, right'</p><p> Sadly, we're still far off course. Global greenhouse gas emissions are still growing, temperatures are spiking and climate impacts are worsening. And that's worrying more and more people and hurting their livelihoods and bank balance. </p><p> Here are two examples: A recent study by the World Weather Attribution network and the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine found climate change caused an estimated 1,500 deaths during the European heatwave in late June and early July 2025.</p><p> From 1980 to August 2024, the United States suffered 396 weather and climate disasters where overall damages for each reached at least US$1 billion (S$1.28 billion). The total cost of these events exceeds US$2.78 trillion. Extreme storms, floods and fires have made insurance unaffordable, or unavailable, in an increasing number of areas in the US and other nations. </p><p> There's a growing urgency for action -- yet strangely there is public paralysis.</p><p> To ramp up global climate action, this silent majority must break its silence and speak loudly. Why isn't it? </p><p> How did we get here'In some countries, the politics around climate change remains polarised, especially in the US, with the climate discourse full of doubt and deceit funded by the fossil fuel industry and amplified by internet trolls. It has also been painted by some as a \"liberal\" or \"woke\" cause, never mind that climate change and forest fires have devastated communities. Seeing this, many people avoid the topic of climate change, even at the dinner table. </p><p> \"This overwhelming majority in favour of climate action is not reflected in most news coverage. It's not reflected in most social media discourse. It's not reflected in what most political leaders talk about and say,\" said Mr Mark Hertsgaard, a US journalist and co-founder and executive director of Covering Climate Now (CCN), a global initiative that works with media organisations to boost climate coverage and education. </p><p> \"It is a reflection of the incredible effectiveness of this 40-plus-year campaign of lies and deception that the fossil fuel industry has mounted internationally,\" said Mr Hertsgaard. </p><p> Internal records show that scientists at some of the biggest oil and gas firms, including Exxon-Mobil, knew decades ago that burning fossil fuels will cause global warming. But Big Oil decided to cover up the overwhelming weight of science that humans are causing climate change. They have funded pro-fossil fuel lobbyists and politicians to push back against stronger climate action.</p><p> Challenging the industry's narratives is a focus of CCN's 89 Percent Project, an initiative launched in April 2025 that seeks to unravel the reasons for the silent majority and solutions to unite them. Dozens of media outlets around the globe are part of the initiative. </p><p> The fact that there is a large unheard majority fundamentally shifts the framing of how all of us think about climate change and the politics of climate change, Mr Hertsgaard told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"You know, we've believed that it's this hopelessly polarised issue that is too controversial to talk about. And that's just wrong,\" he said. </p><p> Human nature also feeds the perception gap, said Dr Olivia Jensen, a social scientist and deputy director of the Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. </p><p> \"When individuals answer the question about what other people think, they bring to mind observed behaviour rather than imagining what people's underlying values might be, so they guess that other people do not care much about climate change,\" she told ST.</p><p> It's human nature to avoid confrontation or awkward social moments. As someone who has been writing about climate change for many years, it can be frustrating to observe colleagues, friends and even family holding on to false beliefs about climate change. </p><p> And there's another reason. Climate change tends to be portrayed as an endless string of disasters, a story of hopelessness. That leads to news fatigue, especially with the daily news cycle dominated by stories of wars, tariffs and other geopolitical risks.</p><p> Media organisations need to do a better job telling the story of climate solutions and financial opportunities and promoting public discussion and education. </p><p> The media plays an important role in driving stronger climate action, Singapore's Ambassador for Climate Action Ravi Menon told ST: \"The media can help by constantly reminding everyone that climate change remains the biggest challenge and risk facing people and that climate action is just as urgent and important as other priorities.\"</p><p> What do the surveys say'To really accelerate change, the majority need to be heard. </p><p> Four in every five people (80 per cent) called for their country to strengthen its commitments to address climate change, according to The Peoples' Climate Vote 2024, conducted by the United Nations Development Programme and the University of Oxford. More than 73,000 people were surveyed in 77 countries, representing 87 per cent of the world's population. </p><p> For people in more climate-vulnerable regions and poorer nations, the number was even higher: 89 per cent wanted their country to strengthen its commitments to address climate change.</p><p> Separate research published in the journal Nature in 2024, based on a survey of nearly 130,000 people in 125 countries, including Singapore, found that 89 per cent demanded intensified political action. In fact, across parts of Asia, the figure was even higher. </p><p> In Singapore, it was 93 per cent; 96.2 per cent for Malaysia; 94.1 per cent in the Philippines; 97.1 per cent in China; 86.5 per cent for Indonesia; and 80 per cent for India. In the United States, it was 74 per cent. </p><p> Despite this, the researchers concluded that \"individuals around the globe systematically underestimate the willingness of their fellow citizens to act\".</p><p> In Singapore, there's growing support for climate action by individuals and businesses, Mr Menon said. The challenge was translating this support into concrete action. </p><p> \"Given the scale and complexity of the climate crisis, many individuals feel that their actions are too small to make an impact. Likewise, many businesses feel that if they move ahead on climate action, they may lose to their competitors who do not.\"</p><p> There was also a sense among many individuals and businesses that climate action is primarily the responsibility of the Government, he added.</p><p> Support, yes. But is it real'It's one thing to demand more action. But will people really follow through, or even know how to'</p><p> \"When you ask people about a big issue like climate change, people tend to think in abstract, value-driven terms, and at this level, they do think that climate change is important and want governments to do more,\" said Dr Jensen. </p><p> But if you ask them questions about trade-offs with other policy priorities, other uses of government revenues, then climate change does not come out on top, she added. </p><p> \"Just looking at the behavioural choices people make, you wouldn't know they cared much about climate change,\" she said. </p><p> That is in part due to the day-to-day economic priorities of people, especially in poorer nations where putting food on the table and paying bills are paramount. </p><p> \"That's the immediate reality. It's not that they don't care. It's not that they don't want clean air and clean water for their kids. They absolutely do,\" said Mr Hertsgaard.</p><p> Money and policiesDigging a bit deeper, doing something about climate action also requires better understanding of the right policies, said Dr Jensen. </p><p> While people may support stronger government action in general, most have low knowledge about which policies would be more or less effective in reducing emissions. This is where politicians must work harder to explain their policies -- especially climate policies that will affect people financially. </p><p> The money question is key. As the climate crisis worsens and governments have to enact tougher policies, are citizens willing to support them, such as budget cuts to key services to fund more green energy or climate adaptation projects, for instance, better flood defences? </p><p> What about making personal choices, such as taking public transport, eating less meat and flying less? </p><p> The 2024 Nature study found that 69 per cent of respondents said they would be willing to contribute 1 per cent of their household income every month to fight global warming (for Singapore, it was 53.1 per cent and 66.9 per cent in Malaysia). Just over a quarter said they would not be willing to contribute any amount. </p><p> Mr Hertsgaard said the economy will always come first for people. That's normal. But through its growing bread-and-butter impacts, climate change has become a top issue.</p><p> Let's talkThe simplest remedy to overcome the perception gap is to start talking to one another. </p><p> That's the message from climate scientist, educator and author Katharine Hayhoe.</p><p> \"I'm absolutely convinced that just about every single person has every reason they need to care about climate change already, and their reason might be different than yours or mine,\" she said in a YouTube message. </p><p> The key was joining the dots -- and here again, the media is key. \"We connect the dots between climate change and how it's affecting what we already care about, what already matters to us, and then we talk about how we really can fix this thing.\"</p><p> Talk to politicians, too. On July 9, more than 5,000 people from across Britain arrived in London to meet their MPs and demand urgent climate action to protect their communities. Before the event, a giant image created by The People's Picture, stating that \"89% of people want climate action\", was projected on the white cliffs of Dover.</p><p> We also need to take steps to cut our own carbon emissions, such as making our homes more energy efficient and cutting food and plastic waste. Not only does this give credibility to demands for greater climate action, but it will also help accelerate it and be a powerful message to politicians and businesses. </p><p> \"Effective climate action is all about collective effort,\" said Mr Menon. \"Government policies are a key enabler, but business strategies and individual actions are just as important.\"</p><p> 'Extraordinary mandate'The bottom line is that there is a huge and untapped resource to drive climate action. It is your friends, your family, your colleagues. </p><p> \"It is an extraordinary popular mandate. There is this 80 to 89 per cent of the population out there waiting for leaders to call them to action. It's 80 to 89 per cent, so it's an enormous opportunity for these activist groups, for politicians, to latch on to,\" said Mr Hertsgaard. </p><p> So what are you waiting for? Start talking to your neighbour. Chances are they care about climate change, too. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A mosaic image -- created from 1,500 photos shared by people to illustrate what they want to protect -- projected on the cliffs of Dover in England on July 9.

Good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you today for the launch of the Alliance for Action (AfA) to co-create the Flood-Resilient Developments Guidebook.</p><p>Singapore's Efforts in Coastal and Flood Protection</p><p>2. Let me begin by thanking the members of the AfA committee who have kindly come forward to be part of this effort. The Flood Resilient Developments (FRD) guidebook is an important endeavour.</p><p>3. Singapore is a low-lying island state. About 30% of our land is less than 5m above mean sea level. This makes us vulnerable to flooding risks brought about by rising sea levels. These risks are exacerbated by storm surges and high tides.</p><p>4. Hence, we have taken a few important steps to strengthen our coastal and flood resilience.</p><p>5. First, we have demarcated our entire coastline into several hydraulically distinct segments and are progressively conducting site-specific studies to identify coastal adaptation solutions for each segment. The studies for Jurong Island, City-East Coast, including Long Island, as well as the northwest coast from Tuas to Woodlands are on track. We will commence the studies for Sentosa and the south-west coast by 2026.</p><p>6. Second, we are preparing coastal protection legislation to set out the responsibilities of coastal landowners, safeguard land for coastal protection measures and ensure that coastal protection standards are met. We will consult stakeholders and plan to table a Coastal Protection bill early in the new term of Parliament.</p><p>7. Third, we are approaching flood resilience from a systems perspective, not just to explore synergies between coastal and inland flood protection, but also to develop approaches where building owners, developers, engineers and architects play their part alongside the Government. This is where the FRD guidebook comes in.</p><p>8. Instead of prescribing a one-size-fits-all approach on how developments should achieve flood resilience, the FRD guidebook aims to set out principles and guidelines, including case studies. It encompasses a toolkit of measures that building owners can adopt at development level, without compromising the land use objectives. This provides designers and building owners with more room for flexibility and space for creativity in applying solutions that integrate best with the design intent.</p><p>9. Through the FRD, we hope to strike a balance between providing adequate and practical guidance to building and landowners to achieve effective flood resilience without being overly prescriptive and impeding creativity and customisation based on different needs and interests. Some cities in the United States and the Netherlands have also published similar guidelines.</p><p>Key Outcomes of the Alliance-for-Action</p><p>10. The new FRD guidebook will complement the upcoming Code of Practice for Coastal Protection as well as the existing Code of Practice on Surface Water Drainage, which collectively set out the design standards, and operational and maintenance requirements for coastal and flood protection infrastructure.</p><p>11. The AfA brings together multiple stakeholders to co-create and co-develop this FRD guidebook. We have experts from relevant professional bodies and associations. We hope to harness industry-wide experiences, best practices and strategies. It will essentially be a guidebook designed by practitioners for practitioners.</p><p>12. This close collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of our long-term climate adaptation plans. It is heartening to see key industry leaders stepping forward to be part of this partnership, in contributing towards greater flood resilience for Singapore.</p><p>Closing</p><p>13. In closing, I look forward to the work of the AfA committee. I hope to see a FRD guidebook that will shape the way we design buildings with flood resilience in mind. Your contributions will help pave the way for a more climate-resilient Singapore, for the current and future generations.</p><p>14.

For one thing, it was among the few nations to meet the UN deadline for new climate targets. </p><p> Prime Minister Lawrence Wong also reaffirmed Singapore's commitment in the latest Budget statement, reiterating that the government \"remains resolute\" in its decarbonisation efforts, despite slowing momentum on the issue globally. </p><p> During Budget 2025, he also introduced a S$5 billion injection into the Future Energy Fund to secure clean power, alongside incentives to accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions heavy vehicles like electric goods vehicles and buses.</p><p> Mitigating risks</p><p>Singapore's commitment to decarbonisation is not only a far-sighted course of action, but also an act of great wisdom. </p><p> As climate change accelerates and extreme weather events become more common, governments that delay taking action now will face a far more challenging transition down the line.</p><p> When disasters like wildfires, floods, and heatwaves grow too frequent and severe to overlook, governments will be compelled to take drastic actions -- but at that point, it may already be too late to prevent the catastrophic consequences.</p><p> By addressing climate risks today, Singapore is not only preparing to handle future challenges proactively, but also positioning itself to capitalise on new opportunities in the burgeoning global awareness and seismic shift towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> The city-state aims to cut emissions to between 45 million and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035. This is on top of an ambitious plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, through the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p> This national strategy is anchored by five key pillars: city in nature; energy reset; sustainable living; green economy; and resilient future. </p><p> One focus of the Singapore Green Plan is about enhancing the city-state's liveability. </p><p> The government is expanding the rail and cycling networks, retrofitting buildings to be greener, and creating more parks and green spaces. Clear targets have also been set to cut landfill waste and reduce water usage.</p><p> These efforts not only advance the goal of creating sustainable, eco-friendly homes, but also fulfil residents' desires for a cleaner, healthier living environment.</p><p> Another key priority is transitioning to sustainable energy sources. Singapore aims to raise its solar energy deployment to 2 gigawatt-peak by 2030, which would meet 3 per cent of the city-state's projected energy needs.</p><p> It also aims to slash emissions in the transport sector, by spurring the transition towards electric or low-emission vehicles across air, land, and sea.</p><p> Achieving these goals requires the right skilled talent to drive scientific innovation and bring new inventions to market. </p><p> Hence, the energy transition will create new job opportunities across various sectors including research, analytics, and finance.</p><p> Globally, the International Energy Agency projects the creation of 10.3 million new jobs by 2030 as the world shifts to cleaner energy. </p><p> In Singapore, the green economy is a key growth sector, with the national skills agency SkillsFuture identifying strong demand for highly adaptable and in-demand skills.</p><p> Aside from talent, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will also demand substantial investments. </p><p> This has led to the growth of sustainable finance, which is channelling significant new capital into the economy by supporting investments in infrastructure, expanding the green bond market, and fostering the development of carbon trading hubs.</p><p> A passing fad'</p><p> Some have questioned whether shifts in global climate policy and ongoing trade uncertainties might mean that sustainable finance is losing its relevance. However, this is far from the case.</p><p> While recent changes in trade policies may complicate supply chains for technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels, these challenges are also prompting governments to strengthen domestic capabilities and encouraging companies to localise their supply chains.</p><p>Singapore is not the only country advancing these efforts through a national climate policy platform. The European Union, for instance, aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050 through a set of policy initiatives put forth under the European Green Deal.</p><p> Further, even if the tempo of climate policy action may appear to be abating, some structural trends are here to stay.</p><p> Rapid urbanisation and population growth are set to double electricity demand globally over the next two decades.</p><p> Meeting this demand will require increased energy supplies, particularly from renewables. With solar and wind now the most cost-effective sources, global investments in renewables is expected to surge, making them the preferred options for new energy supplies.</p><p> At the same time, advancements in artificial intelligence will drive demand for energy-efficient data centres to support these energy-intensive technologies.</p><p> Separately, the slowdown in global mitigation efforts has heightened the risk of climate-related damage and loss. In response, investors are seeing growing opportunities in climate adaptation measures.</p><p> According to a report by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, global annual revenues from various adaptation solution sectors could rise from US$1 trillion today to US$4 trillion by 2050. </p><p> The associated investment opportunities are projected to expand from US$2 trillion now to US$9 trillion by 2050, with US$3 trillion of this growth directly linked to global warming. </p><p> These projections are based on the assumption that global temperatures will increase by 2.7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.</p><p> A separate report by Temasek, which focuses on private equity opportunities, estimates that global annual demand for adaptation financing could reach between US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion from 2025 to 2030. </p><p> This is significantly higher than current adaptation financing levels, which average about US$76 billion per year and are primarily sourced from public funds.</p><p> Notwithstanding the observation that some governments are slowing down their efforts to promote climate protection, there remains a growing pivotal emphasis on environmental protection and sustainability. The shift toward a sustainable future remains inevitable.</p><p> In time, Singapore's current investments in a greener future will yield qualitative dividends for its people, to be able to reside in a salubrious climate. </p><p> The writer is partner at Kennedys and a director of Legal Solutions LLC</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-HAIPGRH</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYT-6YC3-RSMW-X022-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1186\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

More recently, several major financial institutions, including American and Japanese banks, exited the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a coalition committed to aligning banking practices with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Despite this shifting landscape, OCBC remains committed to its decarbonisation agenda. \"For OCBC, our position remains the same because climate change is still a real issue based on science, and it is our responsibility to be part of the solution as a connector of capital,\" says OCBC's group chief sustainability officer Mike Ng.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The bank offers strategic advisory, innovative financial solutions and ecosystem partnerships to help large corporations, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and retail investors achieve their sustainability goals.</p><p> Ng acknowledges that the journey to net zero is fraught with challenges and \"will never be linear\".</p><p> Nevertheless, he stresses that OCBC's commitment to sustainability is not an \"academic exercise\" but a long-term business strategy for the bank that shapes its portfolio and guides how it supports industries and clients in their green transition.</p><p> While climate efforts globally may appear to be losing momentum, Ng believes that significant opportunities remain in the transition to net zero, particularly in Asia.</p><p> A World Economic Forum white paper from 2023 estimated that climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives in Asia could unlock an additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and create 232 million new jobs in the region by 2030.</p><p> Ng points out that industries such as renewable energy and electric vehicles have already achieved commercial viability, and that some OCBC clients are actively increasing their investments in these areas across the bank's key markets.</p><p> These markets include China, which has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for more than 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Investments are also being made in emerging technologies. In 2024, OCBC participated in the project financing of a large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in the UK. CCS technologies are currently being explored in various markets in Asia.</p><p> The business case for sustainability Ng cautions that the risks of inaction against climate change remain high, especially in Asia, which is expected to bear the brunt of the physical consequences of climate change. \"We need to continue to pay attention, especially from a loan portfolio perspective, as part and parcel of sound risk management,\" he says.</p><p> Ng notes that despite the broader global turn against decarbonisation, governments in the region remain focused on the transition.</p><p> For example, in the markets where OCBC operates, policymakers continue to promote regulations and guidelines pertaining to transition planning, sustainability reporting and sustainable financing, among others.</p><p> The global backtracking by some institutions also presents a timely opportunity to take stock of current decarbonisation policies and regulations, says Ng.</p><p> For example, sustainability reporting has become a \"burdensome\" requirement for some firms, potentially distracting from meaningful climate action. In this context, the European Union's Omnibus package announced earlier this year aims to streamline sustainability regulations and ease compliance costs for companies, especially SMEs.</p><p> Ng also calls for a reassessment of the reference pathways -- which set out emission reduction targets and deadlines -- for underperforming sectors.</p><p> While a sector such as power is progressing well against its net-zero reference pathway due to the proliferation of renewable energy, others such as aviation and shipping are seeing slower progress due to the limited availability of green technology. This disparity suggests it may be time to recalibrate these pathways and targets.</p><p> \"Because the more unrealistic those reference pathways and targets remain, the less inclined financiers, investors and businesses will be to commit to them. Without targets, it will be hard to galvanise action,\" says Ng.</p><p> An opportune moment  for actionIn light of this, Ng believes it is all the more critical now to continue to encourage and support businesses to work towards their decarbonisation goals, rather than risk having them fall off the journey due to the difficulties.</p><p> \"OCBC remains committed to supporting our clients in their net-zero transition and sustainability goals with financing as well as knowledge and tools,\" he says.</p><p> The bank supports both large corporates and SMEs through three key areas: strategic advisory, innovative financial solutions and ecosystem partnerships.</p><p> For large companies, OCBC provides industry-specific advisory services, helping them quantify cost savings from undertaking emissions reduction initiatives and assess return on such investments.</p><p> The bank also extends financing to help them meet their sustainability goals.</p><p> Asia's partner for a sustainable futureIts leadership in sustainable finance is reflected in recent accolades. With a committed sustainable finance portfolio of S$71 billion, OCBC was ranked the top Mandated Lead Arranger for Green and Sustainability Linked Loans in both Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and in South-east Asia by the London Stock Exchange Group last year.</p><p> OCBC also ranked eighth in Environmental Finance's 2024 Sustainability Coordinators League Table, which showcases the top banks leading the charge globally in sustainability coordinator deal activity and volume. OCBC was the only Singapore bank on the list.</p><p> For SMEs which lack the resources of larger firms, OCBC helps them understand the steps they can take to decarbonise and to access the capital needed to do so.</p><p> For example, in February this year, OCBC partnered Enterprise Singapore to launch the OCBC SME Start-ESG Programme, which helps SMEs measure sustainability metrics, receive expert advice and access sustainability-linked loans (SLL). Last year, more than 110 SME clients received such loans -- four times more than in 2023.</p><p> The bank also offers unique products, such as its first-in-market OCBC 1.5 degrees Celsius loan. Unlike other SLLs whose parameters are negotiated between the client and financial institution, the OCBC 1.5 deg C loan sets \"science-based, measurable targets\" for clients to lower their emissions, based on the industries they are in. Since its launch in 2023, OCBC has offered the loan to major corporates, including City Developments Limited, CapitaLand Ascott Trust and Cofco International.</p><p> Beyond businesses, OCBC also supports retail investors on their sustainability journey. In February 2024, it launched the OCBC Sustainability Hub on its mobile app, allowing users to view the ESG rating of their investment portfolios. This feature helps individuals make more informed investment decisions and contribute to sustainability in a tangible way.</p><p> Staying the courseNg reiterates that OCBC's net-zero commitment in its financed emissions is a \"strategic, long-term decision\", aligned with the enduring nature of climate change.</p><p> He acknowledges that some companies may choose to pause their green transition efforts for now, focusing on more immediate business challenges such as the impact of US tariffs.</p><p> Even so, he urges businesses to view decarbonisation as an integral part of their long-term strategy. As larger corporations increasingly scrutinise the emissions of their supply chains, smaller suppliers will find it in their business interest to reduce their own emissions in order to stay competitive. Improving on their sustainability metrics also allows companies to tap into the growing pool of sustainable finance.</p><p> Says Ng: \"Climate change will come back and bite us one of these days, sooner or later, in one way or another. So it's better to be prepared than not to be prepared.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-5QIT3O0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G0F-4KF3-RRMP-9375-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Why are investors hesitant, and what needs to be done to get climate-aware investing into the mainstream'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  We have witnessed continuous improvement and strong efforts to transition our global economies to a net-zero future. According to the International Energy Agency, last year's global investments in clean energy were around double the amount going into fossil fuels. Ten years ago, fossil fuel investments were about 20 per cent larger than clean energy investments. Meanwhile, India is projected to achieve a major milestone in 2025, with renewable electricity providing for more than half of the country's power capacity, while China added more renewable power capacity in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notwithstanding this, current investment flows are still insufficient to allow us to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, complexities in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape have understandably made investors more cautious in recent times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Importantly, sustainable investing is not a short-term but a structural trend. Climate risk is increasingly recognised as a major driver of financial risk. Hence, most major investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their overall decision process.</p><p> Encouragingly, Asian regulators are stepping up. Across the region, many policies and regulations have been put in place that create an enabling environment, which supports climate action and related financing flows. This includes green and transition taxonomies and ESG disclosure standards.</p><p> These developments bolster investor confidence and embed greater transparency in sustainable investing -- important steps in shifting these financing flows into the mainstream.</p><p> More work needs to be done. For instance, there is some ambiguity around what qualifies as transition and transition finance. The vast majority of assets and economic activities globally and in Asia are not yet green, and DBS believes it is critical to also allocate capital to support their transition to becoming greener. Beyond financing those assets and activities, transition finance can also help companies transform their entire businesses, all of which will contribute to the greening of the entire economy.</p><p> We see progress across the region on several fronts. Localised taxonomies are evolving to reflect regional contexts and developmental needs. Markets like Singapore are evolving disclosure rules and incentives for credible transition finance.</p><p> At DBS, we have observed growing sophistication in how capital is being deployed. For instance, we saw strong investor appetite for two green bonds DBS brought to the market recently. The first was the issuance of Equinix's S$500 million green bond in March 2025, its first Singapore dollar issuance.</p><p> The second was Asia's first public sustainability-linked securities offering by ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in January 2024. Both bonds were meaningfully oversubscribed, signalling growing investor demand for credible climate instruments.</p><p>  Investors' hesitation around sustainable or climate-aware investing, despite growing interest, often stems from structural challenges and other key concerns.</p><p> For example, the lack of standardisation and transparency in how ESG factors are assessed and reported. Without consistent metrics, it becomes difficult for investors to compare ESG investment products and evaluate their true impact. Additionally, some investors are concerned that corporates and governments may scale back their climate commitments which affect the short-term viability of such investments.</p><p> At UOB Asset Management, we view ESG integration as a strategic tool for value creation and risk mitigation. By embedding ESG considerations into our investment process, we aim to support long-term sustainability for our investees and their businesses. We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p>  One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns. In addition, some investors may be hesitant given concerns about low-quality ESG data, greenwashing, as well as the perceived trade-off between sustainability and returns.</p><p> While interest in sustainable investment may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments and the geopolitical context, we believe that the overarching trend towards investments that take ESG factors and risks into consideration is here to stay. The challenges of sustainable investment are also being actively addressed.</p><p> Collaboration between stakeholders -- asset managers, data providers and regulatory bodies -- is paving the way for more standardisation in reporting frameworks and taxonomies, which will help mitigate concerns on data quality and greenwashing. Meanwhile, leading financial institutions are developing diverse and accessible products catering to varying preferences and risks appetites, and -- over time -- are also showing that sustainable investments can deliver required returns.</p><p> Sometimes, enabling investors with information can also make a big difference in mainstreaming sustainable investing. Take, for example, the OCBC Sustainability Hub, launched in 2024.</p><p> The innovative platform empowers investors with a personal ESG rating, enabling them to track, understand and act on their investments, and to make informed financial decisions.</p><p> Within just six months of its launch, the Sustainability Hub achieved a 2.3x year-on-year increase in sustainability-themed investments.</p><p>  What do you see as the most promising areas of investments for corporates and individuals that will address climate risks and reap a return'</p><p>  The business case for climate-aligned investing remains robust particularly in Asia, where climate risk is acute, economic growth is rapid, and the green transition is gaining momentum.</p><p> We see strong opportunities emerging across several areas that offer both meaningful climate impact and attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p> One such area is energy. Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption.</p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods.</p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions.</p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p> For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls.</p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p>  Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p>  In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors.</p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals.</p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Plugging the funding gap to mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help'</p><p> Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting.</p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments.</p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation.</p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia.</p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital.</p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy.</p><p>  There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors.</p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation.</p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows.</p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p> As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects.</p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation.</p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion.</p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles.</p><p> This supplement was first published in The Business Times on June 5.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-5QIT4S7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G0F-4KF3-RRMP-9374-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3140\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

More recently, several major financial institutions, including American and Japanese banks, exited the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a coalition committed to aligning banking practices with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Despite this shifting landscape, OCBC remains committed to its decarbonisation agenda. \"For OCBC, our position remains the same because climate change is still a real issue based on science, and it is our responsibility to be part of the solution as a connector of capital,\" says OCBC's group chief sustainability officer Mike Ng.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The bank offers strategic advisory, innovative financial solutions and ecosystem partnerships to help large corporations, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and retail investors achieve their sustainability goals.</p><p> Ng acknowledges that the journey to net zero is fraught with challenges and \"will never be linear\". </p><p> Nevertheless, he stresses that OCBC's commitment to sustainability is not an \"academic exercise\" but a long-term business strategy for the bank that shapes its portfolio and guides how it supports industries and clients in their green transition.</p><p> While climate efforts globally may appear to be losing momentum, Ng believes that significant opportunities remain in the transition to net zero, particularly in Asia.</p><p> A World Economic Forum white paper from 2023 estimated that climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives in Asia could unlock an additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and create 232 million new jobs in the region by 2030.</p><p> Ng points out that industries such as renewable energy and electric vehicles have already achieved commercial viability, and that some OCBC clients are actively increasing their investments in these areas across the bank's key markets.</p><p> These markets include China, which has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for more than 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> Investments are also being made in emerging technologies. In 2024, OCBC participated in the project financing of a large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in the UK. CCS technologies are currently being explored in various markets in Asia. </p><p> The business case for sustainability</p><p> Ng cautions that the risks of inaction against climate change remain high, especially in Asia, which is expected to bear the brunt of the physical consequences of climate change. \"We need to continue to pay attention, especially from a loan portfolio perspective, as part and parcel of sound risk management,\" he says.</p><p> Ng notes that despite the broader global turn against decarbonisation, governments in the region remain focused on the transition. </p><p> For example, in the markets where OCBC operates, policymakers continue to promote regulations and guidelines pertaining to transition planning, sustainability reporting and sustainable financing, among others.</p><p> The global backtracking by some institutions also presents a timely opportunity to take stock of current decarbonisation policies and regulations, says Ng.</p><p> For example, sustainability reporting has become a \"burdensome\" requirement for some firms, potentially distracting from meaningful climate action. In this context, the European Union's Omnibus package announced earlier this year aims to streamline sustainability regulations and ease compliance costs for companies, especially SMEs.</p><p> Ng also calls for a reassessment of the reference pathways -- which set out emission reduction targets and deadlines -- for underperforming sectors.</p><p> While a sector such as power is progressing well against its net-zero reference pathway due to the proliferation of renewable energy, others such as aviation and shipping are seeing slower progress due to the limited availability of green technology. This disparity suggests it may be time to recalibrate these pathways and targets.</p><p> \"Because the more unrealistic those reference pathways and targets remain, the less inclined financiers, investors and businesses will be to commit to them. Without targets, it will be hard to galvanise action,\" says Ng.</p><p> An opportune moment for action</p><p> In light of this, Ng believes it is all the more critical now to continue to encourage and support businesses to work towards their decarbonisation goals, rather than risk having them fall off the journey due to the difficulties.</p><p> \"OCBC remains committed to supporting our clients in their net-zero transition and sustainability goals with financing as well as knowledge and tools,\" he says.</p><p> The bank supports both large corporates and SMEs through three key areas: strategic advisory, innovative financial solutions and ecosystem partnerships. </p><p> For large companies, OCBC provides industry-specific advisory services, helping them quantify cost savings from undertaking emissions reduction initiatives and assess return on such investments. </p><p> The bank also extends financing to help them meet their sustainability goals. </p><p> Asia's partner for a sustainable future</p><p> Its leadership in sustainable finance is reflected in recent accolades. With a committed sustainable finance portfolio of S$71 billion, OCBC was ranked the top Mandated Lead Arranger for Green and Sustainability Linked Loans in both Asia-Pacific (excluding Japan) and in South-east Asia by the London Stock Exchange Group last year.</p><p> OCBC also ranked eighth in Environmental Finance's 2024 Sustainability Coordinators League Table, which showcases the top banks leading the charge globally in sustainability coordinator deal activity and volume. OCBC was the only Singapore bank on the list. </p><p> For SMEs which lack the resources of larger firms, OCBC helps them understand the steps they can take to decarbonise and to access the capital needed to do so.</p><p> For example, in February this year, OCBC partnered Enterprise Singapore to launch the OCBC SME Start-ESG Programme, which helps SMEs measure sustainability metrics, receive expert advice and access sustainability-linked loans (SLL). Last year, more than 110 SME clients received such loans -- four times more than in 2023.</p><p> The bank also offers unique products, such as its first-in-market OCBC 1.5 degrees Celsius loan. Unlike other SLLs whose parameters are negotiated between the client and financial institution, the OCBC 1.5 deg C loan sets \"science-based, measurable targets\" for clients to lower their emissions, based on the industries they are in. Since its launch in 2023, OCBC has offered the loan to major corporates, including City Developments Limited, CapitaLand Ascott Trust and Cofco International. </p><p> Beyond businesses, OCBC also supports retail investors on their sustainability journey. In February 2024, it launched the OCBC Sustainability Hub on its mobile app, allowing users to view the ESG rating of their investment portfolios. This feature helps individuals make more informed investment decisions and contribute to sustainability in a tangible way.</p><p> Staying the course</p><p> Ng reiterates that OCBC's net-zero commitment in its financed emissions is a \"strategic, long-term decision\", aligned with the enduring nature of climate change.</p><p> He acknowledges that some companies may choose to pause their green transition efforts for now, focusing on more immediate business challenges such as the impact of US tariffs.</p><p> Even so, he urges businesses to view decarbonisation as an integral part of their long-term strategy. As larger corporations increasingly scrutinise the emissions of their supply chains, smaller suppliers will find it in their business interest to reduce their own emissions in order to stay competitive. Improving on their sustainability metrics also allows companies to tap into the growing pool of sustainable finance.</p><p> Says Ng: \"Climate change will come back and bite us one of these days, sooner or later, in one way or another. So it's better to be prepared than not to be prepared.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ng says that OCBC's net-zero commitment in its financed emissions is a \"strategic, long-term decision\", aligned with the enduring nature of climate change.

Why are investors hesitant, and what needs to be done to get climate-aware investing into the mainstream'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Helge Muenkel: We have witnessed continuous improvement and strong efforts to transition our global economies to a net-zero future. According to the International Energy Agency, last year's global investments in clean energy were around double the amount going into fossil fuels. Ten years ago, fossil fuel investments were about 20 per cent larger than clean energy investments. Meanwhile, India is projected to achieve a major milestone in 2025, with renewable electricity providing for more than half of the country's power capacity, while China added more renewable power capacity in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notwithstanding this, current investment flows are still insufficient to allow us to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, complexities in the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape have understandably made investors more cautious in recent times. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Importantly, sustainable investing is not a short-term but a structural trend. Climate risk is increasingly recognised as a major driver of financial risk. Hence, most major investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their overall decision process.</p><p> Encouragingly, Asian regulators are stepping up. Across the region, many policies and regulations have been put in place that create an enabling environment, which supports climate action and related financing flows. This includes green and transition taxonomies and ESG disclosure standards.</p><p>  These developments bolster investor confidence and embed greater transparency in sustainable investing -- important steps in shifting these financing flows into the mainstream.</p><p> More work needs to be done. For instance, there is some ambiguity around what qualifies as transition and transition finance. The vast majority of assets and economic activities globally and in Asia are not yet green, and DBS believes it is critical to also allocate capital to support their transition to becoming greener. Beyond financing those assets and activities, transition finance can also help companies transform their entire businesses, all of which will contribute to the greening of the entire economy. </p><p> We see progress across the region on several fronts. Localised taxonomies are evolving to reflect regional contexts and developmental needs. Markets like Singapore are evolving disclosure rules and incentives for credible transition finance. </p><p> At DBS, we have observed growing sophistication in how capital is being deployed. For instance, we saw strong investor appetite for two green bonds DBS brought to the market recently. The first was the issuance of Equinix's S$500 million green bond in March 2025, its first Singapore dollar issuance. </p><p> The second was Asia's first public sustainability-linked securities offering by ST Telemedia Global Data Centres in January 2024. Both bonds were meaningfully oversubscribed, signalling growing investor demand for credible climate instruments.</p><p> Victor Wong: Investors' hesitation around sustainable or climate-aware investing, despite growing interest, often stems from structural challenges and other key concerns. </p><p> For example, the lack of standardisation and transparency in how ESG factors are assessed and reported. Without consistent metrics, it becomes difficult for investors to compare ESG investment products and evaluate their true impact. Additionally, some investors are concerned that corporates and governments may scale back their climate commitments which affect the short-term viability of such investments.</p><p> At UOB Asset Management, we view ESG integration as a strategic tool for value creation and risk mitigation. By embedding ESG considerations into our investment process, we aim to support long-term sustainability for our investees and their businesses. We also recognise that some investors may wish to explore and capitalise on advanced strategies to achieve specific impact or invest in specific themes. To meet these needs, we make ESG a core element of our investment thesis, aligning our strategies with both market realities and investor aspirations.</p><p> Mike Ng: One of the key considerations for investors when it comes to their investment decisions is the potential return. The recent increased geopolitical uncertainty and evolving regulatory landscape have tested investors' appetite to commit to sustainable investments since they are unsure about the future regulatory environment and the impact it may have on their investment returns. In addition, some investors may be hesitant given concerns about low-quality ESG data, greenwashing, as well as the perceived trade-off between sustainability and returns.</p><p> While interest in sustainable investment may fluctuate from time to time due to market sentiments and the geopolitical context, we believe that the overarching trend towards investments that take ESG factors and risks into consideration is here to stay. The challenges of sustainable investment are also being actively addressed. </p><p> Collaboration between stakeholders -- asset managers, data providers and regulatory bodies -- is paving the way for more standardisation in reporting frameworks and taxonomies, which will help mitigate concerns on data quality and greenwashing. Meanwhile, leading financial institutions are developing diverse and accessible products catering to varying preferences and risks appetites, and -- over time -- are also showing that sustainable investments can deliver required returns. </p><p> Sometimes, enabling investors with information can also make a big difference in mainstreaming sustainable investing. Take, for example, the OCBC Sustainability Hub, launched in 2024.</p><p>  The innovative platform empowers investors with a personal ESG rating, enabling them to track, understand and act on their investments, and to make informed financial decisions.</p><p>  Within just six months of its launch, the Sustainability Hub achieved a 2.3x year-on-year increase in sustainability-themed investments.</p><p> BT: What do you see as the most promising areas of investments for corporates and individuals that will address climate risks and reap a </p><p> return'</p><p> Helge Muenkel: The business case for climate-aligned investing remains robust particularly in Asia, where climate risk is acute, economic growth is rapid, and the green transition is gaining momentum.</p><p> We see strong opportunities emerging across several areas that offer both meaningful climate impact and attractive risk-adjusted returns.</p><p> One such area is energy. Investments in solar, wind and battery storage systems are increasingly competitive against fossil fuel alternatives. More importantly, enablers such as smart grids and demand management technologies -- especially in high-growth urban centres -- are essential to stabilising renewable energy supply and unlocking further scale.</p><p> Mobility is another sector where climate action meets opportunity. Across Asia, countries are racing ahead in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, charging infrastructure and intelligent traffic systems. Innovations such as ultra-fast charging and connected transport systems are also improving convenience and range, spurring consumer adoption. </p><p> Investors are increasingly focused on mobility platforms, EV supply chains and battery recycling, all of which present strong growth prospects as urbanisation and climate pressure reshape how people and goods move across the region.</p><p> In the agriculture sector, South-east Asia's role as a major rice producer makes agricultural adaptation a top priority. Agri-tech innovations and advanced water management systems can boost food security while safeguarding millions of livelihoods. </p><p> With strong social returns, such investments are increasingly attracting private capital, from agribusinesses investing in resilient seeds to impact investors funding water-saving irrigation technologies.</p><p> Another high-impact, cost-effective climate adaptation strategy is investing in nature-based solutions. </p><p> Restoring and protecting ecosystems such as mangroves, wetlands, coral reefs and forests provides \"natural infrastructure\" that reduces disaster risks, regulates water flows, buffers heat and sequesters carbon.</p><p>  For instance, mangrove restoration in Vietnam and the Philippines has proven effective in shielding coastal communities from storm surges. These solutions are relatively low-cost compared to traditional infrastructure such as concrete sea walls. </p><p> We are also seeing transition finance emerge as an investment theme, which is why we enhanced our Transition Finance Framework in 2025 -- to provide clients and stakeholders with greater clarity and transparency on eligible transition financing activities and enhance access to the financial resources required to accelerate climate action. This creates confidence not just for the bank but also for other ecosystem players.</p><p> Victor Wong: Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind continue to gain traction as demand for clean power grows. Promising investment areas that address climate risks while delivering returns include:</p><p> Mike Ng: In its 2025 Supertrends Report, the chief investment office at our private banking subsidiary, Bank of Singapore, stated its view that the power-hungry nature of technology and the energy transition will accelerate over the medium term. This will be fuelled by the proliferation of AI use cases and the accelerating demand growth for electricity over the long term, driven by developments in the clean energy transition, electric mobility, cooling, data centres and AI sectors. </p><p> As improvements in energy efficiencies of data centres, cooling and power systems infrastructure will be required, the search for cleaner energy sources including solar, wind and nuclear technologies to supplement existing energy sources will present investment opportunities.</p><p> While the US has sidelined the green agenda for now, the global shift towards clean energy remains crucial for humanity's long-term survival and offers substantial economic and investment prospects. According to a World Economic Forum White Paper from 2023, an estimated additional US$4.3 trillion in revenue and 232 million new jobs could be created in Asia by 2030 due to climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives. We see opportunities in companies with exposure to clean energy and EVs, as well as transition enablers focused on smart grid infrastructure, energy storage and efficiency, and producers of metals and minerals. </p><p> Policy shifts have also enabled the oil and gas industry to be part of the energy transition, by leveraging technology -- bioenergy and carbon capture -- and the ability to manage complex energy systems.</p><p> From a geographical perspective, China in particular has emerged as a green industry powerhouse. The country added 373 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity in the past year and now accounts for over 70 per cent of global EV production. In 2024 alone, it exported nearly 1.25 million electric cars.</p><p> BT: Plugging the funding gap to </p><p> mitigate climate risks is even more challenging today amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical </p><p> tensions. What do you see as the most promising sources of capital that remain relatively untapped, and how can corporates help? </p><p> Helge Muenkel: Despite the positive momentum described earlier, the financing gap for climate action in Asia remains daunting. </p><p> DBS estimates that over the next decade, the region will require approximately US$2.2 trillion for mitigation, US$2.5 trillion for adaptation, and a further 10 per cent of that total for resilience-related investments. In comparison, climate finance flows to South-east Asia from 2018 to 2019 totalled just US$27.8 billion annually. Even if this were to increase to US$50 billion annually, the shortfall over 10 years would still exceed US$4 trillion.</p><p> While the scale of capital needed is immense, it is not necessarily capital availability that is the issue -- rather, it is the lack of risk-adjusted returns that remain attractive enough to mobilise capital at scale. The priority must be on designing financing structures that shift the risk-return profile in favour of scalable investments. </p><p> This is where policy and regulatory frameworks become essential. Policymakers and regulators can create enabling environments through measures such as regulatory clarity on transition plans and incentives for green investments -- which can reduce uncertainty and improve the bankability of climate projects.</p><p> At the same time, financial innovation plays a pivotal role in unlocking new capital at a larger scale, such as concessionary and philanthropic capital. Structures like blended finance are particularly promising. They can de-risk early-stage projects, helping to crowd in commercial capital. For example, DBS inked a loan agreement alongside Karian Water Services, Export-Import Bank of Korea, the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation. </p><p> The loan went towards the development of a regional water supply system to deliver fresh water to around two million people across Jakarta, Tangerang and South Tangerang, marking the first blended finance transaction in the water sector in Indonesia. </p><p> We are also seeing the potential of transition credits to support decarbonisation pathways in hard-to-abate sectors. DBS co-leads a working group under the Transition Credits Coalition convened by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). It seeks to catalyse the creation of high-integrity, transition-related carbon credits. A core focus is to support the early and managed phaseout of thermal coal power across Asia, paving the way for credible, just-transition pathways -- particularly in industrial and emissions-intensive sectors.</p><p> Victor Wong: As both major asset holders and stakeholders in climate risk, insurers are well-positioned to play a dual role: investing in resilience infrastructure and integrating climate risks into underwriting and asset management. These areas remain relatively untapped, presenting a significant opportunity for impact.</p><p> Corporates also have a critical role to play. They can issue green and sustainability-linked bonds to fund climate-related activities, embed sustainability into procurement as corporates can stimulate demand for low-carbon goods and services -- thereby indirectly channelling capital into green innovation -- and engage in transparent reporting aligned with international frameworks. These actions can help build investor confidence and attract ESG-focused capital. </p><p> A good example within Asean is Indonesia, where the funding gap for climate action is particularly prominent. To decarbonise its energy and transportation sectors, Indonesia requires an average investment of US$9.1 billion annually from 2018 to 2030. Under its national plan, the government allocated US$2.1 billion annually from 2020 to 2024, leaving a significant annual shortfall of US$7 billion. This highlights the potential of private financing in advancing climate action.</p><p> Corporates -- especially national banks in Indonesia -- can play a key role in mobilising private financing, as fossil fuels continue to receive a bigger share of private investment compared to renewable energy. </p><p> Mike Ng: There is ample liquidity in the system. Banks are still committed to financing green and transition projects and technologies. One often-cited problem lies in the bankability of such projects is the ability to generate enough cashflow to make it suitable for financing or to attract investors. </p><p> Central to the issue of bankability is risk allocation; allocating specific risks to the party most capable of managing and mitigating them is critical. For instance, in a utility project, having the project offtaker (often a state-owned utility company) take on regulatory risks or manage market demand risks by establishing long-term take-or-pay offtake agreements is one avenue for risk allocation. </p><p> Another problem contributing to the climate finance gap is the high cost of adoption. If the cost of a new green solution is several times that of a fossil fuel-based solution, it simply does not make economic sense for companies to adopt it. To overcome this, governments can consider implementing subsidies and regulations that lower the cost of adoption and stimulate demand in the process. When supply grows along with demand, the cost curves associated with the new technology come down. When the technology becomes economically viable, the financing gap naturally narrows. </p><p> Besides tapping traditional financing for climate finance, there are other funding mechanisms to consider. One is blended finance. Traditionally, blended finance structures have been deployed at the project level, with each individual project attracting capital from different providers including multilateral agencies, development finance institutions, export credit agencies, banks and others.</p><p>  As each project has its own risk profile and characteristics, deployment of blended finance at the project level tends to be bespoke and time-consuming, making scalability a challenge.</p><p> To achieve scalability, blended finance structures can be deployed at the fund level which combines capital from multiple stakeholders with different risk-return requirements but with common impact objectives into a single investment scheme. The fund in turn allocates capital to the individual projects. </p><p> Funds have the flexibility to accommodate different risk-return profiles and objectives in the choice of capital providers and fund structure, as well as distribution waterfalls in the fund's documentation. Such flexibility enables the \"crowding in\" of additional capital from commercial investors, achieving scalability to deliver outcomes in areas such as energy transition, climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. </p><p> An example is the MAS' Financing Asia's Transition Partnership initiative, which aims to use an initial injection of US$500 million by the Singapore Government to raise funding from other sources up to a projected US$5 billion. </p><p> The goal is to finance green projects in Asia focused on accelerating the energy transition, ramping up green investments, and decarbonising emissions-intensive sectors such as cement and steel production.</p><p> Another benefit of blended finance is the blending of knowledge and expertise. The diversity of the participants brings a wealth of knowledge which can be shared. For example, multilateral agencies could advise on governance structures, engage local policymakers in enhancing bankability of project documentation, or provide training on ESG standards. Fund managers bring with them the expertise to evaluate project risks and returns, and to structure the fund to cater to the different investor profiles. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Nature-based solutions include protection and restoration of mangrove areas which help shield coastal communities from storm surges.

A very good evening to all of you. It is a pleasure to join you at the 8th DutchCham Winsemius Awards. This award honours the outstanding achievements of Dutch and Singaporean companies in business, innovation, sustainability and social impact - values that reflect the enduring legacy of Dr Albert Winsemius.</p><p>2. Many here would know Dr Winsemius as the Dutch economist who helped guide Singapore's early economic development. He saw possibilities where others saw limitations. Today, his legacy of vision, partnership and enterprise continues to inspire us.</p><p>3. The first Winsemius Awards event in 2015 was initiated to celebrate 50 years of Singapore's independence. In the year of SG60, I am delighted to be here this evening to celebrate a decade of enduring bonds between the Singapore and Dutch business communities. My warmest congratulations to all the finalists and winners tonight.</p><p>Celebrating 60 years of strong partnership</p><p>4. This evening holds special significance, as we mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between Singapore and the Netherlands, and 35 years of DutchCham's presence in Singapore.</p><p>5. Almost 2,000 Dutch companies have set up businesses here, contributing to our growth across healthcare, semiconductors, maritime, engineering, food, and more. Together, we have built globally connected ports, developed smart urban ecosystems, and advanced pioneering solutions in renewable energy and the circular economy.</p><p>6. The Netherlands is now Singapore's second largest EU investor and third largest goods trading partner. In turn, amongst EU Member States, the Netherlands is the second largest investment destination for Singapore companies.</p><p>7. Our partnership thrives because we share common values ofopenness, innovation, and a commitment to sustainable growth. Just within this year, we renewed the Singapore-Rotterdam Cooperation Agreement on maritime sustainability and also deepened cooperation in the semiconductor and other high-tech sectors. These are testaments of our shared ambitions to strengthen our pathfinding roles as respective gateways to Europe and ASEAN.</p><p>Looking ahead to the next 60 years</p><p>8. As we celebrate these milestones, it's timely to look ahead and reflect on what the next 60 years of Singapore-Netherlands collaboration could bring.</p><p>9. True to Dr Winsemius' spirit of turning constraints into opportunities, Singapore and the Netherlands have consistently sought to punch above our weight on the global stage. As we stand at the crossroads of a new global era - defined by digital transformation, decarbonisation, and geopolitical uncertainty, our cooperation as like-minded partners have never been more relevant.</p><p>10. Looking ahead, I see potential for deeper partnership in four critical areas:</p><p>a. First, in the green and digital transitions. From scaling up renewable energy to harnessing AI for smarter cities, Dutch innovations in areas like offshore wind and quantum computing pair naturally with Singapore's efforts to green our energy sources and build digital economies.</p><p>b. Second, climate adaptation and water management remain priority issues where the Netherlands leads globally. Singapore values this partnership as we strengthen our own urban resilience and coastal protection strategies.</p><p>c. Third, circular economy.</p><p>Both countries are advancing sustainable urban living - from boosting food resilience to turning waste into resources. Thereis rich potential for our businesses, researchers and policymakers to co-develop solutions that make sustainability a reality today.</p><p>d. Lastly, as global supply chains face growing pressures from climate risks and geopolitics, Singapore and the Netherlands - as trusted, connected trading hubs - can collaborate to reinforce supply chain resilience and build next-generation digital trade networks.</p><p>Celebrating the power of communities</p><p>11. In a rapidly changing world, the importance of building strong, connected communities remains a constant. It is these communities, across cities, industries and borders, that create lasting impact. Both Singapore and the Netherlands understand that it is not just about economic growth, but about building societies where people feel included, valued, and empowered.</p><p>12. That is why I am especially honoured to present the Winsemius Community Impact Award tonight. This Award recognises companies that go beyond business to uplift communities, lead with integrity, and create meaningful contributions to our society. It reminds us that true leadership lies not just in profit, but in purpose.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>13. This is why partners like DutchCham matter. Beyond a business network, you provide a bridge to connect ideas, people and possibilities. It reminds us that the strength of our economic relationship lies not only in business transactions, but the depth of trust and mutual understanding that underpin them.</p><p>14. This is very much like Dr Winsemius' relationship with theearly generation of Singaporean leaders, which lasted more than two decades. Even after his formal appointment had ended, Dr Winsemius continued to give counsel and keep informed about the Government's activities.</p><p>15. In many ways, it was this man who had the vision to spot a place like Singapore, which, at that time, was a developing and poor country, with very little resources and an imbalanced market, and one that not many people were paying attention to.</p><p>a. And yet, Dr Winsemius saw something in us, something that was different and valuable. He brought in companies like Philips, which started its lightbulb business in Jurong. Along with the investments in transistor radios, toothbrushes, and textiles, this era marked the beginning of Singapore's industrialisation.</p><p>b. Dr Winsemius' leadership and vision, along with that of our early leaders, developed Singapore into what it is today. Most importantly, they imparted important values which the Government still embraces today, such as hard work, openness, incorruptibility, doing business the right way, and being hard-headed.</p><p>c.

A very good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to the FAST Conference 2025.First, please let me acknowledge our partners for the FAST conference, Mr Cheng Wai Keung, Deputy Chairman of Temasek and Ms Susan Chan, Head of Asia Pacific of BlackRock.</p><p>2. We are facing a more uncertain path ahead for climate action than at any time in the last five years:</p><p>* There is greater uncertainty in global commitments to timely transition.</p><p>*Global private sector coalitions for climate action are also seeing a pullback. Many financial institutions have withdrawn from net zero alliances, and these alliances themselves have revised their objectives.</p><p>Global corporate investment more generally may also turn more cautious amid heightened trade and economic uncertainty.</p><p>3. On the positive side:</p><p>*COP29 saw broad agreement to enhance cooperation in such areas as carbon markets and climate adaptation, as well as new goals to channel financing to developing countries;</p><p>*Many countries have submitted their 2035 NDCs, reaffirming a steady pathway towards their net zero goals; and</p><p>*Many major financial institutions have affirmed continued commitment to their net zero targets.</p><p>4. We are meeting at a critical time. It is now even more important to bring together leaders across policy, finance and the real economy, to advance concrete approaches and solutions that will maintain the course for climate action and the region's transition to a climate-resilient and nature-positive future.</p><p>Enabling the Energy Transition in Asia</p><p>5. In Asia, enabling energy transition will be key to transitioning our economies.</p><p>Asia's demand for electricity is projected to rise at an annual rate of 4% until 2035[1], driven by end-use sectors such as transport, industry and buildings.</p><p>6. While energy demand is still growing, the good news is that in parts of Asia, renewable energy already makes up a significant share of the energy mix, supported by falling costs.</p><p>* Wind and solar generation capacity in China has already exceeded fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity for the first time in March this year.</p><p>*Countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia are also seeing lower renewable energy costs than that of coal-generated energy.[2]</p><p>7. There is an opportunity to drive the deployment of renewable energy and develop the infrastructure and solutions to support growth in Asian economies in a sustainable and resilient manner.</p><p>*The IEA expects renewable energy to supply more than half of Asia's increased electricity demand.[3]</p><p>*The increase in demand for electricity will catalyse a corresponding demand for supporting infrastructure and solutions. Earlier this year, ASEAN foreign ministers reaffirmed the commitment to operationalise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) by 2045.</p><p>*Almost S$1.1 trillion in financing is estimated to be needed over the next decade to ramp up renewable energy capacity, upgrade existing power grid infrastructure, and invest in battery storage systems.[4]</p><p>8. Singapore hopes to do more to catalyse the scaling up of renewables power generation and their enabling infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*Over the years, Singapore has supported partners across the entire infrastructure value chain, serving as the regional base to many international infrastructure development companies, project finance teams of global financial institutions, as well as multilateral development banks such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p><p>9. We have also put in place key initiatives to enable the financing of Asia's energy transition.</p><p>10. First, we have provided clear and credible definitions through the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (SAT) on what are green and transition activities, including activities within the Energy Sector.</p><p>*Specifically, for electricity generation using renewables such as solar PV and wind, the SAT sets out thresholds and criteria for classifying such activities as \"green\" or \"transition\".</p><p>*There has been good adoption amongst financial institutions and corporates of the SAT since its launch. Financial products have been developed based on the SAT's classifications, portfolios have been aligned with the SAT's criteria and corporate sustainability strategies have been formulated with reference to the SAT.</p><p>11. We are also bringing partners together through blended finance platforms to co-create solutions for the region, de-risk investments, and catalyse the flow of private capital, for energy transition projects.</p><p>*We launched the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) in end-2023 to raise up to US$5 billion to support Asia's decarbonisation and climate resilience.</p><p>*Within the FAST-P platform, the Green Investment Partnership (GIP), managed by Pentagreen Capital, will be ready to commence deployment in the coming months. They will mobilise capital for marginally bankable clean energy infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*I am also glad to share that a FAST-P office, with a dedicated management team, will soon be set up to facilitate the deployment of up to US$500 million of concessional capital from the Singapore Government into the three FAST-P partnerships, alongside capital from other partners. The office will continue to work closely with asset managers, banks, and commercial and concessional investors, to promote innovative blended finance solutions for sustainable infrastructure in the region.</p><p>12. These are important milestones, but we recognise that an ecosystem approach - regulators, businesses, and financial institutions coming together - will continue to be needed to overcome these challenges. MAS will continue to work closely with the industry to develop solutions to support the region's energy transition.</p><p>Developing High Integrity Carbon Markets</p><p>13. A second area of focus for Singapore is the development of high integrity carbon markets.There are situations where the economic case for climate projects may not be well-established, making it difficult to crowd in investors and capital. High-integrity and well-functioning carbon markets can play an important role, to strengthen the economic case for decarbonisation and channel much needed capital towards worthwhile projects.</p><p>14. There have been headwinds in the last few years, but recent developments such as the finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing industry acceptance of meta-standards such as the ICVCM's[5] Core Carbon Principles, are helping to build confidence in carbon markets.</p><p>15. Shaping a well-functioning global carbon market will require progress in the areas of (i) supply of high-integrity credits; (ii) strong demand for credits; and (iii) robust market infrastructure and capabilities. At the GenZero Climate Summit Insights earlier this week, 2nd Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng spoke about the work the Singapore Government is undertaking to address these gaps, including through developing common standards, crowding in financing, and building capabilities.</p><p>16. The Transition Credits Coalition convened by the MAS is also an important initiative that seeks to address some of these gaps in the carbon markets.</p><p>*In its interim report launched at COP29 last year, TRACTION outlined common key high-integrity attributes across various methodologies and frameworks for the early retirement of coal and its replacement with clean energy. It also identified the transaction risks and possible risk mitigation solutions, and motivations of different buyer profiles.</p><p>17. Building on these findings, TRACTION has identified the market and technical conditions where transition credits have the greatest potential to make an impact. This will enable the industry to prioritise a pipeline of suitable transition credits projects.</p><p>18. TRACTION has also identified the key components of a Just Transition associated with the early retirement of coal plants, to guide project owners and financial institutions to address the socio-economic impacts of coal plant closures on workers and communities.</p><p>19. These findings help foster a common understanding of high-integrity and viable transition credit transactions, enhancing the scalability of transition credits as a mechanism to crowd in financing for energy transition.</p><p>20. I would also highlight the work of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA is collaborating with the Singapore Government to develop guidance for companies on the credible usage of carbon credits alongside a decarbonisation plan. They are also developing solutions to deepen carbon project financing and collaborating with ASEAN counterparts on the ASEAN Common Carbon Framework.</p><p>21. MAS, together with the SSFA, are now considering initiatives to further support financial institutions' participation in carbon markets.</p><p>Strengthening Climate and Nature Resilience in the Financial Sector</p><p>22. Let me move on to a growing area of importance, that of adaptation and resilience. As the physical impact of climate change intensifies, there are mounting risks posed by both climate change and nature loss - risks that have cascading effects across sectors, markets, and value chains.</p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) intends to consider more closely how climate-related physical risks can pose threats to financial stability.<br/><br/>MAS took early steps in 2020 to embed resilience in the financial system, by issuing a set of Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM). These set out expectations for robust governance, risk management, and disclosures related to environmental risks.</p><p>Our financial institutions have also started to enhance the resilience of their portfolios to climate and nature risks. For example, by integrating physical climate risk into their internal credit risk models, asset valuation, and due diligence processes. Doing so will enable them to better anticipate and manage financial loss, minimise stranded assets, and uncover new financing and investment opportunities.</p><p>23. There is growing interest in how nature loss and ecosystem degradation can amplify the effects of climate change and put nature-dependent value chains at risk. It is timely that the SSFA, in partnership with Oliver Wyman, launched a white paper two weeks ago, titled \"Financing Our Natural Capital.\"</p><p>*The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks to our region, identifies sectors of high priority from a nature materiality lens, and provides practical steps for financial institutions to incorporate nature into their business activity.</p><p>24. Beyond managing their own environmental risk, financial institutions play an essential role in mobilising capital towards solutions that enhance the adaptive capacity of economies and communities.</p><p>*The insurance industry in particular has a key role in developing risk financing solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies, to reduce the risk of such projects for commercial investors.</p><p>*Several international insurance brokers have built specialised capabilities in Singapore to support and develop such risk financing solutions, through risk analytics and advisory for physical climate risk, energy transition investments, and carbon and nature markets.</p><p>25. Ultimately, financial institutions can respond on two fronts: by managing exposure to growing climate and nature-related risks, and by innovating to finance and de-risk adaptation, resilience, and nature-positive solutions.</p><p>Staying the Course and Building the Future</p><p>26. There are near-term uncertainties about the global momentum for climate action, but Asia can continue to chart a steady course in its transition. Policymakers, financial institutions, and corporates alike should take the long view, stay the course, and invest in the infrastructure, solutions, and capabilities that will enable industries and economies to transition. In doing so, we will unlock new opportunities for growth, create jobs, build resilient economies and make possible a more resilient future for all of us.</p><p>27.

As China\u2019s GDP is decelerating, the government needs to cut emissions more aggressively to achieve the carbon intensity target set previously.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>                        A view shows a protest projection set up by Greenpeace activists onto the wall of the US Embassy in Berlin against Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, in Berlin, Germany, on 21 January 2025.</p><p>                        In recent years, the reliance on industrial growth to recover from the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased energy demand and, consequently, higher emissions in China. This situation is compounded by domestic coal consumption, which remains a significant barrier to its climate leadership aspirations. </p><p>                        Despite pledges to halt overseas coal projects, domestic coal burning still accounts for more than half of China\u2019s energy consumption and two-thirds of its electricity output. This reliance on coal poses a challenge to China\u2019s ability to drastically reduce emissions and transition to cleaner energy sources.\u00a0</p><p>                        Emerging as the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle (EV) market and producer, China needs to charge its EVs with electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar rather than coal burning. Otherwise, the carbon footprints of these EVs may be even larger than cars with gasoline engines.</p><p>                        Achieving carbon neutrality will require significant reforms in China\u2019s energy sector and broader economy, which may not occur until after 2035.</p><p>                        Significant reforms needed</p><p>                        While China has made remarkable achievements in the development of renewable energy like wind, solar and hydro power, the pace of structural changes needed to fully transition away from coal is far from satisfactory. Achieving carbon neutrality will require significant reforms in China\u2019s energy sector and broader economy, which may not occur until after 2035. This timeline raises questions about China\u2019s ability to lead global climate efforts in the near term.</p><p>                        A man walks before wind turbines of Chinese company Goldwind in Zhangjiakou, northern China\u2019s Hebei province on 26 March 2025.</p><p>                        Despite the current US administration\u2019s climate position, it is important for China to maintain climate and energy cooperation with the US and the EU, which helps the country improve its image and potentially seek global leadership. However, China\u2019s current domestic challenges and missed targets indicate that it may not yet be ready to fully assume this role. The international community will continue to closely watch China\u2019s mitigation actions, as its success or failure will have significant implications for global efforts to combat climate change.</p><p>                        Moreover, China\u2019s geopolitical strategies and economic policies add complexity to its climate leadership ambitions. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while promoting infrastructure development, has been criticised for supporting projects that may not align with global mitigation or adaptation goals. The initiative\u2019s prioritisation of economic expansion sometimes overshadows environmental considerations, posing a challenge to China\u2019s ability to lead by example in climate efforts.</p><p>                        Domestic concerns may impede China\u2019s global climate leadership role</p><p>                        China\u2019s approach to climate leadership is further complicated by its domestic socioeconomic priorities. Although the key is to have sustainable and green growth, the government\u2019s need to maintain a 5% GDP growth in 2025 may take precedence over environmental concerns. This prioritisation can lead to policy decisions that favour short-term economic gains over long-term sustainability, affecting China\u2019s credibility as a climate leader. Lack of an active civil society that supports environmental activism and supervises government and corporate behaviours is weakening the country\u2019s ability to take costly but necessary mitigation actions.\u00a0</p><p>                        China, with the world\u2019s second largest computing power scale, witnesses an annual growth of 15% in its data centres\u2019 power usage, which accounts for about 4% of the national electricity consumption in 2025.</p><p>                        Additionally, the energy and environmental impact of China\u2019s technological advancements in AI-driven solutions is contingent on the integration of more low-carbon energy into the local energy networks. China, with the world\u2019s second largest computing power scale, witnesses an annual growth of 15% in its data centres\u2019 power usage, which accounts for about 4% of the national electricity consumption in 2025.</p><p>                        Paradoxically, the role of AI in optimising intermittent renewable energy supply and improving energy efficiency is also a critical component of China\u2019s climate strategy.\u00a0</p><p>                        People walk past a shopping mall complex during a polluted day in Beijing on 1 March 2025.</p><p>                        AI advancements could aid climate adaptation and mitigation</p><p>                        China\u2019s technological advancements in AI offer potential solutions for climate adaptation and mitigation. AI can optimise renewable energy production, improve energy efficiency and provide actionable insights for governance, enabling data-driven policymaking for more effective interventions aimed at addressing inclusive growth issues. This scalable model for energy efficiency shows promise, but its implementation on a national scale in China is still nascent.</p><p>                        China\u2019s collaboration with other nations is crucial for the country\u2019s climate leadership. Engaging China for sustainability in Asia requires partnership and cooperation among Asian and Western economies. Solidifying mutual trust through cooperation on shared interests like climate change and green economic transition is essential for China to enhance its leadership role. </p><p>                        With the absence of the US, global actions against climate change urgently need the unity and consensus between China and other major players like the EU and ASEAN. China needs to kickstart strategic dialogues with these blocs on climate and energy issues as soon as possible.\u00a0</p><p>                        China\u2019s interest in low-carbon energy sectors in Southeast Asia a boon</p><p>                        China\u2019s ambition to become a major provider of capital, construction services, and equipment to low-carbon energy sectors in Southeast Asia is another facet of its potential climate leadership. Chinese companies have been active in energy-related construction services, equipment, and investments in conventional energy projects, including low-carbon hydropower and grid construction. The transition from conventional to new energy projects has just started, and the pace of this transition will significantly impact China\u2019s ability to lead in global climate efforts.</p><p>                        While China has made strides in green transition, its missed emissions targets and ongoing reliance on coal suggest that it is still not prepared to take on global climate leadership.</p><p>                        The sun rises over solar panels at a village in Taizhou, in China\u2019s eastern Jiangsu province on 26 March 2025.</p><p>                        The falling costs of solar and wind energy, partly driven by low-cost manufacturing of related products in China, have energised the expansion of renewables globally. This trend has been particularly evident in many Western countries, where the cost of installing solar and wind generators has decreased significantly, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. China\u2019s role in driving down these costs highlights its potential to influence global renewable energy markets positively. Nevertheless, the tariffs levied by President Trump are complicating the global supply chain issue and weakening China\u2019s role as the major supplier of renewable energy equipment.\u00a0</p><p>                        While China has made strides in green transition, its missed emissions targets and ongoing reliance on coal suggest that it is still not prepared to take on global climate leadership. The international community needs to press China for more aggressive actions home and abroad, as its success or failure will have significant implications for global efforts to combat climate change. China\u2019s journey towards climate leadership is a complex interplay of domestic challenges, technological advancements and international relations, all of which must be navigated carefully to achieve substantial progress.</p><p>                        Related: Trump 2.0 will slow, not kill, the global energy transition | Tan Min Yih: How Shell Mobility gets ready for a green future</p><p>                        This picture shows the coal-powered Datang International Zhangjiakou Power Station in Zhangjiakou, in China\u2019s northern Hebei province on 15 November 2021.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-6117301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHV-CD03-RVCT-B4Y4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The need for blended finance Sharad Somani, partner and head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out that adaptation measures are often seen as the poorer cousin of climate mitigation; they are under-invested, as the focus has been to contain climate impacts through the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p> That's because most adaptation measures tend to be public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems. And such projects tend not to lend themselves well to traditional commercial financing models, said Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public-sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re. </p><p> This is because dividends often manifest as a loss avoided, rather than an additive cash flow on which investors can rely on, he added.</p><p> On top of these challenges are the facts that adaptation efforts are costly and most often needed in countries with limited resources, and they tend to be localised projects -- where there are plenty of needs competing for limited funds, he also said.</p><p> The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments. However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period. </p><p> Citing forecasts from the UN Environment Programme, Somani pointed out that the annual cost of climate adaptation in poor countries alone could double or possibly even quadruple -- from US$70 billion today to between US$140 billion and US$300 billion by 2030.</p><p> To direct such high levels of capital towards climate adaptation, observers said that blended finance -- which combines private, public and catalytic funding -- is an important mechanism.</p><p> Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.</p><p> \"Only then, when you de-risk to this point... private players with innovative solutions can come in and build adaptation solutions on top of that, because they know that they have a stable policy environment, they know they have risk support, they know they have technical support,\" she said. </p><p> Catalytic funding, in the form of grants, government incentives or impact investment, can also be the first layer of capital that enables the development of pilot solutions and proofs of concept, said Varbanov. He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. </p><p> Mobilising private finance To get more private financing into climate adaptation, Somani said there is a need to address companies' bias against such measures, which are often wrongly perceived as having low returns and impact. </p><p> The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted. As the impacts of climate change become more evident, businesses may actually end up forking out as much as 44 per cent of their profits to pay for damages caused by climate-related impacts, going by an economic study of nearly 15,000 public companies published in the journal Science last month. </p><p> One way to unlock more private-sector financing for climate adaptation is to have companies pay more attention to disaster risk, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific Climate and Resilience Hub.</p><p> For example, a coastal manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, which experiences 20 typhoons annually on average, would see the value of investing in the conservation of mangrove swamps. These natural ecosystems have proven to be effective in preventing storm surges from reaching inland.</p><p> \"This is a public good... But the mangrove being there is providing (the factory) financial benefits. It's protecting your facilities. It's allowing you to exist...

Catalytic funding from the government would be an important starting point to lower the risks of adaptation-development projects, but the observers also said that it is paramount for the private sector to invest in such measures to build business resilience - especially for sectors such as agriculture, which is directly exposed to climate-change impacts.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first Global Stocktake synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.The need for blended finance Sharad Somani, partner and head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out that adaptation measures are often seen as the poorer cousin of climate mitigation; they are under-invested, as the focus has been to contain climate impacts through the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.That's because most adaptation measures tend to be public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems. And such projects tend not to lend themselves well to traditional commercial financing models, said Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public-sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re. </p><p>This is because dividends often manifest as a loss avoided, rather than an additive cash flow on which investors can rely on, he added.On top of these challenges are the facts that adaptation efforts are costly and most often needed in countries with limited resources, and they tend to be localised projects - where there are plenty of needs competing for limited funds, he also said.The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments. However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period. Citing forecasts from the UN Environment Programme, Somani pointed out that the annual cost of climate adaptation in poor countries alone could double or possibly even quadruple - from US$70 billion today to between US$140 billion and US$300 billion by 2030.To direct such high levels of capital towards climate adaptation, observers said that blended finance - which combines private, public and catalytic funding - is an important mechanism.Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.\"Only then, when you de-risk to this point... private players with innovative solutions can come in and build adaptation solutions on top of that, because they know that they have a stable policy environment, they know they have risk support, they know they have technical support,\" she said. Catalytic funding, in the form of grants, government incentives or impact investment, can also be the first layer of capital that enables the development of pilot solutions and proofs of concept, said Varbanov. He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. Mobilising private finance To get more private financing into climate adaptation, Somani said there is a need to address companies' bias against such measures, which are often wrongly perceived as having low returns and impact. The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted.As the impacts of climate change become more evident, businesses may actually end up forking out as much as 44 per cent of their profits to pay for damages caused by climate-related impacts, going by an economic study of nearly 15,000 public companies published in the journal Science last month. One way to unlock more private-sector financing for climate adaptation is to have companies pay more attention to disaster risk, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific Climate and Resilience Hub.For example, a coastal manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, which experiences 20 typhoons annually on average, would see the value of investing in the conservation of mangrove swamps. These natural ecosystems have proven to be effective in preventing storm surges from reaching inland.\"This is a public good... But the mangrove being there is providing (the factory) financial benefits. It's protecting your facilities. It's allowing you to exist... You may not own the mangrove, but we think you should invest in its conservation because it's protecting your facility,\" said Au. He also noted that there has been academic work showing that such nature-based solutions reduce losses from natural disasters by 25 per cent. With reduced losses as a result of climate adaptation, companies could potentially experience more affordable and stable insurance premiums as well, though observers noted that premiums may not actually come down given that many other factors are being considered when pricing them. While some told BT that there is a lack of data - regarding both adaptation activities and exposure to climate-related events - to help others understand how adaptation investments could affect broader risk assessments, Tobias Grimm said Munich Re has seen strong indications in its own data and analysis that climate change is a massive loss driver.The head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at the reinsurer said: \"Strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability - at both individual and community levels - will help to soften the societal and economic shocks of natural disasters.\"While all companies across all sectors should invest in strengthening their business resilience against climate-related events, the agriculture industry is particularly exposed to direct impacts, observers pointed out.With farmers facing more drastic weather cycles, major agribusinesses that depend on them as suppliers could consider extending loans to these farming cooperatives for them to invest in better irrigation systems or purchase seeds with higher yields, said Willis Tower Watson's Au. Financial institutions, though not directly hit by such events, have the most difficult and widespread exposure, said Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact. \"Portfolio managers face a daunting task (grappling) with widespread impact and inability to drive direct adaptation measures on the ground,\" they said. On the other hand, property developers are potentially big winners, especially those ahead of the curve on sustainable design and construction, said Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. \"In the future, we can imagine floating residential districts off the coasts of Asia's big cities, integrated with resilient infrastructure. In the more immediate future, onshore developments can incorporate flood protection with restoration of waterways and urban regeneration, raising property values,\" she added. Technology companies with solutions to improve water efficiency and reuse wastewater also stand to benefit in an increasingly water-insecure region.Ultimately, regardless of the sector they are in, companies that take measures to strengthen their resilience against climate-related impacts would be able to stay ahead of the game, observers said.Those that are able to come up with adaptation solutions, such as climate-adaptive clothing that is able to cool down body temperatures, or incorporate drought- or flood-resilient materials in construction, could also come out on top, said Bhatia of ERM. Sometimes, adaptation actions do not have to come in the form of an infrastructure project, which is the conventional idea of what such measures entail. Au noted that some companies are already increasing their resilience by identifying risks in their supply chains and addressing, diversifying or shortening them. \"The market will increasingly favour forward-looking companies that prioritise sustainability and are mitigating and adapting to climate change for a robust supply chain,\" said KPMG's Somani.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Observers say that the private sector should look into investing in climate adaptation to increase business resilience, especially for sectors such as agriculture, which is directly exposed to climate-change impacts.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6999-2KC1-JCF2-8006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Lawyers are making their presence felt in this electoral cycle. This pattern invites a deeper examination of what these legal minds bring to Singapore's governance, and why their participation matters for the nation's future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A tradition of legal expertise in politicsSingapore's politics has historically welcomed legal professionals, beginning with founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, himself Cambridge-trained in law. This tradition continues with current stalwarts like K Shanmugam, who has served as minister for law since 2008; Edwin Tong, minister for culture, community and youth; Indranee Rajah, minister in the Prime Minister's Office and second minister for finance; and Murali Pillai, minister of state for transport and law. All of them are senior counsels. </p><p> In the history of Singapore, only 100 senior counsels have ever been appointed. Beyond these distinguished senior legal figures, many other lawyers have made significant contributions to governance, including Desmond Lee, who has served as minister for national development since 2020. Their contributions have demonstrated how legal training can translate effectively to governance.</p><p> The current election sees this tradition evolving with fresh faces. The PAP's new candidates who are lawyers include Gho Sze Kee (shipping lawyer), Cassandra Lee (who has legal expertise in corporate matters) and Marshall Lim (former deputy public prosecutor). </p><p> They join PAP members like Alex Yeo, Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, Christopher de Souza, Hany Soh, Nadia Ahmad Samdin, Patrick Tay, Rahayu Mahzam and Vikram Nair in bringing diverse legal perspectives into the political arena. A quick count reveals that the PAP is fielding at least 16 out of 97 candidates who are legally trained in GE2025. </p><p> On the opposition front, the WP has fielded several lawyers as new candidates, including Sufyan Mikhail Putra, Alia Mattar, Fadli Fawzi and Harpreet Singh (who is a senior counsel), while Andre Low holds a law degree. They join other legally trained experienced candidates including Dennis Tan, He Ting Ru, Sylvia Lim and party leader Pritam Singh. That is nine of the 26 candidates the WP is fielding in this election. </p><p> Other opposition parties have also fielded lawyers, such as Lim Tean of Peoples Voice and Stephanie Tan of the Progress Singapore Party. </p><p> What lawyers uniquely contributeEach represents not just legal acumen, but specialised knowledge in different legal domains that could inform various aspects of legislation. </p><p> Legal professionals bring distinct advantages to parliamentary service. Their training fosters precise analytical thinking, and the ability to identify unforeseen consequences in policy proposals. Years of practice in constructing and challenging arguments prepare them to scrutinise legislation with thoroughness and rigour that can improve legislative outcomes.</p><p> For example, Edwin Tong's path from senior counsel to ministry leadership demonstrates how legal expertise transfers to policy implementation. His experience handling complex commercial cases equipped him with the skills to navigate multifaceted policy challenges, particularly in culturally sensitive domains where principles must be carefully balanced against pragmatic considerations.</p><p> Legal training also emphasises the importance of procedural fairness and accountability. Lawyers understand that how decisions are made can be as important as the decisions themselves -- an insight that strengthens democratic institutions. </p><p>  A bridge between policy and implementationThe prevalence of lawyers in Singapore's political landscape speaks to the unique position they occupy between policy formation and practical implementation. </p><p> Take Marshall Lim's background as a former deputy public prosecutor. This experience provides first-hand insight into how criminal justice policies affect real people and communities. Similarly, shipping lawyers like Gho Sze Kee understand the implications of maritime regulations on Singapore's status as a global port and trading hub.</p><p> This practical dimension means legally trained politicians can anticipate implementation challenges and design more effective legislation. Their experience navigating regulatory frameworks allows them to construct policies that achieve intended aims while minimising unintended consequences. </p><p> Furthermore, legal professionals are bound by strict ethical codes that emphasise integrity, independence and duty to uphold justice. When these values transfer to political service, they can strengthen governance standards. </p><p> Another valuable dimension lawyers bring to politics is their training in clear, persuasive communication. The ability to distil complex issues into understandable terms and construct compelling arguments serves politicians well in both parliamentary debate and public engagement.</p><p> Currently, the PAP has four senior counsels running in GE2025, and the WP has one. The senior counsel appointment represents the pinnacle of Singapore's legal profession -- recognition of exceptional ability, knowledge and integrity. When these distinguished jurists enter politics, they bring unparalleled depth of expertise in constitutional matters, regulatory frameworks and complex legal considerations that affect national policy.</p><p> Their presence on either side of the political divide signals the importance all parties place on high-calibre legal thinking in addressing Singapore's challenges. </p><p> Professional diversitySingapore benefits most from a Parliament that reflects diverse professional backgrounds. The complexity of issues facing the nation -- from technological disruption to climate adaptation -- demands varied expertise. Engineers bring technical innovation, educators understand social development, healthcare professionals grasp public health priorities, and business leaders comprehend economic realities.</p><p> The ideal Parliament is not dominated by any single profession, but rather harnesses complementary perspectives. Lawyers who recognise this understand their role is not to monopolise discourse, but to contribute their specialised skills within a broader collaborative framework.</p><p> As Singapore navigates increasingly complex challenges -- from digital regulation to geopolitical positioning -- legally trained parliamentarians will play a vital role in crafting sophisticated responses. Their ability to parse nuanced implications, anticipate legal challenges and draft precise legislation provides a foundation for effective governance. The number of lawyers contesting in GE2025 reflects recognition of these challenges. </p><p> For Singaporean voters, this trend offers the promise of rigorous debate and well-considered policy.

Cumulatively, this reduction is more than half of the $2.7 billion the bank held in 2021. </p><p> Meanwhile, it has also introduced an enhanced transition finance framework that should help speed up decarbonisation across Asia.</p><p> Unlike green finance, which is used exclusively to finance eligible green projects such as developing renewable energy sources, transition finance covers a broader range of industries that have yet to fall into the \"green\" category, but are still working on their sustainability goals. </p><p> Ms Gulrajani said that this framework was revised to align the bank's definitions and guidelines with the latest internationally-recognised best practices.</p><p> The bank has also continued to implement responsible business practices.</p><p> More than 22,000 employees are equipped with fundamental knowledge about sustainability, including climate-related topics, according to the report. </p><p> Separately, the lender has committed more than $100 million to support the wider community, the report said. </p><p> This includes $98.1 million in funding earmarked for multi-year programmes that focus on the provision of essential needs and fostering inclusion, while $4.5 million was set aside for commercial businesses that provide innovative solutions to create positive social or environmental change.</p><p> Large US banks have backtracked on their commitment to sustainability and climate action in the wake of US President Donald Trump's re-election in November 2024. </p><p> The exodus from the Net Zero Banking Alliance includes Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs.</p><p> Their withdrawal appears driven by factors such as political pressure from the Trump administration, legal concerns, including investigations into potential antitrust violations, shifting market dynamics and the opportunity cost of not investing in or lending to fossil-fuel companies.</p><p> DBS chief sustainability officer Helge Muenkel said: \"Notwithstanding these recent setbacks, DBS remains firmly committed to climate action and sustainable financing.\" </p><p> He added: \"We are also pushing hard into transition financing because this is what it takes to help businesses decarbonise.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Shilpa Gulrajani, DBS' head of sustainable finance, says Asian businesses face pressure to migrate to low-carbon business models. photo: DBS Bank</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-DPGM549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F8P-25M3-RWT6-B0C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Public-sector spending is nowhere near the amount required. On the other hand, private-sector capital is profit-driven, and therefore has no appetite for large swathes of adaptation projects. The recently released synthesis report of the Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake -- the first worldwide progress review of the 2015 climate pact -- found that the world is still short of where it needs to be to avoid catastrophic global temperatures. The current rate of warming and the prospect of even higher temperatures have made it imperative to not merely try to arrest global warming, but also to address its impact until we can right the ship. </p><p> \"Owing to climate-related and other factors, loss and damage is already being observed and risks are growing, meaning that enhancing action and support for averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage is urgently needed,\" the report stated.</p><p> The 2022 Adaptation Gap report by the United Nations Environment Programme estimated that annual adaptation needs are between US$160 billion and US$340 billion by 2030, growing to between US$315 billion and US$565 billion by 2050. Yet international adaptation finance for developing countries was just US$28.6 billion in 2020, a fraction of what is needed.</p><p> It is tempting, wherever a financing gap exists, to immediately find a private-sector solution. Indeed, numerous initiatives such as the Adaptation and Resilience Investors Collaborative, the Principles for Responsible Banking and the Global Impact Investor Network have all been trying to increase private flows into adaptation. But as the Adaptation report put it, \"private-sector finance for adaptation is not a panacea\".</p><p> The fundamental problem is that private capital must deliver financial returns to its owners. What is profitable and low-risk is a subset of what is needed, and not necessarily what is most urgent. Yet it is possible to tweak that calculation in favour of adaptation. But doing so requires help from all sides. Globally, countries need to bump up adaptation as a priority. There is a positive feedback loop between adaptation and mitigation, and doing more of one makes it easier to do the other. </p><p> Pouring money into mitigation without paying commensurate heed to adaptation is like swimming with one arm. Shifting some public-sector resources towards adaptation, in the form of procurement contracts and concessionary capital, will help to catalyse private-sector participation. There also needs to be a worldwide effort to better model potential loss and damage. That data then needs to be applied through the right pricing of carbon and risk. Governments need to correctly impose a price on emissions, and insurers need to integrate climate-related risks into their policies, so that we are properly accounting for the cost of inaction.</p><p> Finally, it might be time to take a coordinated and integrated approach towards climate action that doesn't separate mitigation and adaptation. For instance, restoring mangroves can build carbon sinks while reducing coastal hazards. Identifying opportunities for such co-benefits can greatly improve the efficiency of capital. The cost of adaptation is inevitable. We can invest now to prevent damage, or pay for the losses later. Time is running out.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-TB4D6MG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:698F-5VM1-DYX4-0020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

These disclosures include a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\u00e2\u20ac said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p>Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\u00e2\u20ac he said. He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\u00e2\u20ac Chia said. The reporting of Scope 3 emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which arise from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstream and downstream value chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date. We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\u00e2\u20ac said Ng. Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate. Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). From 2024, companies subject to Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.Carbon markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\u00e2\u20ac, said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\u00e2\u20ac he said. To spur the supply of carbon credits, start-up incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit. EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.While no announcements are expected on Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr Rao.Targeted help for SMEsSeveral market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. While Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\u00e2\u20ac, said Helge Muenkel, DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief sustainability officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\u00e2\u20ac he said. Eric Lian, UOB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac To accelerate SMEs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. Climate adaptationSome industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\u00e2\u20acEY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tekchandani similarly expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\u00e2\u20ac. This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience. Budget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\u00e2\u20ac he said. DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pragmatic and long-term approach, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\u00e2\u20ac.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F4V-JS93-RT4M-90GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

An October 2024 article by Temasek Trust highlights a global funding gap in the trillions, estimating that between US$2.5 trillion ($3.24 trillion) and US$4 trillion in annual financing and investment are needed to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his welcome address at the fifth Philanthropy Asia Summit (PAS) on May 5, Lim Boon Heng, chairman of both the Philanthropy Asia Alliance (PAA) and Temasek Holdings, highlighted the shrinking pool of international aid, which is creating \"critical gaps\" in areas such as climate adaptation, food security and public health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During the same event, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a PAS panel discussion with Gates Foundation chair and trustee Bill Gates, warned that this global retreat from aid is unlikely to reverse anytime soon. Tharman, who is also the patron of the PAA, notes that \"even with China stepping up, somewhat, there is a significant reduction in aid monies\".</p><p>In March, the Donald Trump administration cut over 80% of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) programmes, which are responsible for providing foreign aid in areas such as health, education and economic development. These programmes spent \"tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve\", said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X in early March. Similarly, several European countries have reduced foreign aid to prioritise defence and domestic issues.</p><p>Given these funding cuts, the world must maximise the value of every dollar, whether from public, philanthropic or private sources. \"None of their own is going to be enough, but all three need a step up, not just in volumes, but in terms of effectiveness,\" says Tharman. This means countries have to be more self-sufficient, although many still require international support through multilateral development banks (MDBs), bilateral schemes and so on, he adds.</p><p>Making a difference</p><p>While building up domestic tax capacity and running budgets more effectively is an \"extremely important challenge\", it is not a hopeless case at all. \"Many people don't realise that in the lowest income parts of the world, several countries have significantly increased their tax collection, I'm talking about by two or three percentage points of GDP over the last decade,\" says Tharman. However, he acknowledges that there is a \"capacity issue\", in how countries can digitise tax systems, build up monitoring systems, enforcement systems and so on.</p><p>Gates, whose foundation has disbursed a \"little bit more\" than US$100 billion in the last 25 years, agrees that the world may go through a \"tough period\" with the funding cuts.</p><p>Even so, he believes the world is unlikely to return to the child mortality rates seen at the turn of the century, when 10 million children died before the age of five, due to innovative tools such as new vaccines that protect girls from HIV and treatments that prevent maternal deaths from childbirth-related bleeding.</p><p>Even relatively modest investments can have a profound impact. Just a few thousand dollars that go towards bed nets or medicine for neglected tropical diseases can save lives. Even a gift of US$1 million \"can make a huge difference,\" says Gates, who is also the co-founder of software firm Microsoft.</p><p>Beyond making a difference for an important moral cause, Tharman sees broader economic returns from giving as well. Citing Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, every dollar given eventually generates US$54 in return and, beyond that, broader economic returns like healthier and more productive lives for everyone.</p><p>This is the type of thinking that should motivate the global public sector as well as philanthropic giving, he adds. \"We're doing this not just out of the goodness of our hearts. We're doing this not just because it is an important moral cause, but because we are all better off living in a world where every country has populations that lead wealthier and productive lives. We are all safer and we are all better off.\"</p><p>Philanthropy's climate impact</p><p>Beyond public health, Asia remains severely underfunded in tackling climate change, says Ravi Menon, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and current Ambassador for Climate Action. Menon also serves as senior adviser at the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS).</p><p>The region's annual funding gap for climate mitigation and adaptation exceeds US$800 billion, driven by factors such as insufficient public capital and a reluctance among private investors to commit.</p><p>The mismatch presents an opportunity for philanthropy to step up and play a larger role in driving climate action in Asia, Menon says. \"A partnership across public, private and philanthropic capital and philanthropic capital can help effectively fill the gaps in Asia's climate finance.\"</p><p>Less than 2% of philanthropic giving is directed towards preventing climate change, and of that, only around 12% reaches Asia, despite the region's outsized needs, Menon notes. Asia accounts for 50% of global emissions, and 90% of the world's future growth in energy demand will stem from the region, he adds.</p><p>Asia will also suffer the most from climate change, with over one billion people in South and Southeast Asia being affected by the extreme heat by 2080. Asia's climate-induced losses could also reach about 40% of the region's GDP by 2100.</p><p>Philanthropists may leverage funding instruments such as blended finance to maximise the impact of their contributions. \"The premise of blended finance is to use concessional capital to de-risk and crowd in multiples of commercial capital,\" says Menon, who notes that the concessional layer from both philanthropic and public capital accepts first loss and lower returns, which then catalyses \"significantly more\" private capital. \"Blended finance allows philanthropies to amplify the impact of their giving, because for every dollar they put in, they are crowding in multiples of private capital.\"</p><p>Measuring outcomes</p><p>Philanthropy is also evolving in how it's practised, with a new generation of leaders keen to see the impact of their contributions, says Tharman. While financial returns remain a consideration, these leaders are equally focused on the social impact they create, he adds. \"They want to see a broader economic impact in the lives of beneficiaries. So I think that thinking has shifted, and it's important now to develop the methods that allow us to measure impact.\"</p><p>The Tanoto Foundation, for example, takes an evidence-based approach, identifying the root causes of issues it aims to address and investing in long-term change, says Belinda Tanoto, managing director of the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) group and trustee of the Tanoto Foundation. Belinda is the younger daughter of Indonesian businessman Sukanto Tanoto, founder and chairman of RGE.</p><p>Sukanto, along with his wife, Tinah Bingei Tanoto, established the Tanoto Foundation in 1981.</p><p>Formally launched in 2000, the foundation operates in Indonesia, Singapore, China and Brazil, countries that align with the family's business operations. Its focus areas include education, early childhood development and other key social initiatives. \"Our approach is different,\" says Belinda in an interview with The Edge Singapore on the sidelines of the PAS, when asked about the shift in thinking among the next generation of philanthropists.</p><p>This generation is more inclined to collaborate with partners, pool resources, bring together their networks and engage with governments, she adds. At PAS, one example is the Tanoto Foundation signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Gates Foundation to jointly advance health, nutrition and education across Asia.</p><p>Collective action</p><p>Recognising that philanthropic funds are limited, particularly in Indonesia, where they make up just 0.5% of the government's budget, compared to the global average of 0.5% of global GDP, Belinda emphasises that partnerships are essential for driving more meaningful change.</p><p>One such example is the foundation's focus on investing in children's early years and addressing stunting, a significant and complex issue in Indonesia, where no single funder can tackle it alone.</p><p>One funder may contribute expertise in innovative solutions, while the Tanoto Foundation, supported by a team of 150 in Indonesia, offers on-the-ground insight and strong relationships with local stakeholders, the government and funders, says Belinda.</p><p>Investing in the early years was a \"big project\", where the foundation worked with global funders and trained front-line workers, she recalls. That resulted in a huge success, reducing Indonesia's stunting rate from 31% in 2017 to 19.8% in 2024.</p><p>Another project which Belinda is \"very excited\" about is to support better frontline workers or human development workers, who are normally women, collecting data from the ground to ensure that each child gets the help they need.</p><p>When it comes to measuring success, Belinda sees it in terms of impact at the programme level. Reducing the stunting rate is one measure, while improving student learning outcomes is another. \"For us, given that our desire is also to build the philanthropy ecosystem in Asia, a big part of how we measure success is also whether there are others that are coming with us to do it because we really want to [have] the catalytic and multiplier effect,\" she adds.</p><p>While she acknowledges that it is often easier for the foundation to work independently, the organisation opts to collaborate with partners, recognising the importance of bringing other funders, whether global, regional or local, on the journey.</p><p>Belinda also sees that the changing global landscape will require philanthropists to not only step up, but also to work in a more efficient, targeted and productive manner.</p><p>To younger philanthropists, she urges them to \"just start doing\" the work, noting that things are constantly evolving. She adds: \"The amount of tools that are available to philanthropists now with digitalisation and AI and data, it's amazing. It really opens up a new possibility.\"</p><p>It also helps that governments and other organisations are now more attuned to philanthropic work. \"I still remember in 2009, if I talked to a government official, they thought I was between CSR (corporate social responsibility). It's very confusing, but now they understand what philanthropy is,\" says Belinda. \"The openness of the government to partner it's amazing. For the next generation philanthropist, I feel like the time is now.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FT1-8BN3-RSMS-V354-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Edge Publishing PTE.

its energy needs, the government has enhanced its focus on this low-carbon source of electricity, said analysts.</p><p> They were responding to the government's plans to reorganise for \"greater emphasis\" on building nuclear capabilities, as Finance Minister Lawrence Wong stated in his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18).</p><p> \"This reorganisation reflects a proactive approach to thoroughly assess the feasibility of integrating nuclear energy, particularly small modular reactors (SMRs), into Singapore's energy landscape,\" said Lee Poh Seng, executive director of the Energy Studies Institute at the National University of Singapore.</p><p> SMRs are advanced nuclear reactors with a smaller power capacity which supposedly have better safety and economic aspects than conventional nuclear power plants.</p><p>Singapore had previously said it was looking into potentially using nuclear power, such as SMRs, in its strategy to decarbonise its energy sector. </p><p> This is part of wider plans to achieve the country's 2050 target of net-zero carbon emissions.</p><p> Wong, who is also prime minister, said on Tuesday that the city-state is still studying its potential deployment. </p><p> Given the need for new capabilities to evaluate nuclear options and assess if they can be deployed in a safe and cost-effective manner, the government will reorganise itself to provide greater emphasis on this, he added. </p><p> Victor Nian, founding co-chair of the Centre for Strategic Energy and Resources, noted: \"Singapore would need to take a whole-of-government approach in preparation towards a potential future with nuclear energy deployed in the country.\"</p><p> He added: \"The reorganisation would allow Singapore to more efficiently pool resources together to help advance our understanding of suitable nuclear power technologies.\"</p><p> Prof Lee said that this reorganisation signifies a strategic commitment to diversifying the Republic's energy portfolio.</p><p> Starved of renewable energy resources, the country announced a strategy in 2022 to develop low-carbon hydrogen as a viable energy source.</p><p> However, PM Wong acknowledged on Tuesday that there are challenges in making low-carbon hydrogen production commercially viable.</p><p> While the government said in 2010 that conventional nuclear power was not suitable for Singapore, significant advancements have been made since then, and the technology is gaining more interest globally, including from neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia.</p><p> To help fund the deployment of clean energy technology, which could include nuclear power, Budget 2025 includes a doubling of the Future Energy Fund to S$10 billion.</p><p> The fund was set up in Budget 2024 with an initial capital of S$5 billion to support infrastructure investments for Singapore's energy transition.</p><p> Prof Lee said that the new S$5 billion injection could help fund critical infrastructure for hydrogen and nuclear energy, as well as offer financial support to mitigate the high costs and uncertainties associated with emerging energy technologies.</p><p> Besides measures to reduce emissions, Budget 2025 included a S$5 billion top-up to the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund.</p><p> The fund was formed in 2020 -- also seeded with S$5 billion -- to protect Singapore against rising sea levels and enhance flood resilience.</p><p> PM Wong said that the country is looking at various solutions, from sea walls to barrages, as part of climate adaptation efforts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

And this election year, the cherry on top is special SG60 benefits. Something for everyone, in other words. </p><p> While all this may be justified, what is striking is the dearth of public discussion about how it should be paid for, both now and in the future. It is simply assumed that resources will always be readily available.</p><p> This assumption deserves a closer look, especially if we consider the needs over the medium term.</p><p> Take healthcare -- it has overtaken education to be the biggest component of social expenditure, which has almost doubled from fiscal year (FY) 2014 to FY2023. </p><p> In Budget 2024, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who is now also Prime Minister, pointed out that the Ministry of Health's annual budget had tripled within the decade, adding that \"with a rapidly ageing population, the fiscal pressures of healthcare will only grow\".</p><p> There will be other spending needs. Mr Wong projected that with the expansion of social safety nets and other measures, the Government expects to spend about $40 billion on Forward Singapore initiatives alone by 2030. There will also have to be more spending on energy transition, climate adaptation and other big-ticket items.</p><p> So, by 2030, total spending will be around 20 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with 15 per cent in 2010, which is quite a jump. </p><p> If Singapore stays within this limit -- which is a big if -- Mr Wong indicated that it should have enough resources to balance its budget, helped by the latest increase in the goods and services tax (GST). \"But the medium-term fiscal position is tight,\" he said.</p><p> There is thus a case to explore how Singapore can expand its fiscal space, and the sooner the better. </p><p> To do this, Princeton University's professor of economics Atif Mian, who was recently in Singapore as MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) Term Professor at NUS, suggested that the Republic should consider some seemingly radical options.</p><p> The balanced budget rule should not be cast in stoneThe most important is to relax its balanced budget rule, under which the Government is required to balance its budget over a single term, which typically covers five years.</p><p> Prof Mian, who is an expert on the topic of debt, agreed that this rule, which was put in place in 1991, has served Singapore well. </p><p> It has enabled the Republic to build a reputation for fiscal prudence, thereby maintaining investor confidence and ensuring a strong credit rating. It has also forced the Government to prioritise spending and find efficient ways to deliver public services.</p><p> But this self-imposed constraint also has costs. One is the \"rich country problem\" that besets well-managed economies such as Singapore and Switzerland: There is high foreign demand for their assets and currencies, which can lead to upward pressure on their exchange rates. </p><p> So far, the MAS has managed this by selling Singapore dollars and accumulating foreign currencies, which are added to reserves, as well as gold.</p><p> But Prof Mian suggests that some of the pressure on the currency could be released if Singapore allows itself to run fiscal deficits and borrowing other than for only a few large infrastructure projects. </p><p> \"If the rest of the world is ultra-keen to hold Singapore dollar paper, one way to deal with it is to increase the supply of that paper by running deficits,\" he told me in an interview. </p><p> That way, Singapore could get extra money at low cost and use it productively without having to raise taxes or cut spending. It could even increase spending more than it would otherwise be able to do. </p><p> \"It would be like a free lunch for Singapore,\" Prof Mian said.</p><p> Safeguards could be put in place -- such as a limit on debt that is issued -- to ensure that fiscal prudence is maintained. </p><p> The median debt-to-GDP ratio in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is around 72 per cent, while its more fiscally prudent members such as Estonia and Luxembourg have debt-to-GDP ratios below 30 per cent. </p><p> If Singapore had a limit on debt of just 5 per cent of GDP -- which would be conservative by any standard -- that would yield inflows of $33.7 billion, based on 2023 GDP of $673.3 billion, more than enough to cover all of its current health spending. </p><p> The additional strategic investments Singapore would be able to make if it allowed limited fiscal deficits would also stimulate economic growth, which would help at least partially offset the deficits.</p><p> The balanced budget rule was the right policy for its time. But amid an ageing population, a de-globalising world, faster technological disruption and higher climate risks, Singapore's circumstances have changed. </p><p> \"Too much of a good thing can be bad,\" said Prof Mian, adding that relaxing the balanced budget rule \"sounds radical, but actually it is not\".</p><p> Raising property taxes  on foreign buyers Another suggestion relates to property taxes. Prof Mian proposed levying a differential (higher) tax rate on foreign buyers. A lot of foreign buying is concentrated in the top tier of the property market, comprising mainly properties in the core central region worth $5 million or more. </p><p> Analysis by List Sotheby's International Realty cited by its research director Han Huan Mei in The Business Times found that, in 2018, around 63 per cent of buyers of such properties were foreigners and permanent residents (PRs). </p><p> By the first three quarters of 2024, which was after the latest increase in additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) in 2023, this had dropped to 49 per cent -- still a substantial proportion. </p><p> Foreign buyers, even if concentrated in one segment of the market, can influence property prices. </p><p> As real estate broking company PropNex has pointed out, high foreign demand for luxury properties \"can create a ripple effect across the broader real estate market, where not only luxury homes, but also mid-tier properties, may experience a price hike due to the general uptick in property values\". </p><p> The Government has tried to dampen foreign purchases of property by sharply hiking ABSD for most foreigners (excluding a few nationalities) from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. </p><p> This has been partially successful, as evidenced by the continued (albeit fewer) foreign purchases of Singapore properties. </p><p> Prof Mian reckons that some foreign buyers may calculate that they can recoup at least part of the ABSD, which is a one-off payment, through price appreciation in subsequent years. </p><p> Some prices in the high-end segment of the market have indeed risen strongly. Urban Redevelopment Authority data on transactions shows, for example, that the median price per sq ft at Kim Lin Park, a landed development in Lengkok Merak, rose by more than 61 per cent from January 2021 to July 2024; prices at Mirage Tower in Kim Seng Road rose more than 31 per cent from April 2020 to January 2025; and those at Leonie Suites in Leonie Hill were up almost 29 per cent from January 2020 to October 2024.</p><p> A more potent deterrent to foreign buyers than ABSD would be higher property taxes on foreign owners. These would also yield more revenues, because they are paid on a recurrent basis, rather than being just one-off payments.</p><p> A case can be made that Singaporeans and PRs who live in high-end or landed properties be taxed at lower rates, as many of them are retirees who bought their units long ago and, as such, differ from more recent foreign buyers.</p><p> Lower the GST threshold A third option for raising revenue is to broaden the coverage of GST without raising the rate, even though it is less than half of the 19.3 per cent average rate in the OECD. </p><p> The threshold for GST registration for businesses in Singapore is an annual taxable turnover exceeding $1 million. This is abnormally high compared with other advanced economies. </p><p> For example, the threshold is GBP90,000 (about S$152,000) in Britain, A$75,000 (about S$63,000) in Australia, and NZ$60,000 (about S$46,000) in New Zealand.</p><p> Lowering the GST threshold for Singapore businesses would expand the tax base and yield higher revenues as well as promote fairer competition between smaller and larger companies, even among small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p> It is true that a lower GST threshold will impose more administrative and compliance costs on small companies. But there are measures that can mitigate this burden.</p><p> First, the GST threshold could be lowered in phases: for example, initially to $750,000, then to $500,000 three years later and so on, which would give companies time to prepare. </p><p> Second, there could be simplified GST filing for smaller companies -- for instance, through reduced frequency of reporting. </p><p> Third, one-time tax rebates and subsidies for accounting software could be provided for companies newly required to register for GST. </p><p> The end goal should be to significantly reduce the GST threshold over time from the current level, while exempting micro enterprises. The revenue gains would be substantial, and the rewards will outweigh the efforts.</p><p> The measures discussed above will no doubt face political pushback. </p><p> While they are not particularly radical, being widely practised by other well-managed economies -- even Switzerland runs fiscal deficits, for example -- they will be resisted as they depart from long-established norms. </p><p> Nevertheless, they should be considered as a means to create the extra fiscal space that Singapore will need, given its rising pressures on expenditure and the more challenging external environment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The economy at large needs upgraded infrastructure and more funding for greening and climate adaptation, says the writer.

Good afternoon. It is indeed my pleasure to join you at the launch of the new Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health.</p><p>Climate change and health</p><p>2. The establishment of this research centre is indeed timely, given the growing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events as suggested by the three speakers earlier, and their resulting health impacts. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), climate change poses an urgent threat to the global population as it can lead to increased disease prevalence and destruction of health infrastructure that could potentially overwhelm health systems. The WHO estimates that by 2030, the direct costs of damage to our health systems as a result of climate change will reach US$2 - 4 billion per year. As climate change intensifies, its impact on environmental and human health will become increasingly severe.</p><p>3. Rising global temperatures caused by climate change have triggered a cascade of interconnected climate impacts that amplifies the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Regionally, occurrences of heat stress are becoming more severe and frequent. Record rainfall and flash floods are also happening with higher incidence in Singapore and our region during the monsoon seasons.</p><p>4. These erratic weather conditions can potentially foster the spread of vector-borne diseases, affect the management of water resources, increase the likelihood of heat stress, and worsen air pollution.</p><p>5. Heat stress, in particular, poses a growing threat to human health. Studies show that on average approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths occur each year over the past two decades. An estimated 45% of these in are Asia.</p><p>6. Air pollution is another health hazard which can be worsened by climate change. Higher temperatures contribute to forest and peatland fires, exacerbating haze and air quality issues.</p><p>7. As a highly urbanised and densely populated city-state, Singapore is exceptionally vulnerable to climate impacts on our environment and public health. For example, rising temperatures coupled with the urban heat island effect would lead to the effects of heat being more likely felt by our people here. Unlike people in larger countries, Singaporeans would not be able to seek respite from the heat in another part of the country with a different climate zone. This is precisely why our climate adaptation efforts, particularly those protecting public health, must be robust and effective.</p><p>8. Human and environmental health issues have in recent years come to the forefront of global climate discussions. In 2023, countries collectively agreed to the COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health, to reflect our common position on the importance of health within the climate discourse and the COP process. COP28 elevated the health agenda with the introduction of a Health Day, to mainstream health considerations within the global climate agenda. WHO subsequently released a COP29 Special Report on Climate and Health last year.</p><p>9. What do all these mean for Singapore? While Singapore may be small and resource-scarce, we have always turned our vulnerability into strength. Our nation-building experience has shown us how we can, with boldness, tenacity, and vision, shape our lived environment and rise above our constraints.</p><p>10. Many of you would be familiar with NEWater. Its genesis dates back to the 1970s, when the Government commissioned a study to determine the feasibility of producing reclaimed water to address our limited water sources. Through years of extensive research and innovation, we successfully developed high-grade reclaimed water that is safe for drinking. Today, it stands as a sustainable water source and forms part of our Four National Taps. From a daring dream in the 1970s to a cornerstone of our nation's water security today, our NEWater journey showcases our nation's innovation and resilience. Similarly, we can overcome today's challenges arising from climate change with the same boldness, tenacity, and vision demonstrated by our forefathers.</p><p>Importance of research and innovation in safeguarding human and environmental health</p><p>11. Research and innovation will help us achieve our net zero ambition and strengthen our resilience against climate change. We will continue to build on RIE 2025, which supports basic research and promotes innovation in the areas of climate change and human health.</p><p>12. Research will open up pathways for us to testbed and develop measures to safeguard human and environmental health. One successful example is Project Wolbachia. Vector-borne diseases such as dengue are endemic to Southeast Asia, and higher temperatures can create favourable conditions for mosquitoes to breed and viruses to multiply faster. Project Wolbachia, which was the outcome of scientific research, has helped us avoid major dengue surges in 2023 and 2024. Results from a field study indicate that residents living in Project Wolbachia sites are about 75 per cent less likely to be infected with dengue. By the end of 2026, 800,000 households or about 50% of all households in Singapore, will benefit from Project Wolbachia.</p><p>13. Another research project by NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine uses computer simulations to show how climate change will impact health risks from mosquito-borne diseases. The simulations also examine the economic impact of such diseases and the impact on productivity due to rising absenteeism. Such projects allow us to develop a better understanding of the evolving impacts of climate change on human health.</p><p>NTU's mark in sustainability science and research</p><p>14. It is indeed encouraging to see NTU's network of research entities enhance local knowledge and capability-building for climate science and environmental sustainability. This includes the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), Nanyang Environment Water and Research Institute (NEWRI), Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Science Engineering (SCELSE), and Energy Research Institute (ERI).</p><p>Launch of Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health</p><p>15. The new Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Health (CCEH) is an important addition to this network. CCEH's research will span three domains - air quality, extreme heat, and water supply and quality - with a focus on the tropics. This will build on findings from Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3) released last year, to advance our understanding of tropical climate variability and its potential impact on Singapore and the larger Southeast Asia region.</p><p>16. In bringing together the interdisciplinary expertise of existing research entities within the NTU ecosystem and a consortium of experts from global Institutes of Higher Learning, CCEH is well-positioned to further catalyse the design of evidence-based strategies and inform policy-making.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>As we launch CCEH today, we are not just opening another new research facility or adding to the litany of acronyms. We are advancing new knowledge and capabilities in environmental and public health for Singapore and the wider Southeast Asian region. These possibilities could pave the way for us to better build a more climate-resilient society, while aligning our efforts with the United Nation's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, or Agenda. So let me congratulate you on the launch of CCEH, and have a very good afternoon. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Category: Health Care Services and Facilities, Healthcare, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066122930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FK8-HWX3-RSHW-40K3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1440\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 15, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

One potential area is food cooperation, as Vietnam is a major agricultural producer while Singapore imports significantly. A stronger relationship on this front would be a win-win project, he said. The second example was the VSIPs, of which there are now 20 across Vietnam. </p><p> \"But we think there is scope to do more, upgrade the VSIPs, and then maybe even consider projects in third countries,\" said PM Wong.</p><p> Earlier in the day, at a virtual ground-breaking event for the new VSIP in Thai Binh province that was announced last year, PM Wong said that VSIPs \"set the benchmark for industrial park development in Vietnam\" from the beginning.</p><p> The next phase of VSIP development would take reference from the CSP.</p><p> First, VSIPs will be smarter, using technology to improve energy, water, waste and traffic management for greater efficiency and cost savings. One key enabler is a previously signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) on developing technology-enabled industrial parks. Second, VSIPs will be greener, with more of them powered by renewable energy.</p><p> Finally, the industrial parks will be more connected. The 20 VSIPs \"can be mutually supporting and have a synergistic effect\", with good connectivity being key to this, said PM Wong.</p><p> For example, a highway is being built to link Thai Binh province to Lach Huyen Port. VSIP Thai Binh can thus \"serve as a satellite industrial park, supporting existing large manufacturers in other surrounding VSIPs, while attracting investments in high-tech and advanced manufacturing industries\", he said.</p><p> Extending beyond VietnamIn his wrap-up interview, PM Wong noted that Singapore has industrial park projects with other countries, including China, India and Indonesia. There are learning points from each experience, he said.</p><p> A key consideration is whether the local government is able to provide a conducive environment, stability and predictability, allowing the country to attract investments -- factors which Singapore cannot control.</p><p> \"Vietnam is one country which has made tremendous efforts since the start of its reform process to open up, to attract investments, and it is continuing to do so with great determination,\" he said.</p><p> It is also the first Asean member state with which Singapore has a CSP, reflecting the \"comprehensive and strategic nature\" of the relationship, which includes strong connectivity initiatives and economic cooperation. \"If we can do this (with) more Asean countries, so much the better,\" said PM Wong. \"But each relationship will evolve at its own pace.\"</p><p> Strengthening bilateral ties will also benefit Asean as a whole, through networks of interactions and partnerships, he added. </p><p> With a \"profound change in the global order... it feels like we are entering a world where it's every country for itself\", the prime minister said. He noted that Asean countries, individually, will feel that this is a \"very difficult, inhospitable global environment\". But collectively, Asean is much stronger and can hold its own.</p><p> At a ceremony earlier on Wednesday, Singapore and Vietnam exchanged five agreements on cooperation in various areas.</p><p> These included a letter of intent for enhanced cooperation in cross-border electricity trade for the Asean Power Grid.</p><p> The countries will explore increasing the targeted capacity of low-carbon electricity imports from Vietnam to Singapore to around two gigawatts (GW) by 2035. This builds on conditional approval that Sembcorp Utilities received in October 2023 to import 1.2 GW of low-carbon electricity from Vietnam, via new subsea cables spanning around 1,000 km.</p><p> Three MOUs were signed for cooperation on digital development and innovation, cross-border QR payments, and people-to-people ties.</p><p>Singapore and Vietnam plan to promote collaboration on digital infrastructure development, as well as facilitate knowledge exchanges in digital transformation across industries, smart cities and digital government.</p><p> They also seek to enhance exchanges on interoperable digital systems, frameworks and platforms for digital trade and logistics solutions, and strengthen cooperation in artificial intelligence.</p><p> The two countries will also promote information exchange and facilitate partnerships in areas such as climate adaptation, youth engagement and development needs.</p><p> Before the ground-breaking for VSIP Thai Binh, MOUs were also signed between joint venture partners Sembcorp Development and Becamex IDC -- which execute VSIPs -- and Vietnam's local governments.</p><p> These agreements pertain to exploring initial and expansion VSIP projects in the southern Binh Duong province, as well as Haiphong city and Hai Duong and Hung Yen provinces in the north.</p><p> Industrial land at VSIP Thai Binh will be available for handover to customers in 2026, Sembcorp and Becamex also said in a joint statement.</p><p> Future collaboration on carbonBeyond the VSIPs, the leaders of both countries agreed that there is scope to pursue sustainable and resilient growth together, said PM Wong. This includes importing low-carbon energy into Singapore and carbon credit collaboration, with an implementation agreement for the latter being discussed.</p><p> \"Through these projects, we can also pave the way for wider initiatives like the Asean Power Grid, which will improve the collective energy resilience of our region,\" he said.</p><p> In addition to a meeting with Chinh on Wednesday morning, PM Wong also met National Assembly of Vietnam Chairman Tran Thanh Man, as well as called on President Luong Cuong and To Lam. He returned to Singapore in the evening.</p><p> The day's events followed a dinner hosted by Chinh on Tuesday, where the two leaders toasted to the enduring relationship between Singapore and Vietnam, and expressed expectations for deeper cooperation.</p><p> Before the trip -- the sixth of PM Wong's introductory visits to South-east Asian nations since he was sworn into office last May -- the prime ministers had met on the sidelines of the Asean Summit in Laos, as well as the Group of 20 Summit in Brazil.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PM Lawrence Wong (left) calls on Vietnam's top leader To Lam, weeks after the two met in Singapore.

And the spike that we see in (energy) growth demand is going to help build out and make that next phase happen, possibly accelerate.\"</p><p> The addition of renewable energy capacity across the globe over the last few years has not been met with similar upgrades to countries' national power grids. </p><p> Legacy grid and transmission systems were originally set up to handle the stable flow of energy from centralised fossil fuel power plants. As more renewable energy came online, problems relating to grid instability and unreliability have also emerged, given that solar and wind are intermittent sources of power. </p><p> The need to invest in power grids that can accommodate renewable power is one example of a structural shift towards a climate-adjusted future that long-term investors like GIC need to take note of.  </p><p> While markets have been seized with volatility and uncertainty with regard to sustainable investing in light of the rolling back of several climate policies in the United States under President Donald Trump, Chew said that GIC needs to maintain its focus on fundamental asset values in its long-term asset allocation strategy. \"Investors are reacting to noise and headlines... However, long-term investors cannot afford to put aside the systemic impact of climate change in favour of the noise,\" she noted. </p><p> Based on GIC's analysis on various scenarios, climate change has been found to be a drag on returns and is deflationary on asset prices. </p><p> Even though renewable energy investment has not yet proven to be reliable in generating returns for investors, Chew explained that there were several long-term structural trends that represent tailwinds for the sector. </p><p> Besides grid development, growing energy demand, advancements in energy efficiency as well as the increasing commerciality of energy storage solutions such as batteries and liquid storage fuels were other important shifts to take into account. </p><p> While the role of fossil fuels is likely to increase under the Trump administration, Chew said that it may still not be enough to meet the increase in demand for energy, which means that the build-up of renewable energy generation capacity will continue to accelerate. </p><p> \"We're living in a world of not either this energy or that energy, but more and more energy. We're living in a reality of energy addition. And so, even though there's a purported pivot in the US back to traditional energy, there will be more than sufficient demand to keep renewable energy technologies well deployed and growing throughout this period,\" she added. </p><p> Furthermore, outside of the US, policy momentum on decarbonisation remains strong in the medium term in other markets, including the European Union, China, Australia and the United Kingdom. </p><p> GIC's long-term view on how the energy transition would progress is that countries which shift towards more sustainable and affordable sources of energy will enjoy more advantages, while those that lock in on \"dirtier\" and more expensive energy supply sources will be disadvantaged. </p><p> Against the backdrop of potentially escalating tariffs between major economic powers, Chew also pointed out that this may result in closer trade ties between China -- which is the world's largest manufacturer of various clean energy technologies -- and developing countries looking to build their green energy supply chains. </p><p> Taking into account all these developments, GIC has a \"stronger conviction\" that the world is moving towards a scenario where global warming reaches between 2 and 3 deg Celsius. It noted about two years ago that this scenario was \"marginally predominant\". </p><p> This means the world would have failed to reach the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to well below 2 deg C, with an aim of 1.5 deg C. </p><p> Known as the \"too little, too late\" scenario, it is one out of four climate scenarios that the investor has come up with to analyse how potential future climate conditions might impact their investments and help them build portfolios more resilient to climate-related risks. The other three are net-zero, delayed disorderly transition and a failed transition. </p><p> With the latest scientific data showing that global warming might have already surpassed the 1.5 deg C threshold, Chew said that GIC must \"orient towards a warmer temperature outcome and look towards managing the physical risks inherent to this in investment portfolios\". This means turning its attention to the need for investment in climate solutions, climate transition and climate adaptation. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Speaking at a recent conference held by NUS' Sustainable and Green Finance Institute, GIC's Emily Chew said: \"We're living in a world of not either this energy or that energy, but more and more energy.

Additionally, China will invest in upgrading infrastructure, providing resources and conducting training to build local authorities\u2019 capacity in disaster response.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The price of climate change in China</p><p>                        These efforts aim to improve China\u2019s ability to manage climate risks and promote sustainable adaptation at the national level, while also strengthening disaster risk management and community preparedness through improved monitoring, forecasting and early warning systems.</p><p>                        China\u2019s First Vice-Premier Xuexiang Ding delivers a statement during the United Nations climate change conference (COP29), in Baku, Azerbaijan, on 12 November 2024.</p><p>                        The new plan highlights the growing recognition of the urgent threat posed by climate change, reflecting a heightened recognition of its urgent impacts. This proactive approach comes in response to the severe economic and human costs of recent climate-related disasters. In July alone, extreme weather \u2014 primarily heavy rains and floods \u2014 caused 76.85 billion RMB (US$10.1 billion) in economic losses, affecting over 26.4 million people, displacing 1.1 million and damaging thousands of homes.</p><p>                        These staggering impacts highlight China\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, with rising coastal flooding, urban waterlogging, droughts and heavy rainfall intensifying climate risks nationwide. Notably, recent extremes \u2014 including the highest national temperature on record and Beijing receiving 60% of its annual rainfall in just 83 hours \u2014 demonstrate the growing threat. The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p>                        Projections paint an even more alarming picture. By the end of the century, heatwaves could triple, and water scarcity could worsen, deepening regional disparities. Economic losses are expected to soar, with a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase potentially leading to US$112 billion in direct flooding-related losses \u2014 four times the level seen between 2006-2018. Coastal cities like Shanghai face additional risks from extreme high tides. These projections highlight the pressing need for China to prioritise climate resilience and adaptation as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe.</p><p>                        This file photo taken on 17 September 2024 shows buildings silhouetted as clouds drift past the sun in Shanghai.</p><p>                        In response to growing concerns over climate change, Beijing has recognised the urgent need for effective adaptation strategies to protect infrastructure and maintain the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s legitimacy. This approach is influenced by Mao Zedong\u2019s belief that \u201cman must conquer nature\u201d, and has led to a focus on climate resilience and infrastructure in national policies, driven by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts.</p><p>                        Managing extreme weather has long been tied to political legitimacy in China. Historically, failures in this area \u2014 particularly flooding \u2014 have been seen as signs of a loss of authority, linked to the ancient concept of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d. This practice dates back more than 4,000 years, to Yu the Great of the Xia dynasty, who is said to have tamed the Yellow River.</p><p>                        \u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness</p><p>                        Challenges lie ahead. One of the biggest concerns being the potentially high costs of climate adaptation projects. The \u201csponge city\u201d concept (\u6d77\u7ef5\u57ce\u5e02), introduced in 2015 in Chinese cities to manage stormwater through permeable surfaces and green infrastructure, exemplifies these challenges. </p><p>                        Although the central government initially allocated 400-600 million RMB per city involved in the 16-city pilot infrastructure-driven programme, total spending on sponge city projects by 2017 had surpassed US$12 billion, with Beijing covering only 15-20% of the costs. The remainder is shouldered by local governments and the private sector.\u00a0</p><p>                        ... many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. \u2014 Professor Kongjian Yu, Dean, College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University</p><p>                        Despite over 1 trillion RMB (US$140 billion) being invested by cities between 2016-2020, these projects have struggled to cope with severe flooding, highlighting concerns about their effectiveness. Notably, in 2021, \u201chistorically rare\u201d rainfall led to devastating floods in Zhengzhou, affecting over 14 million people, causing 398 deaths and 53.2 billion RMB (US$8 billion) in economic losses. </p><p>                        However, some critics have argued that the sponge city design, intended to handle one-in-30-year rainfall, proved inadequate in the face of such extremes. Media reports at the time suggested that sponge city infrastructure can handle a maximum of 200 millimetres (mm) of rain per day. </p><p>                        A view of Zhengzhou in Henan province, 12 December 2024.</p><p>                        In contrast, Zhengzhou saw rainfall in excess of 200 mm in just one hour. Others note that mismanagement by local officials, who ignored early flood warnings, exacerbated the crisis. </p><p>                        Professor Kongjian Yu, dean of the College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University, and a champion of the sponge city concept, said in a recent interview that the fact that cities are flooding shows that they are not creating enough sponge-like infrastructure. From his perspective, many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. </p><p>                        Further complicating the situation, local governments already burdened by debt may struggle to prioritise such expensive and long-term climate adaptation projects. In the face of a national economic slowdown, many localities are resorting to asset liquidation to address immediate revenue shortfalls in a process described as \u201csmashing iron pots and selling the steel\u201d. This short-term focus risks undermining long-term climate resilience, as local authorities may prioritise quick fixes over necessary investments in sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>                        Disconnect between Beijing and local governments and among regions</p><p>                        As the central government pushes forward with projects aimed at mitigating climate impacts, the widening gap between high-level planning and on-the-ground implementation becomes increasingly apparent, raising concerns about the sustainability and effectiveness of these efforts in addressing climate resilience in cities. Without a unified approach, the effectiveness of China\u2019s climate adaptation efforts will remain in question.</p><p>                        ... China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        Completed in 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was the first major bridge built over the Yangtze river.</p><p>                        The dangers of fragmented policy and poor coordination between municipalities and regional governments, particularly in flood-prone areas, must be considered too. Recent studies have highlighted this issue, using the example of China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        The consequences of this were seen notably, in the aftermath of the 2023 Beijing floods. For instance, netizens pointed out that government bodies often look after their own jurisdiction, responding in isolation rather than through coordinated regional efforts. In their haste to manage the immediate crisis, efforts to divert floodwaters upstream only worsened conditions in downstream areas.</p><p>                        ... the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        Major overhaul</p><p>                        In the face of the challenging situation, the Chinese government is likely to intensify its efforts to enhance climate resilience in the coming years. Recognising the urgent need for coordinated action, Beijing aims to strengthen local governments\u2019 capacity to address climate change by integrating adaptation strategies into urban planning and infrastructure development.\u00a0</p><p>                        This photo taken on 29 June 2024 shows an aerial view of flooded buildings after a flood peak on the Wuyang river at Qiandongnan, in China\u2019s southwest Guizhou province.</p><p>                        In line with this, the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2022\u20132035) lays out a framework for resilience, emphasising improved weather monitoring, and bolstered agricultural, water, and urban infrastructure systems.

That experience sparked emotions which I've come to understand as \"eco-anxiety\" -- a deep sense of distress at the environmental devastation we are witnessing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This eventually let me to start WorkWell Leaders, a leadership-focused charity advocating for well-being and sustainable growth in the workplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I was able to channel my anxiety into action, but many might not be so lucky. Studies show that eco-anxiety is rising, particularly among young people. Social media amplifies this distress, making it feel as if the future is already beyond repair. Those with eco-anxiety often experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and report lower overall mental well-being. The stress of knowing what is happening to our planet can breed powerlessness and even apathy.</p><p> A young woman I know had to quit her job due to eco-anxiety, coupled with the guilt of complicity in \"greenwashing\" -- conveying a false impression that a company's products are environmentally sound -- at one of the top employers in Singapore. \"I was feeling more and more depressed, and dreaded going to work every day,\" she said. </p><p> She is not alone. More than a few young working adults have reached out to me in recent times to share how conflicted and in despair they felt working for companies that simply did not care about the climate crisis. This inevitably leads to presenteeism -- physically present but mentally absent -- and quiet quitting.  </p><p> Yet, the dual crises of mental health and climate change have long been viewed as separate challenges. As we gain a deeper understanding, it becomes clear that they are intricately interconnected. Mental health, once sidelined, is now receiving the attention it deserves. Similarly, climate change is not just an environmental issue but a public health and humanitarian emergency.</p><p> As both of these crises intensify, we must approach them not as isolated issues, but as two sides of the same coin. Initiatives including the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and the Green Plan 2030 are a step in the right direction as mental well-being is being introduced in climate resilience discussions, and vice versa, but Singapore must do more in this nexus of climate change and mental health.</p><p> Integrating mental health, climate approaches We cannot build resilient societies without addressing the trauma and displacement caused by climate change, nor can we create a healthy environment without a mentally healthy population. </p><p> As such, we must deal with the two biggest crises of our time in concert, not in silos. </p><p> However, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) under the Prime Minister's Office does not include the Ministry of Health, which leads the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in 2024 to tackle mental health, now recognised as a significant health and social issue. </p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health Office (NMHO) -- to be fully established in 2025 -- is co-led by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and comprises officers from the ministries of Education and Manpower -- but notably without any representation from the environment and sustainability agencies. </p><p> What are we missing here? With mental health a national priority and climate change an existential threat, the absence of integration in these national organisations creates a critical gap. </p><p>Singapore may not have to contend with the severe psychological impact of frequent natural disasters and climate-related migration that other countries are dealing with. However, rising temperatures and its mental health impact -- such as heat stress, especially for rental flat households and essential workers -- must be urgently considered. Some studies have found that a rise in temperature is associated with aggressive behaviour and suicidality. </p><p> The rise of eco-anxiety, particularly among Singapore's youth, also highlights the urgency of this cross collaboration and representation in NCCS and NMHO. A group of young people I spoke with at a university questioned whether it would be even responsible of them to bring children into a world grappling with climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Such significant attitudinal changes could have far-reaching implications for Singapore's policies, particularly in areas such as public health, social development and economic sustainability. </p><p> It is also important to note that climate change doesn't just affect mental health -- it can also be worsened by poor mental health. When people are struggling with their mental health, they may feel overwhelmed, helpless or disconnected, making it more difficult for them to engage in proactive measures to address climate issues.</p><p> By ensuring that climate policies include mental health considerations, and vice versa, we can better support vulnerable populations and equip individuals with the resilience, motivation, and hope to confront climate challenges. </p><p> As well, the intersection of climate change and mental health presents new opportunities for research, policy and practice. This could include integrating mental health support into climate adaptation plans, extending climate finance to mental health services, and fostering community-led initiatives and creative approaches to address climate-induced stress. </p><p> How to survive and thrive'Mental health has worsened in Singapore since 2020, according to the Ministry of Health's National Population Health survey. Singaporeans have identified mental health as the biggest health problem, surpassing concerns about cancer and diabetes. Worryingly, one in three between the ages of 15 and 35 experiences severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.</p><p> Experts found that youth mental well-being depends on connections in their social and environmental contexts. It's no wonder these same experts warn that the price of climate inaction will be the mental health of young people. </p><p> We must build environments where individuals can thrive, not just survive. Healing happens in ecosystems of care -- not in isolation. Such an ecosystem ranges from workplaces that prioritise psychological safety to schools that nurture emotional intelligence, to policies that embed mental health into broader social systems.</p><p> In this way, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy was a significant step towards addressing the crisis here, moving beyond crisis intervention to a full spectrum of care: prevention, early intervention, resilience-building, and community-based well-being.</p><p> The link between community well-being and nature is especially crucial in urban settings like Singapore, where green spaces play a vital role in fostering mental health and social cohesion. Shared experiences in nature can strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of community. As climate change threatens the environment, these natural spaces are at risk. When nature is degraded, not only is the physical environment compromised, but the mental and emotional resilience of the community is also weakened. </p><p> While working towards creating thriving individuals and communities, we must also focus on ensuring a thriving planet. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for over 50 per cent of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In Singapore, we are experiencing rising sea levels, extreme heat and climate-related health risks. A deteriorating natural environment undermines efforts to foster mental and emotional resilience. So protecting our ecosystems is not just about preserving biodiversity, but safeguarding the mental health of our future generations. </p><p> Reasons for hopeI was delighted when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched in 2021 included the creation of spaces that promote mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance resilience.</p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy includes nature-based solutions, such as creating 30 therapeutic gardens across Singapore by 2030. These spaces will provide restorative environments for people with conditions like ADHD and dementia. </p><p> Furthermore, building codes now prioritise occupant well-being, with the Green Mark certification scheme and the Building Control Act playing key roles in promoting healthy, sustainable buildings.</p><p> And more recently, the Mercury Taskforce, comprising 37 public agencies led by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and National Environment Agency, announced the first National Heatwave Response Plan for Singapore. </p><p> The intersection of mental health and sustainability within environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks is increasingly critical for businesses. Investors are placing greater emphasis on companies that prioritise not only environmental sustainability but also the well-being of their employees and communities. </p><p> Healing from eco-anxietyThe way we treat our planet mirrors the way we treat ourselves. A world that exhausts its natural resources is the same world that exhausts its people. The burnout we feel individually is a reflection of the unsustainable systems we have created. If we want to heal the planet, we must also heal ourselves.</p><p> For me, healing has always come from nature. As a child, trees were my refuge from bullying. Thirty years later, amid a series of personal crises including a broken marriage, shattered career and financial ruin, I found myself hugging a tree again. And since then, I have hugged a tree every week after my regular run. </p><p> There's no single way forward, but there is hope in both individual and collective action. By building bridges between mental health professionals, environmentalists, policymakers, researchers and business and community leaders, we can create a future that is both sustainable and resilient for people and planet.</p><p> Anthea Ong is a former Nominated Member of Parliament, social entrepreneur, mental health advocate and author.

Ultimately, the fate of the glaciers is tied to our progress with global water security and climate change. Coordinated and collaborative international action that builds on a firm understanding of these interconnected issues and equally prioritises the water crisis is the only way toward glacier preservation. </p><p> Symbiotic relationship between water and climate changeTo fully understand the water crisis, we must first recognise its deep interconnection with the climate, where global temperature shifts disrupt water cycles around the world, and vice versa. Glacier melts, for instance, starkly illustrate this link. Their rapid retreat due to rising temperatures depletes critical freshwater reserves, significantly impacting communities that rely on them for agriculture and drinking water. </p><p> Excess meltwater also fuels rising sea levels, endangering coastal communities and intensifying extreme weather events like droughts and floods. </p><p> South-east Asia is expected to be particularly affected by such disasters, given that about 450 million people in the region live in low-elevation coastal zones. Rising sea levels would adversely impact Singapore, where 30 per cent of the island is less than five metres above the mean sea level. </p><p> Conversely, inefficient or poor water management practices worsen the climate crisis, especially given the increasingly energy-intensive nature of processes like the extraction, purification, and desalination of water. Without a shift toward sustainable water management that recognises the role and impact of water in shaping climate progress, we risk intensifying the very crisis we are trying to solve. </p><p> Dangers of employing a short-sighted approach to the water crisisThough the global water crisis demands a unified, collaborative response, it is still treated as a series of isolated, local issues. </p><p> Unlike carbon emissions, which impact a shared atmosphere, water crises manifest within specific regions, shaped by local geographies and climates, making them seem disconnected. This has led to a fragmented approach, where water challenges are addressed in silos rather than as part of an interconnected global system.</p><p> This narrow perspective overlooks a critical truth: the global water cycle is deeply influenced by international factors. Glacier melt in the Himalayas doesn't just affect nearby communities -- it disrupts weather patterns, water supplies, and ecosystems thousands of miles away. Similarly, unsustainable water management in one region can exacerbate climate-driven disasters elsewhere, creating a ripple effect across borders.</p><p> Viewing water crises as localised problems is not just shortsighted, but also counterproductive. It prevents the development of a unified global framework capable of driving collective action. Without such a framework, efforts to scale innovative solutions, such as circular water systems or advanced desalination technologies, remain scattered and inefficient, limiting their potential to address both water scarcity and climate-driven threats like glacier melt. Recognising water as a shared global concern is the first step toward meaningful, collective action.</p><p> Learning from climate policies to drive water actionEffective climate action has shown that no single policy -- whether regulation, subsidy, or market mechanism -- can drive systemic change alone. The most successful strategies, as highlighted by the Potsdam Institute and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, combine complementary policies to accelerate impact.</p><p> Yet, while global climate governance has advanced through global frameworks like the Paris Agreement, water policy remains largely fragmented and managed at the nation-level, lacking the same level of coordination and urgency. The water sector has an opportunity to learn from climate policy successes by fostering cross-sector collaboration, multi-level governance, and inclusive policy design. </p><p> Just as climate policies have integrated energy, transport, and industry to reduce emissions, water policies could align efforts across agriculture, urban planning, and ecosystem conservation to drive meaningful impact. Additionally, ensuring that water policies are seen as fair and equitable, particularly in regions with competing water demands, will be critical for securing public and political support. </p><p> Making the business case for waterDespite its clear economic and risk implications, the business case for water remains under-communicated. A CDP study found that financial institutions face potential water-related losses of up to US$301 billion, yet only a third of them have concrete mitigation strategies.</p><p> Stronger and more consistent communication from water experts in academic and business communities is needed to emphasise the importance of risk avoidance. Beyond risk mitigation, there needs to be compelling evidence of the social and economic value that can be unlocked through improved water management practices. </p><p> A shift in mindset is essential. Water must be recognised as a strategic asset that drives long-term resilience and profitability.</p><p> Collaboration : the key to scaling impactThe last but most vital piece of the water crisis puzzle is collaboration. Water challenges transcend borders, impacting ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide. To drive meaningful progress, we must share solutions, resources, and expertise across industries, sectors, and geographies.</p><p> C40 Cities is a strong example of how collaboration can scale impact. By providing a platform for city leaders, experts, and businesses to exchange best practices, it accelerates solutions across key areas, including water resilience, climate adaptation, and sustainable urban planning. The Water Resilience Coalition is another example, uniting global companies and CEOs to prioritise water stress and its connection to climate change to the top of global corporate agenda.</p><p> Collaboration is also effective on a national level, as illustrated by the water agreement between Singapore and Malaysia. </p><p> In return for its reliance on imported water from Malaysia, Singapore has developed cutting-edge water technologies that can improve water management practices in Johor -- a partnership that holistically addresses the region's water challenges. </p><p> The urgency of the climate and water crises cannot be overstated. </p><p> Just a mere decade following the signing of the Paris Agreement, studies are showing that we may have already broken our promise to ideally cap the global average temperature by 1.5 degrees Celsius. If we continue on this trajectory, the accelerated melting of glaciers will not just be an environmental warning but a tipping point for global water security.</p><p> The era for fragmented solutions is over. To safeguard the world's future, there is no other option but for water to take centre stage.</p><p> The writer is head of group sustainability, external relations &amp; communications and group vice president at Grundfos </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-CKH231J</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FCT-D943-RTDC-42S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1314\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
