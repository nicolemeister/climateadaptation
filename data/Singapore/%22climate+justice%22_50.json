What happens if they don't'</p><p> Mixed recordICJ opinions have a mixed record of success. </p><p> Some past decisions have been ignored and the court itself cannot punish states that fail to abide by its rulings. </p><p> Its key role is to settle disputes between countries and clarify international law as it applies to nation states. </p><p> The court's opinions carry immense moral weight and clearly set out how existing laws can and should be applied. </p><p> But it cannot enforce this.</p><p> In 2022, the ICJ ordered Russia to \"immediately suspend\" military operations in Ukraine. </p><p> In response, Russia set out its opposition to the ruling and said the court lacks jurisdiction in the case. </p><p> The war has ground on with Russia defiant against all sanctions and international condemnation.</p><p> In 2013, the court ruled that Cambodia has sovereignty over the whole territory of the Preah Vihear temple, and that Thailand is obligated to withdraw its military personnel from the area. </p><p> But that ruling has failed to end border tensions and deadly clashes between Cambodia and Thailand have flared again in July 2025. </p><p> In 2008, the court rendered a judgment that Singapore has legal title to Pedra Branca island and Malaysia has legal title to Middle Rocks. </p><p> In 2010, the ICJ helped end a dispute between Argentina and Uruguay over a long-running row over a pulp mill on the banks of their shared river.</p><p> In 2019, the court affirmed that the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, which had been occupied by Britain for more than 50 years, should be returned to Mauritius. </p><p> In 2024, Britain and Mauritius reached an agreement to cede the archipelago, except for a vital military base, to Mauritius. </p><p> Now comes the hard partSo, what will be the impact of the July 23 climate ruling'</p><p> Well, it is not going to immediately halt US President Donald Trump's \"drill, baby drill\" plans to ramp up oil and gas production, nor bring a swift end to multibillion-dollar oil and gas expansion projects around the globe. </p><p> Mr Trump, like some other world figures, has little regard for international law or the ICJ -- national laws come first. </p><p> What the ICJ has done has set a clear legal path for all countries and lays out the possible consequences of causing environmental climate harms for current and future generations. </p><p> Now comes the hard part -- putting the ruling into action. </p><p> \"The ICJ's rulings are immensely influential and serve as authoritative pronouncements of international law and states' obligations under international law,\" Ms Elizabeth Wu, a transnational governance lawyer based in Singapore, told The Straits Times.</p><p> Governments must now translate their international law obligations articulated by the ICJ into domestic rules and policies and with increased regulatory enforcement. </p><p> \"The private sector should be fully prepared for changing regulations and legal risk. Corporations must ensure that they remain relevant and competitive by getting ahead of the regulatory direction of travel,\" she added. This would include business and human rights-related risks.</p><p> All this will take time. The courts are likely to be key drivers of long-term change, with the opinion expected to boost the success of climate cases against governments and companies. </p><p> COP30A more immediate test of the advisory opinion will be November's COP30 UN climate talks in Brazil.</p><p> \"This opinion should reset the negotiating table going into COP30, making clear that the starting point for the talks is not where politicians landed last year, but where the law requires them to be,\" Ms Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy programme at the Center for International Environmental Law, told ST. </p><p> The court's 15 judges made clear that states' climate plans, called nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, must be of the highest ambition and aimed to limit warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key limit backed by scientific research. </p><p> Many nations have yet to submit their updated climate plans to the UN this year and the ICJ opinion could lead some governments to rethink, and possibly strengthen, them ahead of COP30. </p><p> \"The ICJ ruling reflects the demand for climate justice. The 1.5 deg C temperature threshold is a legal obligation, and the fossil fuel industry and particularly petrostates cannot continue to argue that staying within 1.5 deg C is optional,\" said Ms Vesga Correa.</p><p> Intense interestWhat makes this ICJ opinion a bit different is the sheer level of interest and support from nations. </p><p> The Pacific island state of Vanuatu, a nation acutely affected by climate-linked disasters, championed a student-led effort to place questions of states' climate obligations before the ICJ. </p><p> In 2023, the UN General Assembly unanimously supported a resolution for the ICJ to consider states' obligations. </p><p> The court's public hearings in late 2024 generated huge global interest. A total of 96 states -- including Singapore and the US -- and 11 international organisations presented oral arguments, along with 91 written statements and 62 follow-up comments. </p><p> The unprecedented level of participation is proof the court's opinion matters, said Ms Reisch. </p><p> \"No country voted against the UN General Assembly resolution asking the court for its opinion; even the major petrostates wanted the ICJ to clarify the law,\" she said.</p><p> Despite the interest, can countries still ignore the opinion'</p><p> \"No country is immune to climate impacts and no government is exempt from climate obligations. </p><p> \"Denying the clarity of international law no more shields polluters from responsibility than denying the reality of climate change shields the public from its harms,\" Ms Reisch. </p><p> The fossil fuel industry will face mounting public pressure. </p><p> The court's ruling will likely open up new avenues for people and communities to bring lawsuits against oil and gas companies, said Ms Vesga Correa. </p><p> Lawsuits against fossil fuel companies globally and in Asia will also become more commonplace. The number has already increased sharply in the past decade. </p><p> \"The court also confirms that individuals and groups, including future generations, can bring claims under applicable treaties and human rights instruments, even outside the framework of state responsibility. </p><p> \"This greatly expands potential avenues for climate litigation, both domestically and internationally,\" she said. </p><p> Carbon impunityBig polluters have long refused to take responsibility for the impacts of their emissions or to agree to deep emissions cuts or cough up large sums for climate finance. </p><p> The ICJ's ruling challenges the nation-first doctrine of some countries by affirming that all states have the obligation to act with due diligence to prevent significant harm to the climate system, as an obligation of customary international law, said Ms Wu. </p><p> This is regardless whether that state is a party to climate change treaties. \"This narrows the ability for states and corporates to act with impunity,\" she said. </p><p> Ms Reisch said the largest polluters may well contend that the court's opinion does not bind them. \"That's a red herring, because the obligations it lays out do,\" she said. </p><p> The court made clear that the duties to prevent and remedy climate harm are rooted in multiple sources of law.</p><p> This included well-established environmental and human rights law principles and treaties with which all countries must comply -- no matter which way the political winds blow, she added. </p><p> What next'Vanuatu says immediate next steps include tabling a UN resolution that welcomes the opinion and supports its implementation, urging rich nations to ramp up climate finance flows and using the opinion to underpin stronger regional positions. </p><p> \"For Vanuatu, the opinion is both shield and sword: a shield affirming its right to survival and a sword compelling the world's major emitters to act in line with science and justice,\" the government said in a statement after the ruling. </p><p> For the big polluters, the ICJ's ruling means they will face growing pressure on multiple fronts -- in UN climate negotiations, boardrooms, the halls of government and the courts. </p><p> \"It is high time for the age of impunity to end,\" said Ms Reisch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The July 23 climate ruling will not bring a swift end to oil and gas expansion projects around the globe.

Countries are also responsible for regulating companies and their actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Polluters could be liable for damage caused by past and current emissions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> States' legal responsibilities for carbon pollution and its impacts are not just confined to climate treaties, such as the Paris Agreement, but also under the law of the sea convention, human rights treaties, other binding instruments and general principles of international law, the ICJ said. </p><p> The opinion is likely to be a significant boost for climate litigation and could lead to stronger carbon-cutting policies by governments and strengthen flagging United Nations climate negotiations. </p><p> Fossil fuel states -- and companies -- could now be especially at risk of litigation.</p><p> \"The court left no legal shelter for business as usual,\" said Mr Vishal Prasad, director of the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, a group that was instrumental in bringing the case before the ICJ.</p><p> \"It made clear that the status quo is incompatible with states' legal obligations under international law -- a finding that will inform climate litigation and advocacy for years to come,\" he said in a statement. </p><p> The outcome is a victory for Vanuatu.</p><p> The Pacific island nation, which has been repeatedly hit by cyclones and affected by rising sea levels, championed a 2019 initiative by its law students to seek legal avenues to boost global climate action.</p><p>Vanuatu's campaign led to more than 130 nations, including Singapore, supporting a UN General Assembly resolution in 2023 for the ICJ to deliberate questions on state obligations with respect to climate change. </p><p> During hearings in late 2024, nearly 100 nations, including Singapore, gave testimony to the court. </p><p> \"(The ICJ opinion is a) very important course correction in this critically important time,\" Mr Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's minister for climate change, told reporters after the opinion was read out, adding that the opinion was far better than he had hoped for. </p><p> Associate Professor Lowell Bautista, director of the academic programme in the School of Law at Western Sydney University, said: \"In (issuing its opinion), the court elevates climate protection from a matter of political discretion to one of binding legal duty.\"</p><p> Legal experts and climate campaigners also say the decision is a milestone because it directly challenges the notion that big polluting states and fossil fuel companies cannot be held responsible for the impacts of their greenhouse gas pollution or weak climate policies. </p><p> It is the first time the ICJ has addressed states' obligations regarding climate change under existing laws. It has come as the impacts of global warming -- from extreme floods and storms, to wildfires and rising sea levels -- are worsening and affecting the poorest and most vulnerable nations the most. </p><p> Ripple effects\"The ruling by the ICJ is a watershed moment in the fight for climate justice and will likely have ripple effects in courtrooms, boardrooms, legislative halls and international negotiations around the world,\" said Ms Erika Lennon, senior attorney for the Centre for International Environmental Law.</p><p> \"The powerful advisory opinion made clear that all states have a legal duty under multiple sources of international law to protect the climate and preserve our collective future,\" she told The Straits Times. </p><p> In a unanimous opinion, the court's 15 judges emphasised that longstanding duties to prevent environmental harm, which include preventing climate damage and protecting human rights, mean that states must take action to address the drivers of climate change. </p><p> The court said failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions -- such as through fossil fuel production and consumption, as well as granting exploration licences and subsidies -- may constitute an internationally wrongful act that is attributable to that state.</p><p> This finding could be troubling for big fossil fuel producers such as Australia, one of the world's top exporters of coal and gas. And it could lead to a revision of duty-of-care protections by governments. </p><p> Earlier in July, Australia's Federal Court rejected a landmark case brought by Torres Strait Islanders who argued the government had a duty to protect them from climate change impacts.</p><p> The court found the government was not legally obligated to shield the islands from climate change, despite acknowledging the climate threat and the vulnerability of the Torres Strait communities to said threat.</p><p> But, should the islanders appeal, a superior court could revisit the government's obligations in light of the ICJ ruling, legal experts in Australia said on July 24. </p><p> \"No country is exempt from the obligations the court laid out,\" Ms Lennon noted.</p><p> National climate policiesThe ICJ judges also took aim at weak climate policies in a decision that could strengthen the hands of nations calling for stronger climate action at UN climate talks. </p><p> The judges made clear that states' climate plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, must be of the highest ambition and aimed to limit warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key limit backed by scientific research.</p><p> Under the Paris pact, nations must submit updated and more ambitious NDCs every five years. In 2025, states must submit NDCs up till 2035. So far, only about 30 states, including Singapore, out of nearly 200, have done so.</p><p> \"Given the assessments of NDCs to date, many states may, in fact, have to update their climate policies and then implement them. The court was clear -- merely having an NDC is not enough,\" said Ms Lennon. </p><p> Moral weightAnalysts say the ICJ opinion, while not legally binding, carries strong moral authority and will inform how national and international courts interpret laws, including those regarding negligence and harm caused to other states.</p><p> It also raises the very real possibility of reparations to poorer nations for climate harms. </p><p> The ICJ made clear that states have to regulate private actors -- companies -- and ensure that their activities are not causing climate damage. </p><p> \"Additionally, the court stated that a breach of these duties could trigger legal consequences, including financial compensation, for example for loss and damage, as well as non-financial reparations and cessation of harm,\" said Ms Lennon. </p><p> The court also confirmed that harm from climate impacts could be established and scientifically attributed to specific polluter states whose acts or omissions resulted in significant harm.</p><p> Climate litigationLegal cases by citizens, rights groups and others targeting companies and governments have grown strongly in recent years. </p><p> At least 226 new climate cases were filed in 2024, bringing the total number of cases filed between 1986 and 2024 to 2,967 across nearly 60 countries, according to the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.</p><p> Most of the cases are in the United States, Europe and Australia, but that is changing, with cases growing in developing nations, including much of Asia. </p><p> The ICJ's strong opinion is likely to increase litigation in international tribunals and forums, said Dr Joana Setzer, Grantham Research Institute's associate professor of climate governance and climate litigation.</p><p> \"The opinion could also shape judicial understandings of climate change, particularly in jurisdictions where international law and norms can influence domestic 'standards of care' in the context of assessing state and non-state actor responsibility to address climate change,\" she told ST.</p><p> And for Asia? </p><p> The opinion gives solid legal ground for vulnerable communities to bring claims not only against states for climate inaction but also against corporations that seek to expand fossil fuel extraction and subsidies, on human rights grounds for irreversible climate harm -- as Ms Nicole Ponce, an environmental and human rights lawyer-advocate from the Philippines with the World's Youth for Climate Justice campaign group, told ST. </p><p> Observers said that for now, governments, companies and lawyers will be closely studying the 133-page opinion for next steps.</p><p> Vanuatuan minister Regenvanu, a key figure in bringing the case before the ICJ, said one quick result could be the strengthening of national climate plans ahead of the UN's upcoming COP30 climate conference in Brazil in November.</p><p> \"We hope to see many more NDCs submitted, and even those that have already been submitted, revised and resubmitted to ensure they are at the standards required by these legal obligations,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Vanuatu's Climate Change Minister Ralph Regenvanu delivering a speech at a demonstration before the International Court of Justice gave its landmark advisory opinion at The Hague on July 23.

While non-binding, previous advisory opinions by the ICJ have led to change. </p><p> This has sparked hope among climate observers that the latest advisory opinion could refocus global attention on the urgency of tackling climate change, especially in the current geopolitical climate, which is not conducive to environmental action. </p><p> \"Amid turmoil in geopolitics and economic uncertainties, the court has reaffirmed the obligation of states to also protect the environment,\" said former Singapore climate negotiator Rueban Manokara, who is now with conservation group World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). </p><p> One example of an ICJ ruling that had a tangible impact is when the court issued an advisory opinion on the Chagos Islands in 2019. The sovereignty of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean had been disputed by Britain and Mauritius, a former British colony. </p><p> The court found that Britain's claims on the islands were wrongful, preventing Mauritius from being fully independent. </p><p> This prompted Britain to enter into negotiations with Mauritius, leading to an agreement in May 2025, when Britain signed a deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, said the Singapore front of the World's Youth for Climate Justice (WYCJ). </p><p> Associate Professor Jolene Lin, director of the NUS Asia-Pacific Centre for Environmental Law, told ST: \"The power of this opinion is that it gives a lot more legal foundation... to (argue) that states owe an obligation to cut emissions, even if they have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement.\"</p><p> What impact could the advisory opinion have  for Singapore'Singapore's contribution to global emissions is small, at about 0.11 per cent. Its historical emissions are low as it is a young country. </p><p> But given its status as a finance and petrochemical hub, Singapore could come under greater scrutiny. </p><p> With the ruling, the ICJ has made it clear that states can be held responsible for pollutive actions of companies, especially those that contribute to fossil fuel production, consumption and financing. </p><p>Singapore has emitted \"significant amounts of greenhouse gases because of our bunkering and industrial activities\", noted Prof Lin. </p><p> She added: \"There can be climate litigation emerging where corporations and financial institutions are being sued for continuing to finance fossil fuel extraction and production.\"</p><p> The WYCJ's Singapore chapter said: \"Singapore may be in breach of its obligations in international law for failing to take adequate measures against emitting companies located here.\" </p><p>Singapore's carbon tax, levied on large emitters here, is one way that the country is trying to curb the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In 2024, the tax rate rose from $5 per tonne of emissions to $25 per tonne. The rate will go up to $45 a tonne in 2026 and 2027, with a view to reaching between $50 and $80 a tonne by 2030. </p><p> But Mr Sean Tseng, an adjunct senior research fellow at the NUS Faculty of Law, noted that Singapore's carbon price could be more closely scrutinised.</p><p> Mr Tseng said: \"One key question to ask may be: What carbon prices do we need to be consistent with the emission reductions needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement'\" </p><p> The International Monetary Fund recommends a minimum carbon price of US$75 (S$97) for high-income countries. </p><p> How could the advisory opinion affect climate targets set by countries? Countries are given the discretion under the Paris Agreement to determine their own climate change targets and climate policies. </p><p> But with the ICJ ruling, countries may be forced to set more stringent targets for cutting emissions. </p><p> This is because the advisory opinion calls on nations to take more due diligence in laying out the \"highest possible ambition to realising the temperature goals under Paris\", said Mr Tseng. </p><p> \"A reappraisal of current and successive (climate targets) may well be warranted -- not only for Singapore, but for all nations,\" he added.</p><p> In assessing if a country's climate targets are ambitious, a country's level of development, circumstances and historical emissions should be considered, added Mr Manokara, who is global lead of the carbon finance and markets task force at WWF. </p><p> Under the climate pact, countries agreed to strive to limit global warming to \"well below\" 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels. They also agreed to try to limit this warming to 1.5 deg C, to avoid harsher climate impacts. </p><p> Countries must set stronger climate change targets every five years. </p><p> The latest set of climate change targets for 2035 was officially due in February. Only over 20 countries, Singapore included, have submitted them to the UN so far.  </p><p> In its climate ruling, the ICJ said the primary goal should be the 1.5 deg C target, not the 2 deg C one. </p><p> The year 2024 was the first year when global temperatures exceeded 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. While that is one year of data, global warming is forecast to breach the 1.5 deg C Paris limit by the early 2030s, said the UN climate science body. </p><p> But climate scientist Winston Chow from Singapore Management University said that if the world reaches net-zero emissions by 2050, there is still hope of limiting warming to this threshold. </p><p> \"There is still hope to get back down to a liveable world if we get our act together,\" said Professor Chow at the 2025 Bloomberg Sustainable Business Summit on July 30.</p><p> \"Coming up with a new (target) might lead to a more uncertain, confused world, and give the opportunities to people who are for delay and for denial... to muddy the waters and reduce the momentum for any sort of action.\" </p><p> Will the advisory opinion  spur more climate lawsuits  in South-east Asia? The region is highly vulnerable to climate-change impacts, from increasingly powerful typhoons to deadly heatwaves.</p><p> It is possible for countries in South-east Asia to consider bringing accountability lawsuits against developed countries, said NUS' Prof Lin. </p><p> This is because the advisory opinion clearly states that reparations and compensation can be sought, she said. </p><p> Prof Lin noted that there are several ongoing cases in South-east Asia related to air pollution and climate change. </p><p> For example, in 2022, residents of a small island off Jakarta -- at threat of being swallowed up by rising seas -- hauled Swiss cement corporation Holcim to court for its significant contribution to climate change. Holcim is one of Switzerland's largest emitters. </p><p> Pari Island, home to 1,500 people, was partially inundated 10 times in 2023 by exceptionally high tides. </p><p> The residents are demanding Holcim compensate them for climate damage suffered, finance flood-protection measures and commit to deeply cut its emissions. </p><p>NUS Law's Mr Tseng said it will be interesting to see if the landmark opinion leads to climate youth activists pursuing governments for climate inaction, as seen in South Korea and Japan. </p><p> At the same time, South-east Asia is not only a victim of climate change. While the region is not a historical emitter unlike the US, China and Europe, its emissions are rapidly rising.</p><p>WWF's Mr Manokara said: \"As the region develops further, more will be expected from South-east Asian countries to do more for the climate.\" </p><p> He added that the advisory opinion could spur countries in the region to work together on climate change, such as on the Asean power grid -- a regional initiative aiming to have countries trade renewable energy resources -- or on carbon credits. </p><p> Mr Manokara said: \"South-east Asia's forests can (also) be a powerful tool to combat climate change.\"  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Pro-climate protesters in front of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands, on July 23.

No official reason was given, but Ms Villarama's team believes political pressure from China played a role. </p><p> \"It was clear these efforts were not about artistic dialogue,\" Ms Villarama told The Straits Times. \"They were about control. The Chinese government has long used economic pressure to influence institutions into pushing a single narrative. </p><p> \"But here is the thing: We have listened to their stories. We buy their products. We have watched their films and respect their culture. I just hope they have the same courage to listen and to watch ours this time.\"</p><p> Despite the controversy, the Philippine premiere is set for July 27 at a popular shopping mall in Manila. The government's board of censors had rated the film suitable for general viewing with parental guidance since March, days before it was pulled from the local film festival. </p><p> The film made its international debut on June 30 at the Doc Edge Festival in New Zealand, where it screened to positive reviews despite a formal protest from the Chinese Consulate-General in Auckland. Screenings in Wellington and Christchurch have been scheduled for later in July. </p><p> In a letter to festival organisers before the screening, which was later posted online, the Chinese Consulate-General called the film \"rife with disinformation and false propaganda\", and urged the organisers to refrain from screening it, saying it would \"mislead\" the public and harm China-New Zealand relations.</p><p> Doc Edge rejected the request, affirming its commitment to \"independence and curatorial freedom\". Food Delivery won the Tides of Change award, which the festival grants to films that highlight global issues, such as conflict, human rights and climate justice. </p><p> The Straits Times has reached out to the Chinese government for comment. </p><p> The controversy only drew more attention to Food Delivery, which offers rarely seen civilian and military perspectives from the Spratly Islands, a region in the disputed sea claimed by the Philippines, China, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan.</p><p> Told through the lens of Filipino troops delivering supplies to remote military outposts and fishermen facing Chinese harassment at sea, the film seeks to humanise an issue often framed in technical or political terms.</p><p> \"It is about so much more than the West Philippine Sea. It is about how food, a basic human need, becomes a language for connection, resistance and care,\" said Ms Villarama. \"And in that way, it becomes something every audience can understand -- Filipino, Chinese or anyone who has ever craved meaning in the middle of chaos.\"</p><p> Despite the global attention, Food Delivery has not secured commercial distribution in the Philippines. No major cinema operator has agreed to screen it as tensions between Manila and Beijing simmer on. </p><p> In general, documentaries rarely reach mainstream cinemas in the country, where commercial chains favour blockbuster fare. Independent film-makers often rely on film festivals, university circuits or grassroots community screenings.</p><p> Ms Villarama's team has embraced this model, coordinating independent screenings with advocacy groups, schools and film collectives. The documentary will be shown again at the same Manila shopping mall in August, with more community screenings planned after that.</p><p> Associate Professor Danilo Arao, who teaches journalism at the University of the Philippines (UP), said China's efforts to block the film reflect both media suppression and diplomatic overreach.</p><p> \"It is not just an issue of media freedom, it is also an issue of overreach on the part of China because they are trying their best to deodorise their image and to control the narrative pertaining to what they claim to be control over the South China Sea, including the West Philippine Sea. So, it is deplorable that they are doing that,\" he said. </p><p> Dr Arao believes the Philippine government should be more proactive in defending artists and journalists from foreign political pressure.</p><p> Ms Villarama said that since reports of China's intervention in New Zealand, some Philippine officials have quietly reached out to her team.</p><p> \"We are not expecting uniform support from them, especially when geopolitics are involved. But I do hope this film encourages our leaders to defend freedom of expression, and to stand with the people whose lives and labour make that freedom necessary,\" she said.</p><p> Dr Aries Arugay, visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and chairman of UP's Political Science Department, called China's actions \"undue intrusion into the internal affairs of another country\".</p><p> He said Beijing increasingly uses seemingly benign sectors such as trade, art and cultural exchange as tools of influence.</p><p> \"There are no benign aspects of relationship with China because they can weaponise and use it against the country,\" Dr Arugay told ST.</p><p> He said Food Delivery might not contain direct criticism of China, but its existence contradicts Beijing's tightly managed narrative on the maritime dispute. </p><p> In April, then Senator Francis Tolentino accused the Chinese Embassy in Manila of running a \"hidden and sinister\" disinformation campaign to sway public opinion and discredit critics of Beijing's South China Sea claims. China denied the allegation and has since banned Mr Tolentino from entering the mainland and its territories.</p><p> Dr Arao and Dr Arugay said Food Delivery's visual storytelling is especially powerful in the Philippines, where television and cinema heavily shape public consciousness.</p><p> \"A documentary is potent from a Filipino cultural perspective because we are visual as a people. It will penetrate the public consciousness more, so it is threatening to them (China),\" said Dr Arugay.</p><p> The backlash from Beijing has only strengthened Ms Villarama's conviction that her film's message is more urgent than ever.</p><p> \"The attempts to block the film didn't intimidate us. They clarified our purpose,\" she said. </p><p> \"Food Delivery isn't just about delivering food. It is delivering a message: that Filipinos have had enough. Enough of being pushed aside, erased or told who we are. It is a call to remember who we are, and who we must never become\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Filipino filmmaker Baby Ruth Villarama in front of a Philippine Coast Guard ship while shooting her documentary Food Delivery: Fresh From The West Philippine Sea.

While its long-term impact will take time to evaluate, the summit brought together key actors from Southeast Asia, the Gulf and China, which together represent some of the most vibrant engines of global economic growth today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        This alignment reflects not only shared humanitarian values but also a growing confidence among global south actors to speak with a more unified stance on international affairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        In an increasingly multipolar world, the summit signalled an interest in building a pragmatic model of global south cooperation that blends political flexibility, economic complementarity and cultural dialogue. With the US struggling to articulate a consistent Middle East policy and the Western-led international order facing growing skepticism, the gathering offers a glimpse into alternative frameworks that prioritise development over ideology, mutual interest over hierarchy, and connectivity over confrontation.\u00a0</p><p>                        Political alignment and shared concerns</p><p>                        Politically, the summit illustrated the value placed on regional stability, dialogue and mutual respect, even among states with very different political systems and governance traditions. ASEAN, China and the GCC all face common pressures for policy reform, governance resilience and regional autonomy in an era of complex global challenges.\u00a0</p><p>                        People inspect the damage at the site of an Israeli strike that targeted a house in the Nuseirat camp for Palestinian refugees in the central Gaza Strip on 1 June 2025.</p><p>                        The joint statement\u2019s expression of concern over the Middle East situation shows an alignment among all three parties over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, in sharp contrast to US President Donald Trump\u2019s avoidance of the issue during his Gulf visit. This alignment reflects not only shared humanitarian values but also a growing confidence among global south actors to speak with a more unified stance on international affairs.\u00a0</p><p>                        Economic complementarity\u00a0</p><p>                        Economically, the summit leverages complementary strengths: ASEAN\u2019s resources and youthful population, China\u2019s industrial capacity and the GCC\u2019s energy wealth and capital. Chinese media and academic commentary describe the summit as laying the groundwork for a \u201ctriangular platform\u201d, a potential new growth driver amid global economic fragmentation. </p><p>                        As Premier Li Qiang noted, \u201cIf we draw a line between China, ASEAN and the GCC, we get a big triangle \u2014 and triangle is the most stable structure.\u201d This metaphor underscores Beijing\u2019s view of the trilateral framework not only as geographically coherent, but also as a structurally resilient basis for long-term cooperation.</p><p>                        As the global economy reels from trade tensions and fragmented supply chains, such partnerships may help buffer shocks. Areas such as clean energy, the digital economy and infrastructure development offer space for practical collaboration. These are areas where real progress is already visible, from Belt and Road infrastructure projects to burgeoning tech investments in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.</p><p>                        Cultural connectivity and soft power</p><p>                        Culturally, the summit highlights the importance of people-to-people exchanges, leveraging ASEAN-GCC Islamic ties and centuries of trade and religious interactions. Premier Li Qiang emphasised the value of mutual learning between civilisations, framing ASEAN, GCC and China as regions rich in historical ties and cultural diversity. These civilisational linkages can underpin new forms of soft power engagement, from tourism promotion, youth collaboration to educational exchange.\u00a0</p><p>                        From China\u2019s perspective, trilateral cooperation offers a complementary, non-exclusive and development-oriented model of multilateral collaboration for global south countries.</p><p>                        China\u2019s Premier Li Qiang attends the ASEAN-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-China Summit after the 46th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Kuala Lumpur on 27 May 2025.</p><p>                        In a tangible step to support these aspirations, China announced a one-year visa-free policy for four Gulf countries: Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain, effective from 9 June. With the UAE and Qatar already enjoying mutual visa exemption agreements, this move completes China\u2019s visa-free coverage of all GCC member states.</p><p>Malaysia\u2019s proposal for a Confucian-Islamic civilisational dialogue received support from China, signalling Beijing\u2019s interest in positioning itself as a culturally resonant actor in Muslim-majority societies. Yet the impact of such cultural diplomacy remains limited and largely symbolic at this stage.</p><p>                        China\u2019s enthusiasm and the GCC\u2019s ambivalence\u00a0</p><p>                        Nevertheless, China\u2019s high-level attention to the summit reflects its aspiration to shape a model of cooperation and development for global south countries. China has long emphasised its identity as part of the global south. The summit\u2019s narrative fits neatly into Beijing\u2019s broader diplomatic playbook, which includes the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Initiatives, and south-south institutional outreach.\u00a0</p><p>                        From China\u2019s perspective, trilateral cooperation offers a complementary, non-exclusive and development-oriented model of multilateral collaboration for global south countries. This model focuses on comparative advantages of each party, rather than ideological confrontation, and draws on China\u2019s framing of a non-zero-sum global order. China hopes the framework will attract broader participation from global south countries and contribute to a more connected south-south cooperation network.\u00a0</p><p>                        Despite these strategic alignments and aid-based initiatives, tangible outcomes of the GCC\u2019s engagement with the global south have remained limited.\u00a0</p><p>                        A view of the Abu Dhabi skyline on 14 May 2025.</p><p>                        That said, whether this narrative will be genuinely embraced by the Gulf countries remains to be seen. Unlike ASEAN, which is widely recognised as part of the global south due to its postcolonial legacy, developmental status, and active role in south-south cooperation, the GCC countries occupy a more complex position. In classifications by the United Nations, Human Development Reports and the World Bank, they are often listed as \u201chigh-income developing countries\u201d or \u201cnon-OECD high-income countries\u201d, reflecting a hybrid or peripheral global south identity.\u00a0</p><p>                        From a strategic and diplomatic standpoint, however, the GCC states frequently advocate for south-south cooperation and align themselves with developing countries on key issues such as climate justice, decolonisation, and global governance reform. </p><p>                        For instance, the UAE has positioned itself as a strategic partner of the global south through BRICS engagements and climate-related efforts, including the establishment of the \u201closs and damage\u201d fund at COP-28. Qatar has launched public health and education initiatives specifically targeting developing nations, with officials explicitly aligning these programs with \u201cthe priorities of the global south\u201d. Kuwait, too, reaffirmed its commitment to south-south cooperation in a 2022 UN statement, expressing its \u201cconstant readiness to support initiatives that improve the living conditions of the peoples of the south\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>                        Institutional gaps and structural constraints</p><p>                        Despite these strategic alignments and aid-based initiatives, tangible outcomes of the GCC\u2019s engagement with the global south have remained limited. </p><p>                        For example, the GCC-Mercosur Framework Agreement, signed in 2005 to enhance economic cooperation with Latin American countries, has achieved little substantive progress. A study analysing this agreement found that the narrow scope and lack of substantive follow-through have hindered the development of meaningful economic spaces between the GCC and other global south regions. </p><p>                        A similar pattern is evident in GCC\u2013ASEAN relations. Despite multiple ministerial meetings and joint declarations, especially since the early 2000s, no institutional frameworks comparable to ASEAN+3 or ASEAN\u2013EU have been established.\u00a0</p><p>                        China-GCC FTA talks, launched in 2004, have progressed slowly. Although 90% of the terms were reportedly settled by 2024, negotiations have been hampered by geopolitical issues and the GCC\u2019s close ties with the US.</p><p>                        An aircraft flies over the Christ The Redeemer statue at Corcovado hill, as seen from Icarai beach, in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, on 13 May 2025.</p><p>                        Within this \u201cgolden triangle\u201d of the global south, cooperation has followed distinct trajectories shaped by differing priorities and geopolitical realities. In particular, Gulf engagement has been constrained by strategic concerns. </p><p>                        Take free trade negotiations as an example: the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), established in 2010, has seen robust development, with trade reaching $911.7 billion in 2023. The ACFTA 3.0 upgrade, substantively concluded in October 2024, expands cooperation in digital economy, green energy, and supply chains, covering 90% of tariff lines at zero for core ASEAN members. </p><p>                        In contrast, China-GCC FTA talks, launched in 2004, have progressed slowly. Although 90% of the terms were reportedly settled by 2024, negotiations have been hampered by geopolitical issues and the GCC\u2019s close ties with the US. Talks were suspended in 2009 due to China\u2019s protection of its domestic petrochemical industry. Further delays were caused by disagreements over Syria and internal divisions within the GCC. Although negotiations resumed in 2016, a final deal remains elusive after 11 rounds, casting doubt on whether an agreement is truly within reach.</p><p>                        A platform in search of structure</p><p>                        Ultimately, one of the key questions following the summit is whether the trilateral framework can evolve into a more structured mechanism for cooperation. Unlike the more developed China\u2013ASEAN partnership or the China\u2013GCC strategic dialogue, this trilateral platform is still in its early stages. Without regular follow-up meetings, working groups, or investment coordination mechanisms, its full potential remains to be realised. As such, it may be best viewed as a starting point, rather than a milestone.</p><p>                        Related: A new power triangle?

The country also adopted the Asean Human Rights Declaration in 2012.</p><p> But while Singapore has helped to advance these declarations, it also has to ensure that these efforts are adequately implemented in the country, added the special rapporteur, who is from Colombia.</p><p> On climate change, Ms Puentes Riano noted that Singapore contributes just 0.1 per cent of global carbon emissions.</p><p> But the average amount of carbon dioxide emitted by each person here remains significant, she said, pointing to how Singapore ranks 20th globally in terms of emissions per capita, based on a review of 156 countries or territories.</p><p> Along with high consumption-related emissions, these present \"a significant space for improvement\", said Ms Puentes Riano, who is making her first trip as special rapporteur since her appointment in 2024.</p><p> Beyond reducing reliance on natural gas, which accounts for about 95 per cent of the country's electricity production, it is equally important for people in Singapore to reduce the demand for energy and water here, she said at a press conference held at the Park Regis by Prince Singapore hotel to mark the end of her trip. </p><p> About 10 per cent of the global population is consuming and responsible for over half of carbon emissions, she added. </p><p> \"We can't continue with these levels of consumption. Singapore has a huge opportunity, because being one of the wealthiest countries in the world... there is a lot of space to not only think about economic growth as unlimited, but also consider the planetary boundaries,\" Ms Puentes Riano said. </p><p> During her visit to Singapore from May 14 to 23,  Ms Puentes Riano met Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, as well as representatives from several environment-related ministries, government agencies, a High Court judge and some MPs. </p><p> She also had engagements with civil society and academics, and visited places such as the TuasOne Waste-to-Energy Incineration Plant, Sisters' Islands Marine Park and Jurong Island, the country's petrochemical hub. </p><p> The UN has several special rapporteurs who are independent human rights experts appointed to report and advise on a range of issues, from cultural rights to human rights in the Palestinian territories. </p><p> As the UN special rapporteur on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, Ms Puentes Riano promotes good practices in areas such as air quality, waste management and biodiversity, and identifying challenges, among other responsibilities.</p><p> On nature, she noted that Singapore has lost most of its tropical primary forest and a \"significant portion of its biodiversity, due to urban expansion and development\". </p><p> But the Government has rolled out initiatives to address the nature loss, she acknowledged. These include the designation of a marine park, the OneMillionTrees planting initiative, and other efforts to help wildlife species, including the once-extinct otters and hornbills, thrive. </p><p> However, care needs to be taken to ensure natural ecosystems are looked after even as the country continues to develop, Ms Puentes Riano said. </p><p> Citing the example of the future Long Island project, which involves reclaiming land at higher levels off East Coast and placing them in the form of islands to protect the coastline from sea-level rise, Ms Puentes Riano said: \"It is of great importance to prevent and minimise impacts of ecosystems including in the face of new and upcoming projects such as the Long Island project.</p><p> \"Impacts on the marine ecosystems need to be adequately assessed and prevented, as damage to ecosystems can be irreversible,\" she added. </p><p>Singapore can also ensure that its development does not come at the expense of nature loss elsewhere.</p><p> Reclamation projects need to be accountable for the impacts on the source countries that land materials come from, and developers should prevent and reduce reclamation's impact on the Republic and abroad, Ms Puentes Riano stressed. </p><p> She added that findings from all environmental impact assessments (EIAs) should be publicly available, and this, alongside public engagements, should be coded into law. </p><p>Singapore has guidelines about when an EIA should be done, such as if proposed developments are close to sensitive nature areas, but has no EIA law. </p><p> She added: \"One of the gaps here is that there is a lack of clarity about when EIAs are done, when (they are) published, what is published. There's no clarity about whether all the environmental assessment done is published... and what (the stages are).</p><p> \"A key aspect is to make sure... all of these assessments incorporate climate and human rights perspectives.\"</p><p> The UN expert also urged the Singapore Government to be more inclusive in engaging the public on environment matters, even as she noted that such consultations have increased over the last decade.</p><p> \"I received information that people, including youth, have been excluded from participation in certain processes due to what might be seen as diverging opinions,\" she said in a 10-page statement, without giving specific examples.</p><p> \"It is important that the Government continues its effort to increase participation to receive feedback and explain its decisions while keeping spaces for dialogue open.\"</p><p> Following her visit, Ms Puentes Riano will work on a full report with a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of her visit, including recommendations on how to improve the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment in Singapore, and this will be presented to the UN in March 2026.</p><p>Ms Puentes Riano, an environmental and climate justice lawyer based in Mexico, was invited by the Singapore Government. </p><p> This is the first visit to Singapore in a decade by a UN human rights expert. </p><p> In 2016, Ms Rosa Kornfeld-Matte -- then UN independent expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons -- visited Singapore on a similar mission, but focused on the ageing population. </p><p>Ms Puentes Riano's visit coincided with a meeting by the Asean human rights commission in Jakarta, held from May 12 to 16. </p><p> The commission agreed on the text for the landmark Asean Declaration on the Right to a Safe, Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment.</p><p> This non-binding declaration will pave the way for countries in the region to promote and fulfil environmental human rights, in a period when environmental degradation and climate change impacts are worsening. It will cover people's access to justice when environmental rights are violated, and protect green advocates. </p><p>Singapore reaffirms commitment to hearing diverse perspectivesSingapore is committed to incorporating diverse perspectives in the public engagement process, while ensuring that it remains constructive, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) on May 23, at the end of the 10-day visit by Ms Puentes Riano. </p><p> \"Ms Puentes Riano noted that spaces for engagement in Singapore have increased in the last decade,\" said the MFA spokesman. \"She noted the various mechanisms Singapore has established for citizen engagement and our commitment to balancing the range of views and concerns of stakeholders.\"</p><p> He added that Singapore thanks Ms Puentes Riano for her visit and sharing her perspectives. </p><p> \"We had open and constructive discussions with a view to deepening mutual understanding, even if there were different perspectives on some issues. We will study and consider her recommendations carefully. We look forward to reading her full report in due course,\" the spokesman said.</p><p> On climate matters, the MFA said Ms Puentes Riano recognised Singapore's raised climate ambition in its 2035 climate targets, as well as being the first South-east Asian nation to implement a carbon tax. </p><p>Singapore has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to between 45 million and 50 million tonnes by 2035, down from around 60 million tonnes in 2030, with the planned decline in emissions on a linear trajectory.</p><p> \"We reaffirmed our strong commitment to addressing climate change and shared our challenges, including our lack of alternative energy options and carbon sinks, and the need to rely on technology and international cooperation to overcome our constraints to fully decarbonise,\" said MFA. </p><p>Ms Puentes Riano and Dr Balakrishnan also discussed Singapore's approach to environmental sustainability as a small, densely populated city-state, as well as the need to balance competing needs in the country's efforts to \"build a liveable, sustainable, socially inclusive and economically vibrant country\". </p><p> \"We appreciate Ms Puentes Riano's recognition that planning is a key feature of the Singapore Government's policy approach,\" the ministry spokesman said.</p><p> MFA added that the special rapporteur took note of Singapore's long-term, science-based approach to sustainable development -- one that seeks to secure the well-being of both present and future generations, and ensure the responsible stewardship of its resources.</p><p>Ms Puentes Riano also commended Singapore's whole-of-nation approach and close inter-agency coordination as a key strength in advancing its goals, MFA said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Astrid Puentes Riano, United Nations special rapporteur on the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, speaking at a press conference on May 23.

They carried signs that urged world leaders to respect the rights of indigenous communities and consider how climate change was impacting the most marginalised of groups, from refugees to women and those facing persecution from governments back home.</p><p> Similar demonstrations were carried out simultaneously all over the world, including in Australia, the Philippines and Taiwan.</p><p> Organisers estimate that more than two million took part in the protests worldwide.</p><p> \"Climate refugees welcome,\" read some signs in Glasgow, while others toted placards that highlighted how class could impact a group's ability to deal with climate change.</p><p> Ms Pauline Lancon, 30, a protester from France who was at the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, told The Sunday Times that women in many parts of the world are negatively impacted by climate change.</p><p> \"They are the ones taking care of their families, they are the ones producing the food, so they're really at the centre of the climate crisis and should be part of the solution,\" said Ms Lancon, who is a member of the Women and Gender Constituency - a coalition of groups that ensure gender equality and women's human rights are central to climate negotiations.</p><p> The protest was organised by the Britain-based COP26 Coalition, a group that comprises faith, youth, environment and development non-government groups, trade unions, grassroots community campaigns, as well as migrant and racial justice networks.</p><p> Different communities experience climate impacts differently, with some bearing the brunt of the planetary crisis more than others. The call for climate justice is a call for climate policies to involve these communities in decision-making so that their rights are respected.</p><p> Ms Pema Doma, 27, the granddaughter of Tibetan nomads, was at the protest to call for her community to be more included in climate policy.</p><p> \"In the past several decades, over a million Tibetan nomads have been resettled from the plateau and forced to live in urbanised areas, forced to change their way of life that they've had for thousands of years,\" she said.</p><p> Tibetans have not been included in decisions of climate policy or finding solutions, Ms Doma added.</p><p> Yesterday's march marked the second consecutive day of protests, after young people and their supporters hit the streets on Friday, which had been designated as Youth Day at COP26.</p><p> Protester Alex Sidney, 18, cycled from Manchester to Glasgow to call for stronger climate action.</p><p> He told The Sunday Times: \"Leaders of this country and other countries need to make radical change to stop the climate crisis. They are simply not doing enough.

It charts a clearer path for entrepreneurs looking to solve the urgent issue of the plastic pollution crisis[1]. <br/>The need for this is clear in Southeast Asia, where the abundantly visible plastic pollution crisis has already inspired hundreds of entrepreneurs to collect, sort, and innovate plastics at every stage of the manufacturing process, from waste pickers (\u200b\u200bthe people who derive an income for picking material from waste streams) to researchers and startup founders. <br/>A clear(er) opportunity for our entrepreneurs <br/>The exciting opportunity of the Global Plastics Treaty lies in clarifying and unifying a fragmented policy landscape. <br/>By now, news about the plastics pollution crisis is no longer surprising, nor are the attempts to solve it. Where nations have lacked waste management infrastructure, informal waste pickers have collected, sorted, and managed plastic waste for decades.  <br/>In fact, they are responsible for 97 per cent of PET bottles[2] collected for recycling, a formal part of the waste management system, which means they often don't receive social and economic protections. <br/>Each nation has different goals, metrics and approaches to tackle the plastics pollution crisis. Not to mention how regional initiatives (such as the ASEAN regional action plan for combating marine debris[3]) often sit separately too.  <br/>The Global Plastics Treaty has the opportunity to create a single framework and reporting system for all stakeholders to align with. This will greatly benefit entrepreneurs, as a clearly defined problem to solve makes for a better target for innovation. <br/>Across Southeast Asia, entrepreneurial individuals are already applying themselves to the plastics pollution crisis. <br/>Also Read: Why interest in cleantech lags and how startups can overcome[4] <br/>For example, Vietnam-based ReForm Plastic currently empowers over 20 informal waste workers while operating six decentralised factories across Southeast Asia via a social franchise model with over 100 tons of non-tradable plastic waste processed in 2021. <br/>The startup currently empowers 10 informal waste workers while operating four factories across Southeast Asia, with 85 tons of plastic waste diverted in 2021. <br/>ReForm Plastic <br/>With a global treaty that clearly outlines the steps toward tackling plastic pollution, the markets for solutions to these issues become a lot clearer.  <br/>In turn, this de-risks the innovation opportunity for entrepreneurs. Starting your venture involves an element of luck but creating one that meets a clearly defined problem with legally-binding goals makes it an opportunity that is both more secure and stable to explore.  <br/>When we de-risk innovation, we open the doors wider for a more diverse range of entrepreneurs to enter the market. <br/>Enabling more sustainable livelihoods <br/>Plastic pollution disproportionately impacts the poor and the marginalised. Innovating today is not just important but urgent. <br/>Limited choices and incomes restrict households to rely on single-use plastic packaging, while underdeveloped infrastructure can leave communities drowning in plastic waste.  <br/>Yet these communities are not simply victims of plastic pollution; they had played a critical role in tackling this crisis before the treaty was even on the table. <br/>It's exciting to see that stakeholders across the plastic value chain are not just advocating for the voices of some of these unheard voices. The efforts of waste workers and the informal sector were explicitly named in the treaty, so we hope their interests and voices will be represented in the final agreement. <br/>Also Read: Why corporates and investors must climb the mountain called sustainability[5] <br/>These perspectives, and expertise, are critical to ensure solutions meet the needs of affected communities, and innovations will be built with, not enforced on, those on the frontlines. <br/>While anyone can innovate, not everyone has the resources. When entrepreneurs face fewer risks or resistance, they're more likely to start pursuing their innovation - and succeed. <br/>At The Incubation Network[6], we have the privilege of supporting an incredible number of entrepreneurs innovating for the better on a daily basis.  <br/>One fantastic example in Indonesia is Reciki Solusi which has launched a new project to improve the livelihoods of women waste workers and the impact of waste banks by establishing a buy-back centre for rigid plastic.  <br/>Women at their centre will have the opportunity to be formally employed, be enrolled in the national social security and health insurance program, and be given opportunities to upskill. <br/>A compass, not a map <br/>The foundations of the treaty have made one direction clear: the entire plastics value chain, from source to sea, needs to be revisited. If we want to reimagine the whole lifecycle of plastics, we need to take a holistic approach and come up with circular solutions. <br/>The circular economy promotes closed-loop production, think reduce, reuse, recycle. Instead of a cycle of extraction and waste, we follow a cycle of sustainable resource usage. <br/>Tackling such a visible and prominent problem like the plastics pollution crisis could help carve a path for other industries to consider a circular economy approach.  <br/>While the finer details and deliverables of the Global Plastics Treaty are being discussed, entrepreneurs have a clear remit to tackle the plastic pollution crisis. Those who move ahead of the treaty's legally binding requirements stand to gain from a first-mover advantage once it is finalised.  <br/>The details may not be clear, but the sentiment is: there are opportunities for innovators at every stage of the plastics value chain and space for new players to emerge. <br/>There is already a growing swell of energy and interest in the opportunities that a circular approach to plastics and waste could offer.  <br/>In the last two and a half years alone, The Incubation Network has worked with upwards of 200 solutions looking to do just that and will continue to build on the ecosystem's momentum to further progress. <br/>Policies can be an important innovation catalyst. The Global Plastics Treaty presents an opportunity to put an overdue target on our region's plastic pollution crisis. Bringing attention to the entrepreneurial gap is critical to inviting more stakeholders and startups into this space. <br/>- <br/>Editor's note:e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

It will translate into more pressure at an international level.\"</p><p> The next step in the judiciary process is for states and organisations to submit their comments on written statements by other countries by June 24.</p><p> After the written procedures, oral hearings will start at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands, where the court sits. Dates for the oral hearings have not been announced yet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-2G899CM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BM6-1CJ1-JCF2-8025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The festival favourite is now streaming on iwonder.com.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Here are four reasons why you should catch it.</p><p>  Anote's Ark, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in 2018, tells the story of Kiribati, made up of a remote group of atolls in the Pacific Ocean.</p><p> With a population of 122,000, this low-lying paradise is one of the first nations to face being wiped off the map as global warming causes sea levels to rise. Floods and powerful hurricanes have already caused major damage, forcing citizens to flee to the capital or countries such as New Zealand.</p><p> In the film, Rytz shadows Mr Tong on a global crusade to raise awareness of the watery fate awaiting many Pacific Islands.</p><p> Mr Tong pleads for the international community's help and hatches a plan to relocate his entire population - either to Fiji or an artificial floating island designed by a Japanese firm.</p><p> Speaking to The Straits Times over the telephone from his home in Bali, Rytz, 39, says he did not want to make a dry documentary about the science of climate change.</p><p> \"There are already so many documentaries and reports out there talking about that. What I really want is to show how people are actually experiencing it in their daily lives,\" he says.</p><p> \"So it's not just another film with scientists and talking heads and some B-roll footage of nature.\"</p><p>  The film also follows a young Kiribati mother of six, Sermary Tiare, as she fights to migrate to New Zealand, where she must take a lonely, low-paying job so she can save up to bring over her family.</p><p> Rytz hopes seeing people being forced from their homeland and having their lives upended will bring home the reality of climate change.</p><p> \"Most of us aren't facing this - we hear about it and think about it, and we might be scared or in denial. But one day, it might become a daily reality for the rest of us.\"</p><p>  Pacific Islands such as Kiribati have a far smaller carbon footprint than the world's biggest countries and polluters.</p><p> Yet, they will disproportionately bear the brunt of that pollution, a point tactfully made by Mr Tong as he travels the world speaking to world leaders and the United Nations.</p><p> \"It was important for me to move the debate from climate change to climate justice,\" says Rytz.</p><p> \"Yes, we can try to slow down emissions globally, but we've already passed a tipping point and places like Kiribati are doomed. Even now when there is much less oil being burned because of the Covid-19 crisis, it's not stopping the ice from melting.</p><p> \"So what are we going to do about this as a global community? It's a moral responsibility to address it at a human-rights level.\"</p><p>  Mr Tong, who was president of Kiribati from 2003 to 2016, is a compelling figure.</p><p> The son of a Chinese immigrant, he got his master's degree from the London School of Economics, but still lives in very modest surroundings in Kiribati. And yet he has become a major voice in climate-change diplomacy.</p><p> \"He managed to speak to world leaders such as former United States president Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Pope. He became good friends with a lot of powerful leaders and it was the most incredible personal journey,\" says Rytz.</p><p> Now 67, Mr Tong continues to fight for climate-change solutions even as the current government of Kiribati undoes many of his forward-thinking policies.</p><p> Rytz believes Mr Tong's crusade is fuelled not just by the impending erasure of his country's land and culture, but also the future of his grandchildren.</p><p> \"He has 14 grandkids he really loves and is always talking about, and he is wondering what kind of future he can build for them. That's what drives his passion and keeps him going.\"</p><p>\u00b7 Anote's Ark is available on iwonder.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Anote's Ark follows Kiribati's former president Anote Tong on his quest to fight for climate-change solutions.

Reducing net emissions to zero is necessary to stabilise global temperatures.</p><p>India is the world's fourth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the US and the EU, but its per capita emissions are much lower. It constitutes around 17 per cent of the world's population, while contributing only 5 per cent of global emissions.</p><p> The country's net-zero goal comes less than a week after Indian officials publicly rejected calls to announce such a target amid concerns of inadequate financial and technological help from developed countries for this to happen.</p><p> Given this context, Mr Siddharth Singh, an independent climate policy and energy analyst, called the announcement a \"very big and welcome piece of news\".</p><p> \"This will help India plan for the interim five years and 10 years much better because when you have a long-term target, it just helps bring together the short-term policies in place more effectively,\" he told The Straits Times.</p><p> Dr Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think-tank, described India's aims for 2070 as a bold statement that is \"equitable and consistent with climate justice\".</p><p> \"Yet, it is far more aggressive than developed countries because it is going to be a much faster transition from peaking of emissions to net zero,\" he told ST on the phone from Glasgow, where he is attending the COP26 meet.</p><p>India's emissions are expected to peak around 2045 - 25 years before its net-zero target.</p><p> In contrast, countries such as the US and Britain, as well as the EU, have had a long runway between the peak of their emissions and their net-zero goals. Emissions in the US peaked in 2005, and in the 1970s in Britain and the EU.</p><p> All three have given themselves over four decades to achieve their net-zero target by 2050.</p><p>India's commitment to a net-zero transition now has to be backed by a supportive domestic regulatory ecosystem as well as reliance on new technologies, such as those to reduce emissions and absorb atmospheric carbon.</p><p> In addition to legal backing for its stated goals so that governments in India, including future ones, are held to account, there is greater need for green financing.</p><p>India plans to increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, which is considerably more than its current total energy generation capacity of around 388GW.</p><p> A recent analysis by the International Energy Agency, which factored in a path for India to net zero by the mid-2060s, stated that clean energy investments would have to jump from about US$30 billion (S$40 billion) to US$160 billion by 2030.</p><p> Mr Singh said that the 2070 net-zero target is both a \"risk and an opportunity\" for India, with much depending on how green technologies evolve in developed countries.</p><p> If advanced economies are able to invest and demonstrate that transitions are possible, there will be spillover effects allowing developing countries such as India to catch up.</p><p> Greenpeace India said the 2070 target is \"the right direction\" but added that India should \"actively strive for an earlier date of zero emissions after reassessing the situation in the coming years\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-858697</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:640F-DG91-JCF2-83RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 3, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

Yet, a key issue that has preoccupied Singapore is energy transition. As a \"renewable-energy disadvantaged\" nation, it ultimately has to rely on imports to meet its decarbonisation goals.On this score, the past year has been productive. Singapore has unveiled plans to import wind-powered renewable energy from Vietnam and also rapidly secured deals with Cambodia and Indonesia. </p><p>These moves allow Singapore to hit, and potentially even surpass, its target of having 30 per cent of its electricity demand supplied by \"low-carbon\" imported sources by 2035. Collaboration with fellow Asean member states is the more welcome given that every bilateral renewable energy trading link is a step towards the establishment of the elusive Asean Power Grid, a power-sharing arrangement in the region. It would build off the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project, which proves the feasibility of bringing renewable energy across multiple borders.Some challenges remain but, overall, the Singapore government's mission and drive on this front are more than evident. Water and oil analogiesThe ability to hit its own domestic targets provides the platform for Singapore to look towards a bigger ambition: going beyond decarbonisation and energy security, and reconfiguring itself as a renewable energy hub.The historical analogy often drawn by commentators and policymakers for Singapore's efforts to decarbonise its energy mix has been its proud \"water story\", which is perhaps a misleading comparison. The \"water story\", in brief, is a narrative about how resource-poor Singapore managed to overcome its dependence on imported water by leveraging developing technologies and a collective determination to achieve water self-sufficiency.It might be more appropriate to think of Singapore replicating its history as an oil-trading state. While it produces no oil, it has had an essential role in global oil trade, by leveraging its strategic location at the southern tip of the Strait of Malacca and providing high-quality services in bunkering, oil pricing and associated services. Singapore's \"oil story\" is no less important than its \"water story\". Playing a middleman role in distributing and re-exporting oil and petroleum-derived products has allowed Singapore to achieve several strategic objectives all at once. First, it has ensured a steady supply of oil for domestic use. Second, by playing a key role in the circulation of global commodities, it has established the Republic's relevance in the global political economy, a deeply entrenched foreign policy aim. And third, it has laid the foundation for a significant maritime industry, which contributes to its economic growth.Singapore is seeking to replicate the strategy and recast itself as a renewable energy hub. By leveraging its strategic location and advanced infrastructure, Singapore can position itself as the distribution point to serve markets around South-east Asia and potentially beyond. This would yield major strategic benefits, as outlined above. But it would require overcoming several obstacles.Challenges to renewable energy hub aspirationsOne of the more tricky challenges is having to navigate any links between renewable energy and energy nationalism. A big part of the draw of renewable energy is its ability to produce energy self-sufficiency. Global trends and events, especially the war in Ukraine, has alerted countries to the fragility of energy supply chains. This has led to growing attention on and investments into renewable energy. As the International Renewable Energy Agency states, \"Renewable energy resources are available in one form or another in most countries, unlike fossil fuels which are concentrated in specific geographic locations. This reduces the importance of current energy choke points, such as the narrow channels on widely used sea routes that are critical to the global supply of oil.\" Unfortunately, Singapore is an exception though - unpropitious geographical circumstances mean that it cannot produce sufficient renewable energy to meet its own demand. The proliferation of energy nationalism as a result of the global move towards renewable energy may therefore prove detrimental for Singapore and complicate its hub aspirations, given that it would stunt the global circulation of energy commodities. Singapore would have no global markets to serve, and no middleman role to play.Betting on green hydrogen'Hence Singapore's strategic investment into low-carbon hydrogen. This is reflected in significant policy documents, including the Energy Market Authority's (EMA) major report on Singapore's possible pathways to net zero, as well as the National Hydrogen Strategy launched in 2022. While hydrogen is not an energy source in and of itself but instead a carrier of energy, it can be produced by renewable energy sources, and is thereby labelled green hydrogen. There are several reasons behind this push. First, hydrogen can mimic natural gas in that it can be liquified and therefore be shipped across longer distances - and thereby traded. This spells potential for a global trading market. Second, there has also been some promise in the ability of hydrogen to be able to fuel both ships and aircraft. This means that there is potential for Singapore to simultaneously decarbonise its emissions-heavy industries. Last, for Singapore, which currently has most of its electricity derived from liquefied natural gas (LNG), there are also infrastructural benefits. Singapore has made moves to be an LNG hub, and the infrastructure supporting the use of LNG can be adapted relatively seamlessly for hydrogen use.As a clean \"alternative fuel\", green hydrogen thereby can lubricate Singapore's transition to a renewable energy hub. Singapore has made strategic moves towards this end, with GIC, its sovereign wealth fund, pumping capital into companies specialising in green hydrogen.While the government is watching developments in green hydrogen closely, this is not to say that Singapore is putting all its eggs in one basket, or that green hydrogen is without sceptics. Scholars have, for example, scrutinised the buzz around green hydrogen and raised queries around technical and commercial ambiguities. There are also question marks surrounding the fact that oil majors are among the biggest cheerleaders of green hydrogen, raising issues of climate justice and inequality.The government is hedging across several sectors, and is likely working along the lines of the EMA report which mapped out several paths to net zero, depending on the geopolitical context and technological developments.The fulfilment of Singapore's renewable energy hub aspirations certainly hinges on all such factors, and the final outcome will stem from a mixture of vision, flexibility and luck. This is a space that will need to be closely monitored.The writers are researchers affiliated with the Asia Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Recasting Singapore as a renewable energy hub has many benefits, including increased relevance in the global political economy, a deeply entrenched foreign policy aim.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B34-8WN1-DYX4-0001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

First, it has ensured a steady supply of oil for domestic use. Second, by playing a key role in the circulation of global commodities, it has established the Republic's relevance in the global political economy, a deeply entrenched foreign policy aim. And third, it has laid the foundation for a significant maritime industry, which contributes to its economic growth.</p><p>Singapore is seeking to replicate the strategy and recast itself as a renewable energy hub. </p><p> By leveraging its strategic location and advanced infrastructure, Singapore can position itself as the distribution point to serve markets around South-east Asia and potentially beyond. This would yield major strategic benefits, as outlined above. But it would require overcoming several obstacles.</p><p> Challenges to aspirationsOne of the more tricky challenges is having to navigate any links between renewable energy and energy nationalism. A big part of the draw of renewable energy is its ability to produce energy self-sufficiency. Global trends and events, especially the war in Ukraine, has alerted countries to the fragility of energy supply chains. </p><p> This has led to growing attention on and investments into renewable energy. As the International Renewable Energy Agency states, \"Renewable energy resources are available in one form or another in most countries, unlike fossil fuels which are concentrated in specific geographic locations. This reduces the importance of current energy choke points, such as the narrow channels on widely used sea routes that are critical to the global supply of oil.\" </p><p> Unfortunately, Singapore is an exception though -- unpropitious geographical circumstances mean that it cannot produce sufficient renewable energy to meet its own demand. </p><p> The proliferation of energy nationalism as a result of the global move towards renewable energy may therefore prove detrimental for Singapore and complicate its hub aspirations, given that it would stunt the global circulation of energy commodities. Singapore would have no global markets to serve, and no middleman role to play.</p><p> Hence Singapore's strategic investment into low-carbon hydrogen. This is reflected in significant policy documents, including the Energy Market Authority's (EMA) major report on Singapore's possible pathways to net zero, as well as the National Hydrogen Strategy launched in 2022. </p><p> While hydrogen is not an energy source in and of itself but instead a carrier of energy, it can be produced by renewable energy sources, and is thereby labelled green hydrogen. </p><p> There are several reasons behind this push. First, hydrogen can mimic natural gas in that it can be liquified and therefore be shipped across longer distances -- and thereby traded. This spells potential for a global trading market. </p><p> Second, there has also been some promise in the ability of hydrogen to be able to fuel both ships and aircraft. This means that there is potential for Singapore to simultaneously decarbonise its emissions-heavy industries. </p><p> Last, for Singapore, which currently has most of its electricity derived from liquefied natural gas (LNG), there are also infrastructural benefits. Singapore has made moves to be an LNG hub, and the infrastructure supporting the use of LNG can be adapted relatively seamlessly for hydrogen use.</p><p> As a clean \"alternative fuel\", green hydrogen thereby can lubricate Singapore's transition to a renewable energy hub. Singapore has made strategic moves towards this end, with GIC, its sovereign wealth fund, pumping capital into companies specialising in green hydrogen.</p><p> Eggs not all in one basketWhile the government is watching developments in green hydrogen closely, this is not to say that Singapore is putting all its eggs in one basket, or that green hydrogen is without sceptics. </p><p> Scholars have, for example, scrutinised the buzz around green hydrogen and raised queries around technical and commercial ambiguities. There are also question marks surrounding the fact that oil majors are among the biggest cheerleaders of green hydrogen, raising issues of climate justice and inequality.</p><p> The government is hedging across several sectors, and is likely working along the lines of the EMA report which mapped out several paths to net zero, depending on the geopolitical context and technological developments.</p><p> The fulfilment of Singapore's renewable energy hub aspirations certainly hinges on all such factors, and the final outcome will stem from a mixture of vision, flexibility and luck. This is a space that will need to be closely monitored.</p><p> The writers are researchers affiliated with the Asia Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Recasting Singapore as a renewable energy hub has many benefits, including increased relevance in the global political economy, a deeply entrenched foreign policy aim.

The flow of oil has grown by roughly 800,000 barrels a day since early 2022, and analysts expect the industry to add 500,000 more barrels a day next year.The main driver of the production surge is a delayed response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which sent the price of oil to well over US$100 a barrel for the first time in nearly a decade. The wells that were drilled last year are now in full swing.With the surge in output, gasoline prices have fallen by close to US$2 a gallon since summer 2022 and are back to levels that prevailed in 2021. The increase in production has also provided the Biden administration with substantial leverage in its dealings with oil-exporting foes such as Russia, Venezuela and Iran while reducing its need to cajole more friendly countries such as Saudi Arabia to temper prices.But the comeback in US oil production poses big risks, too. More supply and lower prices could increase demand for fossil fuels when world leaders, who are meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, are straining to reach agreements that would accelerate the fight against climate change.Scientists generally agree that the world is far from achieving the goals necessary to avoid the catastrophic effects of global warming, which is caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.\"We're achieving energy security and reducing inflation by leveraging high-emitting, carbon-intensive oil production,\" said Amy Myers Jaffe, director of the Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab at New York University. </p><p>\"We're going to need to address that conflict.\"The United States now exports roughly 4 million barrels a day, more than any Opec member except Saudi Arabia. On balance, the United States still imports more than it exports because domestic demand exceeds supply and many American refineries can more easily refine the heavier oil produced in Canada and Latin America than the lighter crude that oozes out of the shale fields of New Mexico, North Dakota and Texas.Nearly every extra barrel of American crude produced is being exported, mostly to Europe and Asia, where supplies are tight. In addition, the natural gas that often bubbles up with oil has led to record exports of gas and helped to lower prices for that fuel and for electricity, much of which is produced at gas-fired power plants in the United States.The surge in US production has helped to end the energy crisis that gripped Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine - at least for now. European countries have replaced much of the gas they were buying from Russia with gas from the United States, Qatar and other exporters. They have also reduced their use of natural gas, a phenomenon that a mild winter last year helped.\"There is a foreign policy dividend in keeping a lid on oil prices,\" said David Goldwyn, a leading energy diplomat in the Obama administration.Not long ago, the US oil industry was in deep trouble. It had suffered repeated busts since 2015, culminating in a collapse of prices during the pandemic. Investors fled. Exxon Mobil was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average, and some European oil companies announced plans to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables more quickly.With concerns over climate change growing, Joe Biden, during his 2020 presidential campaign, promised to stop drilling on federal lands and federal waters offshore. He also pledged to accelerate the transition to renewable energy and electric cars to drastically reduce the emissions responsible for climate change.But as president, Biden has taken a much different tack. Although he has supported green energy and battery-powered cars, he has also hectored oil companies to increase production in an effort to drive down prices for consumers. He has approved a large drilling project in Alaska over the objections of environmentalists and a small number of offshore oil and gas permits.Biden has been under pressure from some Democrats to trumpet gains in oil production as a way of reaching out to voters who are leery of high gas prices. He has yet to do so - but his administration has not complained about the production, either.John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said the administration was committed to keeping energy prices low.\"The president is going to keep focusing, as he has been, on a healthy global market that's properly balanced and that can continue to bring the price of gasoline down here in the United States,\" Kirby said.The pandemic took a heavy toll on US oil production, which fell to just over 11 million barrels a day at the end of 2020 from 13 million at the end a year earlier. Dozens of oil companies went out of business, and the number of rigs in use fell to 350 in 2020, from 800, as thousands of field workers lost their jobs.Most of the new US oil production is coming from the Permian Basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico. There are also some new projects and expansions in Alaska and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.\"It's the mother of all comeback stories,\" said Robert McNally, who was a senior energy adviser under President George W. Bush. \"The last couple of years have shown that you should never bet against the US oil sector.\" NYT</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>With the surge in output, gasoline prices have fallen by close to US$2 a gallon since summer 2022 and are back to levels that prevailed in 2021.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69SC-GFS1-DYX4-0006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The Alliance of Small Island States was set to propose a loss and damage response fund after the failure to establish a similar facility at COP26 in Glasgow. </p><p>Germany's proposal for an insurance fund like Global Shield to allow a rapid financial response to climate impacts has been dismissed by climate campaigners as not extensive enough.</p><p> There appears to be good reason for developing nations to force this issue -- developed nations' pledge to provide a baseline of US$100 billion of climate finance annually by 2020 to assist decarbonisation efforts has still not been met, with the funding gap caused by richer nations' failure to act expected to be closed only next year or in 2024.</p><p> What a just transition means for investorsFor the conference to be a success, it is key that COP27 delivers meaningful progress on loss and damage. As climate disasters such as Pakistan's catastrophic flooding wreak havoc, we believe developing nations are right to demand reparations and climate justice.</p><p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) this year highlighted the importance of accelerating progress towards a just transition, stating that sustainable development is concurrently able to enhance social inclusion.</p><p> The private sector can play a large role in financing a just transition and climate adaptation in communities that need it. </p><p> For investors, this means, among other actions, ensuring social factors are integrated into capital allocation and stewardship activities or investing in social bonds.</p><p> What else is on the COP agenda'Progress also needs to be made on climate change adaptation and resilience, given the fact that 3.3 billion people already live in climatically vulnerable areas, according to IPCC estimates. </p><p> Even if we manage to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, we are still likely to see risks to human health, livelihoods, water supplies, and food security.</p><p> Mitigation as ever would have played its part in the discussions, and again we believe there is work to do here. Nations agreed at COP26 to bolster their climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), before COP27 as analyses in Glasgow (and more detailed calculations since) indicated that more needs to be done collectively to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 deg C.</p><p> A recently published NDC synthesis report from the United Nations shows that only 24 countries have updated their pledges since COP26, leaving many opportunities for improvement in Egypt. </p><p> After NDC enhancement, we believe it's important that the conversation moves on to actual implementation. </p><p> Indeed, India, which raised the issue of climate finance at COP27, has said its updated NDC is conditional on technology and finance transfer from developed nations.</p><p> Enabling a just transition to net zero can be seen as essential if we are to optimally address climate change, since allowing inequities to persist will likely impede climate action. </p><p> Moreover, even if we were able to resolve climate change while allowing inequities to persevere, we would just be trading an environmental catastrophe for a social one.</p><p> We believe just transition principles will be key for developing nations to be able to implement the pledges made in their NDCs. If fossil fuels are to be leapfrogged in favour of low-carbon alternatives, developed nations need to provide adequate support. </p><p> Here, as with loss and damage, there is much for the Global North and private sector investors to do.</p><p> The writer is global head of sustainability research, BNP Paribas Asset Management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As climate disasters such as Pakistan's catastrophic flooding wreak havoc, developing nations are right to demand reparations and climate justice.

Roughly two-thirds were filed since 2015, the year the Paris Climate Agreement was adopted. </p><p> Ms Wu, who is also a visiting researcher with the Asia-Pacific Centre for Environmental Law at the National University of Singapore, expected the growth trend for cases to continue.</p><p> \"That's because climate impacts are intensifying and the green transition is becoming very urgent. And, more importantly, there's a growing awareness among regulators, corporates and consumers and the younger population about the importance of climate change and the impact of environmental damage,\" she added.</p><p> She said the disproportionate effects of climate change and environmental degradation on women, minorities and disadvantaged communities are also increasing globally, and often it falls to the courts to ensure legal redress. </p><p> A June 2023 report by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy shows challenges to the climate policy response of governments and firms have grown significantly outside the United States, which has the majority of climate litigation cases. </p><p> In the US, about 20 cases filed by cities and states against the carbon majors, such as leading fossil fuel companies, are now likely to go to trial, the report said. </p><p> Litigation around investment decisions is also rising and can help clarify how decisions should be made in the context of climate change, while high carbon-emitting activities are now more likely to be challenged at different points in their life cycle, from initial financing to final project approval, the report added. </p><p> There have been more cases over \"climate-washing\", which challenges the accuracy of green claims and commitments, the report said.</p><p> Cases will also need to consider how to incorporate the latest climate science.</p><p> \"Given that the judiciary will play an increasingly important role in climate-related justice issues, it is essential that members of the judiciary understand the scientific basis on what we know about human-caused climate change,\" said Associate Professor Winston Chow from Singapore Management University, who spoke at the course. </p><p> \"A better-informed and well-educated judiciary about the basis of climate science and climate change would be more confident in assessing cases related to climate justice, such as those in which local communities affected by climate-driven impacts seek recourse from the judiciary. </p><p> \"If vulnerable communities understand that judiciaries know the basis of climate science and understand their rights, I'm quite certain it also gives these communities stronger support towards actions limiting the worst excesses of climate change,\" said Prof Chow, who was recently elected as a co-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations' top climate science body. </p><p> Justice Bambang Hery Mulyono, chief of the Supreme Court of Indonesia's Judicial Research and Education Agency, and a speaker at the course, said judges have a critical role in protecting and preserving the environment. </p><p> \"My hope is that by having judges with environmental certification, we can create environmental justice in the midst of the planetary crisis,\" referring to climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. </p><p> Ms Wu said challenges remain. These include weak national climate and environmental laws that need to be strengthened. </p><p> Another problem is that some areas of law are not fully aligned with environmental law, such as corporate and investment law. </p><p> For instance, corporate law tends to focus on the short-term interests of shareholders, rather than considering a broader spectrum of stakeholders and the medium- and long-term climate, human rights and environmental impacts of companies' decisions. </p><p> Justice Suntariya Muanpawong of Thailand, who was also a speaker at the course, said: \"When the executive and the legislature play an inactive role, the courts should do more. Climate litigation in many countries make real changes: The courts, especially the administrative and constitutional courts, can force the other actors to increase more protections.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associate Professor Winston Chow from Singapore Management University addressed participants at the course on climate science.

But after receiving rousing applause from more than 1,400 attendees after her speech at the SG Climate Rally this year, she understood how her voice can be \"strong\" and be used to deliver a \"powerful message\". Addressing the crowd, Ms Marlina said: \"As the climate crisis worsens, we must not give up. We must understand that we, the people, also have the power to make change.\" Ms Marlina was speaking at the first SG Climate Rally held at Hong Lim Park since the Covid-19 pandemic on Saturday (Sept 23) evening. </p><p>The other speakers were Former Nominated Member of Parliament (MP) Dr Geh Min, sustainability strategist and researcher Madhu Ardhanari, co-founder of LepakInSG Ho Xiang Tian and Nor Syazwan Abdul Majid, who founded Wan's Ubin Journal. Speakers at the rally, in line with the theme of inclusiveness, talked about the pervasiveness of climate change and how the impact of the climate crisis is distributed unequally with lower-income residents disproportionately bearing the negative impacts of climate change. For Ms Marlina, it is clear how climate change affects her daily life - the heat in her flat has become increasingly unbearable and air-conditioning units, even portable ones, are considered a luxury for her family. The community worker said that the heat adds not only to her stress at work but poses financial stresses as higher temperatures lead to increased water consumption, risk of skin problems and doctor's visits. Mr Syazwan, who runs the social platform Wan's Ubin Journal, spoke about emphasising the importance of including indigenous voices and history in policy planning and education of climate change. Drawing on his experience of learning his heritage as a descendant of the Ubin Orang Pulau from his mother, Mr Syazwan said: \"The Orang Pulau were champions of sustainability. They understood what nature provided for them and the symbiotic relationship between humans and nature.\" Rally organiser Kristian-Marc James Paul said that advocating for climate justice means being aware that climate change and the ways we tackle this issue is \"fundamentally related\" to other bread-and-butter issues. Besides speeches, environmental groups such as Students for a Fossil Free Future and the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM.Haze), as well as civil society groups, such as Migrant Mutual Aid and Workers Make Possible, set up community booths to raise awareness about their causes. One activity available at the booths allowed participants to write postcards to MPs about the various concerns and suggestions that they had about climate change. By the end of the rally, about 300 postcards had been submitted. Mr Ho from LepakInSg, an environmental group, said that systemic change cannot be done alone and that the work of raising awareness included tedious tasks like reading reports and writing feedback. While individuals might feel jaded and powerless alone, Mr Ho said that the rally was a good reminder that while individuals \"cannot make a difference alone\", in a community, they could. Ms Nur Hazeerah Mohamed Basri, 29, a freelance fashion designer, agreed that being able to attend the rally in-person was heartening because she met other people who felt strongly about the environment and now feels less alone. \"Even if they might think about things in a different way, they still have the same end goal, and I think it's really cool to build community as we go through this together,\" said Ms Nur who uses sustainable materials and practices in her craft since learning about waste in the fashion industry. Spotted in the crowd was People's Action Party's Member of Parliament (MP) Wan Rizal, who said that he looked forward to receiving postcards from his Jalan Besar residents as they would \"know the environment best\". He added he had also penned a postcard to his own MP about protecting the green spaces in his Pasir Ris neighbourhood. Opposition MPs from the Workers' Party He Ting Ru, Dennis Tan, Louis Chua, Gerald Giam and Jamus Lim were also in attendance as well as Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency MP Leong Mun Wai and Red Dot United's secretary-general Ravi Philemon. WHY DON'T S'POREANS SEE CLIMATE CHANGE AS AN URGENT MATTER? The Southeast Asia Climate Outlook Survey Report 2023, which was published on Thursday by the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, showed that climate advocacy in Singapore is lower than other countries in the region. Only 43.7 per cent of Singaporeans polled believe that climate change \"is a serious and immediate threat to the well-being of the country\", a significant drop from 66.4 per cent in 2021, but a slight increase from 40.5 per cent in 2022. The survey showed that fewer Singaporeans took steps to sign climate change related petitions (17.6 per cent) and attend protests (3.2 per cent) compared to Asean's average of 18.2 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively. When asked about why Singaporeans seem to view climate change as much less of an urgent issue as compared to our neighbours, Mr Paul said discussing climate change may not be a \"muscle\" that Singaporeans commonly use, but that the rally hopes to be a space to start conversations about climate change and how it affects society in uneven ways. Hoping that climate awareness would become less of a \"niche\" issue, Ms Ardhanari said that while a small group of Singaporeans may have a \"high level of awareness\", overall climate awareness in Singapore has not caught up to the scale and nature of impact of climate change. She added that Singaporeans could no longer afford to remain in \"echo chambers\" around climate change. \"This is something that affects all of us, but it seems like the people who want to talk about it is a very small group of people, and are often disconnected with the people who are facing the most of who are most vulnerable to impact.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-2264236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:697K-2821-DXPH-P000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1000\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 23, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>climate change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Singapore Climate Rally</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

Not unexpectedly, these island countries now find themselves beneficiaries of the competition for geopolitical influence even as they try to avoid being drawn into it.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Anne-Marie Schleich</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pacific Island countries share similar challenges: effects of climate change, economic vulnerability, resource scarcity, lack of skills training and underdeveloped infrastructures. Their regional governing body, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), has become a strong advocate for climate change action \u2014 sometimes against resistance from its PIF member country, Australia. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the US-China competition for geopolitical influence, the PIF had already rejected in 2019 the idea that Pacific countries had to choose between the two big powers. \"Friends to all, enemy to none\" is their popular slogan. The present Forum chair, Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown, recently emphasised: \"The Pacific is not a region of competition, but is a region of collaboration.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">United against climate change </p><p>At its 52nd PIF Leaders Meeting in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, two weeks ago, PIF garnered support from among the 21 dialogue partner countries for its four-year-old 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. And 120 countries co-sponsored a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) landmark resolution introduced by Vanuatu in March this year for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on climate change-related obligations. </p><p>Two UN groups, the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) together with the Small Island Developing Countries (SIDS), have become lobby champions against climate change. The present chair of AOSIS, Samoa's Prime Minister Fiame Mata'afa, has rallied UN member states for the upcoming COP-28 in Dubai to press for more progress on \"loss and damage finance\". </p><p>PIF countries have also demanded simplified access to climate financing, more investments in disaster risk reduction and early warning systems, and raised concerns about insufficient grants, inadequate funding for adaptation, and a lack of locally-led climate action initiatives.  </p><p>Infrastructure financing, until recently the niche for China and Japan, has become the flavour of the day.  </p><p>Pacific Island countries are leaders in the global fight against climate change. They have been pushing the global agenda on the ocean and climate change connection, and on climate justice. </p><p>Spiralling debt problem </p><p>According to the Lowy Aid Map, aid to the Pacific was up 47% during the Covid-19 crisis. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had tripled its aid and became the biggest and Australia the second biggest development partner. But nowadays, almost half of the aid are concessional loans, not grants. Infrastructure financing, until recently the niche for China and Japan, has become the flavour of the day. </p><p>In 2021, the ADB provided 34% of all infrastructure loans, Australia 18%, China 15%, Japan 12%, World Bank 6% and the EU 4%. Pacific countries are now in a position to be choosy about their partners for much-needed infrastructure investments. </p><p>Unfortunately, this will also increase already precarious debt levels. According to a 2021 IMF report, six Pacific countries were at high risk of debt distress after the economic downturn during the Covid-19 pandemic. The three major creditors are the ADB, China and the World Bank. </p><p>China's strategic goals in the region </p><p>The Pacific Island region has long been important to China's geostrategic interests. China has pursued various goals in its engagement with the Pacific: seeking naval access to the region, achieving diplomatic victories against Taiwan, securing fishing and seabed mining rights in the vast economic zones of the Pacific States, and protecting its Chinese diaspora.  </p><p>China's development assistance to the Pacific peaked in 2016 (US$287 million). In 2020, it was US$187 million, the lowest since 2008. This downward trend continued in 2021.  </p><p>China has become the largest trading partner for most Pacific Island countries. It has invested in ten Pacific countries within the framework of its Belt and Road Initiative and built numerous large infrastructure projects which it financed by loans. These were projects which other countries or donor institutions were not able or not willing to finance. </p><p>China has also provided generous scholarship programmes and training facilities to a number of countries in the region and established six Confucius Institutes. Numerous high-level diplomatic visits, among them two visits by Chinese President Xi Jinping, have highlighted China's interest in the region as early as 2012. </p><p>Development financing and security agreements remain key diplomatic tools for China. According to last year's Lowy Institute Pacific aid analysis, China's development assistance to the Pacific peaked in 2016 (US$287 million). In 2020, it was US$187 million, the lowest since 2008. This downward trend continued in 2021. One of the reasons for this lies in the slowdown of the Chinese economy. </p><p>China's infrastructure financing now focuses mainly on two countries: Kiribati and the Solomons Islands. In 2019, these countries switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China. China subsequently financed three major projects in the Solomon Islands: a Huawei telecommunications project, the upgrade of its major port and a sports stadium for the ongoing Pacific Games, a pet project of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. </p><p>Recent US steps in the Pacific </p><p>In 2022, the Biden administration of the US kickstarted its rather dormant engagement with Pacific Island countries with a number of high-ranking political and military visits, among them that of Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the first visit of a US secretary of state in 40 years, and Vice-President Kamala Harris, who attended the PIF Leaders Meeting in July last year. President Joe Biden twice hosted PIF heads of government at a US-Pacific summit at the White House in November 2022 and in September this year. The US also announced the US-Pacific Partnership Strategy, a roadmap to strengthen cooperation with the Pacific. </p><p>After having reduced its aid to the Pacific in the years before, President Biden last year announced a US$810 million aid package, spread over 10 years, of which US$130 million was designated for climate change projects. The US government also pledged support in the control of illegal fishing, with the US Coast Guard assisting to strengthen local capabilities, especially in Papua New Guinea (PNG).  </p><p>Fiji has become a focal point of the US's Pacific Islands strategy.  </p><p>The US has had longstanding relations with its strategically important Compacts of Free Association (COFA) allies, Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia, which received the lion's share of US aid and investments in the Pacific. It recently signed an unprecedented package of US$7 billion over 20 years with the three countries, almost double the amount of the previous Compact package. The US hopes that they will remain US partners despite Chinese efforts to pull them into its orbit. </p><p>The US also increased its diplomatic presence in Pacific countries by reopening its embassy in the Solomon Islands after 30 years of absence, established diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands and Niue, and opened a USAID office in Fiji and embassies in Tonga, Kiribati and Vanuatu. </p><p>Fiji has become a focal point of the US's Pacific Islands strategy. Both countries strengthened security ties with a landmark Defence and Security Agreement in 2020. The US also pledged help in controlling illegal fishing. The US and Fiji have also concluded a Trade and Investment Treaty (TIFA). Fiji as the only Pacific Islands country also joined the 14-member US economic initiative Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). </p><p>In tandem with the US, Australia and New Zealand have also intensified their longstanding relations with the Pacific, especially with Fiji, Vanuatu and PNG. Australia increased its aid to the Pacific, slightly improved its previously unambitious climate policy and pledged to work with Pacific Island countries on a more equal footing. However, Australia's recent and much-touted security agreement with Tuvalu, which also gives Australia veto power in Tuvalu's foreign and security affairs, seems to be an ominous sign for equal partnership cooperation with the Pacific.  </p><p>Lack of trade agreements and access to the US market compares unfavourably to China which has become the leading trading partner for most Pacific countries.  </p><p>Potential pitfalls </p><p>There could be potential pitfalls for the US re-engagement. US trade with the Pacific (except with the Compact states) remains minimal. Lack of trade agreements and access to the US market compares unfavourably to China which has become the leading trading partner for most Pacific countries. </p><p>The US as well as China are competing with many other players who have been active for a long time such as Australia, New Zealand, the Asian Development Bank, Japan, and the EU. Pacific countries have more choices as to their development partners. </p><p>Pacific countries fear being drawn into a potential regional conflict between the US and China. Memories of American and French nuclear tests in the Pacific and insufficient compensation for nuclear damage explain some negative reactions to the AUKUS partnership. There is concern about nuclear-propelled submarines in the South Pacific. Without careful consultations, this complex issue could create divisions between Pacific Island nations and AUKUS member countries. </p><p>The US and Australia need to check their domestic and international climate policies. Granting of drilling rights for US gas and oil explorations and approvals for Australian new coal projects as well as non-support of UN resolutions do not go down well with Pacific countries. </p><p>The US re-engagement with Pacific Island countries will not be judged by high-ranking visits or new embassies but by its willingness to address the Pacific Islands' major concern, i.e., climate crisis, to contribute towards sustainable development and to increase trade with the region. China will focus its diplomacy on a few selected countries, further increase its trade with the whole region and use some soft power. The geopolitical tug of war in its courtyard is an opportunity for Pacific Island nations. They will pragmatically pick the best development offers. Competition for influence in Oceania will increase. </p><p>This article was first published as aRSIS Commentaryon 27 November 2023. </p><p>Related:Fiji an important regional power broker as great power politics intensifies in the Pacific|China gearing up for intense competition in the Pacific|The South Pacific Ocean: Another battleground for China-US competition?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-TC3352</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69TJ-T9S1-DXX5-V002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Saudi Arabia and other large oil producers accepted the text because it is sufficiently vague, and \"calls on\" bears a relatively weaker modality equivalent to an \"invitation\" or \"request\".</p><p>\"Over the last two weeks, we have worked very hard to secure a better future for our people and planet,\" says Al-Jaber after confirming the GST text.</p><p>\"We should be proud of our historic achievement, and the United Arab Emirates, my country, is rightly proud of its role in helping you to move this forward.\"</p><p>He adds: \"Let me sound a word of caution: An agreement is only as good as its implementation. We are what we do, not what we say. We must take the steps necessary to turn this agreement into tangible actions.\"</p><p>Saudi Arabia's support of the GST text may have prevented a deadlock. Just hours before the final plenary, Bloomberg reported that the kingdom, which had rejected the idea of phasing down or phasing out fossil fuels, had no objection with the text that calls for a transition instead.</p><p>Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman was personally involved in negotiations and was seen walking into the presidency's office late into the evening of Dec 12 in Dubai's Expo Centre.</p><p>Samoa protests</p><p>The seamless acceptance of the final text caught many experts by surprise, as the anticipated opposition may have come too late. Following the presentation of the GST text, Samoa lead negotiator Anne Rasmussen quickly requested the floor, explaining that her delegation had been consulting fellow members of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis) and arrived late to the plenary.</p><p>\"We didn't want to interrupt the standing ovation, but we are confused,\" says Rasmussen. \"It seems you just gavelled the decision, and the small island states were not in the room.\"</p><p>\"We were working hard to coordinate the 39 small island developing states that are disproportionately affected by climate change, and so we were delayed in arriving here. So allow me, Mr President, to deliver the statement that we were going to deliver before this text was adopted,\" she adds.</p><p>While she commends the \"strong references to science\", Rasmussen says some paragraphs in the final text remain weak. \"We do not see any commitment or even an invitation from parties to peak emissions by 2025. We reference the science throughout the text and even in this paragraph, but then we refrain from agreeing to take the relevant action to act in line with what the science says we have to do.\"</p><p>Rasmussen adds: \"It is not enough for us to reference the science and make agreements that ignore what the science tells us we need to do. This is not an approach that we should be asked to defend.\"</p><p>She highlights Paragraph 11, which \"recognises the specific needs and special circumstances of developing country parties, especially those particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\".</p><p>\"We have repeatedly requested that this be moved to the preamble to align with the Paris Agreement. We do not want to renegotiate the Paris Agreement. This reasonable request has been ignored. We do not consider Para[graph] 11 to have any effect on the obligations and benefits contained in the Paris Agreement and convention on the special circumstances of the seats and [least developed countries].\"</p><p>Speaking after Rasmussen, US climate envoy John Kerry highlights the standing ovation given to Samoa, which lasted longer than the one for Al-Jaber after the GST's conclusion. \"The applause that we just saw for Aosis is a clarion call to all of us about our obligation and responsibility over these next months to ensure we're reaching as far as we can to implement as fast as we can.\"</p><p>Kerry, the former US secretary of state under President Barack Obama, commends the work of negotiators. \"While all of us can find a paragraph, sentences or sections where we would have said it differently, where we would have liked it not to appear, we would have liked something else to appear; but in a multilateral venue, to have as strong a document as has been put together, I find is cause for optimism, cause for gratitude and cause for some significant congratulations to everybody here.\"</p><p>Tom Evans, policy adviser at global climate change think-tank E3G, says \"not everyone is ready to admit the truth of what's needed to avert climate disaster\".</p><p>He adds: \"Champions for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels - both small island states and major economies - have pushed the rest of the world to realise this transition cannot be stopped. But this is only a small first step   The COP text shows the hard work that lies ahead: rewiring the financial system, driving action to vastly scale up renewables and energy efficiency and crucially paying much more attention to adaptation, which has been neglected, putting all of us at risk.\"</p><p>Teresa Anderson, global lead on climate justice at international non-governmental organisation ActionAid, says COP28 shows that \"while the world's appetite for climate action has moved significantly forward, its willingness to pay lags behind\".</p><p>\"The goal to move to a fossil-free future does not yet have the finance components needed to make this goal workable for lower-income countries,\" says Anderson in a Dec 13 post on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter. \"If rich countries had been willing to put real finance and fair timelines on the table, the outcome could have been much stronger.\"</p><p>COP28's many pains</p><p>This year's summit faced mounting challenges, chief among them scepticism about whether summit president Al-Jaber would broker the talks fairly. Al-Jaber's role as the head of the state oil company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company was already cause for concern, but he faced further controversy days before the summit began. Leaked briefing documents revealed the UAE had discussed fossil fuel deals with 15 nations.</p><p>The documents - obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working with the BBC - were prepared by the UAE's COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments before the summit. In a Nov 26 report, the UAE team did not deny using COP28 meetings for business talks, maintaining that \"private meetings are private\".</p><p>After the summit's first weekend, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said in a televised interview on Dec 4 that the world's top oil exporter would \"absolutely not\" agree to a text that calls for the phase-down of fossil fuels.</p><p>He called out countries pushing for a phase-out of fossil fuel for their hypocrisy. \"I'm not naming names,\" he said. \"But those countries who believe in phasing out and phasing down hydrocarbons, you should come out and put together a plan for how, starting Jan 1, 2024.\"</p><p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), too, complicated matters. In a leaked letter dated Dec 6, Opec Secretary General Haitham Al-Ghais urged Opec+ members to reject draft texts that target fossil fuels.</p><p>Citing \"undue and disproportionate pressure against fossil fuels\", Al-Ghais urged members to \"proactively reject any text or formula that targets energy that is fossil fuels rather than emissions\".</p><p>Sentiment soured further after the second and final weekend of the talks, when a draft agreement released on Dec 11 dropped references to the phase-out of fossil fuels, a day before the talks were due to end.</p><p>This sparked widespread criticism from experts, including climate advocate and former US Vice President Al Gore, who said COP28 was \"on the verge of complete failure\". Gore says in a post on X: \"This obsequious draft reads as if Opec dictated it word for word. It is even worse than many had feared . It is deeply offensive to all who have taken this process seriously.\"</p><p>From the first weekend, Gore was critical of the host country, telling Reuters in Dubai that the UAE is \"abusing the public's trust by naming the CEO of one of the largest and least responsible oil companies in the world as head of the COP\".</p><p>Commenting on the final text, Gore calls the agreement \"the bare minimum we need\" and \"long overdue\". \"The influence of petrostates is still evident in the half measures and loopholes included in the final agreement.\"</p><p>He says fossil fuel interests \"went all out\" to control the outcome, \"but the passionate work of millions of climate activists worldwide inspired and motivated delegates from many nations to loosen the industry's grip\".</p><p>Gore adds: \"We must ask ourselves how much longer will the world have [to] wait before all nations summon the political will to overcome these narrow special interests and act on behalf of the future of humanity. It is up to all of us to hold our leaders accountable to their promise to transition away from fossil fuels once and for all.\"</p><p>As climate negotiators stare down one another in Dubai, the fossil fuel industry continues deal-making, doubling down on a business generating billions in supernormal profits over the past few years.</p><p>On Dec 12, Houston-based Occidental Petroleum shook hands with shale producer CrownRock in a US$12 billion ($16.13 billion) acquisition deal. The move by Occidental Petroleum, which Warren Buffett backs, is the latest in a slew of mega-billion M&amp;As in the oil industry over three months. On Oct 12, ExxonMobil announced it was buying Pioneer Natural Resources for US$60 billion and within days, Chevron announced the purchase of Hess for US$53 billion.</p><p>Singapore not a claimant</p><p>The climate summit had started strong, with world leaders agreeing on a loss and damage fund on the opening day. At least US$790 million has been pledged, and the fund will be hosted through the World Bank for the first four years.</p><p>Al-Jaber hailed the \"unprecedented\" speed of the agreement, which is intended to pay poorer countries for the harm caused by climate change.</p><p>Singapore will not claim from the loss and damage fund and will instead support fellow Aosis member states to receive money, says Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu.</p><p>Speaking to reporters in Dubai on Dec 11, Fu says the city-state \"does not intend to access this finance\". \"We will not be claiming from this fund, although we have to invest very significantly into coastal protection.\"</p><p>Following her ambiguous comments in Parliament in February, her comments ended speculation that the republic could be a potential claimant. \"Singapore belongs to [the] developing countries, and we stand as a potential claimant from this loss and damage fund,\" said Fu then. \"We have not even had the chance to discuss this internationally, and we have to decide whether to contribute or claim from this fund.\"</p><p>Singapore targets coal</p><p>The republic endeavoured to make itself heard at the summit. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) managing director Ravi Menon kickstarted the second edition of the Singapore Pavilion on Nov 30, which then hosted 12 days of announcements and panels.</p><p>Over a hectic weekend for Singapore's delegation, MAS launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (Singapore-Asia Taxonomy) on Dec 3, outlining detailed thresholds and criteria for defining green and transition activities contributing to climate change mitigation.</p><p>As the world's first taxonomy to pioneer the concept of a \"transition\" category, the Taxonomy adopts a \"traffic light\" classification system - \"green\" to denote activities that are aligned today with a 1.5\u00b0C outcome, and \"amber\" to denote activities that will move to \"green\" over a defined period, or facilitate significant emissions reductions in the short term.</p><p>Against the fossil fuel fracas, the Taxonomy provides a credible framework to phase out coal-fired power plants. This is a critical part of the energy transition in the Asia Pacific, says MAS, as coal accounts for almost 60% of power generation in the region.</p><p>Formerly referred to as the Singapore Taxonomy, the guidelines had been expected to be published in June. Instead, MAS sought feedback on additional criteria, such as the phase-out of coal-fired power plants.</p><p>Defining transition is particularly salient in Asia, says MAS. \"The progressive shift towards a net-zero economy is taking place alongside economic development, population growth and rising energy demands. Clarifying what constitutes sustainable and transition financing will also help reduce the risk of green or transition washing, as financial institutions will be able to identify and disclose how their financed activities and labelled products are aligned with the taxonomy.\"</p><p>Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean announced a new Asia-focused blended finance initiative that same day. He added that the government is prepared to contribute \"catalytic capital\" to support the partnership to mobilise up to US$5 billion for green and transition projects.</p><p>He first spoke about Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, or Fast-P, when delivering Singapore's national statement at COP28 a day prior. \"The initiative will draw on concessional capital to catalyse commercial capital from a range of partners, including multilateral development banks and philanthropists, in support of Asia's transition to net zero,\" says Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.</p><p>As Teo says, \"some partners\" have already pledged their support for Fast-P. \"We are confident that more will follow.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69X1-WPW1-JCF0-40KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

And few countries will be spared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Torrential monsoon rains, coupled with melting glaciers, submerged one-third of Pakistan's lands in September. The calamity left 1,500 people dead, washed away homes, destroyed livestock and racked up damage worth US$40 billion (S$54.7 billion). Worse, the Pakistan economy will suffer a further projected 3 percentage-point decline in gross domestic product growth in 2023.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Even tested systems are drowning in water. Great powers like China were not spared after floods ravaged cities and wreaked havoc on its mountainous countrysides and busy cities during this year's monsoon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hurricane Ian tore through Florida and North and South Carolina in the United States in late September, with the devastation setting a new US$100 billion global record for insurance claims for a natural disaster.</p><p> Worryingly, this partial list does not include droughts and other extreme weather mayhem. From January through September, there were 29 weather-related disasters with losses of at least US$1 billion, according to insurance broker Aon, with the total economic cost still being counted. The estimate for 2021 was US$329 billion. </p><p> More valuable are the costs we cannot put figures to as climate change acidifies oceans, raises sea levels, alters ecologies and generates more extreme weather events: the loss of lives, biodiversity, heritage and the dangers to health. </p><p> A 'here and now' crisisBut loss may finally be giving way to action. At the COP27 climate summit in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, delegates agreed to include \"loss and damage\" on the agenda, recognising the unavoidable, destructive impact of climate change even with best-laid plans to cut greenhouse gases and adapt to a changed climate.</p><p> This is a long time coming. The most vulnerable developing countries have demanded aid to cover permanent climate-related loss and repairable damage for more than 30 years. In 1991, the Alliance of Small Island States -- a coalition of 39 low-lying coastal nations -- called for help for countries most exposed to rising sea levels. </p><p> But the proposal had little traction, with rich countries -- responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions for the better part of three centuries -- resisting the idea. </p><p> Some baby steps have been taken in recent years. Countries agreed to set up The Santiago Network to catalyse the provision of technical assistance to vulnerable countries in managing climate risks at the Madrid COP25 in 2019. </p><p> But hesitancy continued swirling. At COP26 in Glasgow in 2021, rich countries pledged to start a two-year dialogue to discuss funding, but refused funding commitments. They feared opening themselves up to unlimited liabilities -- even though the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change stated that loss and damage would not involve compensation.</p><p> While true in a legal sense, the cold hard truth is that developed nations are some of the largest emitters, prospering through highly pollutive industrialisation. Yet it's poor countries, whose contributions to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions have been minuscule, which bear the brunt of destruction from climate-related natural disasters. It just doesn't seem fair.</p><p> Africa, which has 17 per cent of the world's population, accounts for less than 4 per cent of current global emissions. Understandably, poor countries believe, as Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados pointed out at Sharm El-Sheikh, that they have \"a moral and just cause\".</p><p> Climate justiceAt its core, loss and damage is about climate justice. This concept has been barely acknowledged in the climate debate, with scant mention. </p><p> The iconic 2015 Paris Agreement mentions the word \"justice\" only once in the preamble: \"The Parties to this agreement... noting the importance for some of the concept of 'climate justice'...\" (my emphasis in italics) -- making clear that justice does not have universal support.</p><p> But there is a budding change of heart. At the 2021 Glasgow summit, host Scotland committed US$2.2 million to loss and damage -- a drop in the bucket, but symbolically important as the first actual commitment of funds. </p><p> At this year's COP27, the president of the European Commission, Dr Ursula von der Leyen, endorsed the idea of separate funding for poor nations affected by loss and damage. Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany and Ireland stepped forward with contributions. </p><p> But conspicuous by its absence from the list was the world's largest cumulative carbon emitter, the US. Perhaps mindful of the fraught political process required to secure funding for such an outlay from the country's divided Congress, US climate envoy John Kerry confined himself to supporting further discussion on loss and damage, but committed nothing.</p><p> Why have some rich countries changed their tune on funding loss and damage? Maybe with climate-related disasters having hit them, they have come to realise the shared nature of the threat and the tragedy of global commons. </p><p> Or maybe they recognise a key consequence of uncompensated climate-related damage long warned before: A surge of climate refugees heading to their shores from the Middle East, Africa and Central America. </p><p> Immigration can be a firecracker igniting policy innovation. Already, there are about three times more climate refugees than the number of people forced to flee armed conflicts, according to the Geneva-based research organisation Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre. And the number is forecast to rise to 200 million by 2050, from 30.7 million in 2020.</p><p> The third pillar of climate financeWhile a financing mechanism for loss and damage has yet to be set up, the idea now at least has some support and more momentum. It will be the third pillar of climate finance to supplement funding for mitigation and adaptation. </p><p> Vulnerable countries, climate activists and non-governmental organisations have their wish lists on how such a mechanism should work. Its disbursements should be automatic, following incidences of climate-related loss and damage. </p><p> They should come primarily from countries that have contributed most to the climate crisis and the contributions should be mandated, not voluntary, ad hoc acts of charity. </p><p> The facility should be separate from humanitarian and development aid serving a different purpose. The amount pledged should also be in addition to the US$100 billion in climate finance rich countries had promised to transfer to the developing world by 2020 as part of COP16 in 2009 -- a pledge on which they have fallen short. </p><p> Some funding can be routed through multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as they raise their game on climate finance, but other sources of funding should also be explored.</p><p> Formidable obstaclesBut the idea of a loss and damage facility faces formidable obstacles, even leaving aside political hurdles. Already, there is a lack of enthusiasm for existing global climate initiatives, particularly in the US. </p><p> One issue will be determining what types of loss and damage the facility would cover and the extent to which they are caused by climate change. Many incidences of floods, for instance, are also the result of poor domestic policies, such as drainage channels being built over or the removal of mangroves, as well as deforestation and faulty land-use policies. </p><p> Air pollution can also be traced to generous fossil fuel subsidies, the absence of mitigating measures such as carbon taxes, stubble-burning -- seen in the seasonal transboundary haze afflicting South-east Asia -- uncontrolled construction activities and poor vehicle emission standards. </p><p> Transfers may have to be conditional on the adoption of minimum standards of mitigation and adaption. Opponents of a loss and damage facility after all would have powerful arguments to deny funding to countries guilty of such self-inflicted malpractices. </p><p> Standards and benchmarks must also be set, made transparent and be independently verifiable, to pre-empt gaming, corruption and the diversion of funds to other uses, with transfers to be closely monitored.</p><p> Then there are issues around the form that loss and damage funding should take, and its sources. Rich countries rely mainly on insurance, but this works poorly in developing countries. Small farmers and coastal communities most at risk cannot afford the premiums, which will increase as sea levels rise, together with other climate-related risks. More assets will become uninsurable. </p><p> Massive subsidies, or the regional pooling of premiums, including from people at lower risk, will be needed. </p><p> As for the sources of funding, the \"polluter pays\" principle suggests some innovative possibilities besides government transfers from rich countries. Among those possibilities mentioned by climate activists are a rollback of fossil fuel subsidies, a windfall tax on the profits of fossil fuel companies (which even US President Joe Biden has proposed), taxes on the extraction of fossil fuels and a levy on frequent fliers, as well as taxes on shipping emissions. </p><p> An additional allocation of the IMF's currency, called special drawing rights, could also be made, with pots earmarked for loss and damage compensation. </p><p> The abundance of ideas is promising but the devil will be in the details. </p><p> The good news from COP27 is that there is, at last, some support for the idea of loss and damage funding, but we are still many steps away from creating an effective mechanism for this. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Climate justice activists protesting against the use of fossil fuels on Nov 12 at the ongoing COP27 climate change conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, where delegates agreed to include \"loss and damage\" on the agenda.

However, if you can't act because you haven't found the perfect solutions to help your business 'go green', it may be time to switch from browsing to building mode. </p><p><br/>First, stop waiting for the perfect find to roll around. It likely doesn't exist, so don't let 'perfect' be the enemy of 'good enough'. Expand your search criteria and get creative in the face of scarcity.  <br/>Are there no good options, or have you just not found them? So many tech solutions exist in the market today. Still, they may be marketed for a different industry, be in another geographical region, or have terrible SEO rendering them tough to find. <br/>If in doubt, ask an expert who understands the space, and often solutions will appear. When I ran an open innovation programme to decarbonise the shipping industry, we found exciting solutions in other sectors that could solve marine challenges but hadn't even considered maritime as a target client base - now they have new product lines and investors because we showed them the potential use-case for shipping.  <br/>At SecondMuse, our team running The Incubation Network finds hidden-gem solutions to the plastic pollution problem in every Southeast Asian market we work in because we engage communities at the grassroots level, engage entrepreneur support organisations as partners, and understand that alone we don't have the answers, but collectively we can see farther. <br/>A hands-on approach for bottom-up solutions <br/>If, even after broadening your horizons, the solutions you find still come up short, consider engaging the ones who come close and help them get over the line. <br/>Also Read:How carbon in the metaverse can help solve the real-world climate crisis[2] <br/>At times, the technology is sound, but the business model doesn't fit your needs, or there is some other (completely valid) barrier to adoption. We as a society have to invest in understanding and overcoming these adoption gaps just as much as we invest in developing new innovations and technology. <br/>Regular businesses can play a huge role in bridging these gaps by becoming customers and partners of the best solutions and engaging with or advising the less ideal ones to make them more business-friendly.  <br/>Think of how powerful (and useful) it can be to give these climate solutions specific feedback, suggest other possibilities, and even brainstorm better ways forward. Simply saying 'no' without any of these other steps doesn't serve anyone: you still don't have your solution, and the ones you've spent time finding + vetting have no clue how to get better. <br/>Where are the climate solution gaps? <br/>Having reviewed hundreds of startups and worked with close to a dozen corporations to craft partnerships that lower their carbon footprint, I have seen specific friction points come up again and again.  <br/>Yet they aren't entirely impossible, so here are some common gaps I've seen and ideas for working through them: <br/>Cost <br/>The clean green solution is often more expensive than the status quo, a concept Bill Gates calls the green premium[3]. How do you bring that down? It depends on what is driving the costs, but unless the problem is the technology (too early = unreliable or too expensive), there is often a way around it.  <br/>If it's the cost-per-unit, can you work with customers to produce in volumes they can afford or find like-minded businesses to join their adoption journey to reduce costs for all? <br/>Also Read:How the 'Paris agreement' for plastic is accelerating climate justice in SEA[4] <br/>If it's a CAPEX issue, could switching to a subscription model, getting a supplier with friendlier payment terms, or finding a financial partner that enables instalments/payment plans to help make this more affordable to adopt? <br/>Convenience <br/>Modern life has been optimised for making everything ready to use, always available, and easy to dispose of; it's incredibly wasteful but straightforward, so more environmentally friendly options (e.g. reuse/refill models instead of single-use) can feel like too much effort by comparison.  <br/>How do you make it easy for businesses or consumers to adopt? Anything that reduces the steps required is reasonable.  <br/>In software, you see this with interoperability (instead of forcing customers to adopt new processes or dashboards, ingest the data they have as is and connect everything with APIs); with physical products or consumer choices, consider automatically latching the new desired behaviour onto an existing built-in habit/norm, changing the default choice to the one you want (so they need to opt-out instead of opting-in), or putting a small cost to the undesired behaviour (people take fewer plastic bags when they see they're being charged 10 cents for one). <br/>Context <br/>Sometimes, engineers create technically marvellous products but are disconnected from the realities of operation. If you see a solution that technically solves the problem but doesn't fit your commercial or operational models, it provides the context required to achieve a better design.  <br/>Many times, the founders you'll work with are open to adjusting if they can see that working with you opens up a larger opportunity to work with many others in the same sector. <br/>Final thoughts <br/>These are just some of the gaps you'll find in the market, and even though you work to address them, you may still find yourself falling short of sustainability targets. The climate crisis is one of great complexity[5]: ultimately, we don't just need better solutions; we need better systems.  <br/>In the final part of this three-piece series, I'll explore how we can take bigger-picture climate action that transcends these steps at the individual or entrepreneurial level. <br/>- <br/>Editor's note: e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

It is a survival guide for humanity,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said  at the release of the report in Switzerland.</p><p> The report, approved during a week-long session in Interlaken, brings into \"sharp focus\" the losses and damage that humanity is already experiencing, hitting the most vulnerable people and ecosystems especially hard. </p><p> \"Climate justice is crucial because those who have contributed least to climate change are being disproportionately affected,\" said Dr Aditi Mukherji, one of the 93 authors of the Synthesis Report.</p><p> \"Almost half of the world's population live in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions,\" she added.</p><p> The IPCC says deep emissions cuts are needed this decade to have any chance of limiting global average warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels -- a level beyond which risks far greater climate-linked impacts. </p><p> IPCC's chair, Dr Hoesung Lee, said that three to six times the current amount of financing will be needed to put the world on a pathway to a safer, more equitable and sustainable future for all. </p><p> \"It's not just about the quantity of money. It's also about how and where it is allocated. Vulnerable areas just don't have enough money to fund the urgent need to adapt to climate change.\"</p><p> The report is also crucial in guiding discussions at the UN's COP28 climate talks in Dubai at the end of 2023. </p><p> \"The report is the last comprehensive science assessment of climate change by the IPCC for the next five to six years. By then, we'd know if the key 2030 goal of halving global greenhouse gas emissions on the path to net-zero emissions around 2050 can be attained,\" said associate professor of science, technology and society Winston Chow at Singapore Management University.</p><p> The world has already warmed 1.1 deg C above pre-industrial levels and could reach 1.5 deg C in a decade, based on present emissions levels. </p><p> But the cure is already known and within humanity's grasp, said the IPCC. </p><p> Rapidly scaling up green energy investments and spending on adapting to climate impacts, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable nations, will have long-lasting benefits that will reduce future losses for people and ecosystems.</p><p> The solution, said the IPCC, lies in climate-resilient development -- integrating measures to adapt to climate change with actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in ways that provide wider benefits.</p><p> For instance, many steps to cut emissions would have significant health benefits by lowering air pollution, promoting active mobility, and encouraging shifts to healthier diets.</p><p> The report details a range of emissions-cutting steps costing US$100 (S$135) -- or less -- per tonne of greenhouse gases to reduce global emissions by half by 2030 on 2019 emissions levels. Wind and solar are by far the cheapest and achieve the largest cuts. But other steps include reducing methane emissions from the fossil fuel industry, more energy-efficient buildings, and cutting food waste. </p><p> US$100 per tonne is about the level of carbon prices in the European Union's mandatory emissions trading scheme, which covers around 40 per cent of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> \"Let's hope we make the right choices,\" Dr Lee said. \"Because the ones we make now, and in the next few years, will reverberate around the world, for hundreds, possibly thousands of years.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The IPCC says deep emissions cuts are needed this decade to have any chance of limiting global average warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels -- a level beyond which risks far greater climate-linked impacts.

There are different histories that go into how these identities have been shaped. Sometimes there's this slippage between inclusion and bothsidesism. I've heard a lot of corporate diversity and inclusion leaders say... 'I don't see gender, I don't see race.' That's also not really it.\"</p><p> On the topic of care, Paul, who is a member of climate justice collective SG Climate Rally, says: \"A system that tries to extract as much from you as possible is not a caring system. </p><p> \"And so then, the converse becomes more evident. 'Revolutionary care' to me is about centring justice, doing the work of social justice, believing everyone deserves a decent wage to live a full life, it means being anti-racist, anti-homophobic, anti-patriarchal, anti-ableist.\"</p><p> Over at the Asian Civilisations Museum, the panel Decolonise Your-s(h)elf brought together three Asian writers -- Muna Gurung from Nepal, Nguyen An Ly from Vietnam and Criselda Yabes from the Phillippines.</p><p> Nguyen, who has translated works by authors such as Margaret Atwood and Kazuo Ishiguro, notes that there are some books about Vietnam which might seem a bit alienating to Vietnamese people themselves.</p><p> She gives two examples: Vietnamese-American author Viet Thanh Nguyen's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Sympathizer (2015), as well as The Mountains Sing (2020) by Nguyen Phan Que Mai. </p><p> While The Mountains Sing tells an important story in Vietnamese history, it is problematic to characterise it as a Vietnamese book, she says. </p><p> \"It was written in English, and written for a US audience -- there are passages after passages explaining Vietnamese culture to the other. If you read it, at times you feel you are reading a tourism book or manual.\"</p><p> Gurung, who translated Nepali poet Sulochana Manandhar's collection Night from Nepali to English in 2019, said one of the things she keeps in mind while translating is to try to do it in such a way that those familiar with the country -- or the original language -- would also appreciate the translation. </p><p> For English readers, the dish \"momo\" could be glossed as \"dumpling\", or have its taste and smell described in the text, she adds.</p><p> As a fiction writer, Gurung favours the latter approach. \"But, as a translator, it's a tricky thing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>At the panel Care Is Revolutionary: Towards An Inclusive, Sustainable Future were (from left) Dawn-Joy Leong, Kuansong Victor Zhuang, Tim Min Jie, Mysara Aljaru and Kristian-Marc James Paul.

The United Nations' (UN) Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change has issued a stark warning with its latest Synthesis Report that the repercussions of inaction are monumental. A broad consensus has already been established on the urgent practical steps required to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. We now only have a headroom of 0.4 deg C, with global warming at 1.1 deg C above pre-industrial levels. </p><p>To never get past 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels down the track, we will need to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and get to net-zero CO2 emissions around mid-century. While few would dispute the moral necessity of climate action today, the practical battle against climate change remains stagnant. A major mindset shift is needed for us to bridge the gap between belief and action. As renegade economist Kate Raworth pointed out in her book Doughnut Economics, economists now need to confront the reality that the environment is not separate from the economy and society. The 21st century economist will now need to think holistically to create a model that meets societal needs, protecting planetary boundaries and supporting human progress. Think of two concentric rings - an inner ring representing a social foundation that addresses life's essentials, and an outer ecological ceiling to protect planet Earth's life-supporting systems. Serving as a compass for human prosperity in the 21st century, the \"doughnut\" lies in the space between these two sets of boundaries that is both ecologically safe and socially just, where humanity can thrive.Doughnut economics: Building in circularity in how we consumeMany countries have announced national legislation and action plans to put the circular economy in motion. While there is no dearth of immediate circular value creation opportunities, the true value of a circular economy lies in wider systemic changes. China announced its five-year action plan in 2021 for reducing plastic pollution and effectively curbing white pollution by 2025 by cutting plastic production and usage, as well as promoting alternatives (such as bamboo, wood, paper and degradable plastics), especially in the retail, e-commerce and express delivery sectors, with the goal of significantly reducing plastic waste in landfills and environmental wastage. Here in Singapore, we are stepping up the national movement in support of the circular economy with the National Environment Agency's recent, islandwide initiative of reverse vending machines to recycle drink containers, and new guidelines proposing a charge on plastic bags. However, given the state of the climate emergency, our current recycling efforts are simply not enough. We need drastic changes in our lifestyles and expectations. It does mean curbing our consumption of \"modern conveniences\" - afforded by endless choice and a convenience culture - and being intentional when we make a purchase. We need to confront the inconvenient truth. Will there be additional waste generated through the consumption of each new material good? Will it have a long useful life? What happens at its end-of-life'The retail industry can play a role in supporting consumers to adopt sustainable practices. Retailers can encourage consumers to take bold action by building in the true cost of waste and ensuring a well-thought-through circular strategy for all the things that we use. While it's now common practice to charge for a disposable container, a better way would be to invest in a reusable container system and eliminate waste altogether. The industry has the opportunity to remake itself through value creation opportunities in retailers' interactions with suppliers and customers. How do brand owners circulate their products and materials in the system, and not downcycle them as waste'The hardest but most impactful part is in the start and end of life - when a product interfaces with nature. Rather than extracting materials and disposing of used products, companies need to move towards a regenerative model and supporting natural processes. Product companies need to rethink innovative ways to incorporate materials that are upcycled and renewable, which in turn encourage best practices across the supply chains. Climate justice: Rethinking our economy to redistribute valueWhile several major corporations are starting to pledge to achieve net-zero operations by the end of 2030, many are also looking at carbon credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions to reduce their tax liabilities. Despite the recent controversy around carbon credits, ensuring greater transparency on carbon offset projects and the benefit on indigenous and local communities can help to redirect financing to areas where real impact can be made.Higher taxes and stricter regulations may be needed for companies to reduce emissions, and minimise the extent to which companies can propagate vague net-zero pledges, as these may be misleading and could amount to greenwashing. Economists now need to consider how to redesign the flow of economic value to redistribute it for the sustainability of the environment and the community. To be effective, it is necessary for price signals to be sustained, strengthened and extended to a greater portion of global emissions. However, Asia has been unable to take concrete action owing to soaring inflation, rising energy prices and economic instability. While the region's carbon taxation is said to be too low to be punitive for major polluters, Singapore's increase of its carbon tax, now the highest in Asia, may well throw a curveball for companies that have not taken heed of the call to reduce emissions. Government revenue from the introduction of significantly higher carbon tax across the region could be redirected to adaptation measures, especially for vulnerable communities that are often the hardest hit by climate inaction.No Planet BAs the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres pointed out, \"the climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win\". As we face rising sea levels, melting ice caps, burning forests and dying coral reefs, inaction is not an option. To inspire bold action, we need to offer more than just rewards, dangling carrots for carrying out feel-good and do-good initiatives. We will need to make inertia too expensive for everyone with the stick approach. The most vulnerable among us will be the hardest hit. The most tangible form of charity is not to give our time or money (that helps too), but to slow down and ideally reverse the climate crisis - not to save the Earth, but to save ourselves.

As part of its sustainability commitments, Lendlease has embarked on Mission Zero to achieve net-zero carbon by 2025 and absolute zero by 2040.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>We now only have a headroom of 0.4 deg C, with global warming at 1.1 deg C above pre-industrial levels.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6823-WCK1-DYX4-02HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1172\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

We are losing the battle to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York on Thursday. \"The Secretary-General reaffirms that there is no way to avoid such a climate catastrophe without ending our addiction to fossil fuels.\" </p><p> The UAE is a major Opec exporter as well as a supporter of both renewable energy investment and continued oil and gas production. But climate activists say this dual focus is incompatible with the goal of deep emission cuts needed this decade to avoid the world busting the 1.5 deg C warming limit under the UN's Paris climate agreement. </p><p> In a statement on his appointment on Thursday, Dr Al Jaber said: \"The UAE is approaching COP28 with a strong sense of responsibility and the highest possible level of ambition.\" He said the UAE will bring \"a pragmatic, realistic and solutions-oriented approach that delivers transformative progress for climate and for low carbon economic growth\".</p><p> Last year's COP27 climate talks in Egypt were heavily criticised for a lack of ambition on cutting emissions from fossil fuels. The final text made no mention of phasing out fossil fuels, despite dozens of nations supporting stronger wording. That has put pressure on the UAE to send a strong signal on fossil fuels. </p><p> Reactions to the appointment of Dr Al Jaber were swift in condemnation and cautious support. </p><p> Former British prime minister Tony Blair, executive chairman of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, pointed to the UAE's role as bridge-builder between rich and poor nations, saying: \"The country is an exemplar of the public and private sectors working in partnership. It has strong relationships with the Global North and South, East and West, and can be the honest broker needed to raise ambitions and seek real consensus.\"</p><p> He also noted the UAE has shown leadership in climate investment and innovation, including becoming one of the largest investors in renewables at home and abroad.</p><p> Dr Al Jaber was founding chief executive of Abu Dhabi's renewable energy firm Masdar, and is driving ADNOC's low-carbon growth strategy. But he has also been open about the need to step up global investment in oil and gas as part of what he says is a realistic transition to meet the world's energy needs as green technology investment gathers speed. </p><p> Dr Maria Mendiluce, chief executive of the We Mean Business Coalition, said driving investment in the green economy will be key at COP28. \"Business needs the COP28 presidency to mobilise ambitious government policy and finance to dramatically scale up investments in clean energy, while stopping new investment in fossil fuels. This will enable companies to cut emissions at speed and build a safer, more stable and thriving global economy.\" </p><p> But climate activists said the appointment sent the wrong signal and risked COP28 becoming a greenwashing event that would back more investment in oil and gas. </p><p> \"This is a truly breathtaking conflict of interest and is tantamount to putting the head of a tobacco company in charge of negotiating an anti-smoking treaty,\" said Mr Romain Ioualalen, global policy manager at Oil Change International. </p><p> \"This appointment risks further undermining the credibility of global climate talks,\" he added. </p><p> ActionAid said fossil fuel interests had captured the UN climate talks process.</p><p>  \"The UN Climate Summit is supposed to be a space where the world holds polluters to account,\" said Ms Teresa Anderson, global lead of climate justice at ActionAid, in a statement. </p><p> \"Like last year's summit, we're increasingly seeing fossil fuel interests taking control of the process and shaping it to meet their own needs,\" she added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE's minister of industry and technology, will help shape the agenda of COP28.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-JJ1A4P0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:679P-WBF1-JCF2-82H6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The sites cover 46,758 sq km, a territory larger than the size of Switzerland.</p><p> She said the expansion of the resources sector was crucial to securing domestic energy needs.</p><p> \"At the same time as we strive to reduce emissions, it must be emphasised that continued exploration for oil and gas in Commonwealth waters is central to alleviating future domestic gas shortfalls,\" she added.</p><p> The move angered environmental groups and campaigners, who said the federal government was defying calls by the United Nations and climate scientists to end the growth of the fossil fuel sector.</p><p> Human Rights Watch's Australian researcher Sophie McNeill said in a statement: \"True climate leadership requires tough, courageous decisions.</p><p> \"The Albanese government needs to stop approving new fossil fuel projects and deliver on its promise of Australia as a renewable energy superpower.\"</p><p> Analysts also rejected the government's claims that new gas projects would help to address domestic shortfalls, noting that Australia produces plentiful supplies of gas but has locked in large volumes for sale to foreign buyers.</p><p> Australia has one of the highest rates of carbon emissions per capita in the world, and is also a major exporter of coal, oil and gas.</p><p> Professor Jeremy Moss, a climate justice expert from the University of New South Wales, criticised the government's strong subsidies for the resources export sector, saying that this support meant Australia shared the responsibility for emissions that stem from its export of fossil fuels.</p><p> \"Australia is not responsible for all the emissions produced by exported fossil fuels - after all, other countries consume them,\" he wrote on The Conversation website.</p><p> \"Still, Australia must take a high degree of responsibility given the billions of dollars in subsidies and environmental approvals that allow the industry to exist.\"</p><p> But Mr Albanese, who is riding a wave of public popularity and attempting to dominate the political centre in Australia, has made it clear that his push for climate action will not extend to ending the growth of the lucrative resources sector.</p><p> Asked at a press conference how Australia could explore for more petroleum and also cut emissions, he said that Australia planned to increase its renewable energy supply.</p><p> \"But what that doesn't mean is that immediately you can stop using fossil fuel sources today,\" he said. \"We need to be sensible about this.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1083230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:669P-GM31-DYX4-03CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Chiefs of natural gas firms were billing themselves as climate champions, despite gas companies having faced lawsuits in the United States over such claims.</p><p> Nevertheless, some electricity-poor nations in Africa argued for their right to develop their natural gas reserves, even as they face increasing climate impacts such as drought. </p><p> And fossil fuel phase-out clubs launched around 2021's summit in Glasgow were struggling to recruit new members amid 2022's energy crisis caused by the Ukraine war.</p><p> 'Brazil is back'Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was greeted by roaring crowds as he declared \"Brazil is back\" in the global climate fight, and vowed to host COP30 in 2025 in the Amazon region.</p><p> The leftist leader made the Egypt climate summit his first visit abroad since winning his country's presidential election in October against right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro, who had presided over mounting destruction of the rainforest and refused to hold the 2019 climate summit originally planned for Brazil.</p><p> On Monday, Brazil also joined Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in launching a partnership to cooperate on forest preservation. The trilateral alliance was negotiated over a decade of on-off talks. They are expected to press rich nations to pay for forest preservation.</p><p>US-China ties rekindledA critical precursor for the climate talks' success happened far away from the Red Sea locale.</p><p> As COP27 entered its second week, China's President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden met in Indonesia for the Group of 20 summit where the heads of the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters agreed to restart cooperation on climate change after a months-long hiatus due to tensions over Taiwan.</p><p> China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua had previously told reporters that informal dialogue with Mr John Kerry, his US counterpart, had continued.</p><p> Mr Xie said on Nov 19 that he expects to keep up direct cooperation on climate change with Mr Kerry after the end of COP27.</p><p> Billions in private financeThe world of finance has failed to provide enough money to help countries cut their carbon emissions and adapt their economies to the changes wrought by global warming, yet the COP27 talks suggest change is coming.</p><p> Among the steps likely to free up more cash is a plan to reform leading public lenders such as the World Bank so that they can take more risk and lend more money. By doing so, countries hope more private investors will join in.</p><p> Deals struck at the talks also give hope for faster action, chief among them a landmark deal between countries such as the United States and Japan, and private investors to help Indonesia shift away from coal-fired power generation more quickly.

Most of the district's million-plus population are itinerant farm workers, earning a daily wage tending crops for  landowners.</p><p> Poverty, debt and the unequal distribution of land have made their livelihoods precarious, but the rise of extreme weather events linked to climate change has deepened the insecurity.</p><p> This year's crops were first scorched by temperatures that reached 51 deg C in May, only to be drenched by monsoon rains that affected a third of the country -- a scale never seen in Pakistan.</p><p> The agriculture sector is by far the biggest employer in Pakistan, accounting for more than 40 per cent of the labour force, the majority being women.</p><p> Community non-governmental organisation worker Jan Odhano, who has provided emergency relief to victims of both the heatwave and floods, said the \"double disasters\" left farm workers desperate for a way out.</p><p> \"They think they can get work in the big cities more easily. Men can work in the factories,\" he told AFP, adding that a wider range of work opportunities is also available to women. </p><p> Many of the flood-displaced people in southern Sindh province have sought shelter in urban centres, including tens of thousands recorded at relief camps and many more in the homes of relatives or rental properties.</p><p> With homes and livelihoods washed away, some are expected to abandon their rural lives, heaping pressure on already-swelling cities grappling with a long-term \"major crisis of urban governance\", according to Dr Nausheen H. Anwar, a professor of urban planning in Karachi. </p><p> \"We are not prepared for what's going to happen,\" she said of migration due to climate change. \"These flows are going to be inevitable.\"</p><p> Mr Muhammad Hanif, 20, has had enough after seeing his livestock perish and crops wrecked. \"It is unliveable here. There is no work left. We will have to go to Karachi.\"</p><p> The standard of living in the southern megacity of more than 25 million is little better for impoverished arrivals. Pakistan's economic capital suffers from poorly maintained roads, crippled drainage and sewerage systems, water distribution in the grip of mafias, electricity shortages and inadequate housing. </p><p> Between six million and nine million Pakistanis are set to be dragged into poverty as a result of this year's cataclysmic monsoon flooding that has sent food prices soaring and is estimated to cost at least US$30 billion (S$42.64 billion) in loss and damage, according to government estimates. </p><p> Even before the deluge, Pakistan's economy was struggling, with soaring inflation, a plunging rupee and dwindling foreign exchange reserves.</p><p> Calls are growing from the government and activists for richer and more industrialised nations  to offer debt relief to Pakistan as a form of climate justice. Demands for the largest emitters to take financial responsibility for the climate chaos impacting poorer nations is set to dominate a United Nations summit in November. </p><p>Pakistan, the world's fifth-most populous country, is on the front line of climate change, despite being responsible for just 0.8 per cent of global emissions.</p><p> During the heatwaves in Jacobabad, 10-year-old Noor Muhammad endured searing temperatures to attend school, watching as friends fainted in classrooms with no electricity or cold water.</p><p> Just months later, he and his family sought shelter in the same building -- repurposed to help flood victims.</p><p> \"We're helpless,\" he told AFP. \"I only want to complete my exams so I can become a police officer.\" AFP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The site of a brick kiln factory damaged by floods in Jacobabad, Pakistan's Sindh province.

young people attending the COP27 climate summit in Egypt are calling for loss and damage compensation to cope with the irreversible impact of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Holding protests at the conference venue, several youth organisations demanded that countries set up a finance facility to provide new, additional and accessible funding to address and limit the irreversible effects of climate change. </p><p> The Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, Youngo (the youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), and the UK Youth Climate Coalition also called for a youth advisory committee on loss and damage to be set up so that youth can be more meaningfully included in the decision-making process. </p><p> Ms Hyacinthe Niyitegeka, 28, a co-founder of the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, said that while she is glad loss and damage have officially been added to the COP agenda this year, it is only the beginning of a long battle to get countries largely responsible for the climate crisis to pay up and compensate developing countries affected by the crisis.  </p><p> So far, countries such as Austria, New Zealand and Denmark have pledged to finance loss and damage.</p><p> The Loss and Damage Youth Coalition was founded in 2020 to rally youth from developing countries in the Global South to raise awareness of the scale and extent of damage that have been escalating in intensity caused by the climate crisis. </p><p> The Global South refers broadly to the regions of Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania.</p><p> \"There are many people out there who are not aware of these losses and damage, including youth,\" said Ms Niyitegeka, a water scientist from Rwanda. </p><p> \"With this initiative, we want to be able to fight for ourselves, fight for our future, and... raise the profile of youth voices on the global stage to pressure world leaders to fulfil their promises.\" </p><p> Student Xuan Zihan, 22, a Singaporean representative of Youngo, said: \"Young people are not merely victims who are disproportionately affected by worsening climate impacts, but are also active agents of change and incubators of innovative ideas and solutions.\"</p><p> Having meaningful youth involvement in negotiations could also push for higher climate ambition and intergenerational equity, he added.</p><p>Filipino climate activist Mitzi Jonnelle Tan, 25, wants young people to have a stake in loss and damage negotiations due to the sheer scale of climate debt that poorer countries would have to potentially pay. </p><p> \"A lot of loss and damage finance that has been given to developing countries are in the form of loans, and not grants, which would mean that many countries will go into debt to these Global North countries.  </p><p> \"It is not just the older generation who will be paying off this debt, but the younger generation and the generations to come,\" said Ms Tan, who is with Youth Advocates for Climate Action Philippines. </p><p> Extreme weather events are now increasing in intensity and frequency. </p><p> In October, a severe tropical storm -- Typhoon Noru -- swept across the Philippines, affecting close to three million people and damaging billions of pesos' worth of infrastructure and agriculture. </p><p> In Pakistan, severe flooding in 2022 has claimed more than 7,000 lives, and caused almost US$40 billion (S$55 billion) in damage, said Mr Pervez Ali, 19, the country coordinator for youth climate advocacy group Fridays for Future (Pakistan). </p><p> \"So it's a big catastrophe, and I think as youth representatives from Pakistan, we should be emphasising youth involvement in policymaking because it's our future,\" he added.</p><p> But while the economic fallout from climate change -- such as the loss of infrastructure, homes and agricultural land -- is large, young people are also worried about the non-economic or intangible losses, such as the impact on physical and mental health, that can be difficult to quantify. </p><p> Intense flooding events and cyclones in Fiji and Pakistan, for example, have left a traumatic imprint on the youth in those countries.  </p><p> Mr Lavetanalagi Seru, 30, the regional policy coordinator at the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network, said that young people who survived a Category 5 typhoon in the Fijian island of Gau in 2016 are still afraid to play in the rain, and cry at any sound of thunder.  </p><p> The Fijian added: \"We don't have adequate facilities and the necessary resources to deal with mental health on this scale. To be able to address this, we would need funding, and it would have to come from a loss and damage finance facility.\"</p><p> This story was published with the support of Climate Tracker's COP27 Climate Justice Fellowship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singaporean climate advocate Xuan Zihan believes young people can be active agents of change and incubators of innovative ideas and solutions.

The fossil fuel savings are equivalent to 9 per cent of total fossil fuel costs in these countries between January and June. </p><p> China has the greatest solar capacity in the world, with Japan, India, South Korea and Vietnam also being among the global top 10 states in terms of solar power generation. </p><p> In 2020, China had only 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar power, but it had ramped up capacity to 307GW by the end of 2021. This year, it is expected to add between 75GW and 90GW of new solar energy to its electricity grid. </p><p> Expanding its solar capacity has allowed China to meet 5 per cent of its total electricity demand within the first half of 2022, with US$21 billion avoided in additional coal and gas imports. </p><p>Vietnam, on the other hand, had close to zero terawatt hours of solar generation in 2018, but it has reached the point where solar power accounted for 11 per cent of electricity demand -- equivalent to 14 terawatts -- from January to June.  This has allowed the country to avoid US$1.7 billion in additional fossil fuel costs. </p><p> Although Vietnam rapidly expanded its solar capacity, the energy grid was not ready for a sudden increase in solar power, causing the solar output to fall by 30 per cent to 40 per cent in some areas, the report noted. </p><p> Though this has since improved, investment into new solar capacity has dropped dramatically, largely due to grid instability and continued delays to the country's eighth power development plan.</p><p> International companies and industries have been driving solar investments in the development of microgrids, for example, to feed their demand for clean energy sources. </p><p> Ember's Asia electricity analyst Achmed Shahram Edianto said Vietnam needs to reconfigure the whole power system around clean energy into its policy, and expanding solar power should go beyond alleviating power shortages. </p><p> \"Its upcoming power development plan should be to rebuild the country's power systems around clean energy, rather than one that merely incorporates a few more transmission lines, to alleviate the network bottlenecks,\" he added.</p><p> The report said that while growth in solar has been slower in Thailand and the Philippines, the avoided fuel costs have still been notable. </p><p> \"While solar accounted for only 2 per cent of Thailand's electricity in the first six months of 2022, an estimated US$209 million of potential fossil fuel costs were avoided,\" it said. </p><p> \"The Philippines avoided US$78 million in fossil fuel spending, despite solar accounting for only 1 per cent of (electricity) generation.\"  </p><p> The Philippines now has favourable policies towards solar energy, according to its recently revised energy plan, the report noted, adding that two of its largest players in solar now have substantial solar capacity that has been permitted or is under construction. </p><p> But access to financing for solar projects still proves challenging. </p><p>Thailand led Asean in solar investments in 2016 but has failed to keep pace with the rest of the region, with just under 600 megawatts of additional solar power since then, according to the report. </p><p> Therefore, while it may have the solar capacity, a more concerted decarbonisation effort is required.</p><p> Dr Edianto said one of the most significant barriers that the Philippines is facing in ramping up solar capacity was the notion that coal remains the cheapest energy source. </p><p> \"But current international market prices could show how vulnerable the countries that rely on import commodities such as gas and coal really are,\" he noted. </p><p> The report concluded that if these countries could meet their 2030 solar capacity targets, at least US$44 billion in fuel costs could be avoided. </p><p> The region's solar capacity is expected to acquire an average annual growth rate of 22 per cent a year till 2030 across China, India, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines.</p><p> This story was published with the support of Climate Tracker's COP27 Climate Justice Fellowship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A man cutting grass among solar panels at the Sao Mai power plant in Vietnam's An Giang province.

It transforms the country's energy sector, in particular, essentially laying out an array of incentives that make clean energy the most cost-effective choice. It devotes, for instance, US$370 billion (S$511 billion) over 10 years to electric vehicle and clean energy tax breaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It also means the US will go into the next United Nations climate conference, COP27, in Egypt in November with some moral authority regained.</p><p> The Bill is called the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) because it will help reduce energy costs that are a key contributor to inflation.</p><p> It invests, for example, in electricity grid improvements, lower-cost clean energy and efficiency in home energy. Over the next decade, modelling suggests the IRA's power sector tax credits could translate into average household savings of up to US$220 annually through lower energy bills and, more generally, less costly goods and services, the World Resources Institute (WRI) estimates.</p><p> The IRA is a pared-down version of a US$3.2 trillion blueprint for sweeping social, environmental and economic reforms proposed last year by Mr Biden.</p><p> But even pared down, the measures taken together will cut nearly one billion additional tonnes of emissions in 2030, putting America's emissions reduction target of 50 per cent to 52 per cent within reach and making significant progress towards the President's goal of 100 per cent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, the WRI said.</p><p> The IRA also addresses healthcare and taxation. But it is in climate, and particularly energy, that it is transformative. Among other things, it will create a boom in employment in the clean energy business.</p><p> \"There will be some disequilibrium as people adjust to changes,\" said Professor Paul Sullivan, an energy expert who lectures at Johns Hopkins University. But \"solar and wind are just going to take off\".</p><p> \"There is a lot of money to be made. This is also a capitalist Bill,\" he said. \"One of the main things about this is that renewable companies and battery and electric vehicle companies will have policy consistency for at least 10 years. This is very important.\"</p><p> Reuters quoted Mr Keith Martin, an attorney with Norton Rose Fulbright who works on financing renewable energy projects, as saying: \"This is going to be a golden period of 10 years, at least. That is a long horizon for people to plan and really get this transition to clean energy into high gear.\"</p><p> Mr Biden said at the signing ceremony in the White House on Tuesday: \"With this law, the American people won, and the special interests lost.\"</p><p> Under the IRA, electric vehicles will be cheaper both to make and to buy.</p><p> It includes generous tax credits for manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels; nearly US$6 billion to reduce emissions from chemical, steel and cement plants; US$3 billion in \"climate justice\" grants to address health risks from pollution and climate change; more than US$20 billion for climate-smart agriculture; and US$5 billion for forest management.</p><p> This comes at a time when the US has for consecutive years reeled from forest fires and storm disasters intensified by global warming.</p><p> Separately, according to a new model released this week by First Street Foundation, a non-profit organisation that assesses future climate risk, more than 100 million Americans live in areas that are expected to see at least one day with a heat index of 51.6 deg C or more in the next 30 years.</p><p> This is a \"do or die situation\", Prof Sullivan said. \"But we are finally going to get our act together to combat climate change.\"</p><p> Mr Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of the WRI, said in a statement: \"The Inflation Reduction Act is a victory for all Americans and shows the world that the United States is still an ally in the global fight against climate change.\"</p><p> Dr Wesley Morgan, a researcher at the Climate Council, a research and advisory organisation in Australia, tweeted: \"In a warming world, climate policy is foreign policy. In the Indo-Pacific, we will see an energy transition that we haven't seen since the Industrial Revolution itself.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1077783</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:665W-18Y1-JCF2-83D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The aim is to agree the outlines of the fund and sources of financing by the next major UN climate gathering -- COP28 -- in the United Arab Emirates in late 2023. </p><p> Progress was also made in discussions to create a global goal on adaptation, another key area for developing nations which need growing amounts of assistance to boost their resilience to worsening storms, floods, droughts and sea-level rise. For instance, investments to strengthen infrastructure such as drainage and sea walls or boosting the resilience of agriculture to hotter and more unpredictable weather. </p><p> An initial four-year work programme has been launched to encourage more ambition by all nations to cut emissions through workshops, knowledge sharing and financial investment events. But it does not set firm targets, nor is it punitive. </p><p> But it was the loss and damage fund decision, which many thought would not be agreed, that brought the most praise. </p><p> This is because the idea of a fund had long been resisted by the United States and a number of other rich nations, fearing it would lead to compensation payments. Wealthy nations are historically responsible for the majority of the greenhouse gas pollution that is heating up the planet and triggering increasingly extreme weather events. </p><p> \"This loss and damage fund will be a lifeline for poor families whose houses are destroyed, farmers whose fields are ruined, and islanders forced from their ancestral homes. This positive outcome from COP27 is an important step toward rebuilding trust with vulnerable countries,\" said Mr Ani Dasgupta, president and chief executive of the Washington-based World Resources Institute think-tank. </p><p> The deal also aims to broaden the pool of financing sources for loss and damage and encourages multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, to do more to help.</p><p> \"A mission 30 years in the making has been accomplished,\" said Mr Molwyn Joseph, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, of which Singapore is a member. </p><p> Mr Yeb Sano, executive director at Greenpeace South-east Asia, told The Straits Times: \"The agreement for a loss and damage fund marks a new dawn for climate justice.</p><p> \"This provides a glimmer of hope for the vulnerable communities in South-east Asia which are already experiencing destructive storms, massive floods, rising sea levels, forest fires, droughts.\"</p><p> But there was deep disappointment on the final wording around fossil fuels and ambition to ramp up global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The text maintains the same compromise language of 2021's Glasgow Climate Pact of phasing down unabated coal and phasing-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. Unabated means the carbon emissions are not captured. The text does not mention oil or gas, only coal. </p><p> The European Union had pushed hard, along with many climate-vulnerable nations, for a call to phase out all fossil fuels, place a stronger emphasis on the need to ramp up renewable energy investments and for nations to submit more ambitious climate action plans to the UN. </p><p> The EU's climate policy chief Frans Timmermans told the conference on Sunday the deal was not strong enough. \"This is the make or break decade, but what we have in front of us is not enough of a step forward for people and planet.\"</p><p> \"It does not bring enough added efforts for major emitters to increase and accelerate their emissions cuts,\" he added.</p><p> Ms Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, and a key figure in the creation of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said: \"The influence of the fossil-fuel industry was found across the board. This COP has weakened requirements around countries making new and more ambitious commitments. </p><p> \"The Egyptian Presidency has produced a text that clearly protects oil and gas petro-states and the fossil-fuel industries. This trend cannot continue in the United Arab Emirates next year.\"</p><p> The pact did recognise the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring nature and ecosystems as a vital way to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key goal of the Paris Agreement. </p><p> The link to nature is essential, especially ahead of December's UN biodiversity summit, COP15, being held in Montreal, which is tasked with setting much more ambitious targets to save nature by 2030, the UN said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry (centre) speaking at the closing session of the COP27 climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh on Sunday.

Such manual methods can be labour- and time-intensive, and are often more expensive in remote areas such as marine environments. <br/>Underwater line transect survey in a seagrass meadow <br/>Technologies such as acoustic monitoring, camera traps, and drones allow for more data on wildlife to be captured and analysed and hence provide an avenue to scale up monitoring for larger areas through: <br/>Accessing remote and previously inaccessible areas via drones and sensors Improving the efficiency of analytical processes e.g. sorting images via AI for species identification Enabling community-based monitoring and citizen science via mobiles apps where users can input data that are uploaded to cloud dashboards or open-source databases Alerting enforcement units to any illegal forest activities occurring through acoustic monitoring of forests, or measuring and monitoring biodiversity Environmental DNA[6] has emerged as a powerful tool to pick up on the presence of species in an area, both historical and present, based on trace amounts of samples <br/>Enforcement and monitoring of protected areas <br/>Tracking devices, camera traps, and other sensors can help with the enforcement of protected areas and track illegal wildlife activities through real-time monitoring and alerting rangers of any anomalies in the area. <br/>The Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool[7] (SMART) exemplifies the use of a technology platform, coupled with conservation capacity-building activities to empower communities to manage conservation areas. <br/>Unlocking additional finance for biodiversity conservation <br/>Web3 generally refers to the next phase of the web characterised by decentralisation and distributed networks, particularly blockchain-based technology. <br/>Blockchain has been promoted as a solution to enable transparency and traceability of restoration projects, while the sale of carbon or ecosystem tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) have been adopted as business models to raise funds for wildlife conservation. <br/>Conservation technology is not a panacea: Challenges and limitations <br/>A key challenge lies in the accessibility of MRV technologies due to costs and affordability, especially for newer technologies that have yet to scale commercially. Technologies such as eDNA are still prohibitively expensive for most projects; they are mostly used in academic research and are less accessible to lower-income communities. <br/>Also Read: As the demand for energy soars, climate tech is here to save the day[8] <br/>These tools can also be inaccessible due to technical expertise and capacity gaps. For example, GIS software often requires specialist knowledge to generate analytical information. <br/>Biodiversity measurement techniques and methodologies are just as important as the tools used. As compared to well-established protocols for manual data collection for forests or coral reef surveys, there is currently no standard for analysing some of the data from emerging technologies, such as eDNA. <br/>Moreover, we are just beginning to explore and understand some of the unintended impacts that conservation technologies may have on wildlife and nature. For instance, there are (inconclusive) studies[9] on how drones can result in behavioural and physiological changes in animals and debates regarding the invasive nature of biologging devices. <br/>On the crypto front, there have been criticisms regarding the environmental impact of blockchain-based tokens, given that blockchain technology is energy-intensive and contributes to carbon emissions that need to be accounted for. <br/>Additionally, given the distributed network of data input and verification, there is currently no standard ensuring that robust measurement methodologies are used and quality data about the conservation or restoration project is recorded onto each 'block' when creating tokens or NFTs. <br/>Thus, third-party verifiers, standard-setting organisations, and regulators still play a role in standardising the quality of credits in the market. <br/>Holistic frameworks and project designs are vital <br/>Conservation technology presents an exciting opportunity[10] for revolutionising the way we measure and evaluate projects, through providing new data, expanding the spatial extent of existing data, or providing real-time information for prompt intervention. <br/>However, biodiversity conservation will require more than tech fixes; ultimately, the agency lies with the people who design and deliver the intervention. Community engagement and capacity building are core to project design and implementation, and ultimately a project's sustainability. <br/>Rather than seeking to replace manual data collection, technologies can be used to enhance community-based monitoring in project areas that are also home to local communities and indigenous groups. <br/>Nonetheless, the race against the ongoing sixth extinction event demands that we act fast, and catalyse scalable solutions for conservation and regeneration. Silverstrand Capital's Biodiversity Accelerator+ is anchored on the belief that solving the biodiversity crisis will require both the adoption of nature-based solutions, as well as technological innovation. <br/>The three-month accelerator programme will support founders through coaching on topics from biodiversity impact measurement to fundraising and marketing strategies.

The floods and mudslides killed more than 440 people, leaving thousands homeless and houses and infrastructure in ruins.</p><p> \"This is part of the new normal that a city like mine is going to have to deal with,\" said Dr Roberts in her keynote speech on Monday at SIWW on how climate change is affecting water systems.</p><p> Scientists believe the south-eastern coast of Africa is becoming more vulnerable to violent storms and floods as greenhouse gases are warming the Indian Ocean.</p><p> Dr Roberts, 61, co-chairs the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Working Group 2, which released its major report in February. She highlighted the sobering implications that rising temperatures, sea-level rise and other indicators will have.</p><p> \"Our report shows very clearly that two-thirds of all adaptation is in response to water-related hazards,\" she said. Adaptation refers to implementing ways to reduce climate risks, such as building seawalls to keep out rising sea levels.</p><p> In an interview with The Straits Times yesterday on the sidelines of SIWW 2022, Dr Roberts noted that nature-based solutions play a key role in managing water-related impacts. For example, restoring floodplains and wetlands can help to reduce flood risks, as wetlands enable more natural water retention. Restoring mangroves will help mitigate climate change impacts with their ability to soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide.</p><p> But nature-based solutions will start to fall off the table as the temperature increases beyond the 1.5 deg C threshold, she warned.</p><p> Limiting warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels is a key goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p> \"By the time we reach global warming levels of 1.5 deg C, we will probably experience irreversible losses of warm water coral reefs and coastal wetlands, so they won't be able to play that (adaptation) role,\" she noted.</p><p> Moreover, poor planning can cause adaptation measures to backfire and spark other environmental issues, she warned. For example, sea walls at some coastal sites can cause coastal erosion further down the coastline.</p><p> She also emphasised that science and technology, and the knowledge of indigenous people should be brought together to tackle the climate crisis since those local communities know their land well.</p><p> Dr Roberts recounted how an Inuit hunter from Canada had noticed that an ice sheet was about to break off. However, satellite images did not spot anything wrong with the glacial ice.</p><p> \"But that ice sheet broke away. It's that combination of (having) people who understand their environment from the soles of their feet, (and using) sophisticated technology. That brings us to our best state of knowledge of the world.\"</p><p> She said putting together the just over 3,000-page Working Group 2 report was no small feat, with 270 scientists labouring over it for five years. It is the second of three that collectively make up the IPCC's sixth assessment report.</p><p> Dr Roberts hopes the three reports will communicate the urgency of finding different ways to make deep cuts in emissions, and raise climate justice and equity.</p><p> SIWW 2022 is being held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre until tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1040815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6588-H891-DYX4-01VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"589\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

But the hard truth is Western countries such as the United States and Canada are not doing enough. Here's why.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Kishore Mahbubani and Bertrand Seah For The Straits Times</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Canadians are among the nicest people on planet Earth as those who have had the good fortune to have Canadian friends can attest. Indeed, one running joke about Canadians is that the first words that come out from their mouths are often \"I'm so sorry...\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Against this backdrop, it was truly shocking to hear a Canadian politician say on BBC Radio that Canada's actions on climate change would not make a real difference since the country contributed only 1.5 per cent of current global emissions. She added that it was all up to China and India, the largest new emitters, to save the world from climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Superficially, this claim by a Canadian politician seems reasonable. Indeed, it is highly likely that many Singaporeans will buy into this hugely unfair and unjust Western perspective on climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This is why it is important for Singaporeans to understand the real story of climate change, especially in the build-up to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (or COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland on Nov 1.</p><p> To paraphrase Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, there are three \"hard truths\" that its people should know.</p><p> The first hard truth is that climate change is not happening just because of the new \"flows\" of greenhouse gases from newly developing countries like China and India. Climate change is also a result of the \"stock\" of greenhouse gas emissions put up by the Western industrialised countries, including Canada, since the Western Industrial Revolution began two centuries ago.</p><p> BBC commentators regularly refer to China as the world's \"largest emitter\" of greenhouse gas emissions. This is true only if \"flows\" are measured. But if the \"stocks\" are added to the picture, the largest emitter in cumulative terms is the US. Here is the data for the \"stocks\" of carbon dioxide emissions: the contribution of the US is 25 per cent, the European Union 22 per cent, China 13 per cent and India 3 per cent. For the record, Canada's historical contribution is 2 per cent.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;DIFFERENTIATED RESPONSIBILITIES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; To be fair, in all the early negotiations on how to cope with climate change, the Western countries acknowledged their historical contributions and accepted that they had to contribute more to fight climate change. This is why the UN agreed on the concept of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" during the first Earth Summit held in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with developed countries (then known as Annex I countries) doing more and developing countries (non-Annex I countries) doing less.</p><p> The Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997, rested on these key pillars: legally binding commitments by the wealthy Annex I countries to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a set of mechanisms including clean development, emissions trading and joint implementation to help countries efficiently reduce emissions.</p><p> If the Kyoto Protocol had been faithfully implemented by all the parties since its adoption, we would have seen 24 years of effective actions taken against climate change. Unfortunately, the Bush administration (from 2001-2009) decided to walk away from the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p> Traditionally, it would have been the responsibility of the host country (in this case, Japan) to fight for and defend the Kyoto Protocol. But the then Japanese government, in a sad act of cowardice, failed to defend the protocol. It instead sought to weaken the agreement. Many precious years were lost in the fight against climate change.</p><p>  To be fair, in all the early negotiations on how to cope with climate change, the Western countries acknowledged their historical contributions and accepted that they had to contribute more to fight climate change.</p><p> This is why the UN agreed on the concept of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" during the first Earth Summit held in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro in 1992, with developed countries (then known as Annex I countries) doing more and developing countries (non-Annex I countries) doing less.</p><p>    Since the world's largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases had walked away from its Kyoto Protocol obligations, it would have been reasonable for new emitters, especially China and India, to also walk away from international agreements on climate change.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; The second hard truth they could have used to justify their refusal to join any international agreement is that on a per capita basis, China and India still contribute far less to carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> The respective figures for the major countries and regions are: the US (15.5 tonnes), Germany (9.4 tonnes), China (7.4 tonnes), India (1.9 tonnes), Australia (17.1 tonnes), Canada (18.6 tonnes). For the record, only European countries have made significant progress in reducing their per capita emissions, averaging 6.4 tonnes.</p><p> It was an extraordinary act of responsibility for China and India to return to the global negotiating table on climate change and accept a whole new agreement on climate change after the Bush administration had walked away from the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p> The result was the famous Paris Agreement of December 2015, at COP21. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, where countries like China and India did not take on any obligations, the Paris Agreement called on all countries, both developed and developing, to make contributions.</p><p> Specifically, the Western developed countries agreed to make deeper cuts in emissions. But this also required the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities to be diluted.</p><p> Instead of the legally binding commitments for wealthy countries in the Kyoto Protocol, countries were allowed to set their own targets. All that was required was domestic political will. It was hoped that this would dissuade countries like the US from withdrawing from painstakingly negotiated agreements again.</p><p> The whole world breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Paris Agreement was reached. This sigh of relief did not last long. After the Trump administration came into office in January 2017, it walked away from the Paris Agreement. Four more years were lost in the battle against climate change.</p><p> When the Trump administration refused to respect its commitments under the Paris Agreement, many feared that China and India, as well as other developing countries like Brazil or Indonesia, would be given the opportunity to follow suit. Doing so would certainly have killed the Paris Agreement.</p><p> Instead, once again, in another massive act of responsibility, China and India, and the rest of the world, respected their commitments. This left the door open for the US to return when Mr Joe Biden became President.</p><p> What is truly remarkable here is that China has not just met its commitments, it has also enhanced them. When President Xi Jinping announced that China would become carbon neutral by 2060, a well-known scholar, Professor Adam Tooze of Columbia University, said that President Xi may have saved the planet with these new contributions.</p><p> Prof Tooze wrote that \"China's leader may have redefined the future prospects for humanity... As the impact of his remarks sank in, climate modellers crunched the numbers and concluded that, if fully implemented, China's new commitment will by itself lower the projected temperature increase by 0.2-0.3 deg C. It is the largest favourable shock that their models have ever produced\".</p><p> All this brings us back to the claim by the Canadian politician that it is up to China and India to do more. Canada, whose per capita income is US$46,327 (S$62,425) in 2019, has not reduced its per capita emissions of carbon dioxide by much. At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, its emissions per capita was 20.5 tonnes. By the Paris Agreement in 2015, Canada's number was 19 tonnes. China and India, whose per capita income in 2019 is much lower at US$10,217 and US$2,101 respectively, also have much lower per capita emissions at 7.4 and 1.9 tonnes.</p><p> A lot of Canada's emissions is due to the hugely damaging tar sands fracking project in its state of Alberta. As the distinguished environmentalist and writer Bill McKibben points out, the Alberta tar sands \"would produce about a hundred and twelve billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is 28 per cent of the world's total remaining carbon budget if we want to have a 50 per cent chance (not a guarantee - a 50 per cent chance) of meeting the climate goals we set in Paris\".</p><p> He adds: \"Lay aside for the moment the devastation caused by mining the sludgy tar sands for oil.

However, battery technology for renewables is still years away from cost competitiveness, said Mr Chen.</p><p> A significant amount of funding would be needed to upgrade the electricity grid to accommodate more renewables. But most electricity markets in South-east Asia are still regulated and operated by a single, state-owned grid operator, which may not be able to generate the funding necessary without private-sector investments, he added. </p><p> According to a report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2022, more than 70 per cent of grid investments in South-east Asia were from state-owned enterprises, but greater involvement by the private sector is needed if greenhouse gas emissions are to be cut rapidly and the global temperature rise kept to 1.5 deg C.</p><p> While policy changes, such as in Vietnam, may allow foreign investments for the grid, this could still be challenging without a clear regulatory environment and revenue framework for investors, said Mr Chen.</p><p> Dr Rishikesh Ram Bhandary, a climate finance expert at the Boston University Global Development Policy Centre, said another difficulty in mobilising private-sector investments for renewables would be that it is still profitable to invest in fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. </p><p> The IEA report noted that for every dollar invested in renewable power in South-east Asia in recent years, another dollar was also invested in fossil fuel generation. </p><p> This means investments in renewables are \"heavily reliant\" on policy incentives and stable regulatory frameworks. In South-east Asia, the cost of capital is also high, which has a direct bearing on profitability, Dr Bhandary added.</p><p> Lack of international climate financeBut climate finance, channelled from rich nations to poorer ones to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions, has also not been sufficient. </p><p> At the COP27 conference held in Egypt in November, a report released by the United Nations high-level expert group on climate finance found that developing countries would need to spend US$2.4 trillion (S$3.26 trillion) a year on climate-related issues by 2030, underscoring a need to scale up climate finance exponentially to help them.  </p><p> But developed nations once again failed to make good on their US$100 billion target, which was meant to be delivered annually to developing countries from 2020 to 2025 to help them green their economies and adapt to climate change. </p><p> Instead, they emphasised the role of private finance in helping to increase the overall scale of climate finance. </p><p> Dr Bhandary, the climate finance expert, said that not fulfilling the US$100 billion pledge not only impacts the amount of finance available to South-east Asian countries but also curtails the \"catalytic role\" played by public finance from these countries in mobilising private finance. </p><p> Due to the lack of financing, the Climate Investment Funds' (CIF) Renewable Energy Integration programme -- an investment programme that will help developing countries transform their power grids to carry a larger share of renewables -- still has a number of countries on its waitlist, unable to marshal the funds to carry out works.</p><p> The programme, which was introduced at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November 2021, was extended to Columbia, Fiji, Kenya, Mali and Ukraine, each of which received a toolbox of financial instruments and technical assistance. </p><p> Each of these countries was invited to submit an investment plan. Examples of projects that were eligible for financing included developing battery storage solutions or investing in grid interconnectors to integrate various regional markets.</p><p> Another five countries, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia and Turkey, were also invited to develop their investment plans, and were then placed on the waitlist for the next phase of the programme.</p><p> Giving an update to The Sunday Times in December, CIF's clean energy lead Daniel Morris said that the five countries will remain on the waitlist until more financial resources -- from government donors and the private sector -- are made available.</p><p> Stressing the difficulties in pooling more finance due to competing demands, Mr Morris said his team remains \"hopeful\" that the resources would come through for them to implement all their investment plans.</p><p> \"But even if we aren't able to gather more finance, the hope is that the exercise of undertaking an investment plan will set these countries up for success if other types of resources become available, or if they decide to divert domestic resources for their grid upgrades,\" he added.</p><p> Financing the Asean gridWithout sufficient finance being channelled to upgrade domestic electricity grids, some experts are sceptical that these countries would be in a position to export clean energy via the Asean grid, at least in the next few years. </p><p> The Asean grid would connect the national power grids of the current 10 member countries to enable them to trade and transfer electricity to one another.</p><p> Dr Philip Andrews-Speed, a senior principal fellow at the National University of Singapore's Energy Studies Institute, said doing so would allow for more efficient use of resources. For instance, joint investments in transmission lines could save countries from having to tap their own expenditure in creating new power generation capacity. Clean energy can also be transmitted from areas with surplus energy to areas with a deficit, which brings about energy security, he added.</p><p> But the Global Wind Energy Council's South-east Asia taskforce chair Mark Hutchinson said the costs of building long transmission lines between countries could be very expensive, and that it would make more economic sense for countries to build their own domestic renewable energy projects before turning to exports. </p><p> \"Most countries, at the moment, are really focusing on meeting their own climate targets and are not likely to export a significant share of their clean energy until maybe well into the 2030s,\" he added.</p><p> To share electricity between countries, transmission lines could either go through a few countries, as with the Laos hydropower project that exports energy to Singapore via transmission lines in Thailand and Malaysia, or electricity could be transmitted directly from one country to another via subsea cables.  </p><p> Both options are very expensive, and would depend on the amount of electricity being transmitted, noted Mr Hutchinson. </p><p> Currently, the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project exports only 100MW of renewable energy to Singapore, which is at a very small scale that does not require any infrastructural upgrades, he added.</p><p> The 100MW accounts for about 1.5 per cent of Singapore's peak electricity demand in 2020 and could power around 144,000 four-room Housing Board flats for a year.</p><p> But when infrastructure upgrades are needed, the question of who pays for them becomes critical, said Mr Hutchinson. </p><p> Grid upgrades in Thailand and Malaysia would be needed to deliver large-scale renewable energy from Laos, but these upgrades would also provide stability to the Thai and Malaysian grids. Allocating the significant costs of grid upgrades between the sellers (for example, Laos), the transit countries (Thailand and Malaysia) and the buyer (Singapore) can get very complicated, Mr Hutchinson noted. </p><p> However, investment in transboundary transmission lines has generally been low, said Dr Andrews-Speed. </p><p> \"A large proportion of lines are from hydroelectric dams in Laos to neighbouring countries, mainly Thailand. These are generally based on bilateral power purchase agreements linked to specific dam projects,\" he added. </p><p> And even within archipelagic countries such as Indonesia, investment in transmission lines between islands has also been low.  </p><p> The funding for transmission lines would have to come from the grid company for one or both of the countries involved, or the developer of a power project who wants to sell the power. </p><p> Many Asean grid companies are generally state-owned, however, and, in some cases, lack the financial capacity or willingness to invest in more infrastructure.</p><p> To help prop up the Asean grid, the IEEFA's energy, economy and policy specialist Putra Adhiguna said that Singapore, with its higher gross domestic product per capita and aggressive push to decarbonise its industries, has the ability to pay a premium for its green energy when importing from neighbouring countries.</p><p> \"That way, countries which have the potential, but not yet the domestic demand to drive their renewable deployment to an economic scale, can export to countries like Singapore to begin with,\" Mr Adhiguna added. </p><p> This, he said, would provide these countries with the \"strategic opportunity\" to kick-start their domestic renewable energy production, which they can leverage in the longer run to green their economies and meet their climate targets. </p><p> This story was published with the support of Climate Tracker's COP27 Climate Justice Fellowship, which the writer was awarded to cover COP27.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-D31558R</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:673Y-N751-JCF2-844N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

In addition to actively fundraising for its latest fund, the programme is also recruiting its seventh cohort, which is set to begin in October. </p><p><br/>In an interview with e27, Accelerating Asia Co-Founder and General Partner Amra Naidoo shares her excitement for the upcoming cohort. 'I was happy when we got our first cohort, and now we're on to seventh,' she says. 'Every cohort is a milestone [for us].' <br/>The regional tech startup ecosystem might recognise Accelerating Asia as a programme that focuses on the Pre-Series A stage companies, defined as those with a level of traction, revenue, and active customers. These companies may have also had investors abroad; they join the programme with the goal of 'taking things to the next level.' <br/>Accelerating Asia is also known for making milestones such as having 40 per cent of the companies in its cohorts led by female founders. <br/>'We would never drop that standard or change the criteria for anyone,' Naidoo says. 'When we talk about that 40 per cent number, a lot of work has been done in the backend to create a culture where, hopefully, female founders would think of Accelerating Asia as a good investor they want to work with. It comes down to things like our Code of Conduct.' <br/>Every individual - from mentor to founder to investor- who is working with the organisation has to follow this code of conduct religiously. 'We're strict about blacklisting people, not engaging them to work with us again. It is about being upfront with our values. I think that helps to create this kind of environment where, hopefully, lots of different types of people feel comfortable coming to us,' Naidoo elaborates. <br/>In this feature article, she explains in detail the kind of company culture that Accelerating Asia built to support its mission. We divided the article into three parts: <br/>Saving the world, one startup at a time \u2014 where we focus on the history of the organisation and how it came up with its structure and mission Enabling innovation \u2014 a focus on the values that they implement and how they are using them to run their operations Supporting the ecosystem \u2014 a look into what the organisation offers to its portfolio companies, including how they measure performance <br/>Also Read: Meet the first batch of startups that received investment from Accelerating Asia's US$20M Fund II[1] <br/>Saving the world, one startup at a time <br/>The journey of Accelerating Asia began in 2018. At the time, Naidoo and co-founder Craig Bristol Dixon were running an accelerator programme for a corporate when they found out that it was shutting down, and they had to figure out what to do next. <br/>'We felt that there was a need for an independent accelerator programme that has high quality and that is serving a specific stage of a company. It is what we have been doing with the corporate accelerator, but not in the fullest sense. So that's essentially how we started thinking about Accelerating Asia,' she explains. <br/>When they first began, one of the first things that they needed to figure out was the revenue model of the business. 'In the early days, we gave ourselves a little timeline to see if we could get something off the ground. We consulted a lot of industry professionals. We spoke to the Singapore government to other VCs. We spoke to the JFDI team, who is infamous in the region for their work starting up that accelerator programme, just to see what we needed to do to make this sustainable on its own. As I'm sure you're aware, it's just really difficult to have an independent programme.' <br/>Following the research, the co-founders came up with three business lines: <br/> The accelerator The consulting/partnership arm The venture arm <br/>These three business lines enable Accelerating Asia to balance the commercial and idealistic sides of the business. When starting up Accelerating Asia, the co-founders knew their passion lies in working with startups. Still, they were aware of the challenge that they were facing: how to remain financially independent and sustainable as it is 'really hard' to charge the startups 'enough money to continue a high-quality programme.' <br/>'That is where the second part of our business came in, which is essentially a consulting or a partnerships arm. We run startup programmes for partners, be it governments, universities, or multinationals. That is the early revenue stream for Accelerating Asia before it evolved into a fund,' says Naidoo. <br/>'We naturally started thinking, 'Well, if we are working with all these startups, we should invest in them too.' That's essentially how Accelerating Asia ventures, the third part of what we do, was set up. Looking back on it now, it all made sense to do it the way we did. But we essentially started three businesses around the same time, and it was a lot of work.' <br/>Naidoo admits that running these three businesses can be quite challenging. 'They can be competing in terms of how much time it takes you. But we found that they all create a really strong ecosystem, and they all feed into each other.' <br/>Also Read: How the 'Paris agreement' for plastic is accelerating climate justice in SEA[2] <br/>Despite its importance, the commercial side of the business was not the only thing that Naidoo and Dixon set up at the beginning of their journey. Beyond that, Naidoo and Dixon also figured out the values they wanted to promote through Accelerating Asia. <br/>The co-founders believe that entrepreneurs are one of humanity's greatest catalysts for positive change -this becomes the guiding principle for the organisation. <br/>'Craig was the one who put it down into such a beautiful sentence. And then our marketing team had a go at it and made it even better. It embodies everything that we're trying to do at Accelerating Asia for [Dixon], he's spoken a lot about how there are some entrepreneurs out there that could be working on some incredible things. If they just had the resources and the support, they could make [their impact] a reality and change the world,' Naidoo elaborates. <br/>'I'm approaching it from a different perspective. I was working for UN Women for quite a while, working with a lot of social entrepreneurs. I got to see so many different business models and thought that if we could make these more scalable and sustainable and use technology as a tool to do that The change and the impact that you could make could be amazing. So, we arrived at the same thing around the same time, but just different ways of getting there.' <br/>I asked Naidoo how far along does she think they are in this journey of fulfilling their mission? As a response, she believes they are still at the 'very beginning' of their journey. In our conversation, she also mentions how she was inspired by the works of other organisations in the industries -and the challenges faced by the community. <br/>'The tech and investment space is not exactly known for its diversity or inclusiveness. We want to be different or even more than that, to set a standard for what it could be in this region and what it could look like.' <br/>Enabling innovation  <br/>With the level of complexity that their operations can have, there is a need for Accelerating Asia to be methodical in how they are running things. The organisation believes that it can achieve this by implementing a culture that promotes the values they live by. Those three values are: <br/>Flexibility Trust in disagreement Clarity <br/>The first value they implement is flexibility. 'We've always been quite flexible regarding where and how you work and how many hours you work. We don't have any set office hours in the organisation. We do have team meetings and things like that; as long as you make it to those team meetings [then it is fine]. If you're a night person and want to work in the evening, go ahead. If you're a super early morning bird, you can do that too,' Naidoo elaborates. <br/>An example of an initiative they implement is a Flexi Friday, where team members are not allowed to host meetings or events during the day. They would also be freed from the expectation to answer messages immediately on Fridays, enabling them to travel for the weekend and return to the office on Mondays. <br/>'All of this is based on trust. The whole idea is that work should be something that you enjoy coming to; hopefully, you can thrive and find your flow that's the kind of environment we wanted to create.' <br/>When the COVID-19 pandemic strikes, this flexibility that the team has implemented allows them to adjust and transition to remote working smoothly -they would even attribute their survival during the crisis to their ability to be flexible. <br/>Also Read: Accelerating Asia to launch Fund II in H2, ups investment size to US$250K[3] <br/>Another value that they implement is related to handling conflict and disagreement in the team. <br/>'We have a disagree-and-move-on policy. Everybody in the organisation can be very opinionated. That's why we hire people to have their opinions about certain things. But there has to be a point where we just have to decide. And so, even if you disagree with something, the decisions must be made, and then you move on,' Naidoo says. 'There are so many different things we've tried to implement; we're constantly testing different things and frameworks.' <br/>Another aspect I am curious about is how the team members work with each other, as some companies in the startup ecosystem are known to have a unique approach to it. Some are more project-oriented, while some are more team-oriented. In the case of Accelerating Asia, the first thing that one needs to know is that the company is being divided into three divisions that work on the different aspects of the business: The accelerator, the fund management, and the partnerships. <br/>The accelerator is certainly the core of the activities in the company. Still, there is the fund management division that works closely with the LPs and the partnership division, which works on business development relationships and partner programme executions. <br/>Despite these divisions, Naidoo points out that there are team members whose role sits across these three different areas. 'For example, I'm more on the operational and administration sides, but much of my work also sits across the fund as the general partner. Whereas Craig is more on the portfolio and the startups as well as sitting across the fund.' <br/>The team managed the role of its members using a matrix approach or swim lane diagram, which Naidoo sees as helpful in clarifying who is responsible for what, especially when many projects are happening with competing levels of priorities. <br/>'We have just started testing out something called the DICE framework[4]. When you're running a project, who is the Decider? Who are the people that just need to be Informed of the project but don't need to be actively involved in it? And then who are you bringing into the team to Consult on certain things, from marketing to legal? And then who are the team members Executing?' she explains each acronym. <br/>'That helped us get some clarity internally, especially when you've got lots of different people doing lots of different things.' <br/>In terms of the tools that they are using, Accelerating Asia relies on 'the classics' such as Slack and Google Drive. <br/>Supporting the ecosystem <br/>So, what kind of support does Accelerating Asia give to its startups? Naidoo gives the answers by explaining what sets them apart from a similar organisations. <br/>Also Read: A snapshot of the 11 startups joining Accelerating Asia's 4th cohort[5] <br/>'Our accelerated programme is not the typical theory-based programme. We are very hands-on. We're probably better described as hands-on investors rather than an accelerator programme because people just have preconceived ideas about what accelerator programmes are. So, our team are there for the startups.' <br/>In the three months that a startup is involved with Accelerating Asia, the organisation assists them in hiring, restructuring the company, and legal matters such as contracts and agreements. They also assist the startups in marketing. fundraising, and even storytelling. <br/>'We tend to work very closely with the founders themselves. But we have also worked with some of the smaller teams with the senior leadership team because that's just as important at that stage,' says Naidoo. <br/>As investors, Accelerating Asia does not set specific performance targets for its portfolio companies. However, they still expect to see growth. To ensure this, following graduation from the programme, they will catch up with the startups through phone calls every six months to see if they can help with anything. <br/>'During the programme, we're much more hands-on, and the feedback circle is quicker than six months. We're seeing them almost every day, so it's about creating an environment where they can trust you with any problems that they're having. If there is a slowdown in growth, we can see why and what's going on there and help them as appropriate.' <br/>But what happens if a portfolio company fails to perform? What actions will the organisation take to prevent and handle that? To answer these big questions, Naidoo begins by explaining the qualitative and quantitative aspects of measuring a portfolio company's performance. <br/>'The quantitative side is easier. We look at the company before they apply for the programme, and we have a certain set of metrics that we look at, things like monthly recurring revenue, user retention, and growth rates. We track them for every month of the programme until graduation and then every six months after that to see growth,' she elaborates. <br/>'The qualitative aspect includes things like new partnerships or media coverage that they have, or growth of the founders themselves. Several founders were recently announced as Forbes 30 under 30. So, it is the other things that signal growth in the company and of the founders themselves,' she adds. <br/>With all that they get to offer to startups, how does Accelerating Asia promote their works to the startup ecosystem? <br/>The organisation's website is certainly the starting point for learning about its mission and how to apply to its programmes, but Accelerating Asia also runs webinars and events to help promote its activities, such as a monthly open house session at the Draper Startup House in Singapore. <br/>Also Read: Accelerating Asian IPO markets: How long can the initial public offering boom last?[6] <br/>'When we do travel around the region, we also have several startup events that we run. We're always hopping around so they can get in contact with us. When we are in a recruitment cycle as we are right now, and applications are open, this is the best time to approach us. Just come and talk to us, drop by the office and things like that,' Naidoo says. <br/>'Outside the recruitment cycle, it's better [for startups] to put themselves down in the pre-application. Because they can start the application process, we can keep tabs on them and keep in contact with them.' <br/>Last words <br/>In an ecosystem where most accelerator programmes are affiliated with a corporate -from telco companies to banks- an independent programme has an opportunity to stand out and provide a unique experience for its participating startups. Most importantly, to stand out from the rest, an independent accelerator programme has to have a mission. <br/>As explained by Naidoo at the beginning of her conversation with e27, there is a certain 'homework' that Accelerating Asia needs to do when setting up its organisation. It had to figure out a way to support itself and be sustainable as a business. In addition to that, they have to set up a system that can help support its mission. <br/>So far, if we look at the organisation's portfolio companies, many of them are imbued with missions that align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), from quality healthcare and education to employment and economic growth. While many of their companies, including Dana and Waitrr, may not secure unicorn status yet, they are experiencing steady growth. They are working in a field that creates an impact -in addition to making money. <br/>This is not the first time that values such as flexibility and the willingness to disagree come out as key values that enable an organisation to stay resilient and grow. These are some of the traits that are often associated with the startup ecosystem. Still, it is always fascinating to see how each organisation implements it in their unique flavour. <br/><br/>\u2014 <br/>Fundraising or preparing your startup for fundraising?

For example, natural gas is a fossil fuel, but is considered the cleanest one as it produces less planet-warming gas when burned, compared with coal.</p><p> So some financiers may argue that gas-fired plants could still be considered \"green\" if they are built in place of coal-fired plants.</p><p> \"Fossil fuels remain the cheapest way to generate electricity in many parts of Asean,\" said a spokesman for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p><p> \"The shift to cleaner energy sources will need to be progressive - for example, by switching to relatively less emissions-intensive fuels such as natural gas, which can be a bridge towards a more sustainable energy system.\"</p><p> Earlier this year, an MAS-convened task force issued a proposed set of guidelines - called a taxonomy - to help Singapore-based financial institutions identify green activities.</p><p> Of the proposed definitions, a \"traffic-light\" system was suggested to help classify activities as green, yellow (transition) or red (unsustainable).</p><p> The task force recently concluded public consultation on its proposed approach, and will next focus on developing criteria and quantifiable thresholds for green and transition activities, the MAS spokesman said. \"Providing clarity to the market is a key enabler to scale up green finance in Asia and globally,\" she added.</p><p> But while financial institutions here step up their lending to support the energy transition in the region, climate activists say these entities must also cut off funding for fossil-based projects.</p><p> Said Ms Norly Grace Mercado, Asia regional director for climate activist group 350.org: \"If the banks truly value the welfare of communities... they would see that fossil infrastructure often infringes upon the very rights of these communities.\"</p><p> For example, the health of those living near coal plants would be affected by pollution, she said.</p><p> \"Energy is a necessity for everyone, and the climate justice we demand is a fast and just recovery towards 100 per cent community-led renewable energy for all,\" she said. \"This means no new fossil fuel projects, and consulting the communities on their needs.\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Renewable energy can also provide more energy security for communities. A solar panel hooked up outside a home, for instance, can power bulbs or appliances in a home disconnected from the national grid.</p><p> The Bicol region in the Philippines is vulnerable to typhoons, which can knock out power in some areas for months, said Mr Jose Chito Milante, an engineer at the Municipal Planning and Development Office in the town of San Jose in Camarines Sur province.</p><p> During those times, people turn to alternatives like diesel generators. \"We are trying to invest in solar electricity, at least in our major streets. Solar-powered street lights are very reliable after typhoons,\" said Mr Milante.</p><p> Singapore firm Third Wave Power is developing technology that provides rural communities with electricity, such as solar-powered bulbs, as well as software that allows villagers to use solar energy on a pay-per-use model.</p><p> This means that they would not have to pay the hefty upfront costs of installing the solar systems.</p><p> Mr V.S. Hariharan, the firm's co-founder and chief executive, said the firm works with microfinancing institutions to provide these options for off-grid communities.</p><p> Compared with kerosene generators or candles, solar-powered appliances are affordable with no operating costs, safe from smoke or pollution-related issues, and will allow students and adults to study or work at night to supplement their income, Mr Hariharan said.</p><p> He added: \"The fact that solar is also good for the climate is a by-product for these situations.\"</p><p> Mr Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser for global climate adaptation policy at environmental group WWF-Singapore, said the climate crisis cannot be resolved by any country alone.</p><p> \"Innovations that enable citizens to make the right decisions are vital. But there are limitations to what an individual can achieve on her own,\" he said.</p><p> \"With several Asean countries at different stages in transitioning to renewable energy due to economic and infrastructure challenges, political collaboration on strategic initiatives has to take place to enable this change to occur.\"</p><p>\u00b7 This report was written and produced as part of a media skills development programme delivered by Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Remote working is here to stay, and here's what you need to know. The year is 2016. I had just moved to Metro Manila, one of the densest metropolitans in the world with a population of just under 13 million in a land area of 619 square kilometers. With this many people, a typical daily commute from Quezon City to the bustling business district of Ortigas meant spending forty minutes in traffic from my house to the closest train station, thirty minutes to fall in line and squeeze myself inside a packed train, twenty minutes to get to the station closest to my work, and another twenty minutes to walk to the office. </p><p>By the time I arrive, I would already be exhausted from the mere act of getting there on time, and often drenched in sweat after spending two hours inside packed vehicles under the blinding tropical heat. This means, a typical workday for me consisted of nine hours at the office and four more hours on the road. This is just a conservative estimate as the 12-hour workday I illustrated operates under three important assumptions: that I don't spend more of my hours doing extra work, that the weather is being cooperative, and that our often unreliable third world transport system isn't clunking out. I was not alone in this predicament. People all over Metro Manila have to deal with the exact same problems, while those in other similarly dense cities around the world like Mumbai and Dhaka have to contend with their own versions of the same harrowing story. To be able to work remotely cuts back four full hours from my workday and relieves me from the violence and terror that a tedious commute system entails. With remote working, not only am I able to perform better, but conversely, the companies I work for get to maximise my time and energy better, rendering a mutually beneficial partnership between employer and employee.Environmental impact of remote workOf all the things modern society has to contend with, the one thing we cannot deny is the impact of carbon emissions to our climate. With climate justice taking on an increasingly important role in how we shape society, it is important to recalibrate how we operate in our daily lives to mitigate the effects of climate change. A recent report from the Carbon Trust found that greater adoption of home working could save around 3 million tons of carbon emissions in the UK alone[1]. Because of our growing knowledge on the impact we have towards the natural environment, it is likely that organisations big and small will continue to push for remote working as a means to reduce our carbon footprint. In the US, the city of San Antonio, Texas is encouraging businesses to authorise more flexible working arrangements for employees such as getting them to work a four-day week (instead of five) to decrease their time on the road and improve the city's air quality. On the other hand, the Philippines has passed a recent law that allows employers in the private sector to offer remote working and promote people's capacity to earn without the need to exhaust their valuable resources and energy in commuting. These initiatives are mere examples of how institutional change are being enforced across multiple parts of the world to better accommodate the increasingly precarious state that our natural environment finds itself in. Not only is it important for governments to implement these solutions in the labor force framework, but it is becoming increasingly necessary. As such, we can realistically project that remote working as a solution to this problem will only take on a more prominent role as the decade unfolds. Not just as a trend, but as a norm, remote working coupled with tools and technologies is a viable and impactful solution to the pressing problems that come with climate change.Business continuity planning in times of crisisBusiness continuity planning (BCP) is the process of creating a system of prevention and recovery efforts from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets are protected and are able to function quickly in the event of a disaster. These disasters can span from anything between situations of environmental calamity like typhoons, to less common predicaments like concerns surrounding health and other related issues. With global threats and health risks becoming more and more prominent, there is an acute awareness among big and small companies that preemptive measures and proactive systems must be in place in order to err on the side of caution. Such is the case in Singapore where, due to certain public health risks, many multinational companies are encouraging remote and flexible working arrangements[2] in order to better protect the their employees while still managing the daily grind that comes with operating a business Given these developments, business continuity planning is more important than ever as it helps strike a balance between securing the health and safety of employees while at the same time, making sure that the company gets to continue rendering products and services for its consumers. Remote working is a great way to circumvent these problems and equip companies with a formidable business continuity planning system. Given the right set of tools, a lot of businesses especially in the tech ecosystem will be able to function normally with the help of remote working despite certain public threats.The right set of toolsThere are many technologies out there that can help a company promote business continuity planning and provide ample tools for remote working. One of the greatest markers of a powerful tool when it comes to effective remote working is an integrated system that combines all conversations, documents, and meetings in one seamless platform. Because remote working means one's workforce is somewhat scattered and fragmented and often across multiple time zones, the best way for it to work is by streamlining and simplifying operations that can only be achieved in an effective integrated model. One of the best examples of these technologies is Lark, the new unified communications and collaborations solution for teams of all sizes. With tools such as messaging, calendar, video conferencing, and docs all synced in real-time and under one platform, Lark is a great example of a technology that can help one's business ease into a remote working environment. Not only that, but you can also install third-party tools into the platform that you may need in order to function as you would in an office-setting.

But some others have labelled it a total hogwash and \"epic failure\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> What are they really concerned about? It boils down to two words: climate justice. This is a concept that views climate change as an ethical and political issue involving equality, human rights, collective rights and historical responsibility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The grassroots movement began in 2000, when the first Climate Justice Summit took place in the Netherlands alongside the UN climate change talks. It seeks to draw attention and give voice to those least responsible for climate change, but who bear the brunt of its impact - usually the poor, disempowered and marginalised.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In 2002, a coalition of NGOs which includes Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and Third World Network, established the Bali Principles of Climate Justice that defined climate change from a human rights and environmental justice perspective.</p><p> Since then, a growing army of activists, including former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, have campaigned for the voices of these people to be heard, and for developed nations to help minimise the climate impact on these communities.</p><p>Under the Paris agreement, targets are not binding but countries are obliged to declare, communicate and maintain their targets. There is no \"penalty\" as such, but countries that do not keep their commitments will lose credibility and international standing, which may impact trade and diplomatic relations.</p><p> Some within this movement argue that Paris has failed on two counts. First, that even though the treaty aims to limit warming to under 2 deg C, with a view to further cap it under 1.5 deg C, it does not outline concrete or legally binding targets for countries to get there.</p><p>Britain-based magazine New Internationalist, in calling the Paris agreement an \"epic fail on a planetary scale\", pointed out that pledges made by countries, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, fall short of what is needed and is not consistent with the latest science. Critics also take issue with the fact that the deal requires no emission reductions from countries before 2020.</p><p> The second complaint, held particularly by civic groups in India, is the lack of mention of \"carbon space\" or carbon budget. These activists believe emission limits should be set for countries - less for developed nations, more for developing ones - so that the world remains within the safe limit of warming.</p><p> While both arguments have their merit, the reality is more complex.</p><p> The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997 with participation from 192 parties and which is in place till 2020, has demonstrated that legally binding targets are ineffective because enforcement is weak and countries (such as Canada) could simply drop out to avoid penalties. International UN treaties, where nations agree to a punitive framework, are simply no longer politically achievable.</p><p> Under the Paris agreement, targets are not binding, but countries are obliged to declare, communicate and maintain their targets. There is no \"penalty\" as such, but countries that do not keep their commitments will lose credibility and international standing, which may impact trade and diplomatic relations.</p><p> The desire to allocate specific emission limits to countries is not realistic either, because no politician will be able to get such a plan approved by its domestic citizens or Parliaments.</p><p> The next best approach is to have voluntary targets that are transparent and open to public scrutiny and pressure. This is exactly what the Paris agreement offers, with options to review these targets every five years and to ramp up cooperation in areas such as finance, forest protection and technology transfer.</p><p> More importantly, the Paris agreement is a big deal because it is a powerful show of global willingness to transition into a cleaner, more sustainable era. It sends a clear message - particularly to corporates - that the world has recognised climate change as a serious threat and has set out pathways to tackle it.</p><p> The fact is, we are - and climate justice is - better off with the Paris agreement than without it. Rather than slamming it, a more constructive response by the international community would be to encourage the process and mobilise governments and businesses to finance the infrastructure projects needed to achieve a low-carbon, more stable world.</p><p> Developing countries should view the agreement as an opportunity to embrace a path of development that leapfrogs existing inefficient and pollutive fossil fuel energy systems. Developed nations must honour their promise of providing the US$100 billion (S$141 billion) floor of financing each year to help developing countries get there.</p><p> Let's also not forget that this treaty is the hard-fought result of two decades of tough negotiations and that it went down to the wire. Speaking to reporters late on Dec 12 when the agreement was adopted, Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan shared that it was only in the wee hours of that morning that \"it all came together\", and that he \"wouldn't have taken it for granted\".</p><p> I was in Paris covering the talks and indeed, there were moments when I thought they might fail and we would leave empty-handed.</p><p> Tensions ran high on the last day, in anticipation of the final draft. After it was released, an angry activist from India denounced the agreement at a press conference, urging India's officials not to sign on to it. But as more reactions to the draft started to pour in, it became clear that the French presidency, thanks to masterful diplomacy, had managed to navigate countries into common \"landing zones\" so that everyone could accept the final agreement. Make no bones about it: Gaining consensus from 194 parties is nothing short of a miracle.</p><p> Even NGOs known for their tough demands gave their cautious approval. Friends of the Earth climate justice coordinator Lucy Cadena said the agreement \"marks a turning point for the balance of power\" , while Greenpeace International executive director Kumi Naidoo said of the agreement that \"the human race has joined in a common cause\".</p><p> \"%5BIT%5D is only one step on a long road... but it is progress. This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're in, but it makes the sides less steep,\" he said.</p><p> Extreme activists who describe Paris as a failure ironically chip away at the potential of the deal to bring about the very outcomes they desire. A real Paris failure would be a repetition of what happened in Copenhagen at the same summit six years ago, which would have meant an irrevocable breakdown of trust between nations. Fortunately in Paris, it was the spirit of compromise and cooperation that prevailed.</p><p> \u00b7The writer is editor of Eco-Business, an Asia-Pacific sustainable business online publication.</p><p> \u00b7From January, this column will appear on the second Friday of each month.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Representatives at the World Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) in Le Bourget, north of Paris, France, Dec 12, 2015.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-210997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HNF-WV51-JCF2-8458-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1172\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 22, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>THIRD WORLD NETWORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FRIENDS OF THE EARTH</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp;

It has created a large platform to ensure climate justice,\" he said.</p><p> The ISA, launched in 2015 by Mr Modi and then-French President Francois Hollande and headquartered in Gurugram in India, is an alliance of countries mostly located between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn that receive abundant sunshine. Attempts are on to expand this grouping to include countries outside this region.</p><p> The framework agreement of the ISA has been signed by 70 countries, including some Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) members such as Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Nigeria. The pact has been ratified by 44 countries.</p><p> The alliance aims to lower the costs of financing solar power and required technology, and to mobilise more than US$1 trillion (S$1.37 trillion) towards the deployment of 1,000GW of solar energy by 2030.</p><p> Mr Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron were named as recipients of the United Nations Environment Programme's Champions of the Earth Award last month for their policy leadership in advocating action on sustainable development and climate change.</p><p> The same event marked the inauguration of the second Indian Ocean Rim Association Renewable Energy Ministerial Meeting, and the second Global RE-Invest (Renewable Energy Investors' Meet and Expo).</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the inauguration that \"current commitments under the Paris Agreement still fall far short of the target of limiting global warming to well below 2 deg C and striving for 1.5 deg\".</p><p> \"The truth is that climate change is still running faster than we are. What is urgently needed is more ambition and more action. This International Solar Alliance represents exactly what needs to be done and represents the future,\" he added.</p><p> Mr Guterres also said he will convene a climate summit in New York in September next year to \"bring climate action to the top of the international agenda\".</p><p>India has announced ambitious renewable energy goals and committed to put in place 175GW of installed renewable energy generation capacity by 2022.</p><p> It has already installed 72.10GW of this target and has another 46GW under the implementation or bidding process.</p><p> Renewables account for 21 per cent of installed power capacity in the country. It made up for 10 per cent of the electricity mix of the country last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Indian schoolchildren with solar lamps during a renewable energy expo in New Delhi on Tuesday.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-524223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDB-7PC1-DYX4-00MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 4, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000CY8I</classCode><className>CAPSTONE INFRASTRUCTURE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ORGANIZATION OF THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221115 WIND ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS221114 SOLAR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4931 ELECTRIC &amp;

Now it is up to the ministers and senior diplomats to put in the finishing touches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The main points are known - as are the positions of the main players, whatever the shape of the final document. The United States and European Union would like some aspects of the document to be legally binding and, perhaps, in some way enforceable. But, then, that was what the 1997 Kyoto Treaty set out to do. Signatories agreed that they would cut carbon emissions by fixed amounts over agreed time frames. Unfortunately, the world's worst polluter at that time, the US, refused to ratify the treaty. Canada pulled out. China and India never acceded to the cuts. Now China has overtaken the US as the world's worst offender and carbon emissions have soared in the years since Kyoto.</p><p>COP21, as this round of talks is known in UNspeak, changed tack and this time \"nationally determined contributions\" are the norm. This simply means the countries themselves decide what they will do to prevent global warming beyond 2\u00b0Celsius. Thus, when the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 per cent from its 2005 level by 2025, it was in full knowledge that the American legislature would do everything in its power to thwart him. Not only are the lawmakers not expected to pass any enabling laws, President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>would have to use what powers he has by way of executive authority in the hope that his pledges will not be pushed to one side by the Republican-controlled Congress, as it seems to be bent on doing. Thus Mr Obama commanded a bevy of US senators to persuade the others that this time, Washington will not renege on its climate promises.</p><p>Beijing promised to increase the non-fossil fuel share of its energy mix to 20 per cent by 2030. It is also planning to introduce an emissions trading scheme in 2017. This \"cap and trade\" system will place a limit on emissions while also creating a market where companies can trade carbon allowances. This scheme will cover power stations, and steel, cement and other heavy power-consuming industries.</p><p>India unveiled a global solar alliance of 120 countries, together with France. The idea is that climate justice would be served when public financing from the industrialised nations is mobilised to deliver clean energy in the poor countries. It is a noble concept but how it will turn out remains to be seen. In the meantime, India holds on to the view that those responsible for the present state of affairs - the industrialised countries - must pay the most to mitigate the problem of global warming. Without doubt, the hardest bit is going to be financing for clean-energy projects in poor countries.</p><p>As many critics have pointed out, if all the countries kept their word scrupulously, the world is in for a temperature rise of 3\u00b0Celsius by 2100. But it would be wrong to dismiss COP21 as yet another hyped-up talkfest. What everyone has to understand is that whatever plans to mitigate the consequences of global warming are agreed upon on this occasion, it is going to be an ongoing multi-generational effort. So what the next phase of the talks needs to do is create an institutionalised framework for the tasks ahead. There should be a transparent way to verify national pledges - both on carbon emissions and on aid for the poorer countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-79690</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HJG-9821-DYX4-04W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>December 8, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000632</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp;

In return, Norway will pay Indonesia US $1 billion (S $1.3 billion).</p><p>But for the moratorium to be legally binding from its Jan 1 start date, it must be backed by a presidential decree, which has not been issued yet, the Jakarta Globe reported last week. What is more, the Civil Society Organisation Common Platform, which includes the groups Greenpeace South-east Asia and the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi), says that even if enforced, the moratorium may not protect more forested areas as claimed.</p><p>'Only 41 million hectares will be protected, but these are already categorised as conservation and protected areas,' Mr Teguh Surya, head of international liaison and climate justice at Walhi, said.</p><p>The confusion arises because there are two versions of the draft presidential decree, one submitted by the Forestry Ministry and the other by the Redd task force, appointed by the president.</p><p>The ministry's version states the moratorium should apply only to primary forests and peatlands, while the other version says secondary forests in peat areas should also be included, the Globe reported.</p><p>The Redd scheme - which some palm oil and pulp and paper firms fear would hurt their expansion plans - will kick off in Central Kalimantan.</p><p>But even before the scheme begins, complications have set in, with carbon brokers reportedly trying to manipulate the system by signing deals with provincial or district governments in East Kalimantan, Papua and Aceh.</p><p>Mr Fitrian Ardiansyah, programme director for climate and energy at World Wildlife FundIndonesia, told the Globe: 'They say, 'Sign this. For 100,000ha for Redd, you will get US $2 per hectare.' But you're not supposed to count the hectares, you count the carbon.'</p><p>Dr Dicky Simorangkir, forest programme director at The Nature Conservancy, told The Straits Times: 'People are still unsure how this works.

Everything came to a temporary standstill until the large knot of people had made their way through to the exit.</p><p>Their demands: Real action to curb climate change, and resistance to the array of vested interests of rich countries and corporations trying to undermine efforts to curb greenhouse gases, or to profit from peddling false solutions.</p><p>One banner read: 'Don't change the climate, change the system.'</p><p>Different worlds overlap inside?the cavernous Bella Centre - and the mood within both is increasingly ragged and occasionally ugly.</p><p>Rich countries are ranged against poor, and sub-groups guard their national - and often parochial - interests.

yesterday after developing countries walked out of key talks to protest against what they said was the sabotage of a climate agreement by richer nations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">African nations led the five-hour walkout, backed by the G-77 bloc of developing countries, including China and India.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Representatives from 135 countries said they refused to take part in any formal working groups until their developed counterparts gave guarantees for the future of the Kyoto Protocol, which mandates strict emissions curbs on richer nations.</p><p>Algerian delegate Kamel Djemouai told reporters that developed countries were trying to 'collapse' the entire 192-nation talks by killing 'the only legally binding instrument that exists now'.</p><p>The dispute came as the conference entered its second week, just days before more than 100 world leaders, including US President <person><nameText>Barack Obama, </nameText></person>are scheduled to arrive in Copenhagen.</p><p>United Nations climate chief Yvo de Boer tried to play it down, telling reporters: 'The vast majority of countries here want to see the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol. ?I am not aware that any countries are trying to block anything.'</p><p>Yesterday, delegates went into 'open-ended informal consultation' in the afternoon to rescue the talks amid mounting public pressure for a meaningful agreement.</p><p>Representatives from the developing nations later agreed to rejoin talks after a half-day suspension, but their walkout marked yet another reminder of the widening gap between rich and poor nations.</p><p>It also highlighted fears that closely watched efforts to hammer out a global agreement will end in failure.</p><p>Poorer developing countries, including small island states which risk losing their lands to rises in sea levels, want richer nations to commit to cuts in carbon dioxide in an amended and strengthened Kyoto Protocol.</p><p>But the European Union and other developed countries are promoting an entirely new agreement that would replace the Protocol, which expires in 2012.</p><p>They prefer a new deal that would oblige all nations to fight global warming largely because it would include the United States, which did not sign up to the Kyoto deal.</p><p>But developing countries fear a new agreement would allow rich nations to escape legally binding emissions cuts laid down in Kyoto.</p><p>A spokesman for the Climate Justice Now network said: 'Rich countries are moving the goal posts by trying to end the Kyoto Protocol rather than implementing it.</p><p>'By refusing to negotiate on Kyoto's second period, developed countries are killing Kyoto.'</p><p>Reports of secretive meetings among the richer nations have prompted developing countries to complain that rich nations are stitching up a deal behind their backs.</p><p>'We are asking for a transparent democratic and inclusive process,' Bolivian Ambassador to the UN Pablo Solon said in a statement.</p><p>'It seems negotiators are living in the Matrix, while the real negotiation is taking place...in small stealth dinners with selective guests,' he said, referring to the Hollywood blockbuster movie in which the world turns out to be a simulated reality.</p><p>He also lashed out at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for saying it would hold informal consultations based on regional participation.</p><p>'They are creating an undemocratic parallel process where they can pick and choose only some countries,' he said.</p><p>Senegalese observer Amath Pathe Sene, who is from the UN in Nairobi, agreed.</p><p>'We are here to rescue the planet, but negotiations are still focused on the interests of each country and each sub-group, rather than the interest of the planet,' he told The Straits Times.</p><p><email

Their country sits next to the world's most intense typhoon generator, a huge expanse of deep, warm ocean in the North West Pacific.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than 20 tropical storms and typhoons buffet the islands each year. But even by Philippine standards, Super Typhoon Haiyan - or Yolanda as it is locally named - is a catastrophe of epic proportions. And the effect it has had on the country's people may have been significantly worsened by the Philippine government's siphoning of funds meant for infrastructure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Haiyan's winds were greater than either the 2005 Hurricane Katrina or Tropical Cyclone Yasi that hit North Queensland in 2011. They may have been the strongest winds ever recorded to make landfall.</p><p> In the worst hit areas, the super typhoon destroyed 70 to 80 per cent of the houses and structures in its path. One can only imagine how it treated the people sheltering inside.</p><p> One stranded resident told a journalist the hurricane aftermath resembled an apocalyptic horror film. It's estimated the human toll in one city alone will reach 10,000.</p><p> Haiyan is now considered the most destructive natural disaster ever in the country's history.</p><p> Few people realise the Philippine islands are home to almost 100 million people, making it the 12th most populated country in the world. The vast majority live in the regional provinces outside the highly urbanised capital of Metro Manila.</p><p> Still, little news is coming from the countryside of the central Philippines, the region which bore the brunt of the typhoon. Entire provinces have been cut off from the country's main power grid.</p><p> It's an eerie silence.</p><p> In the hours before the typhoon hit land, the President Benigno Aquino appeared on TV assuring the public his administration was making \"war-like\" preparations... cargo planes, helicopters, even 20 navy ships on standby. He had ordered officials, he said, to aim for zero casualties.</p><p> It's unlikely any preparation could have been sufficient to meet that goal. Nonetheless, what is estimated as an enormous loss of life - the full extent of which is still unknown - will demand answers in due course.</p><p> And when the time for such questions arrives, two political questions will no doubt loom large over this humanitarian crisis. Is this a natural disaster with an unnecessary human toll? And what is the role of climate change'</p><p> On the first: in a country where geography makes it one of the most dangerous places in the world to live, what is the role of government inaction in the tragedy'</p><p> The World Bank has previously pointed to the Philippines' government's failure to address the link between poverty and vulnerability to natural disasters. The country desperately needs investment in long-term preventive infrastructure, but the government seems committed only to a reactive approach.</p><p> It's not really about lack of money. Just as people suffer the effects of this killer typhoon further south, a political storm continues to unfold in Manila: a corruption scandal implicating members of the political elite, including President Aquino himself, who came to power in 2010 pledging to clean up patronage politics.</p><p> Conspicuously, allegations centre on the ransacking of two government funds designed to boost spending on infrastructure and poverty reduction. Money that should have gone to house vulnerable squatters and build flood protection in coastal communities has brazenly been funnelled away.</p><p> Far from being quiescent, ordinary Filipinos have had enough. In August, 100,000 people marched in Manila calling for the abolition of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (aptly renamed the \"pork barrel\" fund) which allows the President billions of pesos in discretionary (read, unaccountable) spending. No doubt, in the wake of Haiyan, these nation-wide protests will continue.</p><p> Second, the unprecedented intensity and destruction of Haiyan has already prompted political discussion at the international level. While it may have been branded by some as \"bad taste\" to politicise the recent bushfires in Australia with links to climate change, in the case of this Philippines environmental disaster things couldn't be more different.</p><p> On Monday, as news of the suffering to the south shocked the country, the Philippines Movement for Climate Justice mobilised a thousand people to march on the US Embassy in Manila, carrying banners that read \"US Dirty Energy means Our Disaster and Our Misery\".</p><p>Philippine protests about the link between killer storms and climate change have not been limited to the streets. A year ago the head of the Philippines delegation to the UN Climate Summit in Doha wept while addressing the plenary. Just days before, Typhoon Bopha had made its destructive way through the Southern Philippines, leaving over a thousand people dead, tens of thousands dislocated, and livelihoods destroyed. \"Madam chair,\" he said, \"we have never had a typhoon like Bopha, which has wreaked havoc in a part of the country that has never seen a storm like this in half a century.\"</p><p> Almost a year later to the day, with his country even more shaken by Typhoon Haiyan's human carnage, the same lead negotiator for the Philippines on Monday brought the opening session of the 2013 UN Climate Summit in Poland to its feet in a standing ovation, as he made his emotional plea on behalf of Typhoon Haiyan's victims:</p><p> \"What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness, the climate crisis is madness. We can stop this madness right here in Warsaw.\"</p><p> The unprecedented scale of Typhoon Haiyan was influenced by climate change, scientists have confirmed. Given that this is the case, the Filipino people not only urgently need a more responsive government, they may also just need more from the international community than a short-lived burst of sympathy and donations.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:stopinion@sph.com.sg\">stopinion@sph.com.sg</email></p><p>The writer is a doctoral candidate at the Institute for Democracy and Human Rights at the University of Sydney.</p><p>This article first appeared in The Conversation (theconversation.edu.au), a website which carries analyses by academics and researchers in Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1732193</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59TP-8PR1-JCF2-83GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>November 14, 2013 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;
