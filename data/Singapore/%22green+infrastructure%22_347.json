Areas of interest include power transmission and distribution, renewable energy, transportation and urban services.</p><p> The Asia-Pacific faces a \"significant infrastructure gap\" due to the demands of a rapidly urbanising population, said Christina Tan, Keppel's chief executive for fund management. </p><p> She believes that the partnership will combine AIIB's financial strength with Keppel's track record in large-scale infrastructure projects, highlighting that both have a \"longstanding relationship\". </p><p> She also referred to AIIB as \"a valued partner who has invested with Keppel across multiple fund strategies and asset classes, to address burgeoning needs\". </p><p> Headquartered in Beijing, AIIB is a multilateral development bank focused on developing Asia, that has been described by some as \"China's answer to the World Bank\". It provides long-term capital through both debt and equity financing.</p><p> Rajat Misra, a senior executive at AIIB, said that the partnership reflects its \"continued commitment to partnering with leading institutions to finance infrastructure that is green, technology-enabled and regionally connected\". </p><p> He noted: \"We look forward to expanding our collaboration to support resilient and forward-looking infrastructure across the Asia-Pacific.\" </p><p> In Keppel's latest annual report, chief executive Loh Chin Hua noted that infrastructure \"remains a highly attractive asset class, providing stability and resilience to investors\". </p><p> He added: \"The infrastructure market is poised for significant growth, driven by rapid digitalisation and the energy transition. As a global asset manager with deep operating capabilities in sustainability and connectivity solutions, Keppel is strategically positioned to capitalise on these transformative opportunities, to create value for our limited partners and shareholders.\"</p><p> As at end-2024, Keppel's infrastructure funds under management stood at S$19 billion. Its portfolio includes energy and environmental assets, as well as digital infrastructure such as the Bifrost Cable System, the world's first subsea cable system directly connecting Singapore to the west coast of North America. </p><p> The partnership with AIIB is not expected to have any material impact on Keppel's earnings per share for the current financial year.</p><p> Keppel shares ended Wednesday flat at S$7.40.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Christina Tan, Keppel's chief executive for fund management, signed the deal with Rajat Misra, senior executive of AIIB.

The artificial intelligence-ready facility, with a gross floor area of approximately 40,000 square metres, is located within the Jurong East Data Centre Cluster. This is DayOne's first data centre in the Republic.</p><p> The facility will be fully powered by renewable energy through a power purchase agreement with Sembcorp Power. DayOne is also partnering the National University of Singapore to pilot on-site solid oxide fuel cell power generation.</p><p> Hydrogen could supply half of the Republic's power needs by 2050, according to the National Hydrogen Strategy released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry in 2022.</p><p> Responding to queries from The Business Times, DayOne said they invested S$350 million to develop the data centre, and expect to generate over 200 jobs from the facility.</p><p>DayOne was one of four data centre operators selected by the Singapore Economic Development Board and Infocomm Media Development Authority for the pilot Data Centre -- Call for Application (DC-CFA) exercise in 2023.</p><p> The other data centres selected for the DC-CFA were Equinix, Microsoft, and a tie-up between AirTrunk and ByteDance.</p><p>DayOne was formerly the international arm of Chinese data centre firm GDS.

Its first project, Sentosa's now-defunct Volcano Theme Park, marked the beginning of a long and growing commitment to the city-state. Thirty-three years on, ChinaConstruction (South Pacific) Development Co Pte Ltd (CCDC) has firmly established itself as a key player in Singapore's urban story, credited with building 82,691 homes, major national infrastructure, and a reputation for quality, safety and sustainability. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now one of Singapore's leading contractors with the highest Building and Construction Authority (BCA) builder grade (A1) and over 280 industry awards, CCDC's growth has closely tracked Singapore's development. Beyond the numbers, however, the company measures success by the lives and communities shaped by its work. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> From its early days, CCDC has responded to Singapore's priorities. After its private residential debut in 1994, the company swiftly moved into the public housing space, winning its first HDB project in Bukit Batok that same year. Since then, it has delivered 48,984 HDB flats and 33,707 private homes. Today, one in 20 people here lives in a home built by CCDC. </p><p> Beyond housing, the company has extended its reach across the built environment, from educational institutions, commercial centres and healthcare facilities to transport infrastructure and even water management. Key milestones include the construction of Republic Polytechnic's Woodlands campus (2003-2006), which featured varied structural designs; the Canberra MRT Station (2015-2019), a technically challenging project that earned multiple safety and design awards; and the Tuas Water Reclamation Plant, its first foray into water infrastructure. </p><p> The developer's current portfolio includes high-profile, complex projects like Bukit Canberra, an integrated sports and community hub, and CanningHill Piers mixed development, its first large-scale, high-end project. </p><p> Responding to changing aspirationsCCDC's steady growth reflects not just Singapore's development needs, but also the evolving aspirations of its people. Singaporeans today are placing greater emphasis on quality of life, sustainability, and smart living, moving beyond traditional goals like material success or homeownership. This shift has created stronger demand for thoughtfully designed technology-enabled spaces that enhance everyday living in a modern urban environment. </p><p> This is visible in projects such as Oasis Terraces, a lushly vegetated waterfront hub in Punggol that integrates healthcare, retail, residential and transport within a green ecosystem. The development received acclaim locally and abroad, including an award at the World Architecture Festival.</p><p>CCDC has also been an early adopter of green building standards. It has built more than 70 BCA Green Mark-certified projects since 2006, many of which exceed minimum regulatory requirements. These include green rooftops and innovative natural lighting systems, all designed to minimise environmental impact while improving user comfort. </p><p> By prioritising and practising Green Mark building standards, CCDC proactively implements environment friendly construction methodologies, materials and systems.</p><p> Harnessing technology for transformationKey to CCDC's growth has been its push to modernise construction through technology. As early as 2014, it set up a dedicated Building Information Modelling (BIM) team and today deploys over 200 BIM specialists across its projects. The team works on full-scale 2D to 6D models to enable more precise planning and resource management, as it seeks to \"build twice and build wise\".</p><p> On the prefabrication front, CCDC has led the local adoption of Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction (PPVC) and Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DfMA). Its Lake Grande project was Singapore's first reinforced concrete condominium using PPVC, significantly reducing build time and site waste. At Bulim Square, another ongoing project, the company is employing an advanced drilling robot, prefabricated MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) modules, and an integrated digital management platform. </p><p> The drilling robot showcased its precision and efficiency, completing complex tasks with minimal human intervention, thus significantly reducing labour costs and project timelines. According to CCDC, these technologies are not just about speed, they support higher build quality, better safety outcomes and reduced carbon emissions.</p><p> The company is also piloting smart micro-grid systems and battery energy storage technologies, while exploring AI-assisted inspection and construction automation. These initiatives align with Singapore's Smart Nation and Green Plan goals. </p><p> Investing in peopleCCDC's belief in building well extends to its people. With over 1,600 employees in Singapore, the company places strong emphasis on local hiring, skills development and workplace inclusion. Today, 94 per cent of its core management team are Singaporeans or permanent residents. </p><p> To equip its staff with the right qualifications and skills, the company implements a comprehensive annual training plan that includes both internal and external programmes. These initiatives aim to help employees stay current with industry standards and effectively support the increasing demands of CCDC's construction projects. The company also offers dual career tracks for professional and leadership development. </p><p>CCDC's active emphasis on safety and quality is also supported through dedicated training sessions, interactive site activities, and internal knowledge-sharing platforms like the \"EasyLearn\" series.</p><p> Community at the coreLooking beyond the bottom line, CCDC has invested heavily in building communities. This includes social outings for migrant workers, such as a recent Gardens by the Bay trip in partnership with The Salvation Army, and friendly badminton tournaments that encourage camaraderie and inclusion on site. </p><p> At Riviera MRT station, one of CCDC's ongoing projects, a vibrant community mural now brightens the space, featuring 18 artworks created by young artists from Greendale Primary, Horizon Primary, and the Punggol Shore neighbourhood. The company's commitment to community care extends even after construction is completed. Its Building Service Centres, for instance, handle post-handover support for HDB developments, reflecting its focus on resident satisfaction. In 2024, CCDC received the HDB Excellence Service Award for its work at Tampines GreenCourt and Woodleigh Village.</p><p> \"Passionate customer service is the cornerstone of our success. We emphasise empathy, active listening, and timely solutions, with the goal of building meaningful connections with residents,\" says a CCDC spokesperson.</p><p> Building ties across bordersCCDC's story is also about cross-cultural connection. As a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), CCDC has served as a ground-level bridge between Singapore and China for over three decades. </p><p> \"We believe that every project is not just a structure, but a bridge between people, ideas, and cultures. Delivering high-quality work, acting responsibly, and building lasting relationships is a meaningful way to support the broader Singapore-China partnership on the ground,\" says the company spokesperson. </p><p> This includes adapting innovations from China for local use and ensuring Singapore standards and culture are integrated into every delivery. The company also works closely with local suppliers and industry partners, promoting local procurement and inclusive business practices. </p><p>  Looking ahead, CCDC's priorities remain aligned with Singapore's national goals over the next decade. The company plans to deepen its role in key sectors such as healthcare, transport and green infrastructure, areas identified in the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p> \"While we have played an active role in Singapore's residential and public construction landscape, we are now placing greater emphasis on landmark projects, which reflect the country's evolving infrastructure needs,\" says the CCDC spokesperson. </p><p> \"By introducing innovative products from our Group and adapting them to local needs, we aim to provide solutions that are sustainable, efficient, and suited to Singapore's urban vision.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-34J08VV</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF1-DGW3-S251-0076-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Very good morning to all of you. Sa-wat-dee-krub.</p><p>2. It is a great privilege and a great pleasure to join you today for the 9 th Singapore Regional Business Forum (SRBF), in the vibrant city of Bangkok.</p><p>3. I am indeed very heartened to see such strong participation by companies from Singapore, Thailand, and the wider region, united all by one common goal: to strengthen business resilience and to seize new opportunities.</p><p>Strong Singapore and Thailand Partnership</p><p>4. This year's SRBF also holds a special significance - because we are commemorating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Thailand. The theme for this significant milestone is STRONG@60. It captures the essence of our longstanding bilateral relationship - which is a robust and resilient partnership. Ladies and gentlemen, the numbers speak for themselves:</p><p>a. Our bilateral trade reached over S$44 billion last year, which is a 6.4% increase from the year before. Thailand was Singapore's 9 th largest trading partner, and the third largest in ASEAN.</p><p>b. Since 2015, Singapore has consistently ranked amongst Thailand's top investors, and in 2024, we emerged as the largest foreign investor in Thailand.</p><p>5. However, beyond the numbers, it is our people and the business ties that form the foundation of this strong partnership. During my meeting with DPM Pichai this morning, he had asked, \"What drew Singapore entrepreneurs and businesses to Thailand?\" I responded that it was the people, the strong business ties, and the hospitality that really laid the foundation. I want to illustrate two examples and share them with all of you:</p><p>a. In the sustainable energy space, Keppel, in partnership with BCPG Public Company Limited, pioneered a first-of-its-kind district cooling system for the Samyan Smart City in Bangkok.</p><p>b. In the healthcare innovation space, Singapore-based CoNEX Healthcare's AI-powered patient monitoring solution, PreSAGE, has been adopted by several Thai hospitals. Using thermal imaging, machine learning and predictive algorithms, the system reduces falls amongst elderly patients and contributes towards Thailand's efforts to care for its ageing population.</p><p>6. At the 7th Singapore-Thailand Enhanced Economic Relationship (STEER) Ministerial Meeting earlier in March this year, we continue to forge partnerships in new areas. I witnessed the signing of five Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) which span the areas of e-commerce, consumer protection, fintech, and agri-trade, as well as the announcement of a refreshed workplan on intellectual property collaboration.</p><p>7. As Singapore and Thailand celebrate our success in the last 60 years, I hope that we can reflect not just on our shared path, but think ahead and look at how we can shape the next 60 years of our partnership.</p><p>Navigating a Complex Global Landscape Through Regional Collaboration</p><p>8. This is especially important at a time where the global environment is undergoing profound changes:</p><p>a. Geopolitical tensions are threatening to fragment trade flows;</p><p>b. Our supply chains are being reshaped;</p><p>c. Climate risks and the need for energy securities are accelerating;</p><p>d. Technological disruptions, especially with the increasing prominence of AI, are transforming how we live, how we work, and how we do businesses.</p><p>9.In the face of such volatilities and to navigate these uncertainties, I think it is sll the more important for trusted partners to come together and to collaborate both on the bilateral and regional level because that would be a critical way forward.</p><p>10.Amidst these challenges, ASEAN remains a critical anchor for stability and growth:</p><p>a.ASEAN's economy is projected to grow at 4.7% this year [1], and it remains on track to become the fourth-largest global economy by 2030.</p><p>b.ASEAN is home to more than 680 million people, with an expanding middle class that is also tech savvy. This will be a very powerful driver of innovation and consumption.</p><p>c.We are also seeing a reconfiguration of global supply chains that favour this region - especially in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p><p>11. Structural changes within ASEAN are also creating new engines of growth.</p><p>a.On the digital front, ASEAN is emerging as a global hub for digital finance and e-commerce. Digital payments alone are expected to surpass US$1 trillion in gross transaction value by 2025. [2] With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, these digital innovations are set to transform existing business models and create entirely new industries across various sectors.</p><p>b. On the green transition front, ASEAN's green economy could unlock an additional US$300 billion in annual revenue through the development of green infrastructure, modernising domestic and regional electricity grids, accelerating the electric vehicle ecosystem, and leveraging the region's rich natural assets to develop carbon markets. [3] This green transition is not only a tangible step towards creating and combatting the effects of climate change, but will also help to create new jobs and it can enhance our collective regional energy security. [4]</p><p>12.To unlock its full potential, all of us have to work together, both at the bilateral and regional levels. Thailand and Singapore have been strong advocates of regional economic integration.</p><p>a. Thailand as the Chair of the ASEANDigital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) plays a key role. Singapore will support Thailand in working towards an ambitious and forward-looking agreement by the end this year, that will enhance interoperability and inclusivity across ASEAN's digital economies. Singapore also welcomes Thailand's application to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).</p><p>b. To support ASEAN's green economy development and the longer-term energy vision, we also look forward to accelerating discussions on the ASEAN Power Grid, so as to achieve a more resilient and sustainable future for ASEAN.</p><p>Seizing Opportunities: A Call to Action for Businesses</p><p>13. What do they mean for Singaporean and Thai businesses? I want to humbly suggest that they present business opportunities in three areas.</p><p>14. First, it deepens trade and investment. There remains scope for our companies to forge closer partnerships in mutual areas of interests, such as in advanced manufacturing, fintech, agri-tech, and electric vehicles.</p><p>a. For instance, in the Fintech space, iFAST signed an MOU with Thailand's TSFC Securities Public Company Limited earlier this year to explore a fintech platform to facilitate access for Thai securities companies and other financial institutions. This will allow companies to seamlessly trade offshore bonds, with immediate executable pricing and full price transparency.</p><p>b.Riding on Thailand's interest in electric vehicles (EV) development, Singapore tech start-up Voltality has partnered with Thai industrial estate conglomerate WHA Group last year to offer a multilateral roaming platform for EVs in Thailand. Currently, Voltality provides access to over 2,000 EV charging points.</p><p>15.Secondly, accelerating digital collaboration. Singapore and Thailand are digital frontrunners in ASEAN, and our countries would benefit significantly by enhancing digital collaboration.</p><p>a. For example, our Paynow-PromptPay real-time payment linkage launched since 2021 have allowed users to transfer funds securely and seamlessly between accounts in Singapore and Thailand. This is a practical demonstration of how technology can bring about tangible benefits to our people and to our businesses.</p><p>b. As digital trade between both our countries continue to grow, Singapore and Thai businesses will have much to gain by leveraging cross-border e-commerce for better connectivity and better market access.</p><p>16.Third, pioneering sustainability collaboration. Carbon markets would allow us to unlock new economic opportunities across our entire region whilst mitigating carbon emissions.</p><p>a. Thailand is a forerunner in this space. Since 2024, Thailand has developed and implemented its own national carbon standard, the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction (TVER) programme. It is the first country to complete an Article 6.2 carbon credits transfer under its cooperation with Switzerland.</p><p>b. I am about to announce with great pleasure that this afternoon, I will be signing an Implementation Agreement pursuant to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement with Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Chalermchai Sri-on. I am really looking forward to this Agreement because this Agreement will be the first between two ASEAN member states, and this is a significant milestone in our bilateral climate cooperation.</p><p>c. This Agreement will unlock additional climate finance and catalyse and uplift investments into credible carbon projects in Thailand, such as in forestry and e-mobility. It will also support Singapore in meeting our climate targets.</p><p>d. I am confident that our collaborations on this front will serve as a pathfinder for the region, by demonstrating how countries can work together to achieve both economic and environmental good outcomes.</p><p>e. We look forward to working closely with Thailand to implement the Agreement. I would like to encourage our business communities to look and explore joint projects that can advance sustainable development, that can contribute to a dynamic carbon market in ASEAN. This will bring significant meaningful impact to all of our communities.</p><p>Closing</p><p>17.Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude with this thought: in this era of uncertainty, collaboration and partnerships have never been more vital.</p><p>18.It is through all of us working together, Singapore and Thailand, alongside with the rest of ASEAN, we can prevail by turning challenges into opportunities. We can build a more integrated and a more resilient and sustainable regional economy enabled by digital and green transformation, and we continue to be able to define and shape our collective future.</p><p>Thank you.

Marking its first anniversary in the region, the platform recently facilitated a US$7.3 million  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2025/04/16/hong-kong-ai-powered-workplace-software-startup-viact-raises-73-million-round/\">funding round for viAct, a Hong Kong-based AI company focused on improving safety and sustainability in construction and mining.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Diana Kam, Chief Executive Officer, Asia Pacific at Venturebeam, impact investing has substantially changed in recent years. The movement has evolved from a defensive mindset to a proactive strategy.</p><p>'We've seen a shift from a primary focus on 'Do No Harm' and philanthropy towards a 'Net Positive' approach that emphasises responsible investing with both measurable impact and financial returns,' she said in an email interview with e27.</p><p>Kam noted that frameworks such as the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), the US SEC's Climate Disclosure Guidance, and Singapore's Sustainable Finance Taxonomy shape investor expectations and reporting standards.</p><p>'These are increasingly reshaping impact reporting, compliance, and de-risking impact investing,' she added, observing that investors now demand 'SDG-aligned value creation, not just ESG risk mitigation.'</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/fancytech-doubles-down-on-sea-with-expansion-into-thailand-indonesia-20250527/\">FancyTech doubles down on SEA with expansion into Thailand, Indonesia</url></p><p>Venturebeam aligns its mission with these trends by enabling broader access to impact investing. 'Our aim is to encourage co-investment in our curated global deals, ultimately enabling a broader range of investors to allocate capital to impactful companies,' Kam explained.</p><p>The platform also actively works with family offices in the region. 'We are currently developing several collaborations with family office alliances and clubs,' she said, noting that dedicated events will help these groups co-invest alongside professional investors while deepening their understanding of impact-driven opportunities.</p><p>One of Venturebeam's most prominent achievements to date was receiving the Rising Star Award in Sustainability from the European Chamber of Commerce, Singapore, in December 2024. The award acknowledged the platform's contributions alongside major players such as Standard Chartered and Roche Diagnostics.</p><p>Gaining momentum</p><p>While investor interest in measurable impact grows, startups cannot often meet these expectations. Kam acknowledged this challenge: 'There is little data to suggest that startups are building their startups with impact and sustainability in mind because it's simply too onerous.'</p><p>To bridge this gap, Venturebeam created its solution. 'Recognising the challenges early-stage venture companies face we developed our proprietary 'Venture Impact Score' to address these pain points,' she said.</p><p>This startup-centric tool assesses alignment with the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals and offers practical insights on governance, diversity, and sustainability.

From green infrastructure to carbon capture and circular economy innovations, startups are racing to build sustainable solutions. Yet the path to a thriving climate tech ecosystem is far from straightforward. The region's stakeholders must act collectively and decisively to overcome deeply entrenched barriers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the Expand North Star event that e27 attended,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/investing-in-climate-tech-why-investors-should-focus-on-impactful-low-hanging-fruits-20241014/\">part of the GITEX GLOBAL 2024 summit in Dubai, SOSV Founder Sean O'Sullivan delivered a stark reminder of what is at stake.</url></p><p>He described climate change as an 'urgent existential crisis for humanity' and urged the global tech investor community to step up. 'There are low-hanging fruits in that area. But there are also really, really long-term effects that also need to be considered. They need some sort of governmental backing, at least to the point where they can scale.'</p><p>O'Sullivan's insight speaks directly to the core dilemma for climate tech startups. These ventures often operate at the cutting edge of science and engineering, where development timelines are long and capital needs are vast. Unlike typical tech startups, which may see rapid returns through software or platform-based models, climate tech companies are frequently hardware-heavy, regulation-bound, and reliant on interdependent systems and infrastructure.</p><p>The challenge is exacerbated by the limited pool of traditional venture capital (VC) ready to take on these risks.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/lps-watch-how-asian-gps-are-adapting-to-changing-conditions-cooley-partners-20250526/\">LPs watch how Asian GPs are adapting to changing conditions: Cooley Partners</url></p><p>'Venture capital as an asset class is quite small, something like less than one per cent of the financial capital is deployed,' O'Sullivan noted.</p><p>As such, the climate tech ecosystem must look beyond VC. Institutional investors, public funds, family offices, corporate ventures, and even philanthropic capital must all come together to shoulder the burden - and the opportunity - of financing a sustainable future.</p><p>Fortunately, there are signs of optimism. Speaking at the Unlocking Capital for Sustainability 2023 event in Singapore, Richard Mattison, Vice Chair at S&amp;P Global Trustcon,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/some-lessons-on-how-to-fulfill-the-climate-tech-promise-20231002/\">noted positive momentum in energy transition investments.</url></p><p>'In our best-case scenario, I would tell you that greenhouse gas emissions will fall by 25 per cent in 2050. This is not enough but there are reasons to be optimistic. We are looking at huge increases in investment in renewables,' he said.</p><p>Mattison's sentiment is echoed in emerging trends across the region. Countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam are beginning to prioritise sustainability within their national development strategies. Meanwhile, a new generation of entrepreneurs is leveraging advanced materials, AI, and data to drive innovation in waste management, water conservation, and energy efficiency.</p><p>However, optimism must be matched with action. Regulatory frameworks across SEA are still patchy and inconsistent, while talent and R&amp;D ecosystems often lack the depth to scale innovations beyond pilot phases. Public-private partnerships, cross-border collaborations, and more substantial incentives for sustainable business models are critical if the region is to reach its climate tech potential.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/antler-backs-localpasar-filepillar-to-tackle-inefficiencies-in-agri-tax-industries-20250526/\">Antler backs LocalPasar, FilePillar to tackle inefficiencies in agri, tax industries</url></p><p>These challenges and opportunities will take centre stage at Echelon Singapore 2025, where thought leaders and innovators will converge to explore the future of climate technology in the region.</p><p>A key highlight of the event is the panel discussion titled 'From Prospects to Progress: Unlocking a Thriving Climate Tech Ecosystem in SEA', taking place on Wednesday, June 11, from 2.40 PM to 3.30 PM on the Growth Stage at Suntec Singapore.</p><p>Moderated by Ken Lee, Investment Director at Vidacity, the session will feature insights from Arka Irfani (CEO &amp; Founder, Bell Living Lab), Jatin Kumar (Co-Founder &amp; CTO, Xinterra), Rebecca Sharpe (Director, Better Earth Ventures), and Nicole Ngeow (Executive Director, Prudence Foundation).</p><p>Together, they will unpack what it takes to move beyond ideas and into impact, bridging financing, policy, and innovation in one of the world's most climate-vulnerable regions.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon/singapore/ticketing/\">Join us at Echelon Singapore 2025 on June 10-11 at Suntec Singapore to be part of the conversation and drive the change our region - and our planet - urgently needs.</url></p><p>-</p><p>Image Credit:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://unsplash.com/@antoinegiret?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Antoine GIRET on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/garbage-near-forest-7_TSzqJms4w?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</url></p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/climate-tech-ecosystem-20250526/\">The clock is ticking.

As at Friday, the index has advanced nearly 6 per cent year to date (YTD) -- comparable to that of the S&amp;P 500, which is up by slightly over 6.7 per cent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Various Singapore Exchange (SGX)-listed counters such as Sembcorp Industries, UOL Group and DFI Retail Group recorded over 30 per cent YTD returns, and are within the top 10 performing stocks in the Straits Times Index.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The trio of local banks -- DBS, UOB and OCBC -- however, are not within this list, as they take 18th, 19th and 20th place, respectively, in terms of total returns YTD. </p><p> YTD, these companies took the top 10 spots: </p><p> 1. ST EngineeringThe technology, engineering and defence company had a strong run for the first half of this year, with a YTD return of 72.3 per cent, as the group recorded a surge of contract wins worth nearly S$4.4 billion in Q1. This brought ST Engineering's order book to S$29.8 billion as at Mar 31. Some S$7.3 billion of these contracts are expected to be delivered this year.</p><p> The group's commercial aerospace segment reportedly accounted for about S$1.3 billion of the new jobs, defence and public security S$2.7 billion, and the rest came from the urban solutions and satcom segment. </p><p> Despite the ongoing tariff war, ST Engineering said on May 9 that it sees \"immaterial financial impact\" for the group, but continues to monitor the \"evolving situation\".</p><p> On Jun 25, the company announced that it will be divesting its entire equity interest in ST Engineering LeeBoy, a US-based construction equipment manufacturer, for an estimated US$290 million. It also issued US$750million of 4.25 per cent notes due 2030 via its subsidiary, ST Engineering RHQ, to bolster its capital structure and support future investments. </p><p> 2. Hongkong Land The property developer has made a comeback in the first half of 2025 with a YTD return of 49.2 per cent, after announcing that it would sell 147,025 square feet (sq ft) of One Exchange Square to Hong Kong's stock exchange operator for HK$6.3 billion (S$1.1 billion). This is in addition to the group's plans to launch a share buyback programme. </p><p> Earlier on Mar 7, the company posted a 44 per cent lower underlying profit of US$410 million for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2024, from US$734 million a year prior. </p><p> The group, which is part of the Jardine-Matheson stable, has said that it is pivoting its business to focus on ultra-premium, mixed-use commercial properties in Asia's \"gateway\" cities. </p><p> 3. Sembcorp Industries The energy and urban development company, part of the Temasek group, came in as the third top-performing stock on the SGX, with a 33.6 per cent YTD return. </p><p> The group has been developing various partnerships in the Asia region, as two commercial agreements involving Sembcorp Industries were inked during the 15th Singapore-Indonesia Six Bilateral Economic Working Groups Ministerial Meeting on Jun 15.</p><p> Additionally, on Jun 12, the group's wholly owned renewables subsidiary Sembcorp Green Infra was awarded a 50 megawatt round-the-clock power project from Indian public-sector company Solar Energy Corporation of India. </p><p> The subsidiary was also awarded a solar-energy storage hybrid project by SJVN, an Indian state-owned power company on May 29.</p><p> 4. DFI Retail GroupThe pan-Asian retailer recorded a YTD return of 31.7 per cent, amid various divestments by the company in recent times. </p><p> The company sold Chinese supermarket operator Yonghui Superstores to low-cost retailer Miniso in late 2024, leading to an 18 per cent decline in underlying profit for Q1 2025 compared with the same period a year ago. The Shanghai-listed player contributed US$23 million in earnings in the corresponding period a year ago.</p><p> The group also divested its 22.2 per cent stake in Robinsons Retail for an undisclosed sum on May 30. </p><p> Since then, however, analysts from DBS have a \"buy\" rating on DFI Retail, and raised its target price from US$3 to US$3.60 on Jun 9, in light of \"a stronger and more focused business strategy\". </p><p> 5. UOL GroupThe real estate player recorded a YTD return of 31.2 per cent, as it secured more tender wins and launched more developments in its joint venture projects. </p><p> Its indirect subsidiary Qin Rui Jia (Shanghai) Realty Co had teamed up with China Jinmao Holdings Group on a 10:90 basis for the government land sales tender, which closed on Feb 27. </p><p> Additionally, the group's joint Tampines project with Singapore Land and CapitaLand Development -- Parktown Residence -- began previews on Feb 7, with prices starting in the S$2,100 to S$2,300 per sq ft range. </p><p> This comes after UOL's 60 per cent net profit decline to S$227.8 million for the six months ended Dec 31, 2024, though it saw growth across its key segments that drove a 16 per cent rise in revenue to S$1.5 billion for the period.</p><p> 6. Jardine MathesonThe Hong Kong-based conglomerate is in sixth place with a 26.9 per cent YTD return. </p><p> This is good news for the group, which announced on Mar 10 that it logged an 11.4 per cent decrease in underlying profit to US$1.5 billion for its full year ended Dec 31, 2024, from US$1.7 billion in the previous corresponding period.</p><p> The group attributed the fall in profit to significantly lower contribution from Hong Kong-listed automotive dealership group Zhongsheng. </p><p> The other drag on profit was due to reduced profit from Hongkong Land, attributed to non-cash impairments it incurred from its build-to-sell segment on the Chinese mainland.</p><p> 7. SingtelThe local telecommunications giant had a 25.3 per cent return YTD, after returning to the black with a net profit of S$2.8 billion for its second half ended March, compared with a net loss of S$1.3 billion for the previous corresponding period. </p><p> Singtel also authorised its first share buyback programme of up to S$2 billion on May 22. The programme, which will be delivered over the course of three years until financial year 2028, involves the purchase of shares in the open market that will subsequently be cancelled. </p><p> It also incorporated its wholly owned subsidiaries in Singapore, such as Singtel International Digital Services (IDS) and IDS Cloud, during this period. </p><p> 8. Singapore Exchange (SGX) In eighth position, SGX itself recorded a 20.7 per cent YTD return, after seeing various listings on the bourse in H1. </p><p>Japanese telco Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) filed to list a real estate investment trust (Reit) on Jun 27 -- possibly the largest S-Reit listing in 10 years. </p><p> Meanwhile, software services provider Info-Tech Systems closed at S$0.35, about 16.6 per cent above its initial public offering (IPO) price of S$0.30 on its first trading day on Jul 4. Automotive group Vin's Holdings also made its listing debut on Apr 15 on SGX this year, as the first IPO on the bourse in 2025. </p><p> 9. CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT)The largest Reit listed on the Singapore bourse had a 16.4 per cent return YTD. </p><p> This comes after the manager of the trust on May 2 decided to sell its stake in the serviced residence component of CapitaSpring worth S$126 million, with the transaction concluded on May 30. </p><p> A week earlier, on Apr 25, CICT posted a 0.8 per cent dip in net property income of S$291.5 million for its first quarter of FY2025 from the same year-ago period. This came as revenue shrank 0.8 per cent on the year to S$395.3 million. </p><p> 10. Keppel The asset manager recorded a 16 per cent YTD return, thanks to successful green infrastructure tie-ups in H1, and the appointment of former DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta as deputy chairman and non-executive independent director of its board, effective Jul 1. </p><p> Keppel partnered Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on Jun 25 to facilitate up to US$1.5 billion worth of sustainable infrastructure investments and financing opportunities in the Asia-Pacific. The venture will last for an initial five-year period up to December 2030. </p><p> Its infrastructure division will also work with Chinese tech giant Huawei International to design and develop solar photovoltaic systems and battery energy storage system technologies for interconnected power grids across South-east Asia, according to a company statement on May 13. </p><p> The company on Jun 6 also said it will divest its stakes in a New York-based company and a logistics park in China to unlock more than S$80 million from the monetisation of non-core assets. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Sembcorp Industries, UOL Group and DFI Retail Group recorded over 30% while SGX itself recorded a 20.7% year-to-date returns, and are within the top 10 performing stocks on the exchange for H1.

The moral malaise is palpable.</p><p> Other Western nations too are hit by economic and leadership malaise. The euro zone is structurally flawed, with its internal barriers and regulatory hurdles creating a very difficult macroeconomic environment. </p><p> The UK's relevance has diminished over time, especially post-Brexit.</p><p> China, too, has scored some own goals. The decades-long dependency on real estate has ended. Coupled with a 200-plus per cent debt-to-GDP ratio and poor demographics, it is an economy under enormous pressure.</p><p>Japan is dealing with fractured politics and a declining working-age population, and Latin America and Africa are struggling with corruption. </p><p> Standing reasonably tall are India and Asean. But towering above them all is Singapore.</p><p> What makes Singapore the \"real\" exceptional nation'</p><p> First, political stability in the age of chaos. We've just had a change of prime minister with minimal fuss and fanfare. The Government's focus remains squarely on the long term while executing in the short term.</p><p> Second, maintaining our economic resilience amid increasing global uncertainty. </p><p> In Singapore, we are seeing the payoff of our planned transition from a maritime services and oil refining economy to one led by innovation, technology, biotech, fintech, sustainability and the arts. </p><p> Further, Singapore's private sector operates alongside public regulation, with rising wage growth and productivity. A constructive relationship between labour and industry is the optimal governance architecture of the future.</p><p> Three, preparedness in the era of climate disasters. Singapore's investment in coastal protection measures, green infrastructure and water management will serve us well in the years ahead. </p><p> Much has been achieved by smart planning and a citizen- and community-focused government, but Singapore still has several challenges: a rapidly ageing population, adequacy of talent, and balancing competing geopolitical interests. </p><p> Does Singapore have the \"paranoid optimism\" to thrive in this unstable and fractured world? Singapore remains well-positioned to continue forging ahead with its enduring model of stability through a pragmatic government. </p><p>Singapore's focus on long-term planning, social cohesion and community, innovation and competitiveness, efficiency and productivity, reducing disparity, and shared prosperity is what makes Singapore the truly exceptional nation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-IVGMP7H</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F8P-25M3-RWT6-B09R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Furthermore, a fast-track approach is required to support enterprises in their sustainability and technology transitions,\" he said. </p><p> To help companies with their sustainability practices, a centralised hub around environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns can be created to aid firms in navigating reporting requirements. </p><p> Given Singapore's 2050 net-zero emissions target, businesses in hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and maritime can also get long-term financial support through grants and competitively priced loans to help them become more energy-efficient and adopt clean energy. </p><p> KPMG and SID called for greater transparency regarding carbon tax and the sorts of green infrastructure that money raised from the tax is used for. </p><p> \"Detailed disclosures on the use of these funds can enable businesses to align their investments with Singapore's climate agenda,\" they said. </p><p> Other incentives like strategic grants can also help enhance the funding landscape for large-scale sustainable projects, they added. </p><p> These efforts can complement existing initiatives, such as the platform Gprnt, which helps companies of various sizes automate their ESG reporting process. It was launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in November 2023. </p><p> There are also grants and programmes to support ESG efforts, such as the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, which is for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, to build capabilities. </p><p> When it comes to workforce development, KPMG and SID recommended measures to groom future leaders to take over board positions, especially since companies have to refresh their boards with the rule that a director can be considered independent for a tenure of only nine years. </p><p> To this end, the Government can create a national leadership competency index to provide a standardised benchmark outlining the essential skills that organisation leaders need. </p><p> There can also be apprenticeship programmes for future board directors. </p><p> There should be mandatory board evaluations across sectors, conducted regularly by external parties, to enhance corporate governance and transparency, KPMG and SID said. </p><p> SID chief executive Terence Quek said: \"Board leadership is essential in setting the tone and aligning business models with evolving societal expectations, shaping a future where profitability and positive social impact go hand in hand.\"</p><p> SID governing council member Neil Parekh added: \"Directors play a crucial role in guiding businesses to strategically leverage (public capital) markets, ensuring that investments are channelled towards initiatives that not only deliver financial returns but also contribute to long-term value creation for all stakeholders.\"</p><p> More can also be done to allow people to gain micro-credentials and get access to SkillsFuture funding, KPMG and SID said. </p><p> They added that people should be able to take short-term certifications in high-demand areas like AI, sustainability and cyber security to help address talent gaps in the workforce.</p><p> \"Micro-credentialling will play a pivotal role in equipping individuals with industry-recognised qualifications, creating leaders who are not only well educated but also professionally competent to deliver value and impact across sectors,\" KPMG in Singapore managing partner Lee Sze Yeng said.</p><p> Finally, businesses can also get more support in sharpening their technological capabilities so they can make use of cutting-edge tools and innovate. </p><p> KPMG and SID called for more funding to develop AI governance and standards, and training for companies to encourage ethical deployment of AI. </p><p> Driving innovation will also enable the business landscape in Singapore to be more competitive, they said. </p><p> This can be done through initiatives that develop company directors, so they are more capable in navigating ESG issues and exploring new strategies in that area. </p><p> Corporate governance can also be strengthened through enhanced tax governance. For companies benefiting from tax incentives or grants, governance of their tax can also be part of their corporate governance requirements, both organisations said. </p><p> KPMG's Mr Sanganeria said: \"We believe these steps are critical to ensuring Singapore's economy, businesses and people are climate-resilient, future-ready and digitally savvy.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>(From left) KPMG in Singapore partner Yong Jiahao, head of tax Ajay Kumar Sanganeria and managing partner Lee Sze Yeng with Singapore Institute of Directors governing council member Neil Parekh and chief executive Terence Quek and the organisations' Budget 2025 proposals. photo: KPMG</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-9GFDGAR</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVH-PRM3-RT1D-43TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

That it surpassed its target reflects the appetite not only for infrastructure as a private-market asset class, but also for exposure to the Asia-Pacific, where the funding gap is wide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Globally, countries in the Asia-Pacific are among those most vulnerable to the climate crisis. The Asian Development Bank has estimated that Asia will need US$1.7 trillion in annual investment in infrastructure through 2030 to meet current demand.</p><p> For its portfolio exposures, Seraya has picked two themes that play into megatrends -- green data centres and facilities that support the energy transition challenge. It succeeded in attracting a roster of blue-chip investors, including the Alberta Investment Management Company, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and BlackRock funds.</p><p> Seraya's Fund 1 aims to invest in mid-market deals. Its proposition combines the income-generating profile of infrastructure assets with a returns kicker that is in line with private equity assets. </p><p> To date, more than half of the capital has been deployed. A second round of capital-raising is planned for 2025.</p><p> Seraya managing partner James Chern says the firm was founded with a vision for a \"truly local, Asia-focused fund management company in the infrastructure sector\".</p><p> \"Drawing on our experience with large global and regional funds, our firm is dedicated to investing in Asia, championing local teams, and developing innovative investment opportunities within our region.\"</p><p> Chern was previously a founding member of I Squared Capital, a global infrastructure fund manager with US$40 billion in assets. Managing partner and sibling Ivan Chern was former managing director of RRJ Capital, a US$12 billion private equity fund.</p><p> Managing director Khan Yow says the firm's stamping ground is the mid-market space, where the deal flow is \"rich\" and deal values range between US$50 million and US$100 million. \"We are builders of companies. In the infrastructure segment, we're relatively small compared to our global peers. Large firms are under pressure to deploy very big-ticket sizes, but in Asia we don't believe there are all these big-ticket sized deals out there for unlisted infrastructure.\"</p><p> Seraya Partners began to seed investments soon after its founding in 2020. This meant the fund could begin to generate revenues almost from the get-go, thanks to long-term lease contracts.</p><p> Yow said: \"We have a compelling story and thesis. But the ultimate factor which probably is the tipping point, is that we have real, actionable deals that our investors see, that they can underwrite. They know that when the rubber hits the road, there is something to put money against.</p><p> \"At the asset level, the deal has to be profitable from day-minus-one, where even before we put in the capital, we have a clear path to revenues... We have to plan carefully so that our deal pipeline supports the growth of the portfolio companies. It's not just about assets, but about the assets being operated by a competent, strong team that can grow them.\"</p><p> The first investment was in Empyrion Digital, which started when Seraya acquired a data centre from a family business in 2021. Empyrion is positioned as \"green by design\", which means it focuses on energy and water efficiency through the adoption of new technologies. </p><p> The efficiency components are designed upfront and integrated into the construction and operations. </p><p> Empyrion's first centre, SG Dodid1, is in Serangoon North. The firm has since expanded into South Korea, where it is building a 40 megawatt centre in Gangnam, Seoul, that is expected to be completed in 2025. It is also exploring facilities in Japan and Taiwan.</p><p> A second key investment is Cyan Renewables, which owns and leases specialised vessels to support all phases of offshore wind farm projects, from installation to operations. It acquired its first ship in 2023 in a deal with Belgium's DEME, and secured a long-term charter with turbine maker Siemens Gamesa for work in offshore Belgium.</p><p> \"Cyan's vessels are the shovels and spades, and core to the operation of wind farms, where there is a huge shortage of vessels. The wind farm operators don't want to have the capex of US$50 million to US$100 million on their books. We provide the solution on a lease basis,\" says Yow. \"We're probably the first in Asia, and we believe one of the biggest in Asia for such an idea.\" </p><p> Cyan aims to own and operate a US$1 billion portfolio of vessels by the end of 2025.</p><p> A third area is Astrid Renew, which will focus on renewable energy and energy storage solutions. </p><p> Yow says Seraya aims to achieve a stable \"bond-like\" return profile, but with \"enough juice for upside with growth opportunities\". It aims to focus on developed Asia, in countries where respect for rule of law reduces country-specific risks.</p><p> \"Infrastructure as an asset class is well-established with big, limited partners, who primarily invest for yield because they want stable cash flows. But if you just go for yield, returns are not very interesting. You're just clipping a coupon.</p><p> \"We try to achieve a blend. We get decent yield for investors, but to have the extra juice, we also offer value creation. We've started as early as possible to build our companies. In the underlying assets, we stick to the principles of infrastructure investments -- which consist of long-term contracts, stable and strong counterparties, predictable revenues and good equipment.</p><p> \"But we also have people and talent which can build the companies to a larger scale and create future opportunities for exit. We take an outsized share of our portfolio companies, which enables us to guide, build and grow the companies. We think that's how we can command interest among investors who want to put money with us.\"</p><p> Seraya Partners itself has close to 20 employees. Empyrion and Cyan each has between 30 and 50 staff. </p><p> Empyrion Digital is headed by Mark Fong, who has more than two decades of experience in technology and data centre industry. Cyan Renewables is headed by Lee Keng Lin, who has a track record of working in the renewables, port logistics, maritime ventures and offshore energy industry.</p><p> Seraya is headquartered in Singapore, and has offices in Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Taipei and Esbjerg, Denmark.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>From far left: Douglas Kang, partner; Ivan Chern, managing partner; James Chern, managing partner and CIO; Bernard Ning, head of asset management and partner; Khan Yow, managing director.

The site spans a land area of 380,869 sq ft and has a total gross floor area of 106,949 sq ft. It has a lease tenure of three years, with the option to extend the lease for two terms of three years each.</p><p>Tender results published by SLA online show that Coliwoo submitted a monthly rental bid of $225,000. It was the second-highest of five bids, coming just under the $225,900 bid submitted by hostel and dormitory operator Tee Up. The remaining three bids came from Tap Co-Livings at $118,888, Cherryloft Resorts and Hotels at $138,000, and The Bus Hotel at $98,000.</p><p>In a June 2 press release, Coliwoo says it plans to convert the property into its first resort-style chalet. Renovations are expected to take 10 months, with the resort targeted to open in 2026. Billed as an eco lifestyle hub, the property will have 350 keys, doubling the current number of units at the site and making it Coliwoo's third-biggest property.</p><p>Facilities at the property include swimming pools, indoor and outdoor sports zones, meditation gardens and barbecue pits. Coliwoo says guests can also look forward to social bonding events organised by the firm.</p><p>The revamped property will have sustainability features, including solar energy systems, electric vehicle charging stations, dedicated cycling paths and extensive landscaping. Nearby attractions include Pasir Ris Beach, Downtown East and Wild Wild Wet.</p><p>Global corporates target over 100 mil sq ft of new office space as disruptions spur demand for flexibility: Knight Frank</p><p>A survey by Knight Frank has found that businesses are betting on the future of offices as they navigate an uncertain global environment. The survey, which polled 300 corporate real estate (CRE) leaders overseeing over 650 million sq ft of space globally, revealed that over 50% of respondents plan to grow their office workspace over the next three to five years, the equivalent of 104 million sq ft.</p><p>Plans to expand come as companies seek to build resilience in a landscape being shaped by economic, geopolitical and technological disruptions. In Knight Frank's survey, respondents identified the need to balance growth and innovation with cost control as the biggest influence over their real estate strategy over the next three to five years.</p><p>The second-biggest influence identified by CRE leaders was uncertainty and volatility in the operating environment. Trade wars and political tension also ranked highly among respondents, coming in at fourth place.</p><p>Despite these concerns, rather than cutting workspace or freezing decision-making, many companies are choosing to expand, says Knight Frank. Of the survey respondents that plan to grow their office footprint, 27 companies are expected to boost their workspace by over 20%.</p><p>At the same time, corporations are embracing change by pivoting to real estate strategies that build in optionality and flexibility, including shorter leases, more flexible formats, and diversified locations.</p><p>\"Corporates are committing to new space but building in flexible lease terms and options on pre-lets to remain nimble,\" says Tim Armstrong, partner and global head of occupier strategy and solutions at Knight Frank. He adds that companies are looking to regionalise their footprint to stay relevant to local markets while also diversifying exposure to geopolitical risks.</p><p>Lee Elliott, partner and head of global occupier research at Knight Frank, notes that as occupiers regionalise portfolios, many are moving away from monolithic headquarters towards having networks of hubs in prime office assets. \"The trend is already playing out in major markets where demand is tilting toward buildings that offer adaptability, experience, and ESG credentials, particularly in cities that combine global reach with local talent,\" he adds.</p><p>Workstyle evolution was cited as the third most influential factor for real estate strategy among respondents over the next three to five years. However, in contrast to the high-profile full return-to-office mandates that have made headlines in the last year, Knight Frank's survey found that only 10% of respondents expected to opt for an \"office only\" workstyle in the next three years. The majority, at 46%, expected to follow a hybrid workstyle, while 22% elected for an \"office first\" approach.</p><p>As hybrid work settles into the mainstream, leaders are redesigning offices for better workplace utilisation by focusing on supporting outcomes rather than presence, says Knight Frank. This, in turn, is leading to demand for workspaces that can flex across work styles while activating spaces in ways that drive engagement, support culture and deliver measurable productivity gains.</p><p>\"Corporate real estate is expected to deliver more than ever, and leaders face increasingly urgent challenges that can no longer be parked in the sidings,\" says Elliott, adding that while many see hybrid working and office-centric models as the future of the workplace, corporations will increasingly focus on the functionality of the environment and whether it delivers for employees and teams.</p><p>Frasers launches two new serviced apartment properties in Mainland China</p><p>Frasers Hospitality has added two new properties under its Modena by Fraser brand in Mainland China - Modena by Fraser Shenzhen and Modena by Fraser Wujiaochang Shanghai.</p><p>Both properties offer serviced apartment units equipped with kitchenettes, communal areas and flexible common spaces that can be tailored to accommodate guests' individual needs.</p><p>The 325-unit Modena by Frasers Shenzhen soft opened on March 29. Located in the Luohu District in Shenzhen's Greater Bay Area, the property offers a range of studio to two-bedroom apartments for both short- and long-term stays. The property also features common amenities such as a pickleball court, gym, yoga studio, caf\u00e9 and outdoor barbecue area.</p><p>Meanwhile, Modena by Fraser Wujiaochang Shanghai houses 307 one- and two-bedroom apartments from about 248 sq ft to 710 sq ft. Common amenities at the property include a yoga studio, gym and common room with amphitheatre seating.</p><p>Located in the Yangpu district, close to the Wujiaochang commercial hub of Shanghai, the property is situated close to global tech companies, retail districts and universities. - Compiled by Atiqah Mokhtar, Nicholas Lam and The Edge Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G10-G863-RS6G-853J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Edge Publishing PTE.

That would mark a noticeable slowdown from the 4.6 per cent annual growth recorded from 2020 to 2024.</p><p> The team of economists, led by DBS chief China and Hong Kong economist Ji Mo, presented China's outlook from 2025 to 2040 in a webinar on Apr 16.</p><p> Dr Ji said that China's ageing demographic was an obstacle to growth.</p><p> \"China's ageing population remains a structural drag on its long-term economic expansion,\" she noted. \"Ageing shrinks the workforce and raises dependency ratios, straining resources for innovation and growth.\"</p><p> She added that its effects are felt across the economy, paring an annual 0.4 percentage point off growth projections.</p><p> Due to higher life expectancies, lower fertility rates and a declining total population, the report has forecast that the country's working population will shrink by 0.8 per cent a year. By 2035, individuals aged 60 and above are set to rise above 400 million, or 30 per cent of the total population.</p><p> Neither does China's ageing bode well for the country's ongoing property struggles. While structural deleveraging of China's property sector has become a policy priority for Beijing in the last five years, DBS expects that the country's housing oversupply will continue to be exacerbated as household sizes, marriage rates and home-buying populations shrink. </p><p> China's demographic struggles have not been ignored by policymakers. The country has begun progressively raising its retirement age -- which currently ranks among the lowest globally -- and recently announced its intention to use local government bond proceeds to convert unsold homes into affordable housing.</p><p> All in on AIA broader move towards technology-driven productivity gains has been targeted by policymakers, as both a driver of productivity and to offset the country's ageing woes. </p><p> The report noted that the country's State Council has set 2025 as a major milestone for AI development, with a goal of becoming the global leader by 2030. State-backed venture capital funds have pumped more than 23 per cent of their total investments into more than a million AI firms nationwide in the past decade, the report said.</p><p> The emergence of DeepSeek, the DBS team said, is optimising chip performance, and lowering the energy and computational costs of AI model training and inference. The report further projected the country to dominate the global chip market by 2040, with its market share likely to rise beyond 50 per cent.</p><p> Such advancements in AI infrastructure are expected to enhance productivity significantly, the DBS economists added.</p><p> Humanoid robotics are intended to inject productivity gains across various sectors, especially healthcare, education, logistics and elderly care, with the adoption of robots projected to reach 50 per cent by 2040, the report said. </p><p> \"The government sees humanoid robotics as a critical solution to the ageing population crisis,\" noted Samuel Tse, senior economist at DBS. </p><p> Even agriculture is projected to undergo transformation, with the country targeting full automation in the sector by 2040 -- early glimpses already seen in projects such as automated strawberry pickers in Shandong and soil-optimising drones. </p><p> Yet as the country's middle class continues to grow, Beijing has recognised the need to transition from capital to domestic consumption as the key driver of the economy. </p><p> Currently, high household savings of about 45 per cent of GDP -- partly in response to insufficient social safety nets -- have resulted in weak domestic consumption, which accounts for just 38 per cent of GDP, the report found.</p><p> Rethinking urbanisation\"The government will roll out more and more policies to give people more confidence to spend. That means building a stronger social security system, so people don't feel like they need to hold on to every yuan just in case something goes wrong,\" said Nathan Chow, senior economist at DBS. </p><p> He projected that domestic consumption could rise to about 50 to 55 per cent by 2040.</p><p> Crucial to the target of sustainable domestic consumption is rethinking urbanisation, which has served as a key driver of Chinese economic growth over several decades through foreign investment and industrialisation, Chow added.</p><p> \"To China, urbanisation is no longer about expanding as fast as possible -- it's about growing smarter,\" he noted. \"China wants to build cities that are not only bigger but better. We're talking about more liveable, inclusive and sustainable places.\" </p><p> The country's urbanisation rate is expected to get to at least 75 per cent by 2040, said the report, with greater emphasis placed on healthcare, education and green infrastructure.</p><p> Technology remains critical in this approach to development. Chow expects such \"smarter\" urbanisation to integrate AI-powered optimisation strategies, such as Hangzhou's pilot \"City Brain\" programme, designed to streamline traffic and energy grids. </p><p> Rural areas are already becoming integrated in e-commerce networks and digital agricultural supply chains through platforms such as Pinduoduo, the report noted. </p><p> Still, existing headwinds remain, as shown in the uncertainty towards trade relations with the United States, which threatens to escalate further.</p><p> \"The impact of trade war will likely weigh on the disinflation of China,\" the report said. \"External demand will continue to slow in the medium term and exacerbate overcapacity.\"</p><p> Paying attention to larger transformational and macroeconomic foundations in the country remains equally important, noted Taimur Baig, chief economist at DBS.</p><p> \"China's growth in the 2010s happened not because of its investments in the 2010s,\" he said. \"Instead, it was due to factors such as the country achieving universal literacy in the 1990s.\"</p><p> \"Today, seeds are being put in place that may provide fruits or create constraints 10 or 15 years out.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The emergence of DeepSeek is optimising chip performance, and lowering the energy and computational costs of AI model training and inference, notes DBS.

The project is the first of its kind to be built on already developed land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In this distributed district cooling network, which will slash the environmental cost of air-conditioning, some buildings in the town centre have taken over the cooling load for others. </p><p> Such a shared system will help to cut carbon emissions, save energy and enhance efficiency through economies of scale, said SP Group, which built and operates the system, on March 14. </p><p> Mr S. Harsha, managing director for sustainable energy solutions at SP Group, said: \"For years, we have understood the crucial role air-conditioning plays in our tropical climate, but traditional in-building air-conditioning systems, especially the ones in older buildings, are usually less efficient and designed with standby capacity.</p><p> \"These buildings consume vast amounts of energy for cooling, and many of them will be around for years to come. As we strive to reduce our carbon footprint and build a greener Singapore, we need to implement a more sustainable cooling solution that can be adapted for existing buildings.\"</p><p> In district cooling technology, water is chilled in a centralised location and then sent through a network to multiple buildings. In conventional cooling systems, individual buildings have their own chillers.</p><p> This cooling network will help the town centre cut its carbon emissions by 1,000 tonnes a year, equivalent to removing 910 cars from the roads.</p><p> It will also achieve energy savings of more than 2.3 million kilowatt-hours a year, enough to power over 710 three-room Housing Board households for a year.</p><p> About 25,000 sq ft of space previously used by the several chiller plants can also be repurposed, SP Group said. In addition, those buildings will save on the cost of maintaining the equipment.</p><p> The seven buildings connected to the network are Century Square, CPF Tampines Building, Income at Tampines Junction, OCBC Tampines Centre 2, Our Tampines Hub, Tampines Mall and Tampines 1.</p><p> Instead of constructing a new centralised cooling plant, the network uses the existing chiller plants of Century Square, Our Tampines Hub and Tampines 1.</p><p> These were selected to be the chilled water supply nodes as evaluations showed they had excess cooling capacity and superior energy efficiency.</p><p> They supply the chilled water through an underground pipe about 1.3km long to the other buildings in the network.</p><p> Construction began in March 2023 to retrofit the buildings and install infrastructure such as chilled water pipes. </p><p> Mr Harsha said the Tampines town centre is a densely built environment, lacking the space to build a district cooling plant.</p><p> \"What we have done here today is not just launch the Tampines distributed district cooling network; we have also developed a blueprint or reference architecture that can be used to implement a similar concept in other precincts or districts and other areas where it's fairly built up,\" he said. </p><p> But given the density of the area, it was challenging to build the network while minimising inconvenience and disruption to residents, he added. </p><p> To tackle this, SP Group regularly engaged with building owners, residents and the public to mitigate the inconvenience to the community over the two years of construction.</p><p> Mr David Chua, chief investment officer at Income Insurance, which owns one of the buildings receiving the chilled water, said the network allows the building to better optimise energy efficiency.</p><p> \"As a building owner, the implementation of the network will free up space with the removal of air-conditioning equipment which is no longer needed, and we can potentially consider other sustainable practices such as solar renewable energy in the future.\"</p><p> For the next phase, SP Group is in discussions to add seven more buildings in the vicinity to the network, further enhancing Tampines' ambitions to be an eco-town.</p><p> The launch of the network is a key milestone in the Tampines eco-town masterplan, which serves as a blueprint for how cities can be built and lived in sustainably, said Tampines GRC MP Masagos Zulkifli at the launch event on March 14.</p><p> The brownfield project is one of the efforts in the masterplan -- which was created in line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a national blueprint for sustainability targets.</p><p> \"We are not just constructing green infrastructure, we are enabling every resident to live the green life,\" said Mr Masagos, who is also Minister for Social and Family Development. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-OKGSQ99</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FBC-RP73-RSXF-K10T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Inflation of 2.5 per cent in December remained above the official target of 2 per cent. It has only been six months since the Labour party won the general election. Instead of a honeymoon period that some had expected, a recent YouGov poll found that Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support has slid by 8 percentage points to just 26 per cent. </p><p>As things stand, the government is only one percentage point ahead of the right-wing Reform Party, with the Conservatives starting to regain some lost ground.Reeves pinned the blame on \u00e2\u20ac\u015314 years of economic stagnation\u00e2\u20ac under the Conservatives for the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current economic situation. She added that she was determined to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kickstart growth, which is the number one priority in our plan for change\u00e2\u20ac.She has been banking on better growth to cut government debt which has soared from \u00c2\u00a3800 billion in 2009 to the current level of around \u00c2\u00a32.8 trillion. State debt is almost 100 per cent of gross domestic product. The UK Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicts that annual government debt interest will be \u00c2\u00a3112 billion until 2030. This is much higher than the \u00c2\u00a340 billion annual average in the first decade of this century.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Since Reeves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 heavily criticised first budget on Oct 30 last year, the pound has tumbled by 8 per cent against the US dollar and has weakened against the euro, yen and Singapore dollar.Over the same period, yields on ten-year gilts (bonds issued by the UK government) have soared from 4 per cent to a peak of just under 5 per cent in mid-January. This is the highest government bond yield since 2007. The FTSE 100 index of mainly multinational companies has rallied since the start of the year because businesses have benefitted from a weaker pound. The FTSE 250 index of mainly local companies, however, has been flat for the last few months.A recent Bank of England survey of more than 2,300 finance directors found that over half of British businesses expect their profits to tumble this year.Just over half (54 per cent) of respondents expect thinner profit margins, while a similar proportion (55 per cent) indicated that they would carry out retrenchments in an effort to slash costs.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses are taking stock of higher employment costs, a more gradual pace of interest rate cuts and (higher) inflation,\u00e2\u20ac said Jon Holt, a senior partner at KPMG UK.The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Federation of Small Businesses claimed that 92 per cent of its members were worried that they might have to shed workers at some point in 2025. Some of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top executives, including Marks and Spencer CEO Stuart Machin and Tesco CEO Ken Murphy have expressed worries about the impact of inflation on costs and higher interest rates. Sainsbury\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Simon Roberts noted that many of the supermarket chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers are tightening their belts when it comes to the size of their food bills. They are feeling the squeeze after experiencing the worst inflation shock in decades, he added.On her part, Reeves said the government is requiring 17 regulators in the UK to submit at least five proposals each to promote growth, and these will be studied over the next few weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every regulator, no matter what sector, has a part to play by tearing down the regulatory barriers that hold back growth. I want to see this mission woven into the very fabric of our regulators through a cultural shift from excessively focusing on risk to helping drive growth,\u00e2\u20ac she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves says the government has to do more in order to grow the sluggish economy.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F17-2N83-RRMH-R0J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Inflation of 2.5 per cent in December remained above the official target of 2 per cent.</p><p> No honeymoon periodIt has been only six months since the Labour Party won the general election. Instead of a honeymoon period that some had expected, a recent YouGov poll found that Labour's support has slid by eight percentage points to just 26 per cent. </p><p> As things stand, the government is only one percentage point ahead of the right-wing Reform Party, with the Conservatives starting to regain some lost ground.</p><p> Reeves pinned the blame on \"14 years of economic stagnation\" under the Conservatives for the UK's current economic situation. She added that she was determined to \"kick-start growth, which is the No 1 priority in our plan for change\".</p><p> She has been banking on better growth to cut government debt, which soared from GBP800 billion in 2009 to the current level of around GBP2.8 trillion. State debt is almost 100 per cent of gross domestic product. </p><p> The UK Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that annual government debt interest will be GBP112 billion until 2030. This is much higher than the GBP40 billion annual average in the first decade of this century.  </p><p> Since Reeves' heavily criticised first Budget on Oct 30 last year, the pound has tumbled by 8 per cent against the US dollar and weakened against the euro, yen and Singapore dollar.</p><p> Over the same period, yields on 10-year gilts (bonds issued by the UK government) soared from 4 per cent to a peak of just under 5 per cent in mid-January. This was the highest government bond yield since 2007.</p><p> The FTSE 100 index of mainly multinational companies has rallied since the start of the year because businesses have benefited from a weaker pound. The FTSE 250 index of mainly local companies, however, has been flat for the last few months.</p><p> A recent Bank of England survey of more than 2,300 finance directors found that over half of British businesses expected their profits to tumble this year.</p><p> Fifty-four per cent of respondents predicted thinner profit margins, while a similar proportion (55 per cent) indicated that they would carry out retrenchments in an effort to slash costs.</p><p> Businesses worried\"Businesses are taking stock of higher employment costs, a more gradual pace of interest rate cuts and (higher) inflation,\" said Jon Holt, a senior partner at KPMG UK.</p><p> The UK's Federation of Small Businesses claimed that 92 per cent of its members were worried that they might have to shed workers at some point in 2025. </p><p> Some of the UK's top executives, including Marks &amp; Spencer chief executive officer Stuart Machin and Tesco CEO Ken Murphy, have expressed worries about the impact of inflation on costs and higher interest rates. </p><p> Sainsbury's CEO Simon Roberts noted that many of the supermarket chain's customers are tightening their belts when it comes to the size of their food bills. They are feeling the squeeze after experiencing the worst inflation shock in decades, he added.</p><p> On her part, Reeves said the government is requiring 17 regulators in the UK to submit at least five proposals each to promote growth, and these will be studied over the next few weeks.</p><p> \"Every regulator, no matter what sector, has a part to play by tearing down the regulatory barriers that hold back growth. I want to see this mission woven into the very fabric of our regulators, through a cultural shift from excessively focusing on risk to helping drive growth,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves says her government needs to \"do more to grow our economy\", and reiterated her pledge to go \"further and faster\" to boost growth in order to raise living standards. photo: AFP</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-8BFTS93</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F1F-1TF3-RRJ9-T45D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The share now is about 64 per cent. </p><p> \"This is a key enabler to achieve the ambitious goal of significantly reducing land transport emissions in absolute terms, in alignment with Singapore's net-zero target by 2050,\" the MOF said. </p><p> The Jurong Region and Cross Island lines are estimated to result in total carbon savings equivalent to taking at least 22,000 cars off the roads when fully operational. </p><p> The $2.1 billion allocated for the projects was raised from the 50-year Green Singapore Government Securities (Infrastructure) bond, which reopened in September 2023, with an issuance size of $2.8 billion. </p><p> The $2.1 billion comprises $1.7 billion from the first tranche of bonds issued in August 2022 and $400 million from the reopened tranche. </p><p> The remaining funds from the reopened tranche are expected to be fully allocated by the end of the 2025 financial year. </p><p> Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development, said in the report: \"The Singapore Green Bond Framework remains a key pillar of Singapore's efforts to channel investments into projects that will advance our sustainability efforts and contribute towards our net-zero goal.\"</p><p> It was announced in Budget 2022 that the Government will issue up to $35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects.</p><p> Eligible categories include those revolving around renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, clean transportation and sustainable water and wastewater management. </p><p> These projects are expected to help Singapore transition to a low-carbon economy, contributing to the climate-related and environmental goals set out by the Government. </p><p> Ms Indranee added in the report: \"Our fight against climate change requires collective effort and urgent action, and critically, we have to marshal the resources for change. Green finance plays a pivotal role in driving the global transition to a low-carbon future.\" </p><p> The MOF report, the second it has issued relating to the green bonds, noted that the land transport sector accounts for about 15 per cent of carbon emissions here. </p><p> \"One key strategy to reduce carbon footprint in this sector is encouraging greener commutes, among other initiatives such as vehicle electrification and greening infrastructure and operations,\" the ministry said. \"Expanding our public transport infrastructure and electric rail network is a core element of this strategy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Jurong Region Line (above) and Cross Island Line are estimated to result in total carbon savings equivalent to taking at least 22,000 cars off the roads when fully operational.

This was 30 per cent higher than the year before, making it the most expensive year on record for natural disasters. As devastating wildfires burn in Los Angeles, 2025 could prove to be even dearer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Climate change has intensified the dangers of wildfires, meaning disaster events are more likely to occur outside of the typical wildfire season. With global temperatures exceeding an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, this is only going to become more difficult to mitigate and adapt to.</p><p> Economic burden for AmericansJPMorgan estimates that the economic cost of the LA wildfires will total around US$50 billion. However, only US$20 billion of this will be insured, so there is a significant protection gap. In recent years, as wildfires become bigger and harder to control, many insurers have decided against offering protection in high-risk areas, which has exacerbated the economic burden for many Americans.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has been vocal about his scepticism of the threat climate change poses, labelling it a \"hoax\" and \"one of the great scams of all time\" during his campaign in 2024. In his first term, he withdrew the US from the 2015 Paris agreement in a major setback to efforts to curb the country's emissions. </p><p> He has vowed in his second term to repeal environmental rules introduced by the Joe Biden administration, end public spending on clean energy, scrap incentives for Americans to buy electric vehicles (EV) and embark on a \"drill, baby, drill\" drive for new fossil fuel energy. On his first day in office this week, Trump once again withdrew the US from the Paris agreement and halted more than US$300 billion in green infrastructure funding as part of his plan to undo the progress made by Biden's team.</p><p> This will have drastic implications for transition finance. A move towards greater de-regulation will override much of the Biden administration's important work to hold industries to account for their emissions and counter the risk of greenwashing through disclosure requirements. There has already been a widespread retreat of banks and asset managers from many of the frameworks and alliances that were established following COP26 in 2021.</p><p> Since the Nov 5 US election, all six of the largest US banks -- Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo -- have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has left Net Zero Asset Managers, the equivalent organisation for money managers. And just a few days after Trump took office, the Federal Reserve left the Network for Greening the Financial System in a blow to central bank net-zero efforts.</p><p> In OMFIF's Global Public Funds 2024, not a single survey respondent chose climate change when asked to identify the top three economic factors affecting their investment approach over the next five to 10 years. In 2023, it was chosen by 50 per cent of respondents. The latest findings show a clear shift in public pension and sovereign funds' concerns over the medium term.</p><p> It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the political climate of the US is able to exert such influence over a crucial part of the fight to meet net zero. Just four years after these banks and asset managers declared \"climate risk is investment risk\", these alliances are beginning to crumble and pledges are being sidelined.</p><p>US will fall behindDespite the progress made by the Biden administration in attempting to regulate and standardise frameworks and disclosure requirements, the US still trailed Europe in action on climate change. A report by OMFIF and Luxembourg for Finance in 2022 found that \"the US still looks to Europe for guidance on ESG regulation and lags in green equity development\". </p><p> With transition finance set to be bumped down the list of priorities, it stands to reason that the gap between the two jurisdictions will soon become a gulf.</p><p> Elsewhere, China is looking to assume a leading role in the clean energy transition, hoping to dominate the market in the next phase of green innovation. </p><p> It is already the world's largest producer of solar energy and it has set its sights on the EV industry.</p><p> Trump spoke this week of his plans to impose 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports on Feb 1, in addition to the 100 per cent tariff that already exists on Chinese-made EVs. Given Trump's hostility towards both climate change and China, it may be safe to assume that Chinese green technology won't be making its way into the US any time soon.</p><p> However, China's dominance in this field, and the business it will do with the rest of the world, may make some US business leaders rethink a reluctance to engage with the transition. Could a healthy dose of competition be enough to pull the US back into the net-zero game'</p><p> Regardless of the cause of the wildfires, Trump will be unable to ignore the economic devastation wrought across LA. In a fraught political environment, Democrats and Republicans will have to reach across the divide to help those who have lost everything. Even more importantly, they will have to work together to prevent a catastrophe on this scale from happening again.

Initiatives that tap the green budget include Tuas Nexus, which is expected to be the world's first fully energy self-sufficient greenfield facility that integrates water treatment and solid waste management. The facility is estimated to cost about $6 billion. </p><p> The building of more cycling paths is also expected to cost about $1 billion, MOF said in its paper. </p><p> The ministry estimates that it has spent more than $2 billion on green initiatives in the 2021 to 2024 financial years. </p><p> To fund long-term green expenditure beyond 2030, the Government has also introduced measures such as a carbon tax to help fund decarbonisation efforts and support the transition to a green economy, MOF added. </p><p> The Government can also borrow money through green bonds to finance nationally significant green infrastructure projects. This will help to spread the costs across generations that will directly benefit from these projects. </p><p> As at January 2025, the Government has issued $9.2 billion of green bonds to finance the expansion of the electric MRT network, MOF noted. </p><p> Money has also been set aside for coastal protection measures to protect Singapore against rising sea levels. These are estimated to cost more than $100 billion over the next 100 years, and MOF said it has put an initial $5 billion into this fund. </p><p> The ministry has also put $5 billion into a fund to invest in critical infrastructure needed for energy transition, such as undersea cables to import low-carbon electricity and new hydrogen terminals and pipelines. </p><p> Regarding state investors, the Government expects them to take into account the impact of climate change on their investments, said MOF. It noted that GIC, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and investment firm Temasek have integrated sustainability considerations into their investment processes, although the Government does not direct their individual investment decisions or prescribe specific sustainability outcomes. </p><p> MOF said in its paper: \"Climate change has significant interactions with public finances. Governments around the world need to facilitate the carbon transition and adapt nimbly to the effects of climate change, which require significant investments and fiscal resources. </p><p> \"At the same time, climate change can cause severe disruptions to human and economic activities, but also holds the promise of creating new economic opportunities. These, in turn, affect public finances.\" </p><p> It noted that governments face the problem of balancing three things: the pace of decarbonisation, the impact on economic competitiveness, and ensuring fiscal sustainability. </p><p> \"There is a need to balance these trade-offs while allocating finite resources to competing priorities,\" MOF said, adding that this problem is made worse by technological uncertainty and the high costs of decarbonisation pathways. </p><p> Hence, it said, it is important, now more than ever, for governments to incorporate sustainability considerations in the management of public finances. This ensures that budgets are aligned with national climate and sustainability strategies. </p><p> \"Finance serves as a crucial lever to support governments' climate goals, and enable a whole-of-society transformation to achieve optimal sustainability outcomes. If done well, climate mitigation and adaptation can create economic and social benefits,\" MOF said. </p><p> On Jan 23, MOF also released its refreshed Singapore Green Bond Framework. </p><p> First published in 2022, the framework lays out the requirements around sovereign green bonds issued to finance green public sector projects. It ensures that the public sector upholds a high level of green standards in line with best practices in the industry. </p><p> \"The addition of these science-based and robust thresholds ensures that the projects financed by public sector green bonds under the framework will contribute substantially to Singapore's climate ambition,\" MOF said. </p><p> The framework governs factors such as what the proceeds from the green bonds will be used for, what sort of projects will be funded, how the proceeds from the green bonds are tracked, and how the whole process is reported to investors. </p><p> The Singapore Government has planned to issue up to $35 billion in public sector green bonds by 2030 to support the growth of the sustainable finance market here. </p><p> These issuances will also help to attract green capital and investors, and anchor Singapore as a green finance hub in Asia, MOF said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In total, the Government expects to commit more than $10 billion in fiscal spending for projects like the management of climate-related risks in the decade up to financial year 2030, under the Singapore Green Plan.

Some also expect Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also the finance minister, to speak about infrastructure for adapting to climate change in the Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18). The cost and talent requirements for sustainability reporting are key concerns for companies. All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. These disclosures include a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\u00e2\u20ac said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p>Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\u00e2\u20ac he said. He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\u00e2\u20ac Chia said. The reporting of Scope 3 emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which arise from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstream and downstream value chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date. We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\u00e2\u20ac said Ng. Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate. Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). From 2024, companies subject to Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.Carbon markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\u00e2\u20ac, said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\u00e2\u20ac he said. To spur the supply of carbon credits, start-up incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit. EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.While no announcements are expected on Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr Rao.Targeted help for SMEsSeveral market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. While Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\u00e2\u20ac, said Helge Muenkel, DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief sustainability officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\u00e2\u20ac he said. Eric Lian, UOB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac To accelerate SMEs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. Climate adaptationSome industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\u00e2\u20acEY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tekchandani similarly expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\u00e2\u20ac. This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience. Budget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\u00e2\u20ac he said. DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pragmatic and long-term approach, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\u00e2\u20ac.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F4V-JS93-RT4M-90GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These disclosures include a company's direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.</p><p> Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company's first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.</p><p> Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. </p><p> \"Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\" said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p> Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. </p><p> \"One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\" he said. </p><p> He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.</p><p> Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. </p><p> \"The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\" Chia said. </p><p> The reporting of Scope 3 emissions -- which arise from a company's upstream and downstream value chains -- is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.</p><p> Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company's entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. </p><p> \"Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date.</p><p> \"We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\" said Ng. </p><p> Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. </p><p> Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate.</p><p> Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). </p><p> From 2024, companies subject to Singapore's carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.</p><p> Carbon markets \"need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\", said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. </p><p> \"While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\" he said. </p><p> To spur the supply of carbon credits, startup incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. </p><p> On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit.</p><p> EY's Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.</p><p> While no announcements are expected on Singapore's carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative.</p><p> \"This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\" said Dr Rao.</p><p> Several market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. </p><p> While Singapore's carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \"there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\", said Helge Muenkel, DBS' chief sustainability officer.</p><p> \"Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions, will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\" he said.</p><p> Eric Lian, UOB's head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \"SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\"</p><p> To accelerate SMEs' sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. </p><p> The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. </p><p> Some industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN's Lim: \"As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures -- such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management -- to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\"</p><p> EY's Tekchandani similarly expects a \"strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\". This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience.</p><p> Challenging timeBudget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. </p><p> But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh.</p><p> \"Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\" he said. </p><p> DBS' Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore's pragmatic and long-term approach, \"balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025.

This was 30 per cent higher than the year before, making it the most expensive year on record for natural disasters. As devastating wildfires burn in Los Angeles, 2025 could prove to be even dearer.Climate change has intensified the dangers of wildfires, meaning disaster events are more likely to occur outside of the typical wildfire season. With global temperatures exceeding an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, this is only going to become more difficult to mitigate and adapt to.Economic burden for AmericansJPMorgan estimates that the economic cost of the LA wildfires will total around US$50 billion. </p><p>However, only US$20 billion of this will be insured, so there is a significant protection gap. In recent years, as wildfires become bigger and harder to control, many insurers have decided against offering protection in high-risk areas, which has exacerbated the economic burden for many Americans.US President Donald Trump has been vocal about his scepticism of the threat climate change poses, labelling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hoax\u00e2\u20ac and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the great scams of all time\u00e2\u20ac during his campaign in 2024. In his first term, he withdrew the US from the 2015 Paris agreement in a major setback to efforts to curb the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emissions. He has vowed in his second term to repeal environmental rules introduced by the Joe Biden administration, end public spending on clean energy, scrap incentives for Americans to buy electric vehicles and embark on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drill, baby, drill\u00e2\u20ac drive for new fossil fuel energy. On his first day in office this week, Trump once again withdrew the US from the Paris agreement and halted more than US$300 billion in green infrastructure funding as part of his plan to undo the progress made by Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team.This will have drastic implications for transition finance. A move towards greater de-regulation will override much of the Biden administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important work to hold industries to account for their emissions and counter the risk of greenwashing through disclosure requirements. There has already been a widespread retreat of banks and asset managers from many of the frameworks and alliances that were established following COP26 in 2021. Since the Nov 5 US election, all six of the largest US banks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. BlackRock, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest asset manager, has left Net Zero Asset Managers, the equivalent organisation for money managers. And just a few days after Trump took office, the Federal Reserve left the Network for Greening the Financial System in a blow to central bank net-zero efforts.In OMFIF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Public Funds 2024, not a single survey respondent chose climate change when asked to identify the top three economic factors affecting their investment approach over the next five to 10 years. In 2023, it was chosen by 50 per cent of respondents. The latest findings show a clear shift in public pension and sovereign funds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns over the medium term.It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the political climate of the US is able to exert such influence over a crucial part of the fight to meet net zero. Just four years after these banks and asset managers declared \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climate risk is investment risk\u00e2\u20ac, these alliances are beginning to crumble and pledges are being sidelined.US will fall behindDespite the progress made by the Biden administration in attempting to regulate and standardise frameworks and disclosure requirements, the US still trailed Europe in action on climate change. A report by OMFIF and Luxembourg for Finance in 2022 found that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the US still looks to Europe for guidance on ESG regulation and lags in green equity development\u00e2\u20ac. With transition finance set to be bumped down the list of priorities, it stands to reason that the gap between the two jurisdictions will soon become a gulf.Elsewhere, China is looking to assume a leading role in the clean energy transition, hoping to dominate the market in the next phase of green innovation. It is already the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producer of solar energy and it has set its sights on the EV industry. Trump spoke this week of his plans to impose 10 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports on Feb 1, in addition to the 100 per cent tariff that already exists on Chinese-made EVs. Given Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hostility towards both climate change and China, it may be safe to assume that Chinese green technology won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be making its way into the US any time soon.However, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance in this field, and the business it will do with the rest of the world, may make some US business leaders rethink a reluctance to engage with the transition. Could a healthy dose of competition be enough to pull the US back into the net-zero game? Regardless of the cause of the wildfires, Trump will be unable to ignore the economic devastation wrought across LA. In a fraught political environment, Democrats and Republicans will have to reach across the divide to help those who have lost everything. Even more importantly, they will have to work together to prevent a catastrophe on this scale from happening again.

Introduction</p><p>1. A very good afternoon to everyone. I am delighted to join you and open today's Sustainability Apex Programme (SAP) event, a unique gathering of legal and accounting professionals committed to navigating one of the defining challenges of our time - sustainability.</p><p>B.Evolving Global Sustainability Landscape</p><p>2. The world is at a critical juncture in the sustainability transition.</p><p>a. Climate risks, regulatory shifts and market expectations are driving unprecedented change.</p><p>b. Businesses are no longer asking whether sustainability matters, but rather, how they can adapt, innovate, and integrate sustainable practices to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving global economy.</p><p>3. However, shifting political tides hint at potential headwinds to global climate action.</p><p>a. The US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and is increasing oil and gas production.</p><p>b. More recently, with political tides in Europe turning to the right, the European Commission has proposed an \"Omnibus\" package to streamline ESG reporting rules, leaving investors concerned about weakened accountability for businesses.</p><p>4.Given these developments, it is understandable for businesses to be concerned about what these developments mean for you. Will there still be demand for sustainability-related professional services? Is this the right time to invest resources and strengthen capabilities? These are questions I'm sure you are asking yourselves.</p><p>5. The reality of climate change transcends political discourse. The science and data are clear - climate change is not a distant threat but a present reality. Singapore's response must be grounded in this scientific truth. As a small country, we cannot afford the luxury of not being ready for climate change. We have no high hills in which to retreat, we have no hinterlands in which to expand. Singapore is a small island faced with rising sea levels. For us, this is an existential issue. So, we have no choice but to deal with these issues squarely. Singapore needs to be ready, regardless of trends elsewhere; we have to take decisive and proactive actions to seize the opportunities.</p><p>6.Aside from politics, there are two other important drivers of climate action.</p><p>a.First, economics. Scaling up key green technologies has made the cost of renewable energy more affordable. The average levelised cost of solar energy globally, for instance, is now 50% lower than that of fossil fuels. This explains why two-third of global energy investment in 2024 went to clean energy technologies and infrastructure. Green growth opportunities remain, and continue to be driven by market forces.</p><p>b. Second and more importantly, nature. Nature is not going to wait for us. As climate change accelerates, the devastation wrought on people and on infrastructure will intensify; the last 10 years alone have been the hottest years on record. The public will demand that governments and companies take urgent action. Nature will force the world to take decisive actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>7. Against this backdrop, organisations must prepare for the long term and be ready to reap the green economic opportunities that have and will continue to arise. Those which lag behind will be forced to act eventually and will experience a more disruptive transition. So, the essence is to change before you are made to change.</p><p>C. Growth Opportunities in Sustainability</p><p>8. Professional services firms here play an important role in strengthening the sustainability ecosystem.</p><p>9.As companies across industries face growing regulatory requirements, investor scrutiny, and customer demand for responsible business practices, they are turning to professional services for guidance to navigate this transition. In short, they will be running to many people in this room.</p><p>a. Today, organisations increasingly turn to consultants to help develop and implement sustainability strategies, integrate sustainability into corporate decision-making, and identify opportunities for innovation amidst the sustainability push.</p><p>b.Lawyers are increasingly called upon to navigate the complexities of sustainability regulations, manage climate-related litigation and compliance risks, and advise on green financing disclosures.</p><p>c.Accountants are stepping up as gatekeepers of financial integrity, ensuring companies accurately measure, report, and verify sustainability data in ways that are robust and auditable.</p><p>10.I encourage professional services firms to proactively adapt to such needs - by expanding your service offerings, integrating emerging technologies and develop specialised expertise.</p><p>a. This allows your firms to unlock new market opportunities arising from sustainability, build client trust at an early stage, and lead the transition to a green economy.</p><p>D. Singapore as a sustainability hub</p><p>11.Singapore is the ideal hub for professional services firm looking to seize new opportunities in sustainability. Let me share three key factors.</p><p>12. First, the Singapore Government is committed to sustainability.</p><p>13. Singapore has made clear our stance on climate action and continues to drive initiatives to support the green transition.</p><p>a. Through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have laid out a comprehensive roadmap, outlining key targets to advance sustainable development, green infrastructure, and carbon reduction efforts. Businesses are able to tap into a structured framework that supports their sustainability ambitions.</p><p>b. We have also introduced the first carbon pricing scheme in Southeast Asia, with carbon tax increasing from S$5 per tonne in 2019 to between S$50 and S$80 by 2030, creating stronger incentives for decarbonisation.</p><p>c. In addition, the government has also rolled out a suite of sustainable finance initiatives to encourage responsible investment and accelerate green financing. Singapore is a trusted financial centre and is also ASEAN's largest sustainable debt market. Sustainable debt issuances grew year-on-year by 7% in 2023, to about S$38 billion. Over S$130 billion of sustainable bonds and loans were issued between 2018 and 2023.</p><p>d.To spur green and transition activities and mitigate the risks of greenwashing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, or SAT in short, in end 2023. Companies and financial institutions can use the SAT in various ways such as developing sustainability frameworks or structuring green and transition financing solutions that are aligned with or refer to the SAT criteria.</p><p>e.In particular, the three local banks have either completed or are in the process of updating their sustainable financing frameworks to integrate the SAT, and will be using the SAT as a key reference tool in the structuring of green or transition financing solutions going forward.</p><p>f.Singapore's professional services sector plays a vital role in advancing the sustainable finance agenda and is well-placed to participate in these opportunities. Let me give you an example:</p><p>i. Sembcorp's updated Green Financing Framework 2024, draws reference from the SAT in defining what is \"green\" for its energy projects. To ensure credibility of the framework, Sembcorp has engaged a professional services firm for its pre-issuance external assurance. Moving forward, Sembcorp also intends to engage external review providers for its post-issuance reviews.</p><p>g.MAS has recently published an Information Note that showcases practical applications of the SAT by corporates and financial institutions. I encourage the sector to take a look at the SAT, and contribute your specialised expertise and knowledge in the area of sustainable finance because your clients will need your advice.</p><p>14. Second, there is growing demand for sustainability solutions in Singapore.</p><p>15. As a global business hub, Singapore is home to a wide range of regional headquarters, financial institutions and multinational corporations. Many of these companies are embedding sustainability at the core of their strategies - driven either by their corporate commitment to sustainability, or due to sustainability regulations. Corporate demand for sustainability reporting and advisory, carbon accounting and other carbon services will only increase.</p><p>16. Beyond that, Singapore's green economy is also growing.</p><p>a. Singapore is emerging as Asia's green finance hub, with sustainable investment flows increasing across multiple sectors.</p><p>b. Singapore is also investing heavily in green technology, sustainable urban development and clean energy - all of these will unlock new service opportunities for professional services firms.</p><p>17. Third, Singapore has a high concentration of sustainability players here.</p><p>18. We host an increasing number of global sustainability leaders - from large corporates, to major renewable energy firms and carbon market players; ESG-focused investment funds, private equity firms and banks; and a comprehensive range of sustainability solutions providers, such as yourself.</p><p>19. With a robust network of sustainability players concentrated in Singapore, professional services firms have the opportunity to leverage partnerships, deepen expertise, and expand your sustainability service offerings.</p><p>E. Seizing Opportunities in Sustainability</p><p>20.Collaboration is key to capturing the opportunities from sustainability.</p><p>a. The sustainability challenge is complex, spanning multiple industries and disciplines. No single firm can address these issues alone.</p><p>21.The Singapore Government is committed to supporting professional services firms harness new opportunities arising from sustainability.</p><p>a. We recognise that professional services firms play a crucial role in shaping sustainable business practices, and are actively creating platforms to facilitate engagement, knowledge-sharing and capacity building.</p><p>b. Initiatives such as the Sustainability Apex Programme (SAP), spearheaded by ISCA (Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants) and LawSoc (Law Society of Singapore) and enabled by Enterprise Singapore, were designed precisely to provide a space for firms to come together, exchange insights, and explore collaboration opportunities. This builds on the earlier Committee of Future Economy's work, where we identified that greater collaboration among professional services firms such as accounting and legal will benefit from the synergies, and in time to come, we will see how we can add on other types of professional services, but this is a good start.</p><p>c. The Ministry of Law, Singapore Economic Development Board and Enterprise Singapore have also commissioned PwC Singapore to conduct a study to map out sustainability opportunities for the legal services sector - PwC will be sharing key findings from this study later.</p><p>d. These initiatives underscore our commitment to ensuring that professional services firms have the necessary resources, networks, and policy support to succeed in the green economy.</p><p>F. Conclusion</p><p>22.In closing, sustainability is not just an imperative - it is an opportunity for the professional services sector to develop new capabilities and work together to create new growth engines.</p><p>23. I would like to thank all of you for taking time off your busy schedules to join us for this event as well as PwC for supporting us throughout this journey.

As at end-March 2022, it had over US$1.5 trillion in assets under management -- a phenomenal figure that has the potential to shape the world and its future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And that is precisely what Franklin Templeton aims to do. The California headquartered global asset manager strongly believes that being a responsible steward of client capital is crucial to their goal of delivering better client outcomes and essential to these efforts is consideration of sustainable investment factors.</p><p> The firm has been and continues to be committed to supporting and strengthening the consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) opportunities and risks across its entire platform. It sees increasing client demand for ESG, sustainable or \"green\" investment products as perhaps the greatest driver of change in the asset management industry.</p><p> The firm's clients also broadly hold the same opinion. ESG factors are quickly becoming relevant to an increasing breadth of investors -- not just as a matter of principle but as recognition of the exigent risks to regions, economies and capital markets. </p><p> Financial markets are facing an inflection point on climate change. Generating sustainable, risk-adjusted returns -- in a holistic manner -- is core to the company's role as investment managers.</p><p> Picking winnersAs stewards of clients' assets, Franklin Templeton states that its goal is to provide the best guidance it can for investors. </p><p> With this mindset, the investment manager continues to work towards improving its investing processes and move towards the goal of being the leader in the asset management landscape when it comes to positioning its clients for climate change.</p><p> But as governments around the world push towards decarbonisation and a green future -- with an eye on the broad target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 -- not all companies are poised to benefit equally. </p><p> Here, Franklin Templeton believes stock selection and active management will be key to sift the long-term winners from the losers.</p><p> And it has already picked one potential winner from the sustainable investing trend: Infrastructure.</p><p> The firm believes that as decarbonisation efforts ramp up, green infrastructure projects will be plenty and their scale, significant. This will be a key tailwind for infrastructure players that are well positioned to undertake such generation changing projects and expand their asset bases along the way.</p><p> For example, some green infrastructure projects include the electrification of public transport systems, incentivising electric vehicle (EV) adoption and modernising power grids. </p><p> The International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that global spending on electricity systems should nearly treble by 2030 to be on track to achieve targeted net zero outcomes.</p><p> Such spending entails building a more comprehensive network of EV charging stations and upgrading electric transmission and distribution grids to handle the rising share of renewables such as wind and solar in electricity generation.</p><p> Given the enormity of the task, the private sector is key to ease pressure on public finance, where infrastructure companies such as electric utilities and toll roads can help mobilise private capital to invest in decarbonisation initiatives.</p><p> More than a few of these green infrastructure projects are likely to be through public-private partnerships. In these cases, the infrastructure companies typically hold long-term contracts with governments that define an allowed rate of return on their asset bases. </p><p> Subsequent spending on infrastructure upgrades and new infrastructure builds will also expand these asset bases and, in turn, boost earnings, cash flows and dividends.</p><p> The runway for growth of the infrastructure sector is long and attractive, given that this is only the beginning of a multi-decade shift towards net-zero. </p><p> Green networksWhile Franklin Templeton is leading the charge towards a green future, it is by no means working alone.</p><p> The investment manager also works with a wide range of organisations that are establishing and promoting best practices for incorporating sustainability into investment processes.</p><p> Among others, it is a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the leading global investor network that champions responsible investing. </p><p> As part of this commitment, Franklin Templeton is represented on the Select Advisory Committee to the Assessing Sovereign Climate-related Opportunities and Risk (ASCOR) Initiative. </p><p> It is also a member of the Ceres Investor Network on Climate Risk and Sustainability, which includes more than 200 institutional investors managing more than US$47 trillion in assets.</p><p> In addition, Franklin Templeton is a signatory to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and an investor signatory to CDP, a global environmental disclosure organisation formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project. </p><p> Last year, the company also joined the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAMI) in support of its goal of addressing climate change through investment practices aligned with reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner. Its participation reinforces the firm's commitment to addressing climate-related issues through data-driven investment decisions.</p><p> As an investment manager with offices in more than 30 countries globally and approximately 1,300 investment professionals, Franklin Templeton recognises the powerful influence it can have in this area by coordinating its efforts within a global strategic framework.</p><p> Internally, the company is also incorporating sustainability into its DNA.</p><p> In March 2021, Franklin Templeton established a firm-wide Stewardship and Sustainability Council, comprising key investment leaders from each of its specialist investment managers, to leverage the wealth of expertise across its autonomous investment teams.</p><p> In addition to the dedicated experts within its specialist investment managers, Franklin Templeton's Global Sustainability\u00a0Strategy Team engages\u00a0its investment teams and risk management professionals to help\u00a0them recognise and understand the impact and scope of material ESG\u00a0issues. On top of this, they consult on sustainable investment topics in their analysis, and use research and tools to ensure that ESG issues are addressed throughout the company's investment\u00a0processes.</p><p> In February this year, Franklin Templeton appointed its first global head of sustainability. In the newly created role, Anne Simpson reports directly to president and CEO Jenny Johnson, while driving the firm's overall strategic direction on stewardship and sustainable investment strategy. </p><p> Simpson works in close partnership with Dr Ben Meng, Franklin Templeton's executive vice president and chairman of Asia-Pacific, and its executive sponsor of sustainability.</p><p> To showcase its commitment to sustainable investing, Franklin Templeton is planning to hold a sustainable investing forum in Singapore later this year.</p><p> Franklin Templeton's long-term goal is to be a global leader in stewardship and sustainable investing, and to extend that leadership through collaborative participation in key industry initiatives and partnerships.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-7K869C</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65K1-9TX1-DYX4-02K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1248\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

These standards will ensure that the international carbon market is of high integrity and that emissions reductions and removals are real, additional, verified, and measurable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Work began in October when Azerbaijan hosted a meeting of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body, which proposed a set of standards for Article 6.4. The COP29 Presidency says it \"built support\" for these standards at \"Pre-COP\", a series of negotiations held on Oct 10 and Oct 11.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COP29 will run from Nov 11 to Nov 22 in the capital of Baku, with some 70,000 delegates registered to attend.</p><p>The Nov 11 opening plenary was delayed multiple times, and the Article 6.4 text was adopted within an hour at 9.50pm in Azerbaijan (1.50am, Nov 12 in Singapore).</p><p>Some climate groups had warned that the COP29 Presidency could gavel through the Article 6.4 text before governments could properly negotiate it. US-headquartered non-profit group Corporate Accountability had issued a release just hours before that the COP29 Presidency was \"rumoured to risk departing from precedent\" by passing the \"risky text on carbon removals\".</p><p>Among the 12 members of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body is Benedict Chia, director general (climate change) from the National Climate Change Secretariat in the Prime Minister's Office, Singapore.</p><p>International environmental organisation 350.org says the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body - a \"small technical committee\" - took an \"unprecedented step\" of finalising and implementing rules for \"speculative\" carbon removal in markets \"without wider state input\".</p><p>\"This bypasses countries' ability to revise and strengthen these standards,\" says 350.org in a post on X, formerly Twitter.</p><p>\"At COP27 and COP28, governments rejected draft rules on carbon removal, warning that they could weaken climate action and encourage risky approaches like carbon capture and geoengineering. Now, these rules are moving forward without the same scrutiny,\" it adds in a subsequent post.</p><p>Kicking off COP29 with a \"back-door deal\" sets a poor precedent for transparency and proper governance, says Isa Mulder, a policy expert on global carbon markets at research firm Carbon Market Watch, to Bloomberg. \"If these texts can be adopted this way, where do we draw the line?\"</p><p>Olga Gassan-zade, a current member and former head of the Article 6.4 Supervisory Body, says in a comment on her personal LinkedIn page: \"The criticisms of the process are fair, but it was also critically important to operationalise Article 6.4 as soon as possible to scale up the delivery of carbon finance to the developing world.\"</p><p>Article 6 of the Paris Agreement outlines how countries can pursue voluntary cooperation to reach their climate targets. This means countries can collaborate to achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) or plans to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change by trading carbon credits.</p><p>Countries first established the framework for international carbon trading through Article 6 in late 2021, but talks have stalled. Article 6-compliant markets will be a critical tool for channelling more investment to developing countries, allowing countries to target mitigation efforts to where costs are lowest.</p><p>The standards for Article 6.4 agreed upon are not set in stone. As they are governed by the CMA - or the states that are parties to the Paris Agreement - the parties will be able to enhance them further \"as they see fit\", says the COP29 Presidency.</p><p>Parties still need to agree on the remaining building blocks of Article 6, including Article 6.2 and the final elements of Article 6.4.</p><p>Article 6.2 enables a host country on track to exceed its NDC target to trade units in exchange for investments, support for capacity-building and access to technologies.</p><p>Once Article 6 negotiations have concluded, the COP29 Presidency says it will encourage the uptake of Article 6 carbon trading so that countries can realise its potential benefits.

And there, you go back again to a different structure -- which could be a public-private partnership or another structure -- how you can mobilise money for the region where it is actually most needed,\" said Speth. </p><p> Bigger expectationsWhile investors typically get more leverage for every dollar of investment in emerging markets, the higher returns they are getting now from the EU and the US has led them to have bigger expectations on the premium they can get from emerging markets -- given that these markets are perceived to have higher risks. </p><p> Blended finance is a capital-raising approach that leans on investors with higher risk appetites, such as development funds and philanthropists or governments, to provide concessional or catalytic capital to pull in more commercial investors. </p><p> The main thrust of blended finance is for concessional or catalytic capital to lower investment risks or the costs of capital through guarantees or first loss, thereby attracting more commercial capital. </p><p> Discussions on using this financing mechanism to fund the energy transition in South-east Asia have been gaining traction. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has launched a blended finance initiative known as Financing Asia's Transition Partnership last year, with the goal of raising US$5 billion.</p><p> However, Speth cited several challenges inhibiting the scaling up of blended finance in South-east Asia. \"The thing about blended finance is a lot of people need to come together, and all of them have different interests, so you need to have a really good project manager who's aligning all these things, because we can only do this as a team.\"</p><p> \"And then it takes time to create these (blended finance) vehicles. It's a risk-adjusted return. So if you have different parties in that vehicle, some are willing to take either fixed returns or lower returns... But you need to find that party first to be able to blend this with institutional capital,\" she added. </p><p> Investors are also looking for a stable regulatory environment to deploy their funds. Asset managers like BlackRock will not make their investment decisions by taking a risk on regulation, said Speth. </p><p> A liberalised energy market, such as the Philippines', is the most efficient and cheap in the long term. </p><p> However, Speth also recognised that governments in South-east Asia are unable to transform their energy markets overnight as energy prices need to be kept at a level where its affordable for consumers. </p><p> \"I think it's finding the right balance, and probably we will take some time until you can do that entire shift... All these markets, they have cycles, and they are going to be a 20 or 30-year journey. It's not going to be one, or two years where energy transition will be our main focus,\" she added. </p><p> Broader macro themesBeyond just how the energy market is regulated, Brad Kim, BlackRock's managing director of global infrastructure fund in Asia-Pacific, said that asset managers also look at broader macro themes as well, such as how governments in the region are aligning policies relating to artificial intelligence (AI), supply chain and energy transition. </p><p> \"(The region) is so spread out between a very large area -- lots of islands, lots of seas, lots of different countries. Everything has to travel, including energy. And so there's a huge convergence that's happening,\" he said. </p><p> \"When we look at how do we invest into climate or into decarbonisation or transition, it's also very important to look at: What's the step further? Who's using this green energy? Which countries are investing into AI-enabled data centres as the next theme, and who is then going to be looking for these new green infrastructure -- the batteries and the low-carbon (electricity) generation,\" he added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Workers at the South Luzon Thermal Energy Corporation power plant outside Manila.

He added that net inflows in Q3 2024 would have been higher than the same period a year ago if this exchange-traded fund (ETF) were excluded. </p><p> Despite the on-year decline, UOB's Wong noted that investors are not redeeming their ESG-themed funds, as they understand that these are long-term investment instruments and are prepared to hold on regardless of short-term changes in sentiment. </p><p> \"We also believe that the broader ESG trend remains intact, as both institutional and retail investors increasingly consider sustainability factors in their long-term investment strategies, and value the importance of responsible investment practices. Regulatory developments, corporate sustainability disclosures and consumer demand for responsible business practices are expected to support ESG investing in Asean over the longer term,\" he added. </p><p> Shum also added that the sustainable investments universe in South-east Asia is broader than open-ended and ETFs domiciled in the region. </p><p> \"We see capital flows into other asset classes and areas. For example, many projects or companies contributing to sustainable development in Asean are early-stage or small and medium-sized enterprises, which are attracting funding from the philanthropic and private markets -- for example, venture capital, microfinance, private equity and private debt -- as well as public funding support for infrastructure,\" she added. </p><p> While ESG funds may have seen lower amounts of net inflow in Q3 2024, the returns were much higher than last year, averaging a three-month return at 16.96 per cent -- an improvement from -3.54 per cent a year ago.</p><p> ESG funds performed better than non-ESG funds, which managed an average quarterly return of 14.74 per cent, reversing from -1.85 per cent this time last year. </p><p> Notwithstanding the re-election of former US president Donald Trump -- who is a well-known climate sceptic -- fund managers foresee continued investor interest in ESG investing, with long-term capital flows into sustainable investments for South-east Asia. </p><p> Oil and gas stocks had surged, while renewable energy stocks had slumped in the immediate aftermath of Trump's election victory earlier in November. Besides being a climate sceptic, Trump had previously said that he will expand oil and gas production, and withdraw the US -- once again -- from the Paris Agreement. </p><p> FundamentalsWhile markets may react in the short term to political events, Fidelity's Wong said that they tend to be driven by fundamentals over time and that investors focus on long-term fundamentals rather than try to predict near-term outcomes.</p><p> Despite concerns that Trump will not be supportive of policies that further the ESG agenda and may even roll back some existing policies, such as the Inflation Reduction Act which provides tax incentives for clean-energy technologies, UOB's Wong said that global initiatives to address climate change remain. </p><p> This includes the adoption of rules governing the global trading of carbon markets, as well as the setting of a new climate finance quantum that developed countries are obligated to provide for developing countries at the recently concluded United Nations' COP29 climate summit. </p><p> \"We expect these developments to drive the momentum in sustainability,\" said UOB's Wong. </p><p> Beyond global developments, there continues to be persistent interest among institutional investors in South-east Asia to incorporate ESG into their investment mandates, he added.</p><p> In addition, more affordable renewable energy sources, record power demand requiring multiple sources of energy, as well as growing disclosure requirements will push businesses towards climate mitigation and adaptation, said Shum. </p><p> \"For 2025, we anticipate a growing alignment between financial returns and sustainable investment principles as ESG-related opportunities in sectors like renewable energy, technology and green infrastructure expand. These trends are expected to complement traditional investment strategies, rather than compete with them,\" said UOB's Wong. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amid wider geopolitical uncertainties, the focus on securing yields have led investors to prefer large-cap index stocks as well as fixed income or money market funds -- investment products that typically do not come with an ESG label.

Advanced economies including the European Union, Japan and the US had accounted for the majority of completed cleantech FDI projects, but in recent years, investments have increasingly come from within the region and Asian neighbours such as China and South Korea.</p><p> However, despite its stellar increase in recent years, cleantech FDI flows remain only a small share of total FDI -- representing about 15 per cent of total FDI stock in Asean, less than 20 per cent for the EU, and slightly more than 10 per cent for China. Similarly, despite all the buzz about cleantech goods trade, exports of these goods amount to only less than 8 per cent of total goods exports for any Asean country between 2011 and 2021 -- with little rising trend.</p><p> The green sectors are still too small compared to the entire economy. To consider a true transition towards sustainability, one must also look at other sectors -- and these other sectors currently have a higher emission intensity.</p><p> On average, for Asean, every dollar of output by the entire economy amounts to almost five times the emissions of a dollar of output within the key cleantech industries alone.</p><p> Emissions-reducing technological innovation applicable to sectors outside the cleantech sector could be that missing link between driving economic growth and decarbonising the economy.</p><p> Innovation: The key to balancing the emissions-growth dilemmaUntil carbon storage technologies are widely available, emissions-mitigating technologies for production processes are particularly relevant as countries expand their carbon pricing schemes and seek to decarbonise their supply chains.</p><p> A case in point is the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism that came into force in October last year. It effectively imposes an additional carbon price on high-emissions imports such as cement and steel from countries with more lax climate regulations.</p><p> As the global regulatory environment tightens, innovating operational and production processes might just become a daily reality for firms to comply with regulations, stay competitive and keep afloat.</p><p> Asean boasts quite a number of inventions and applications of climate change mitigation technology patents targeting production processes -- especially for the chemical industry, and increasingly also for metal processing and agriculture. But Asean still lags in terms of overall green tech patent invention and application, accounting for less than 1 per cent of the total number of green tech patents, both as a destination market for patent filings and as an inventor.</p><p> Fostering international collaboration may help more green technology diffuse to Asean, particularly for countries lagging in innovative capacity.</p><p> Among the leading three green tech inventors within the region -- Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines -- only 20 to 40 per cent of their inventions have a foreign co-inventor, but for Vietnam and Indonesia, almost 90 per cent of their inventions involve foreign collaboration.</p><p> Beyond innovation: Policy and finance for a sustainable AseanTo take the sustainability narrative beyond the cleantech sectors into the wider economy, it is essential to support businesses of all sizes to take up green innovations and transform operation and production processes.</p><p> Turning environmental risks into opportunities requires more efficient public-private sector interactions, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, which include simplifying regulations and creating a transparent financing and resource support environment, as Singapore Business Federation's head of Net Zero Transition Programme Office Hu Ching pointed out during the Festival of Ideas organised by Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. </p><p> In addition, riding on the rising interest in sustainable investment, the region can grasp the opportunity to attract more private funding to finance greening the economy. Innovative financial solutions combined with active client engagement are critical in supporting all kinds of businesses to overcome the initial hurdles and attain their net-zero targets, according to OCBC group chief sustainability officer Mike Ng.</p><p> A mix of green tech innovation applicable to the wider economy, inclusive strategies that provide firms -- particularly SMEs -- with the tools they need for making the transition, a coherent and competitive policy framework, and expanded financing opportunities will help Asean to go beyond the hype and deliver on the green growth promise.</p><p> The writers are researchers from the Asia Competitiveness Institute, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fostering international collaboration may help more green technology diffuse to Asean, particularly for countries lagging in innovative capacity.

This is about as close as a green-tech firm can get to being Trump-proof. </p><p> It is well known that climate-change sceptic Trump prioritises fossil fuels. His administration may repeal parts of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act through which the Biden administration has funnelled billions of dollars towards solar power, electric vehicles, carbon sequestration, hydrogen and other clean energy technologies. </p><p> Mr Farrant, a 40-year-old Australian and Singapore permanent resident, is among a small tribe of savvy Singapore-based entrepreneurs slowly finding a footing in the world's largest green economy. </p><p> The US accounts for 60 per cent of global green economy market capitalisation, followed by Taiwan with 6 per cent, and China with 5 per cent, according to the London Stock Exchange Group study, Investing in the green economy 2024.</p><p> Another entrepreneur, Mr Jogjaman Jap, is the founder and chief executive of Spectronik, a start-up that makes hydrogen fuel cells. Bigger players in his field are fretting over the lack of nationwide hydrogen infrastructure in the US. They fear that generous government subsidies could dry up or big regulatory changes are coming.  </p><p> But Mr Jogjaman, a 39-year-old Singaporean, is not worried because his focus is on portable power applications and niche markets. Think autonomous lawnmowers and drones, which run longer and cheaper on his fuel cells.</p><p> A drone using his fuel cells can fly for three hours on less than a kilogram of hydrogen gas. </p><p> The intensely competitive US market can seem hard to break into, but opportunities are not lacking for Singapore companies that recognise the draws of America's massive market, its strong funding ecosystem and the hunger for the next big thing.</p><p> As Ms Lim Seow Hui, director of the Americas Division at Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG), puts it: \"The US is an attractive market for Singapore businesses due to its huge consumer base and concentration of large corporates with manufacturing and supply chain needs. It is also a good source for technology partnerships, investments and talent.\"</p><p> EnterpriseSG has seen an increase in Singapore companies exploring US opportunities. \"We have supported over 70 per cent more companies to explore overseas activities in 2023 compared with that in 2022,\" Ms Lim said.</p><p> \"Singapore start-ups and companies see the potential and are already offering solutions across renewable energy, green infrastructure and agri-food technologies.\"</p><p> Mr Farrant saw an opportunity in the prevalent method of recycling used lithium-ion batteries. It involves shredding and processing them into a black mass that is exported, usually to China and South Korea, for further processing. </p><p> He entered the US market promising a better way through technology developed by his start-up, which he co-founded in 2019 with Dr Reza Katal, an Iranian permanent resident of Australia who earned his doctorate from the National University of Singapore.</p><p> \"We recycle 100 per cent of the battery, so nothing gets wasted,\" said Mr Farrant.</p><p> \"We take the highest value elements like nickel, cobalt, manganese, lithium and, to a lesser extent, graphite, and completely purify them to make sure that they're ready for reuse in batteries. </p><p> \"About 1 per cent goes into what we call the impurity stream and that goes into cement production, or alloy production, so all of it gets reused.\"</p><p> In the world of hydrogen fuel cells, Mr Jogjaman of Spectronik is serving an alternative that outclasses the usual batteries, used to power robots, drones and such, and can be refuelled faster than you can read an article on climate change. </p><p> The entrepreneur, who holds a master's in engineering, said his firm's portable hydrogen fuel cells offer three times the energy density of traditional batteries and can be refuelled in just five minutes. </p><p> They have worked well for one of his customers, a firm in San Antonio, Texas, that supplies autonomous lawnmowers for vegetation management at solar farms. </p><p> \"If the robot uses a battery, it can cut grass for an hour and has to be recharged for an hour. With our hydrogen fuel cell, it can cut grass for three hours and recharge in five minutes. This translates to huge productivity gains and cost savings,\" he added. </p><p> Mr Jogjaman's clients also include American defence and aerospace companies that cannot buy fuel cells from China, which the US regards as an adversary. He said: \"Because we are a Singapore company, we are uniquely positioned to serve US customers who cannot purchase fuel cells from other sources.\"</p><p> Beyond clean power, EnterpriseSG also sees opportunities for Singapore firms applying technology and innovation in the agriculture and food sectors. \"The consumer base in the US is shifting to be more health and environmentally conscious,\" said Ms Lim.</p><p> That was the draw for Mr Mathew Howe, an engineering graduate who founded Grobrix in 2019 after a career in financial markets. He offers a subscription-based service for indoor farming that is part salad bar and part art. </p><p> Mr Howe, a Briton who is a Singapore permanent resident, caters to hotels, spas and corporate offices. </p><p> \"I believe that there will be a time when all offices will have an edible garden, in the same way that they have a coffee machine,\" said the 42-year-old.</p><p> After tasting success in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Grobrix branched into Boston, in partnership with Green City Growers, a local firm that services more than 250 urban farms in offices, schools and healthcare facilities. </p><p> \"In the US, there's a big issue with where our food's coming from. It's a growing trend with people like myself who have young children. The produce is not fresh, the prices are going through the roof,\" said Mr Jason Capracotta, Grobrix's US general manager. He sees an opportunity with health- and price-conscious Americans not wanting veggies brought in on long-haul trucks. </p><p> As the US green scene braces itself for some turbulence after Trump returns to office in January, these Singapore firms are prepared to ride it out one recycled battery, one office lettuce at a time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Green Li-ion co-founder Leon Farrant entered the US market promising a better way of recycling used lithium-ion batteries.

Good afternoon. I am delighted to be with you today at TechInnovation 2024. This event, organized by IPI, is an iconic feature of the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology or SWITCH.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>2. This year's conference theme is \"Sustainable Urban Living,\" an issue that affects both individuals and businesses, large or small.</p><p>3. The growth of the global population and cities continues to strain our energy resources. Singapore is not spared as one of the world's most densely populated cities. To overcome this, we harness technology and innovation to transform our city-state into a Smart Nation. The drive for Sustainable Urban Living is fundamental to our Smart Nation goal. It aims to integrate technology, data-driven decision-making, green infrastructure, and community engagement to create a more livable, efficient, and environmentally friendly city.</p><p>4. We aim to be a model for sustainable urban development globally. To succeed, we need SMEs to play an active role in our dynamic innovation ecosystem, which includes companies, research institutions, industry, and investors.</p><p>5.The Government is committed to supporting SMEs in their sustainable journey and helping them seize opportunities in the sustainable urban living sector. To achieve this, SMEs would need three critical ingredients: partners for technology, partners for mentorship, and partners for global expansion.</p><p>Partners for technology</p><p>6. First, partners for technology. All businesses must innovate to stay competitive in today's fast-paced world. Companies that embrace innovation are better positioned to adapt to market changes and offer new products and services.</p><p>7. Services like IPI's Tech Scouting help SMEs connect with potential partners, explore technology collaborations, and accelerate the development of their products and services. This is one way SMEs can get an extra hand in navigating the innovation landscape and identifying opportunities that complement their business needs.</p><p>a. One of the SMEs that has benefited from such assistance is Charged Asia, a Singapore-based electric vehicle company. IPI connected the company to KGS, a local recycling specialist, to handle the firm's end-of-life battery disposal. The two partners launched pilot trials on recovering battery materials. Their cooperation has not only given Charged Asia a competitive edge but has also fostered a more sustainable battery recycling ecosystem. Importantly, the advancement of such green technologies also positively impacts the environment.</p><p>Partners for mentorship</p><p>8. Second, partners for mentorship. Having the right mentors is equally vital for businesses to achieve meaningful growth aligned with their objectives.</p><p>a.Take the example of Creme Concepts, a local ice cream maker. It started with humble beginnings in farmers' markets and partnered with IPI to improve its internal processes and expand regionally.</p><p>b. IPI engaged industry veterans from its Innovation Advisors Programme to advise Crme Concepts on innovation, provide market insights, and scale its operations. The company was able to leverage the advisors' wealth of experience to transform and expand. Creme Concepts went on to redesign its factory, streamline production, align commercial strategies, and refresh its brand.</p><p>c.This collaboration enabled Creme Concepts to scale up operations and position itself for long-term growth. Its products are now found in Malaysia and Hong Kong.</p><p>Partners for global expansion</p><p>9. This brings me to my third point: SMEs would do well to seek suitable partners to establish their global footprint. By engaging and meeting with companies and potential partners worldwide, our SMEs can better understand different cultures, expectations, and market demands.</p><p>10. IPI's network of global partners offers our SMEs this opportunity. For instance, its partnerships with organisations in China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand open doors to fresh business potential.</p><p>a. One of IPI's partners, the National Eastern Tech-transfer Center (NETC) from China, works closely with companies to promote enterprise growth and focuses on emerging sectors like AI, healthcare, and energy.</p><p>b. In another partnership, the IPI and the Japan External Trade Organisation started the Japanese Corporates Technology Innovation (JCTI) Launchpad in April this year. This attracted top Japanese companies like Ricoh, Toyo Seikan, Panasonic, Nisshinbo, and Mitsui Chemicals. Panasonic and IPI have since partnered on an open innovation challenge to invite SMEs, startups, and research institutes worldwide to address Panasonic's challenges.</p><p>11. I commend IPI's efforts to advance such international collaborations. These initiatives not only showcase cutting-edge technologies but also provide a platform for multinational corporations, the government, and, most importantly, SMEs to co-create opportunities with one another.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>12. To conclude, I encourage SMEs to proactively seek innovation opportunities to build products and services that enhance their competitive edge.</p><p>13. During this conference, I hope you will gain insights into exciting areas such as the latest AI-driven solutions for smart cities, healthcare, and food sustainability. There is also a wealth of networking opportunities here. I hope you discover and nurture new relationships and partnerships to multiply your business.</p><p>14. The Government is fully committed to empowering SMEs to innovate, grow, and internationalise.

However, Downing Street sought to get on the economic front foot on Sunday (Oct 13) and Monday with events at the UK Investment Summit in London ahead of the big Oct 30 budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The end-of-month fiscal event is shaping up to be the most important UK budget since at least the emergency fiscal statement in 2010 of the new Conservative government of then prime minister David Cameron. Moreover, it may even prove as politically decisive as the early budgets of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s.</p><p> Recognising the importance of the big occasion ahead, Keir Starmer's Labour government has begun its political choreography for the event.</p><p> \"Clean energy superpower\" </p><p> After uncovering a fiscal black hole of over GBP20 billion (S$34.1 billion) in July, after auditing the government's books, ministers are putting forward a more optimistic mood music at the summit events centred around the UK's long-term growth potential into the 2030s, including to become a \"clean energy superpower\". </p><p> In attendance at the summit events on Sunday and Monday were over 300 senior international business people and thinkers, including from Singapore. Key names include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. </p><p> The political build-up for the summit began on Friday when Poppy Gustafsson, co-founder and former CEO of cyber firm Darktrace, was announced as the new UK investment minister at a meeting of English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish politicians in Edinburgh. </p><p> This was followed over the weekend with investment summit events in London attended by firms including Alphabet, Goldman Sachs and DeepMind.</p><p> Overall, the government welcomed around GBP50 billion of deal announcements at the events. This is roughly twice the GBP28 billion unveiled at the last such summit held under the former Conservative administration in 2023 of then prime minister Rishi Sunak.</p><p> Gustafsson will lead a beefed-up UK Office for Investment, which will bring together expertise from industry and business leaders, plus also 10 Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department of Business and Trade. This is part of a wider reform of the UK central government, to strengthen the nation's partnership with businesses.</p><p> An example of the innovation here is that the central government will harness other devolved political actors, including the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and mayors of major cities including London, Birmingham and Manchester. </p><p> The goal is promoting the UK, including in Asia, to capture a greater share of internationally mobile investment in strategic sectors, and motivate domestic businesses to boost their investment and scale up their growth.</p><p> One key economic enabler of this revamped approach is a new UK industry strategy, announced on Sunday, with a new advisory council to spearhead this led by Microsoft UK CEO Clare Barclay. The full membership will be announced soon to help unleash the potential of high productivity sectors to spur growth, spread wealth and drive up employment.</p><p> The new industrial strategy focuses on eight areas the UK excels in, or has the potential to do so: advanced manufacturing; clean energy industries; creative industries; defence; digital and technologies; financial services; life sciences; and professional and business services. </p><p> Over the last quarter of a century, the top 30 per cent of UK sectors ranked by productivity in 1997 were responsible for generating roughly 60 per cent of the economy's entire productivity growth so the government wants the new strategy to channel support to sectors and geographical clusters that have the highest potential for the next decade.</p><p> The government has also launched a supply chain taskforce. This will assess where supply chains critical to the UK's economic security and resilience could be vulnerable to disruption.</p><p> The task force's work will focus particularly on supply chains critical to the UK's economic security and resilience, especially those in the eight growth-driving sectors outlined in the industrial strategy. The goal is seeking to ensure that the government works with business to address these risks, building the conditions required to deliver secure, inclusive growth.</p><p> Of the approximately GBP50 billion in investment announced at the summit, about half is in clean energy investment across the UK's nations and regions.</p><p> One driver of this spurt is the launch of the new Great British Energy -- an investment body and publicly owned energy generation company which aims to ensure a massive expansion in clean energy to help enhance UK energy security.</p><p> Earlier this month, the government also confirmed funding to launch the UK's first carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) sites in Teesside and Merseyside. In a more than GBP20 billion commitment, two new CCUS-enabled hydrogen projects will help remove over 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year -- the equivalent of taking around four million cars off the road.</p><p> Moving the needleIn July, moreover, the government overturned a nine-year ban on onshore wind power construction under the last several Conservative governments. This was followed by one of the most successful renewable energy auction rounds in history.</p><p> Examples of the investment include that by Iberdrola -- one of the biggest energy companies in Europe -- which is doubling its UK investment, through Scottish Power, from GBP12 billion to GBP24 billion over the next four years. This includes GBP4 billion for the East Anglia 2 wind farm off the Suffolk coast in England.</p><p> Two wind energy players Orsted and Greenvolt have also confirmed they will invest a further GBP8 billion (Orsted) and GBP2.5 billion (Greenvolt), respectively, in planned offshore wind farms. Moreover, SeAH Wind has made an additional GBP225 million investment into a now total GBP900 million wind technology manufacturing project in Teesside, North East England, thanks to new backing from UK Export Finance.</p><p> Other firms making announcements include Macquarie, BW Group, and Holtec. Macquarie is planning investment of GBP1.3 billion into new green infrastructure including in Stow, Gloucestershire, and its Roadchef portfolio company, which installs electric car ultra-fast charging points along the UK motorway network.</p><p> Meanwhile, BW Group has green-lit a GBP300 million investment into a new battery energy storage project in Birmingham. Holtec has also confirmed GBP325 million in a new factory in South Yorkshire which will supply materials for power stations, including Hinkley Point C.</p><p> Taken together, the investment summit has therefore moved the needle significantly in the government's attempt to shift the UK into a clean-energy superpower. While this is a vote of confidence from the international community, many market participants still await the Oct 30 budget before making final decisions on the new government.</p><p> The writer is an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer (centre) speaking with attendees at the UK Investment Summit in London.

Additionally, China will invest in upgrading infrastructure, providing resources and conducting training to build local authorities\u2019 capacity in disaster response.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The price of climate change in China</p><p>                        These efforts aim to improve China\u2019s ability to manage climate risks and promote sustainable adaptation at the national level, while also strengthening disaster risk management and community preparedness through improved monitoring, forecasting and early warning systems.</p><p>                        China\u2019s First Vice-Premier Xuexiang Ding delivers a statement during the United Nations climate change conference (COP29), in Baku, Azerbaijan, on 12 November 2024.</p><p>                        The new plan highlights the growing recognition of the urgent threat posed by climate change, reflecting a heightened recognition of its urgent impacts. This proactive approach comes in response to the severe economic and human costs of recent climate-related disasters. In July alone, extreme weather \u2014 primarily heavy rains and floods \u2014 caused 76.85 billion RMB (US$10.1 billion) in economic losses, affecting over 26.4 million people, displacing 1.1 million and damaging thousands of homes.</p><p>                        These staggering impacts highlight China\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, with rising coastal flooding, urban waterlogging, droughts and heavy rainfall intensifying climate risks nationwide. Notably, recent extremes \u2014 including the highest national temperature on record and Beijing receiving 60% of its annual rainfall in just 83 hours \u2014 demonstrate the growing threat. The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p>                        Projections paint an even more alarming picture. By the end of the century, heatwaves could triple, and water scarcity could worsen, deepening regional disparities. Economic losses are expected to soar, with a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase potentially leading to US$112 billion in direct flooding-related losses \u2014 four times the level seen between 2006-2018. Coastal cities like Shanghai face additional risks from extreme high tides. These projections highlight the pressing need for China to prioritise climate resilience and adaptation as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe.</p><p>                        This file photo taken on 17 September 2024 shows buildings silhouetted as clouds drift past the sun in Shanghai.</p><p>                        In response to growing concerns over climate change, Beijing has recognised the urgent need for effective adaptation strategies to protect infrastructure and maintain the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s legitimacy. This approach is influenced by Mao Zedong\u2019s belief that \u201cman must conquer nature\u201d, and has led to a focus on climate resilience and infrastructure in national policies, driven by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts.</p><p>                        Managing extreme weather has long been tied to political legitimacy in China. Historically, failures in this area \u2014 particularly flooding \u2014 have been seen as signs of a loss of authority, linked to the ancient concept of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d. This practice dates back more than 4,000 years, to Yu the Great of the Xia dynasty, who is said to have tamed the Yellow River.</p><p>                        \u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness</p><p>                        Challenges lie ahead. One of the biggest concerns being the potentially high costs of climate adaptation projects. The \u201csponge city\u201d concept (\u6d77\u7ef5\u57ce\u5e02), introduced in 2015 in Chinese cities to manage stormwater through permeable surfaces and green infrastructure, exemplifies these challenges. </p><p>                        Although the central government initially allocated 400-600 million RMB per city involved in the 16-city pilot infrastructure-driven programme, total spending on sponge city projects by 2017 had surpassed US$12 billion, with Beijing covering only 15-20% of the costs. The remainder is shouldered by local governments and the private sector.\u00a0</p><p>                        ... many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. \u2014 Professor Kongjian Yu, Dean, College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University</p><p>                        Despite over 1 trillion RMB (US$140 billion) being invested by cities between 2016-2020, these projects have struggled to cope with severe flooding, highlighting concerns about their effectiveness. Notably, in 2021, \u201chistorically rare\u201d rainfall led to devastating floods in Zhengzhou, affecting over 14 million people, causing 398 deaths and 53.2 billion RMB (US$8 billion) in economic losses. </p><p>                        However, some critics have argued that the sponge city design, intended to handle one-in-30-year rainfall, proved inadequate in the face of such extremes. Media reports at the time suggested that sponge city infrastructure can handle a maximum of 200 millimetres (mm) of rain per day. </p><p>                        A view of Zhengzhou in Henan province, 12 December 2024.</p><p>                        In contrast, Zhengzhou saw rainfall in excess of 200 mm in just one hour. Others note that mismanagement by local officials, who ignored early flood warnings, exacerbated the crisis. </p><p>                        Professor Kongjian Yu, dean of the College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University, and a champion of the sponge city concept, said in a recent interview that the fact that cities are flooding shows that they are not creating enough sponge-like infrastructure. From his perspective, many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. </p><p>                        Further complicating the situation, local governments already burdened by debt may struggle to prioritise such expensive and long-term climate adaptation projects. In the face of a national economic slowdown, many localities are resorting to asset liquidation to address immediate revenue shortfalls in a process described as \u201csmashing iron pots and selling the steel\u201d. This short-term focus risks undermining long-term climate resilience, as local authorities may prioritise quick fixes over necessary investments in sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>                        Disconnect between Beijing and local governments and among regions</p><p>                        As the central government pushes forward with projects aimed at mitigating climate impacts, the widening gap between high-level planning and on-the-ground implementation becomes increasingly apparent, raising concerns about the sustainability and effectiveness of these efforts in addressing climate resilience in cities. Without a unified approach, the effectiveness of China\u2019s climate adaptation efforts will remain in question.</p><p>                        ... China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        Completed in 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was the first major bridge built over the Yangtze river.</p><p>                        The dangers of fragmented policy and poor coordination between municipalities and regional governments, particularly in flood-prone areas, must be considered too. Recent studies have highlighted this issue, using the example of China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        The consequences of this were seen notably, in the aftermath of the 2023 Beijing floods. For instance, netizens pointed out that government bodies often look after their own jurisdiction, responding in isolation rather than through coordinated regional efforts. In their haste to manage the immediate crisis, efforts to divert floodwaters upstream only worsened conditions in downstream areas.</p><p>                        ... the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        Major overhaul</p><p>                        In the face of the challenging situation, the Chinese government is likely to intensify its efforts to enhance climate resilience in the coming years. Recognising the urgent need for coordinated action, Beijing aims to strengthen local governments\u2019 capacity to address climate change by integrating adaptation strategies into urban planning and infrastructure development.\u00a0</p><p>                        This photo taken on 29 June 2024 shows an aerial view of flooded buildings after a flood peak on the Wuyang river at Qiandongnan, in China\u2019s southwest Guizhou province.</p><p>                        In line with this, the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2022\u20132035) lays out a framework for resilience, emphasising improved weather monitoring, and bolstered agricultural, water, and urban infrastructure systems. However, the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        As extreme weather intensifies, China is prioritising disaster prevention and community preparedness but bridging the gap between ambitious plans and on-the-ground implementation is crucial for long-term climate resilience.</p><p>                        Related: Storing sunshine: How northwest China is making renewable energy reliable | China\u2019s environmental focus in South China Sea: Questionable motivations | China\u2019s booming nuclear sector lobbies for green vouchers to ensure profits</p><p>                        The photo taken on 6 July 2024 shows an aerial view of a partially submerged Guanyin temple in floodwaters in the swollen Yangtze River in Ezhou, central China\u2019s Hubei province.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-5486700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DPC-RXH3-RS5N-106F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

She had spent the last three years at a bank. After giving birth to her second daughter, she was looking for a change in profession. The trouble was she had little knowledge of the real estate sector and no experience in it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When Kwek asked her for her opinions on the property sector, her response was to criticise the industry's reputation in terms of environmental impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I was too honest,\" An recalled in an interview with The Business Times, adding that she expected not to get a callback.</p><p> It turned out that Kwek appreciated her honesty, and An was hired to take on public relations responsibilities at CDL in 1995.</p><p> That evolved into a corporate communications role as the team took on more corporate social responsibility functions, which then gradually expanded into sustainability.</p><p> Over the years, and even before CDL created a dedicated sustainability team, An made special efforts to support sustainability efforts at the company.</p><p> She pushed CDL to participate in the United Nations (UN) Global Compact in 2005, launch a sustainability report in 2008, and voluntarily conduct biodiversity impact assessments on greenfield sites in 2010.</p><p> An was appointed CDL's chief sustainability officer in 2014, marking the first time a listed company in Singapore had made such an appointment. With this, her focus was no longer split between sustainability and communications; and she was able to focus on greening the company's buildings and operations.</p><p> A lonely journeyAn's entry into CDL marked a major turning point in her life, but she had no grand plans or vision at the time to be the sustainability practitioner that she is today. Even the late Kwek Leng Joo probably had not foreseen how mainstream sustainability would become, she said.</p><p> \"I won't want to tell people that I was a visionary 30 years ago. It was just coincidence, maybe fate, that gave me the opportunity to join an industry where I could make a difference,\" she said.</p><p> Bonding with Kwek over a shared interest in nature photography, An said CDL's sustainability playbook came together easily.</p><p> \"It was very simple. It's not like we engaged McKinsey to come and do branding and all that. It was just two brains,\" she added, referring to the company's ethos of \"conserving as we construct\" that was established in 1995 as a result of their discussions.</p><p> Getting the rest of the company on board, however, was a lonelier journey.</p><p> There was hardly any interest in the first few sustainability reports CDL published, even from the company's own investor relations (IR) department. Back then, sustainability reporting was entirely voluntary.</p><p> \"Every time we pushed the sustainability reports to the IR, they pushed them back to us. Nobody wanted them. Really, it was so sad,\" said An.</p><p> She also had to face negative comments around her efforts to continue producing these reports.\"Don't do it. What for? Are you very free? Why do you want to do a sustainability report'\" the naysayers said.</p><p> It was only in 2017 -- two years after the Paris Agreement on climate change was inked -- that the company started to notice investor interest in these reports.</p><p> Balancing commercial needs and sustainabilityChallenges to An's sustainability efforts also came in the form of various financial frameworks and considerations that came with being a listed company.</p><p> When CDL wanted to issue a green bond, An spent months learning about the process, setting up a green bond framework and having it verified.</p><p> After all the necessary elements were in place, at the end of 2016, it was decided that the interest rates were not favourable and plans to issue the green bond were put on hold.</p><p> When a window of opportunity came in April 2017, An said, there was an urgent \"go/no-go\" meeting. CDL would go on to issue the first green bond by a Singapore-listed company.</p><p> Another project that has caused An to have many sleepless nights is the CDL Eco Train being installed at City Square Mall.</p><p> Repurposed from a decommissioned train car, the train was intended to be a classroom and exhibition space on various sustainability topics.</p><p> Figuring out where to place the decommissioned car and transporting it in one piece required plenty of discussion and coordination among government authorities, engineers, project managers and consultants. Not only was the project delayed by several months -- it also went over budget by between 20 and 25 per cent.</p><p> \"We overshot the budget. That is the biggest challenge because as a listed company, we are very, very prudent, to the extent that we are quite tight in cost control. And don't forget, these are investments into the community. There is no return on investment,\" said An.</p><p> \"Last year was very difficult. I could not sleep because of the budget. It's so expensive, and nobody has done it before.\"</p><p> Such trade-offs are sometimes inevitable, An said, but the triple bottom-line framework -- which assesses a company's success around people, planet and profits -- is at the core of her approach towards sustainability.</p><p> \"You need to look at the profitability... If you don't have resources, how are you going to take care of the people and the planet'\"</p><p> \"I also know everybody wants to save the world, save the universe. But we are a small country, a small economy; (and CDL is) not the biggest company in the world,\" she added.</p><p> To do what it can, CDL has set a target to be operationally net-zero by 2030. Its target was verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative in 2018, with a renewal in 2021.</p><p> Its latest sustainability report also integrated the disclosure framework recommended by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures.</p><p> An's efforts have helped CDL earn numerous sustainability accolades, and garnered recognition for An herself. She was named Impact Leader of the Year at this year's Sustainability Impact Awards, jointly organised by BT and UOB.</p><p> In 2018, she was the first Singaporean to be named an SDG Pioneer for green infrastructure and low-carbon economy. The UN programme recognises business professionals who have been significant in advancing the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as principles of the UN Global Compact.</p><p> Paying it forwardWhile An's initial years as a sustainability practitioner were characterised by loneliness, the landscape has shifted significantly since then.</p><p> From a \"good-to-have\", sustainability has gradually evolved into a \"should-have\" and is now a \"must-have\", An said.</p><p> This has also meant that An's work over the last 30 years has become increasingly visible. Her speaking engagements have gone up significantly compared with the pre-Covid days.</p><p> Thankful that her time in CDL has given her the opportunity to build her knowledge on decarbonising the real estate sector, as well as sustainability reporting, she believes she should be paying it forward by sharing her knowledge with others as well.</p><p> That may be in her capacity as an adviser, through her participation in 26 boards and task forces, or as a mentor under the Young Women's Leadership Connection -- or even through her LinkedIn channel, where she has found surprising reach.</p><p> In one instance, industry peers from Germany requested a German translation of CDL's two-pillar approach in its blended reporting after she had posted about it on LinkedIn.</p><p> \"We're not selfish. Someone asked us to copyright this two-pillar approach. Even if people want to adapt, let them adapt. Why do we want to charge any money? I said no, I don't think it's necessary,\" she added.</p><p> She also believes it is her responsibility to mentor and nurture younger executives who have the potential and interest to take up sustainability as a career.</p><p> Despite being on this journey over the last 30 years, An doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon. She draws her inspiration to keep chugging forward from marine biologist and oceanographer Sylvia Earle, as well as primatologist Jane Goodall.</p><p> \"They have served the planet for 60 years, more than 60 years. When Jane Goodall moved from London to Tanzania, she was only 26 years old. Sylvia was the first female marine scientist in America. She was not even 30 years old.</p><p> \"When I look at them, I think: Don't talk about retirement. Talk about today and what you can do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-75D0SS7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D3B-CW71-DYX4-01C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

She had spent the last three years at a bank. After giving birth to her second daughter, she was looking for a change in profession. The trouble was she had little knowledge of the real estate sector and no experience in it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> When Kwek asked her for her opinions on the property sector, her response was to criticise the industry's reputation in terms of environmental impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I was too honest,\" An recalled in an interview with The Business Times, adding that she expected not to get a callback.</p><p> It turned out that Kwek appreciated her honesty, and An was hired to take on public relations responsibilities at CDL in 1995.</p><p> That evolved into a corporate communications role as the team took on more corporate social responsibility functions, which then gradually expanded into sustainability.</p><p> Over the years, and even before CDL created a dedicated sustainability team, An made special efforts to support sustainability efforts at the company.</p><p> She pushed CDL to participate in the United Nations (UN) Global Compact in 2005, launch a sustainability report in 2008, and voluntarily conduct biodiversity impact assessments on greenfield sites in 2010.</p><p> An was appointed CDL's chief sustainability officer in 2014, marking the first time a listed company in Singapore had made such an appointment. With this, her focus was no longer split between sustainability and communications; and she was able to focus on greening the company's buildings and operations.</p><p> A lonely journeyAn's entry into CDL marked a major turning point in her life, but she had no grand plans or vision at the time to be the sustainability practitioner that she is today. Even the late Kwek Leng Joo probably had not foreseen how mainstream sustainability would become, she said.</p><p> \"I won't want to tell people that I was a visionary 30 years ago. It was just coincidence, maybe fate, that gave me the opportunity to join an industry where I could make a difference,\" she said.</p><p> Bonding with Kwek over a shared interest in nature photography, An said CDL's sustainability playbook came together easily.</p><p> \"It was very simple. It's not like we engaged McKinsey to come and do branding and all that. It was just two brains,\" she added, referring to the company's ethos of \"conserving as we construct\" that was established in 1995 as a result of their discussions.</p><p> Getting the rest of the company on board, however, was a lonelier journey. </p><p> There was hardly any interest in the first few sustainability reports CDL published, even from the company's own investor relations (IR) department. Back then, sustainability reporting was entirely voluntary.</p><p> \"Every time we pushed the sustainability reports to the IR, they pushed them back to us. Nobody wanted them. Really, it was so sad,\" said An.</p><p> She also had to face negative comments around her efforts to continue producing these reports. \"Don't do it. What for? Are you very free? Why do you want to do a sustainability report'\" the naysayers said.</p><p> It was only in 2017 -- two years after the Paris Agreement on climate change was inked -- that the company started to notice investor interest in these reports.</p><p> Balancing commercial needs and sustainabilityChallenges to An's sustainability efforts also came in the form of various financial frameworks and considerations that came with being a listed company.</p><p> When CDL wanted to issue a green bond, An spent months learning about the process, setting up a green bond framework and having it verified. </p><p> After all the necessary elements were in place, at the end of 2016, it was decided that the interest rates were not favourable and plans to issue the green bond were put on hold.</p><p> When a window of opportunity came in April 2017, An said, there was an urgent \"go/no-go\" meeting. CDL would go on to issue the first green bond by a Singapore-listed company.</p><p> Another project that has caused An to have many sleepless nights is the CDL Eco Train being installed at City Square Mall.</p><p> Repurposed from a decommissioned train car, the train was intended to be a classroom and exhibition space on various sustainability topics.</p><p> Figuring out where to place the decommissioned car and transporting it in one piece required plenty of discussion and coordination among government authorities, engineers, project managers and consultants. Not only was the project delayed by several months -- it also went over budget by between 20 and 25 per cent. </p><p> \"We overshot the budget. That is the biggest challenge because as a listed company, we are very, very prudent, to the extent that we are quite tight in cost control. And don't forget, these are investments into the community. There is no return on investment,\" said An.</p><p> \"Last year was very difficult. I could not sleep because of the budget. It's so expensive, and nobody has done it before.\"</p><p> Such trade-offs are sometimes inevitable, An said, but the triple bottom-line framework -- which assesses a company's success around people, planet and profits -- is at the core of her approach towards sustainability.</p><p> \"You need to look at the profitability... If you don't have resources, how are you going to take care of the people and the planet'\"</p><p> \"I also know everybody wants to save the world, save the universe. But we are a small country, a small economy; (and CDL is) not the biggest company in the world,\" she added.</p><p> To do what it can, CDL has set a target to be operationally net-zero by 2030. Its target was verified by the Science Based Targets Initiative in 2018, with a renewal in 2021.</p><p> Its latest sustainability report also integrated the disclosure framework recommended by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures.</p><p> An's efforts have helped CDL earn numerous sustainability accolades, and garnered recognition for An herself. She was named Impact Leader of the Year at this year's Sustainability Impact Awards, jointly organised by BT and UOB.</p><p> In 2018, she was the first Singaporean to be named an SDG Pioneer for green infrastructure and low-carbon economy. The UN programme recognises business professionals who have been significant in advancing the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, as well as principles of the UN Global Compact.</p><p> Paying it forwardWhile An's initial years as a sustainability practitioner were characterised by loneliness, the landscape has shifted significantly since then.</p><p> From a \"good-to-have\", sustainability has gradually evolved into a \"should-have\" and is now a \"must-have\", An said.</p><p> This has also meant that An's work over the last 30 years has become increasingly visible. Her speaking engagements have gone up significantly compared with the pre-Covid days.</p><p> Thankful that her time in CDL has given her the opportunity to build her knowledge on decarbonising the real estate sector, as well as sustainability reporting, she believes she should be paying it forward by sharing her knowledge with others as well.</p><p> That may be in her capacity as an adviser, through her participation in 26 boards and task forces, or as a mentor under the Young Women's Leadership Connection -- or even through her LinkedIn channel, where she has found surprising reach.</p><p> In one instance, industry peers from Germany requested a German translation of CDL's two-pillar approach in its blended reporting after she had posted about it on LinkedIn.</p><p> \"We're not selfish. Someone asked us to copyright this two-pillar approach. Even if people want to adapt, let them adapt. Why do we want to charge any money? I said no, I don't think it's necessary,\" she added.</p><p> She also believes it is her responsibility to mentor and nurture younger executives who have the potential and interest to take up sustainability as a career.</p><p> Despite being on this journey over the last 30 years, An doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon. She draws her inspiration to keep chugging forward from marine biologist and oceanographer Sylvia Earle, as well as primatologist Jane Goodall.</p><p> \"They have served the planet for 60 years, more than 60 years. When Jane Goodall moved from London to Tanzania, she was only 26 years old. Sylvia was the first female marine scientist in America. She was not even 30 years old.</p><p> \"When I look at them, I think: Don't talk about retirement. Talk about today and what you can do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CDL's Esther An draws her inspiration to keep chugging forward from marine biologist and oceanographer Sylvia Earle, as well as primatologist Jane Goodall.

It is not only the world's most populous region, but also the fastest-growing. Asia is expected to contribute 60 per cent of global growth in 2024 and within the area, the 10 members of Asean make up the beating heart of the region, driving connectivity within the region and with the global economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But this rapid growth comes at a cost. Asia is now the leading contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. More critically, the region faces disproportionate risks from climate change. Asean nations including the Philippines, Myanmar and Thailand are ranked among the top 10 countries most severely affected by weather-related loss events and most vulnerable to climate risks. </p><p> Last year alone, Asean countries were hit by more than a thousand natural disasters. These affected 22.5 million people, displaced 1.8 million, and resulted in damages of more than US$600 million. </p><p> Sadly, these disasters are just the beginning of the coming global climate crisis. We must recognise that many natural disasters are no longer natural, but are due to manmade climate change.</p><p> This stark reality underscores the urgent need for Asia to accelerate its efforts towards a green transition, to mitigate climate change and to conserve our planet's living environment.</p><p> The transition towards net-zero industries represents not only a challenge but an opportunity. Asia's future competitiveness depends on sustainability. </p><p> Economies that embrace sustainable development will become the preferred destination for trade and investment. Looking ahead, secure and affordable renewable energy will be the key engine for economic development. On the supply side, this transition will create many industries and job opportunities.</p><p> Significant challengeHowever, as the theme of this year's Asean-Asia Forum rightly identifies, global shifts are casting doubt over this ambition. Increasing risks of geo-economic fragmentation pose a significant challenge to achieving the green transition. </p><p> Today, we are witnessing increased trade restrictions and anti-competitive measures, especially in strategic sectors such as semiconductors and renewables. Around 3,000 trade-restricting measures were imposed in 2023 alone, nearly three times the number in 2019. </p><p> As the strategic importance of green sectors becomes more evident, we also see more restrictive policies placed on these sectors and their supply chains, including import tariffs and domestic content requirements. Additionally, there is an increase in export restrictions to prevent key technology from flowing to others. </p><p> Here, there is a real risk that the economic opportunity presented by the green transition becomes its own victim.</p><p> It is imperative that we overcome these tensions and work together to combat climate change. Supply chain disruptions increase the cost of the green transition for all of us and hinder progress towards our collective goals. We need avenues for trade, capital and knowledge to continue flowing. </p><p> While it's crucial to support the growth of local industries, we must avoid the pitfalls of protectionism that can hinder global cooperation and technology exchange. The key is to strike a judicious balance.</p><p> As we navigate the risks of fragmentation, we must continue to advocate strongly for globalisation and multilateralism. Asean economies have a deep history of economic collaboration, and many are today highly connected by trade and plugged into global supply chains. Encouragingly, there are now more cross-border sales and transmission of renewable energy in the region, and a more integrated Asean grid is in the works. </p><p> As Asean is demonstrating, multilateral cooperation presents the most efficient and effective approach to solve climate change. Thus, we must work collaboratively to reduce trade frictions and invest in regional connectivity, especially in Asia.</p><p> More than ever, multilateral development banks (MDB) have a pivotal role to play in facilitating international cooperation and directing resources to tackle these urgent global challenges. </p><p> Driving cooperationThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is heeding the call. We are firmly committed to financing infrastructure for tomorrow and work every day to promote sustainable development and regional cooperation. I am proud to say that 60 per cent of our financing in 2023 was directed towards green infrastructure, and 23 per cent was invested in cross-border connectivity.</p><p> Furthermore, AIIB has sought to drive cooperation across the MDB system. The organisation co-financed a US$230 million pumped hydropower project in Indonesia with the World Bank, and with the Asian Development Bank, a US$150 million cross-border wind power project in Laos supplying green energy to Vietnam. </p><p> Last year, we also provided a US$1 billion guarantee facility for the World Bank, increasing lending capacity for both AIIB and the World Bank.</p><p> In July 2023, we began to align all our financing activities with the Paris Agreement. Our Climate Action Plan further committed to using our resources, expertise and partnerships to help our members both mitigate and adapt to the climate change crisis. </p><p> By 2030, we expect our cumulative climate finance to reach US$50 billion.</p><p> In 2024, we introduced an instrument -- Climate-Focused Policy-Based Financing. Moving beyond project-by-project lending, this new instrument enables AIIB to support members to undertake climate-positive policy reforms and scale up climate finance. </p><p> Our policy-based financing will put specific emphasis on policy reforms that are conducive to crowding in private-sector investments. </p><p> Working with other MDBs, we have already approved a US$400 million programme to support Bangladesh's efforts in mainstreaming climate change adaptation and mitigation.</p><p> Finally, at the most recent meeting of MDB heads, AIIB -- along with nine other major MDBs -- committed to concrete and actionable deliverables in several critical areas: scaling up MDB financing capacity; boosting joint action on climate change; strengthening country-level collaboration and co-financing; and importantly, catalysing private-sector mobilisation.</p><p> Just as Asean's 10 member countries have demonstrated the organising power of multilateralism, MDBs must continue to promote regional interconnectivity in this time of rising geo-economic fragmentation. Importantly, MDBs must also deepen our collaboration to address the spectre of climate challenges ahead. </p><p> Only by working together as a system can we increase our climate finance at the speed and scale required to finance humanity's moonshot towards net zero.</p><p> The writer is president and chair of the board of directors at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-4RBI4IG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CMB-5MT1-DYX4-000W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1122\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It has prompted shifts in behaviour, and inspired concerted action. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Governments worldwide are enacting regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), and plans for green infrastructure development. Businesses are committing to net-zero emissions, setting science-based targets, and encouraging their supply chains to adopt more sustainable practices. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, and are altering their spending patterns accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile, some investors are advocating for action, heightening their focus on climate-related risks and setting minimum climate standards, which in turn influences portfolio allocations.</p><p> Although these transformations pose risks to asset prices, we recognise that they also herald a unique investment opportunity for our generation. </p><p> We advocate for a climate strategy that yields both environmental and financial returns, moving beyond traditional approaches. Generally, strategies focused solely on low emissions often rely on historical data without adequately accounting for shifts in business models or the tangible impacts on the environment. </p><p> Similarly, while green bond strategies contribute to funding eco-friendly projects, a strategy exclusively centred on green bonds may suffer from limited diversification, lower yield return and extended durations.</p><p> Such traditional methodologies do not sufficiently address the physical consequences of climate change, nor do they focus adequately on adaptation. Current policies place us on a trajectory towards a 2.4 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures, a scenario corroborated by our climate analysis. This warming path is likely to exacerbate weather volatility and temperature extremes, affecting both society at large and asset values.</p><p> Crafting a solutionAt the heart of a favourable solution is the conviction that climate outcomes should prioritise real-world emissions reduction, support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and facilitate adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Every investment decision should be made through a climate lens, necessitating a bespoke framework. This approach, coupled with a global opportunity set and a strategy focused on best ideas, is designed to yield compelling returns and income.</p><p> Climate transition in Asia will likely be core to the outcomes that are achieved on a global level considering the size of Asia's population, projected economic growth, exposure to higher emitting industries, and the opportunity to potentially leapfrog high-emitting technologies and adopt low-carbon solutions. Asian companies are often national, regional or even global leaders in their respective industries, which could translate to meaningful impact when they adopt more sustainable trajectories. </p><p> Covering the global universe, the strategy centres on identifying and investing in ambitious companies that are leading the charge in their respective industries. These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands. By aligning with such leaders, investors may capitalise on the growth of the climate market and achieve superior performance.</p><p> Three types of companies are worth a look -- those in high-emitting sectors that are setting the standard for emissions reduction; innovators who are developing the technologies and products essential for decarbonisation efforts; and entities that help societies adjust to the impacts of climate change and contribute to global climate resilience. </p><p> By carefully selecting companies that align with these themes, investors may seize a significant growth opportunity and contribute meaningfully to the efforts against climate change.</p><p> Fixed income instruments, including green and municipal bonds, are pivotal in channelling funds towards projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience. A comprehensive fixed income strategy should span various segments -- investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. </p><p> An additional nuance within the Asian bond universe is the presence of large state-owned enterprises that are focused on delivering policy objectives instead of solely profit, allowing bond investors the opportunity to lend to issuers that are involved in national infrastructure projects that are part of the government's strategy to move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> We currently see the opportunities in Asia in the renewable energy space, EVs and its corresponding value chain, as well as large corporates that are adopting more sustainable ways of manufacturing their products. </p><p> We expect the potential pipeline from Asia to continue to grow, and could span a wide variety of opportunities including low carbon materials production and climate adaptation.</p><p> Selecting the right theme is merely the beginning. Active company selection becomes crucial in ensuring that investments genuinely enhance the portfolio's value. </p><p> For credit investors, the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards across all issuers requires careful consideration, especially given the disparities between high-yield and investment-grade issuers. High-yield issuers -- often smaller or newer companies -- may not have the luxury of dedicated ESG teams, established green-bond frameworks, or the capacity to generate comprehensive sustainability reports. Consequently, companies genuinely committed to sustainability might be overlooked due to their inability to showcase their ESG credentials prominently.</p><p> A recent example is Ardagh Metal Packaging, a US-listed global producer of infinitely recyclable metal drinks cans. Until recently, this company lagged in ESG disclosures despite its strong alignment with sustainability, particularly within the circular economy and waste reduction sectors. In 2022, its recycling initiatives were estimated to have avoided 3.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions compared to using virgin materials.</p><p> This case highlights that ESG assessment should transcend mere box-ticking; there is no substitute for thorough research. Investors adept at identifying firms with commendable ESG practices, albeit with limited disclosure, stand to gain by investing ahead of the curve, before enhanced transparency garners wider market recognition. </p><p> A promising landscapeThe future of climate change investing looks bright, buoyed by the escalating global emphasis on environmental sustainability. Despite concerns, we maintain that the burgeoning demand for climate-related investments will not alone lead to overvaluation. The arena of climate transition presents a vast and perpetually evolving landscape of opportunities, far from being exhausted by current interest levels.</p><p> Most importantly, we believe a climate change investment strategy should have a dual objective -- achieving meaningful climate impact alongside robust financial returns. This approach transcends mere trend-following. It is about pinpointing and supporting innovative companies that lead the charge in industry transformation and real-world decarbonisation efforts. </p><p> This strategy opens the door to a wide spectrum of opportunities, enabling investors to engage with ventures that are not just promising in terms of returns but are also pivotal in the global transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> It is imperative to curate a well-balanced portfolio encompassing leaders in emissions reduction, innovators in technology, and contributors to climate adaptation. This diversified strategy ensures resilience against potential overvaluation in any single region, sector or asset class by spreading exposure across the varied facets of climate transition.</p><p> The writer is investment director of fixed income, abrdn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Opportunities in Asia include companies in renewable energy, electric vehicles and the corresponding value chain, and manufacturers adopting more sustainable practices.

For passenger vehicles, the most promising clean energy option is electric vehicles.</p><p> Mr Wong pointed out that electric vehicle share of new car registration had jumped from 0.2 per cent in 2020 to around 4 per cent last year.</p><p> \"Given this momentum, we will further accelerate electric vehicle adoption by building more charging points closer to where we live,\" he added.</p><p> \"To do this, infrastructure upgrades will be necessary, and the financing can come from green bonds.\"</p><p> Aside from green finance, Mr Wong also highlighted carbon services as an area of green growth for the country.</p><p> Carbon services refer to services that help firms reduce the amount of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, that they release.</p><p> These services include clean energy project development or financing, as well as consultancy, audit and certification services that help firms in their efforts to measure, reduce and manage emissions.</p><p> One example of a carbon service includes carbon offsetting, where companies may choose to buy a carbon credit from a renewable energy plant or a forestry restoration project developer elsewhere to \"offset\" their emissions.</p><p> Each time a project verifies it has reduced or avoided one tonne of greenhouse gases, one carbon credit is created.</p><p> The buying and selling of these carbon credits requires financial expertise, creating new roles for carbon brokers and traders.</p><p> There are more than 70 organisations involved in carbon services and trading in Singapore, according to a new report commissioned by economic agencies here, The Straits Times reported last month.</p><p> Said Mr Wong: \"We can become the go-to location in Asia for expertise in carbon services, and the trusted regional marketplace for carbon credits.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1021205</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64TJ-FY71-JCF2-82WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

These include the installation of various green infrastructure, such as solar cells, electric-vehicle charging stations, as well as smart energy optimisation and management systems.</p><p> SP and the property developer will then collaborate on a feasibility study to implement a green micro-grid for BDIP. This will accelerate its clean energy transition by easing access to renewable energy and providing greater power reliability and resilience for the tenants.</p><p> BDIP is Frasers Property Vietnam's first industrial park development in Vietnam, and the first phase is now at over 90 per cent occupancy. The park's industrial service centre occupies 837 square metres. </p><p> To maximise energy efficiency and thermal comfort, SP will deploy smart building energy management systems, Green Energy Tech, which uses artificial intelligence to regulate the air-conditioning based on changes in occupancy and weather conditions.</p><p> The parties expect to save up to 30 per cent on cooling energy and reduce carbon emissions by nearly 18 per cent. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Brandon Chia (second from left), MD, sustainability energy solutions for South-east Asia and Australia, SP Group; and Lim Hua Tiong (third from left), CEO of Frasers Property Vietnam, at the MOU signing ceremony.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is delighted to co-host today's event with the World Bank.</p><p>2. If there was a Dummy's Guide to Decarbonisation, it would probably say something like this: clean the grid, electrify everything and leave a small carbon budget for genuinely hard-to-abate sectors.</p><p>3. The focus on coal transition addresses the first of those three limbs: clean the grid. Today, our grids are primarily powered by fossil fuels, accounting for over 60% of the share of global electricity generation. Coal continues to remain the largest source of electricity globally and remains the dominant energy source for many countries.[1]</p><p>4. There is some reason for optimism. Based on IEA forecasts, more than a third of the world's electricity will come from renewables by next year, surpassing coal as the largest source of supply. In advanced economies last year, renewables accounted for 34% of total power generation, while coal's share plummeted to a historic low of 17%.[2]</p><p>5. However, the transition is taking place unevenly and we are seeing a different trajectory in developing regions. For instance, in Southeast Asia, coal continues to account for over 40% of the energy mix.[3] Renewables make up only a quarter of the region's power generation.[4] We have a fair bit of ground to close, given the International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) estimates that renewables will need to account for between 90-100% of electricity generation in 2050, if are to keep to a 1.5 degree scenario for Southeast Asia.[5]</p><p>6. We should all be concerned about this because one in every seven tonnes of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere comes from a coal plant in Asia. If we are serious about the climate transition, we need to get serious about Asian coal.</p><p>7. If nothing is done, coal power will continue to be dominant for three main reasons:</p><p>a. Coal is already locked in. Asia's coal plants are young, less than 15 years old on average. There is established infrastructure, and long-term power purchase agreements (PPA). These make transitioning from coal a costly process.</p><p>b. The second reason underpinning the dominance is that bottlenecks in grid infrastructure are hindering renewable energy deployment. There is no transition without transmission. There is little value in adding more generation capacity if the electricity cannot reach the intended end-user. In Vietnam for example, the influx of solar and wind capacity in the South has caused renewable energy generation curtailment. At the same time, the country's coal-dependent northern provinces face supply challenges.</p><p>c. Lastly, if we only think of coal in economic terms, we have missed the plot. Coal is not just an economic asset; it is an asset with deep security and social implications. Coal is viewed as essential for energy security given its reliability as baseload capacity. In Asia, some 6.7 million jobs are tied to the coal industry, from mining to power generation. The transition away from coal, if not managed carefully, could lead to significant social disruption, particularly in regions where alternative employment opportunities are scarce.</p><p>8. These three challenges - (i) lock in, (ii) grid infrastructure, and (iii) the broader entrenchment of coal, particularly in emerging markets - highlight why broad-brush efforts to phasing out coal have met with limited success. Because coal has deep economic, social and existential roots, we need to complement these efforts with market-based solutions.</p><p>9. Market-based approaches are not just purely theoretical, they are already being implemented with promising results. Such mechanisms are being pioneered through initiatives such as the U.S. Energy Transition Accelerator and the Just Energy Transition Partnership. Recent modelling by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has found that the decommissioning of over 800 coal power plants in emerging economies can be achieved through large-scale investments in renewables and restructured power purchase agreements. All costs would be covered through this market-based approach, including financing PPAs, the development of renewables, retraining workers and upgrading grid infrastructure.[6]</p><p>10. Given that market-based approaches are the focus of today's event, I thought it would be useful for me to outline the key components of such an approach.</p><p>11. I would say there are three key components - the three \"As\": ambition, arsenal and actors.</p><p>12. First, ambition. What is essential here is to ensure strong ambition loops between demand and supply. Market-based approaches work best when demand and supply goals and parameters are aligned. This is a key principle underpinning the work to develop transition credits. Transition credits are a new form of carbon credits that can be generated from the emissions reduced by retiring a coal plant early and transitioning to cleaner energy sources. For this to be a viable financing tool, the supply of transition credits has to be of high integrity. Confidence in the integrity of the credits will reinforce demand. This is where we need to build a virtuous loop of demand and supply to build a market for transition credits.</p><p>13. To concretely unpack how this can be achieved, MAS launched the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION) at COP28 with more than 30 members. TRACTION is exploring how to support the development of high-integrity supply and build up buyer confidence in transition credits. This means hearing from demand-side players, including sovereigns, corporates and sectoral bodies from both the compliance and voluntary markets. We are asking them what key attributes they look for when purchasing credits. This, in turn, feeds into TRACTION's work on the supply side, to identify suitable coal retirement projects for the generation of such credits.</p><p>14. Beyond supply and demand, what makes TRACTION different is a third focus on making transactions scalable. This means looking beyond pilots. We are looking to build replicable ambition loops between demand and supply at scale. Part of this involves mapping the risks faced by stakeholders in a transition credit value chain, and identifying ways to mitigate these risks.</p><p>15. The second \"A\" in a strong market-based approach is arsenal. This refers to the need to develop an arsenal of tools and mechanisms to improve the economic viability and risk profile of coal decommissioning projects. Concessional capital is certainly a key tool, but it cannot be our only tool. Market-based approaches use a variety of complementary tools, such as blended finance, technical assistance, guarantees, and carbon credits. Each tool seeks to address a different gap.</p><p>16. Applying this to the example on Transition Credits, we need to be receptive to a wide arsenal of approaches even as we address the foundational issue of credit integrity. Several methodologies that prescribe how high integrity transition credits can be generated are being developed as we speak. Some of these are premised on a project-based approach, where the mitigation activity is implemented by each individual coal plant. Others use a sectoral approach where the mitigation activities are managed across a jurisdiction, at the national or subnational level.</p><p>17. TRACTION is examining both approaches. Let me share three initial observations:</p><p>a. First, project-based and sectoral approaches use different guardrails to meet high integrity standards and Just Transition needs. Importantly, these requirements also have to consider implementation practicalities.</p><p>* For instance, project-based methodologies require a just transition plan to be developed at the plant level with stakeholders. Sectoral approach would call for one at the national or subnational level.</p><p>*While the approaches may be different, both stipulate that part of the credit proceeds must be directed to just transition.</p><p>b. Second, jurisdictions and plant owners should choose a crediting methodology that suits their local context.</p><p>* For example, where there are no site-appropriate options for cleaner energy, a sectoral approach may be considered provided there is a national energy transition plan.</p><p>c. Third, with multiple approaches under development, stakeholders facing different circumstances will have more options to accelerate a just coal transition action globally.</p><p>* We must recognise that energy transition will not be homogenous as markets have their unique needs for energy security and growth. And the economics of energy transition for each market will also be different.</p><p>* This goes back to my point on the need to have an arsenal of tools. Different methodologies can and should be part of the toolkit to encourage more countries and plant owners to take action today.</p><p>18. The final \"A\" is actors. We need everyone to step up to the plate more decisively. We need better coordination across actors so that those with the ability to step in can quickly plug the gaps. Governments, development finance institutions, and philanthropies could provide concessional capital. Multilateral development banks can provide technical assistance, including advisory and structuring support, and commercial capital. We also need to more extensively harness the capabilities of financial institutions, such as insurance players, to provide innovative risk mitigation solutions across the project development lifecycle.</p><p>19. We are starting to see the beginnings of this in the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P), the US$5bn blended finance platform that we launched at COP28 last year. One specific theme under FAST-P is the Energy Transition Acceleration Fund (ETAF), which is being developed in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP). The fund focusses on energy transition projects in Asia, such as the early phaseout of coal assets and replacement with renewables. The ADB provides not just concessional capital from its donors, but also its structuring expertise, experience in working on the Energy Transition Mechanism in Asia, and a pipeline of potential projects. GEAPP, with its experience in the energy transition, and a network of willing partners with a focus on green energy access, is well placed to ensure that investments in the space are socially inclusive and just. We are also grateful for the World Bank's partnership in FAST-P. Singapore is working with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other partners on a Green Investment Partnership under FAST-P to finance marginally bankable green infrastructure projects and companies in Asia. IFC's experience in deploying blended finance and scaling infrastructure projects has been invaluable.</p><p>20. Market-based approaches are not just a novelty or an interesting talking point. They are a necessity if we are to accelerate the coal transition at the scale we need. For these approaches to work, I have outlined three key \"A's\" that are essential: (i) Ambition loops to harness the market-making power of demand and supply, (ii) the ability and willingness to tap on a wide Arsenal of tools, and (iii) a strong ecosystem of Actors that readily step up to play critical roles.</p><p>21. I would also add a fourth \"A\" - Action. I have outlined some concrete workstreams and initiatives that can make decisive impact on coal transition. I hope you will step forward to contribute to this work.</p><p>22. With this, I look forward to the panel discussion that will cover a number of innovative market-based approaches, and to the fruitful discussions that will no doubt follow.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] Ember, 2024 - with major processing by Our World in Data.

Good afternoon.</p><p>2. Let me start by congratulating the Singapore Reinsurers Association for the 20th anniversary of its flagship event, the Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).</p><p>a. Since its inception in 1991, the SIRC has grown into a leading forum for reinsurers, insurers and reinsurance brokers to discuss topical issues facing the global reinsurance industry, and as a networking platform for reinsurance deals.</p><p>b. Today, we have about 3,300 delegates gathered here from over 65 countries, including a strong bench of global and regional leaders.</p><p>3. This year's strong turnout reflects the strength of Singapore's insurance industry.</p><p>a. Gross premiums for general insurance grew 7.5% year-on-year to reach S$13.5 billion in 2023.</p><p>b. Brokerage revenues increased by 9% year-on-year to S$847 million.</p><p>c. At the same time, Singapore's reinsurance premiums grew 31% year-on-year to S$27.6 billion in 2023, accounting for about 21% of Asia's reinsurance market.</p><p>4. This comes on the back of a resilient global reinsurance industry.</p><p>a. Global reinsurance capital has grown by 3.7% since end 2023 to reach a new high of US$695 billion in the first half of 2024, a level not seen since 2021.[1]</p><p>b. This was driven by retained earnings, more disciplined underwriting, and improved investment performance.</p><p>c. The industry has returned to profitability, with reinsurers' return on equity reaching 17.6% in the first half of 2024.[2]</p><p>5. This puts the reinsurance industry in a strong position to support the growth of Asia, as it navigates four key transitions in the years ahead - namely, climate, energy, digital, and demographic.</p><p>Climate transition</p><p>6. I will start with the climate transition. This is something which the insurance industry is familiar with, given its traditional role in providing natural catastrophe insurance coverage.</p><p>7. It is not so much that climate change is happening, but the pace at which it is accelerating which is of increasing concern. This is in turn challenging risk projections based off historical data.</p><p>a. In the past five years, annual insured losses from natural catastrophes averaged US$106 billion, up from less than US$83 billion in the previous five-year period.[3]</p><p>b. Latest models indicate the insurance industry needs to be prepared for an average annual insured loss of US$151 billion, or higher.[4]</p><p>8. Asia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It also suffers from a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage.</p><p>a. Total economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region for 2023 amounted to US$65 billion, of which 91% was not insured. This compares with a 30% protection gap in the United States.[5]</p><p>b. Based on the current trajectory, global temperatures are expected to increase by about 2.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels without more aggressive actions. Under this scenario, Asia could lose about 20% of its GDP by 2048 from 2021 levels, whilst ASEAN collectively could lose about 29% of its GDP.[6]</p><p>9. There is therefore both an imminent need and opportunity for the insurance industry to address the underinsurance gap arising from climate change, even as the world scrambles to mitigate the global impact of climate change.</p><p>a. To do so, the industry will need to work closely with governments, academia and technology providers, to enhance its risk models, scenario analysis and data on the physical impact of climate change in Asia.</p><p>b. I therefore encourage the insurance industry to tap on Singapore's growing applied climate risk research ecosystem.</p><p>i. Singapore has close to 10 institutions[7] which provide research and insights on the physical impact of climate risk and related issues in the region, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, climate impact modelling, and nature-based solutions.</p><p>ii. Insurers, risk modelling firms, and brokers can leverage the work of these institutions as a foundation to layer on economic impact assessments, data and risk models, and hence enhance their assessments, disclosures and portfolio risk management strategies.</p><p>c. With these analyses, the industry can also better advise clients how to reduce their risk - for example, manufacturers could raise their factory floor, install flood barriers or elevate critical machinery above base flood elevation, in anticipation of frequent flooding as a result of sea level rising.</p><p>d. In turn, this will enable the industry to offer tailored products to provide sustainably priced, effective insurance coverage against natural catastrophes over the longer term.</p><p>Energy Transition</p><p>10. Let me move on to the energy transition.</p><p>11. Unlocking renewable sources of energy is key to enabling Asia to grow its economies while transitioning towards net-zero.</p><p>a. Asia accounts for half of global greenhouse gas emissions, as most of its energy needs today are being met through fossil fuels, including coal.</p><p>b. Moreover, much of Asia is developing, and its energy needs are still rising.</p><p>c. It is critical that we catalyse investments into renewable energy generation and transmission.</p><p>i. In fact, investments in renewable energy generation in Asia Pacific are poised to double during the current decade to US$1.3 trillion by 2030.[8]</p><p>1. This comprises a sizeable pipeline of renewable energy infrastructure projects, including solar, hydropower and wind.</p><p>ii. To enhance electricity connectivity within ASEAN, the International Energy Agency estimates that an overall grid investment of about $21 billion annually is needed from 2026 to 2030 and a further $31 billion annually from 2031 to 2035[9].</p><p>12. Amidst the energy transition, there are opportunities for specialty insurers and reinsurers to step up risk financing and insurance solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies.</p><p>a. It is estimated that Asia Pacific will account for a quarter, or US$59 billion of cumulative global renewable energy insurance premiums between 2022 and 2035.[10]</p><p>13. Yet compared to natural catastrophe insurance, there is less historical track record of risk assessment and loss profiles for renewable energy development in Asia.</p><p>a. Such projects will also be exposed to risks from potential damage from physical elements, such as heavy winds and storms, as well as the additional risk arising from the integration of energy storage systems with renewables.</p><p>b. To bridge these gaps, the industry must work closely with the renewable energy sector to develop new risk assessment frameworks, risk engineering methodologies, and sector-specific solutions.</p><p>c. This will improve the financial viability, risk management, and resilience of renewable energy and decarbonisation projects in the region.</p><p>14. There is also room to deploy solutions such as parametric insurance covers, as well as pre- Final Investment Decision, or pre-FID, insurance solutions[11], such as technology performance guarantees[12] and counter-party credit covers[13].</p><p>a. Parametric insurance covers can address specific coverage needs which may not be supported by traditional insurance, given the highly customisable nature.</p><p>i. MAS is studying ways to support the growth of parametric insurance, including through research on the regulatory treatment of such solutions in the region as well as information on independent and reliable data resources.</p><p>b. I encourage the industry to study pre-FID stage insurance solutions for projects in Asia, especially where projects are facing uncertainties.</p><p>i. This is a nascent space in the region, and there is room for the industry to innovate and pilot solutions offering protection during critical early stages of project development.</p><p>15. Insurers can also support the energy transition by investing directly in green infrastructure.</p><p>a. In fact, insurers are some of the world's largest institutional investors, holding more than US$40 trillion in assets.[14] In the Asia-Pacific, insurance assets are estimated to be about US$10 trillion.[15]</p><p>b. The long duration of infrastructure investments makes such assets a good match for the long-term liabilities of say life insurers.</p><p>c. To facilitate greater allocation of assets to infrastructure, MAS had recently issued a public consultation proposing a differentiated capital treatment for infrastructure assets that meet certain criteria to enjoy diversification benefits or lower risk charges than other debt and equity assets.</p><p>d. MAS will also be piloting a differentiated risk capital treatment for insurers' investments in environmentally sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>i. This allows insurers in Singapore to build their experience and capabilities in investing in sustainable infrastructure assets, and to gain deeper exposure to such assets.</p><p>ii. We will share more details of this pilot soon.</p><p>16. Taken together, these moves can potentially unlock Asia's sizable infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated at US$815 billion annually.[16]</p><p>Digital transition</p><p>17. I will touch on the digital transition next.</p><p>18. By 2030, the digital economy in the Asia-Pacific is expected to reach $2 trillion or more, driven by factors such as -</p><p>a. The boom in e-commerce, especially in countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam;</p><p>b. Innovations in fintech, especially digital payments; and</p><p>c. AI and cloud services, as businesses invest in these technologies to drive innovation.</p><p>19. At the same time, the risks associated with cyber threats will also increase. This will in turn drive the demand for the cyber insurance market in Asia.</p><p>a. The Asia-Pacific cyber insurance market is estimated to double from 2023 to 2027[17], as companies seek coverage for data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber threats.</p><p>b. Reinsurers are developing more sophisticated cyber risk models to address this evolving threat.</p><p>i. For example, we have seen the industry develop dynamic cyber risk underwriting based on monitoring platforms making real-time risk assessments.</p><p>c. In tandem, I urge the industry to work with businesses and consumers to put in place robust cybersecurity measures.</p><p>i. Such ex-ante mitigation can help insurers better manage cyber risks, while encouraging businesses to adopt best-in-class systems and practices from the get-go.</p><p>Demographic transitions</p><p>20. Last but not least, the changing demographics in Asia - in particular, a combination of ageing populations, urbanisation, and increasing wealth - will fuel the demand for life and health reinsurance.</p><p>a. Many countries in Asia, such as China, Japan and South Korea, are experiencing rapidly aging populations. Singapore is no exception - we project to attain 'super-aged' status by 2026, with about one fifth of our population aged 65 years or older.</p><p>b. At the same time, life expectancy is expected to increase. This will drive demand for long-term healthcare, pensions and financial products that provide security in old age.</p><p>c. Likewise, the rise of the middle class in Asia, coupled with greater urbanisation, will fuel greater demand for life insurance, health insurance and savings-related products.</p><p>d. These trends will give rise to growing liabilities, and reinsurers can share the risk associated with longer lifespans and rising medical costs.</p><p>e. The rise of digital platforms and insurance technology - or InsurTech - will also increase the reach of insurers. This expansion in coverage will lead to a higher volume of complex risk, and therefore the opportunity for reinsurance to manage the risk portfolio.</p><p>f. Asia accounts for 39% of the global life market, and is expected to grow by over 5% annually over the next decade, outpacing the global average[18].</p><p>Growing Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub</p><p>21. I have outlined four transitions in Asia that will drive the demand for reinsurance - climate; energy; digital; and demographics.</p><p>22. Amidst this demand growth, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>23. First, we will double down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>a. Today, Singapore serves as the Asia-Pacific hub for 12 top global insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>b. Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 reinsurers in the world have made Singapore their regional hub, covering not just ASEAN, but also markets in North and South Asia and even Australia.</p><p>c. We also have a well-developed network of about 150 brokers in Singapore today.</p><p>d. We encourage insurers to expand their presence in Singapore -</p><p>i. By leveraging our concentration of underwriting expertise here, including in complex property, casualty and specialty lines; and</p><p>ii. By building on the databases and models available, such as on climate change that I had spoken about earlier.</p><p>e. By strengthening our ecosystem of insurers, reinsurers and brokers, we can position Singapore as the hub for the development of risk financing solutions for Asia.</p><p>24. Second, we will work with insurers and reinsurers in Singapore to deepen their capabilities, in particular in AI.</p><p>a. There is good potential for the insurance industry to harness AI to improve productivity, customer service, and core operations including underwriting, actuarial analysis, and claims processing.</p><p>i. For example, it is estimated that generative AI can boost the insurance industry's revenues by 20% and cut their costs by 15%.[19]</p><p>b. To support the scaling of AI with confidence, Singapore is developing a strong foundation of AI governance that balances the need for innovation with the responsible use of AI.</p><p>i. In this regard, MAS is working in partnership with leading insurers here under Project MindForge to develop a risk framework for the responsible use of GenAI for insurance use cases, including in AI-assisted underwriting and customer engagement.</p><p>ii. MAS will also be issuing a set of good practices next year for addressing AI model, technology and cyber risks.</p><p>c. In tandem, we must build up our talent pool to harness the potential of AI.</p><p>i. MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance have commissioned a Jobs Transformation Map study on how GenAI will change job roles in the financial sector, and to identify the new skillsets needed. We will publish the findings and recommendations early next year.</p><p>d. I encourage the insurance industry to tap on the guidance and support available to develop and deepen your AI capabilities.</p><p>25. Third, we will continue to expand insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments.</p><p>a. One such example is sovereign insurance solutions.</p><p>i. Singapore is part of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (or SEA-DRIF), an ASEAN+3 initiative in partnership with the World Bank to provide climate and disaster risk insurance solutions for the region.</p><p>ii. SEADRIF has made US$4.5 million in payouts to support flood response in Laos, including a US$3 million payout in September 2024 following Typhoon Yagi.</p><p>b. Another example is insurance-linked securities (ILS).</p><p>i. Singapore is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to unlock additional risk financing capacity for peak catastrophe risks.</p><p>1. Of the 28 catastrophe bond issuances[20] in Singapore over the past 5 years, 13 issuances have covered perils in Asia, providing US$1.6 billion in coverage.</p><p>2. Whilst this is a good start, Asia currently accounts for less than 5% of the global catastrophe bond market.</p><p>ii. With their strong credit rating, good in-country relationships and sovereign support programmes, multilateral development banks can bring scale to ILS issuances in Asia by partnering sovereigns on programmatic issuances.</p><p>1. For example, they can provide a ready platform from which to issue catastrophe bonds, offering faster time to market and cost savings compared to individual countries building issuance capabilities on their own.</p><p>iii. There is opportunity to channel some of the growing flow of investments from private wealth and institutional investors in Asia towards ILS - and to this end, MAS is partnering with the ILS industry to promote ILS as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios.</p><p>c. Through such alternative risk transfer instruments, we can unlock additional risk financing capacity, and complement that provided by traditional insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Let me conclude. As Asia undergoes four fundamental transitions in the years ahead, there are opportunities for the reinsurance industry to play a key role in its growth and development, to insure a dynamic, sustainable and resilient Asia.</p><p>27. Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>28. I wish you a fruitful conference ahead.

In front of him is a large interactive screen stretching across an entire wall of the room. With a few flicks, he pulls up a virtual 3D rendering of the area, zooms past a park, and enters an apartment. We're now \"standing\" in the apartment's balcony, where we can see exactly what the view from this soon-to-be-built tower will be like, down to the gently swaying treeline. As we take in the seaside panorama, the executive taps the screen again, and the room instantly glows orange from a simulated sunset.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The technology is astonishing. It's like that scene from Minority Report, where Tom Cruise uses the futuristic Precrime system to hunt down criminals (except here, we're chasing sunsets). Even more incredibly, if all goes according to plan, this experience is only a taste of what the development as a whole promises. </p><p> Lamda is the real-estate holding firm that Time named one of this year's 100 most influential companies. Credited for revitalising Greece, it runs four of Athens' biggest malls. But all that is dwarfed by the Ellinikon, Lamda's eight-billion-euro privately funded flagship development that is being built on the 6.2-million square-metre site where the former Ellinikon International Airport used to sit, along the sparkling Athenian Riviera.</p><p> This is Europe's largest urban regeneration project, a sustainably built and run \"smart\" city three times the size of Monaco that's breathing new life into an area famous for its Jackie Onassis-level glitz before the 2008 financial crisis hit. To be completed in three phases by 2035, it will encompass homes, offices and schools as well as sports, entertainment and cultural facilities across a master plan by global architects Foster + Partners, all of which will completely run on renewable energy sources, thanks to green infrastructure such as an underground power grid. It's also designed to give residents and visitors access to everything within a zippy 15 minutes, eliminating the need for cars.</p><p> The location is Hollywood-worthy: the Hydra head-shaped plot, 30 minutes from the capital's centre, hugs the Saronic Gulf on one side, while the limestone slopes of the Hymettus mountains loom behind. Blue skies and bluer waters illuminate the area, and ancient ruins, like the 6th-century-BC Temple of Apollo Zoster, dot the surroundings. In contrast, when the first roads and residential buildings are ready from next year, the Ellinikon will showcase some of the most advanced technology on the planet -- from sensors monitoring road traffic and seawater levels, to systems that manage waste collection, street lighting and parking spaces -- and serve as a global template for a city of the future. </p><p> \"One challenge other cities face is that they have an existing infrastructure which needs excavating, for sensors and other technology,\" says Lamda CEO Odisseas Athanasiou. \"Here, we have a unique opportunity to create the smart infrastructure from scratch. By building the roads, we could put in sensors, fibre optics and a 5G network to offer unprecedented levels of connectivity. Building from the ground up means we can collect data and incorporate sensors everywhere, from the light bulbs to underground infrastructure, collecting this data in a central platform and then addressing every need of residents and visitors from this master data centre.\"</p><p> Transforming lifestyle and locationIn a world of big dreams and even bigger fortunes, the construction of mind-bogglingly grandiose urban utopias -- think Saudi Arabia's Neom and the US' Telosa -- is no longer novel. But the Ellinikon stands out for being more, well, grounded. It's fully funded through its first phase of development, unlike others that have struggled with financing. And the massive project, which commenced work in June 2021, is quickly becoming reality, with the foundations of a vast state-of-the-art Sports Park laid this year, and the first tendrils of the Riviera Tower, the Mediterranean's tallest skyscraper at 50 floors, poking up close to the waterfront. Existing buildings, such as the Eero Saarinen-designed former airport terminal, which have been deemed to be environmentally kosher, are undergoing restoration to be repurposed in the new development.</p><p> Athanasiou says the project was created in consultation with the community, so public spaces abound. Its centrepiece is a coastal park, fertilised by compost and irrigated with cleaned sewage water, that will be one of the world's biggest when it opens next year. The tract will take up almost a third of the Ellinikon's area and double the green space in Athens, which has been dubbed a \"concrete capital\" for its lack of parks. With one million trees and 50 km of trails, it's perhaps the one thing locals are most looking forward to. Outside the park, an already complete Ellinikon Experience Centre houses community events such as music performances and film screenings, while by 2027, a 1 km-long public beach will open along the coastline. </p><p> Designs on the worldThose who want a slice of this future have plenty of big-name, Leed-certified residential options to choose from. The biophilic Riviera Tower, by Foster + Partners, takes indoors-outdoors design to a new level of luxury, with open-terrace living rooms that promise breathtaking views of the Aegean Sea. Next to the waterfront, Kengo Kuma's Marina Residences combine elegance with eco-friendly living (and a convenient spot next to the swish Riviera Galleria mall, which is also being designed by the storied Japanese architect). Meanwhile, the Little Athens neighbourhood to the west of the site will embrace local materials, and be home to a clutch of condos by both local and international practices. In total, about 8,000 units will be built, with prices starting from 6,000 euros per square metre. Many have already been sold, including all 170 units in the Riviera Tower.</p><p> Other offerings include what will be Southern Europe's largest and most modern mall by AEDAS, which will house 350 stores, a Hard Rock integrated casino and resort, and a Mandarin Oriental hotel and residences slated to launch in mid-2027. </p><p> Although completion of the entire development is some time away, the project's ambition and the promise of so many starchitect and brand names are already buoying holiday hotspots in the riviera. Last month, One &amp; Only officially opened its first resort in Greece along the same stretch, as did 91 Athens Riviera, a luxury glamping resort with a focus on wellness. Come summer, the hip Ace Hotel will set up camp in the riviera's Glyfada neighbourhood. </p><p> International influences, local love If certain aspects of the Ellinikon sound familiar, that's because the project drew inspiration from Singapore -- the Lion City was one of 17 case studies that Lamda and its consultants, McKinsey, studied in their research. </p><p> \"One of my biggest inspirations, not just for the Ellinikon, but in general, is Singapore,\" enthuses Athanasiou. \"I visited the city in 1999 and I was impressed how an island like this has become a world leader in so many things -- the green space, the creation of science and being a hub in transportation, financial services, culture and many others. After Lamda was appointed for the Ellinikon, I revisited Singapore, to see the Marina Bay development and specifically Marina Bay Sands. A truly successful global example.\" He highlights MBS as an example of the importance of having established names when it comes to the design of a development -- the Moshe Safdie landmark helped double the number of tourist arrivals in Singapore in eight years.</p><p> Still, it's clear that the Ellinikon's aspirations are very much focused on the wider world. \"Our vision is not to create real-estate projects and venues in buildings, but experiences that make people's lives better,\" explains the CEO. \"Sustainability is a fashionable word, but for us it is a very meaningful target that we are pursuing.\"</p><p> Sales pitch aside, the development is ultimately an ode to the resolute spirit of a country that has struggled for years, but is now finally poised to take off. \"Timing, probably for the first time in the last two decades, is in our favour,\" mulls Athanasiou. \"This is going to have a great effect on the way people perceive Greece. It cannot be measured in numbers today, but five years from now, it's going to be significant. This puts Greece on the map again -- for the right reasons this time.\"</p><p> The writer was a guest of Lamda Development</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-OLAQSH5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CFV-SSC1-JCF2-8005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Technology is a powerful enabler. We speak to the experts about the opportunities in climate-related tech.Q: What is the opportunity set in climate tech for investors, and what types of innovation are most promising? Xiaying Zhang: We believe the market opportunity for mitigation- and adaptation-related climate solutions is enormous and necessary. While some individuals and companies may be willing to make trade-offs for more climate-friendly solutions, it is unlikely that society will accept trade-offs at the scale needed. </p><p>People are unlikely to stop travelling and consuming, and businesses are unlikely to stop producing. Regulation will be essential, but ultimately, solutions will need to be market-driven and stand on their own to be truly scalable.The range of investable climate solutions continues to broaden and expand. We continue to see declining costs and increased market adoption in areas such as renewables and electric vehicles (EVs), and this is likely to ramp up over time with ongoing scientific and technological innovation - for example, advances in solar materials and battery technology.Regarding adaptation, improved near-term weather and longer-term climate forecasting should help companies adjust their operations in real time to account for extreme weather events and to incorporate future climate risks into long-term asset planning. Parametric weather insurance is emerging as a way for businesses and consumers to hedge their revenue or asset risk around weather-related risks. Together, these combine into a wide range of potentially high-return, high-impact opportunities, particularly within growth-stage climate-tech companies.We also think several secular trends support disruptive climate-focused entrepreneurs. For example, as the list of countries and corporations committed to net-zero emissions grows, we expect high levels of global infrastructure spend, creating a foundation for innovative, asset-light companies to build on. In addition, consumers are demanding transparency and choices that match their climate-related values, and companies are in search of innovation that can help them meet that demand.In our view, this creates an enormous opportunity for innovations and technology that address climate change while delivering a superior user experience without trade-offs. We see all of this reflected in the growth of climate-related investments across public and private markets.Rachel Teo: Based on the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 report - which sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 - the investable opportunity until 2050 in the scenario where net zero is indeed achieved by mid-century is approximately US$126 trillion, or US$4.2 trillion a year over the next 30 years. However, even in a Stated Policies Scenario, as the IEA calls it, there is still significant momentum behind green solutions because of favourable conditions - such as existing and committed climate actions by governments, and the fall in climate change-related technology costs. The opportunity set for investors when it comes to technology solutions that aid the transition lies both within transition assets and green solutions providers. The former focuses on supporting high-carbon businesses that are credibly transitioning towards low-carbon business models, while the latter is about funding companies that are providing decarbonisation solutions for transitioning businesses and the economy at large. In both categories, the opportunity set for investors is broad - spanning public and private markets and across the full capital structure.Among six sectors that climate technologies can be categorised into (such as electricity, transport, buildings, industrial processes, low-emission fuels, and agriculture, forestry and other land use), electricity and transport represent the largest investment opportunities.Some technological solutions are already well established, such as solar and wind. But many are still nascent or early-stage, such as direct air capture (DAC), green hydrogen and nuclear fusion.While we do see many promising innovations, GIC's investment decisions are based on value creation and returns, including factors such as attractive risk-reward proposition and a good path to commercialisation. At GIC, we invest across both the entire technology spectrum and various stages of a company's growth because of our long-term orientation, flexible capital, and multi-asset portfolio. Our investments range from private equity (in technologies such as carbon capture or green steel) to infrastructure (in a company building EV charging infrastructure) to public equity (in an environmental, social and governance or ESG data provider), to debt financing (for companies working on geothermal energy solutions). This breadth allows us not only to invest in multiple innovative solutions, but also to support firms at various stages of development.Mathieu Forcioli: As a bank, we have a leading role to play in mobilising the transition to net zero by supporting our customers in their own transition to lower emissions. This involves helping companies access sustainable finance and expertise, and investing in climate solutions in collaboration with our partners and investors all over the world to scale up new technologies and approaches at pace.The global race to net zero presents an opportunity for investors, such as opening up new asset classes and products targeting, for example, technology and green infrastructure. At this stage, however, it is estimated that around half the technologies needed to meet the challenge are not yet commercially deployable and require rapid scaling-up. To date, the major focus in terms of decarbonisation has been low-carbon power generation, but we know this will not be enough to meet targets. Reducing emissions in the transport sector is another focal point, helping to drive substantial disruption in the auto and mobility industries from new competitors and technologies. Therefore, one pertinent theme for investors today is \"future transport\". The IEA estimates that 6 per cent of cumulative emission reductions in 2021-2050 could be achieved by using hydrogen-based fuels. Globally, government policy is driving both infrastructure development and vehicle transition via fuel standards, emission targets and incentives. Major vehicle manufacturers are accelerating their push to launch zero-carbon electric truck models, based both on battery and hydrogen fuel cell drivetrain technologies. And, more broadly, the convergence of mobility and technology underscores the structural importance of semiconductors and software. This is an exciting opportunity for investors. Cutting-edge, smart technologies and tech-based solutions can also help preserve nature, thereby indirectly contributing to net-zero emissions. We see many compelling examples of this, such as the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to convert food waste into insect-based animal feed, thereby helping reduce waste, carbon emissions and deforestation, and the use of agricultural methane detection technology to help cut emissions, reverse forest loss and regenerate biodiversity. In addition, the application of financial technology to the climate change challenge is bringing new investment solutions and opportunities to the VC space, which are all important in the transition towards net-zero emissions.Q: Venture capital is an avenue for investors to get exposure to climate tech. What are some of the challenges investors face when investing in climate tech'Zhang: The climate crisis represents a useful example whereby many venture-stage companies are developing new technologies, which may play a key role in helping every sector of the economy transform by reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, and making global energy supply more sustainable. At the same time, investors should not overlook that investing in these more illiquid private companies comes with specific risks. Therefore, this is only appropriate for investors who can take a long-term approach, as exiting an investment in the event of financial or sustained underperformance may be difficult. Moreover, transparency and governance may be more limited compared to investments in publicly listed companies. Overall, some of these management teams may have less experience with public shareholder scrutiny and engagement than existing public companies.Investors need to ensure that the investee companies ultimately deliver real-world solutions in the fight against climate change - meaning the rigorous measurement of actual impact is critical when identifying and monitoring investments.However, impact measurement in private markets - particularly in VC - has specific considerations, including data availability and uncertainty, given that many of these companies are innovators and disrupters aiming to transform the industry. Further, if the investment thesis involves an innovative company with a new, first-to-market solution that is expected to be widely adopted, it is important to consider both the individual company and the potential ecosystem change.Teo: Given the early-stage nature of venture investing, there are many challenges for investors, particularly in evaluating the technology and the commercialisation risk.For some climate technologies, the solutions are still pre-commercialisation or scale-up. These require significant upfront capital and potentially years of research before any revenue is generated. In some cases, there may be significant asset management requirements to help company management teams develop business strategy, support growth, and monitor performance. For investors, the bar for domain expertise to be able to evaluate opportunities is thus very high.Additionally, business models may not be proven yet, and investors face significant uncertainties regarding the supporting ecosystem or infrastructure, including policies and regulations. The upshot, however, is that a climate tech startup which successfully achieves commercialisation is likely to have deeper competitive moats, making it tougher for competitors to replicate its products.Climate technology presents unique organisational challenges for investors. As climate technology covers a wide range of sectors and markets, investment teams require broad-based sector and regional experience. Furthermore, a long-term mindset is required to understand the full value of climate-tech solutions, as well as patience to support companies in their scaling-up. The climate-tech ecosystem is a quickly evolving one, with new companies having the potential to disrupt incumbents. Engaging early in this space in a considered and controlled manner allows GIC to understand the evolution of these promising technologies and better discern the winners. All investments, however, still carry risks. We look at these very carefully, put them through our stringent investment due diligence process, and subject them to risk controls which include starting with small investments and scaling up only when investments are sufficiently de-risked.Forcioli: By some estimates, over a quarter of all VC funding goes into climate technology, with strong growth over the last decade. Still, the amounts we are speaking about represent a fraction of total flows into private equity and VC, and fluctuate each year, which may impact the sustainability and growth of the climate-tech ecosystem. Thus, challenges remain along the road to fulfilling the climate objective. For example, while the long-term nature of private market investments lends itself to investing in technology, the illiquid nature of the investment and the uncertainty of cash flow generation later in life may suit a smaller pool of investors from a risk-return perspective. Factor in the time and risk involved in research and development - and, in many cases, a fund's lack of track record - and it is reasonable to see how this combination of longer time frames and unproven technology does not work for many VC investors, who typically want to see returns in five to seven years.On top of this, investors can find it challenging to monitor impact outcomes or assess the alignment of sustainability objectives to a portfolio company or fund manager due to a lack of benchmarks and data, which makes reporting and disclosure more difficult.But with challenges come opportunities. We see promising structural growth opportunities in clean energy and green technologies, including in innovations in solar, wind and hydrogen power, EVs, and green infrastructure such as flood walls which increase resilience of urban areas to natural disasters. Nature-based solutions in \"climate smart\" city planning can benefit city dwellers, reduce the carbon footprint and promote biological diversity.Q: In climate tech, how should impact be measured and tracked; and how do you set investor expectations for the likely outcomes'Zhang: We believe there are a few best practices that may help companies and investors navigate the unique challenges of measuring impact in this constantly evolving space. In setting investor expectations, there are four ways to authentically measure the progress companies create: Use existing wisdom to inform your approach. Generally accepted frameworks and principles in the industry include Impact Management Norms and Global Impact Investing Network's Iris+ system. Each provides a holistic view of impact and how best to derive key performance indicators (KPIs). Commit to assessing real-world impact with KPIs. Gathering regular data over the life of an investment speaks to actual outcomes. Ensure business model alignment. Considering that companies may have several different growth options, impact investing is potentially most powerful when there is strong alignment between the profit-seeking objectives and the ability to solve a pressing social or environmental problem. Do more than report the data. Data should be analysed and benchmarked over time to embed feedback. This helps to inform ongoing discussions with the company, as well as influence future investments in similar sectors. Teo: At a baseline level, tracking the financial performance and subjecting the company to the same standard of financial discipline as non-climate-tech companies are important and a key focus at GIC.Impact measurement is an evolving space and best practices are still developing. Some possible measures could include activity-based metrics, such as the amount of fossil fuel-powered energy usage the technology replaces (or has the potential to replace), or the amount of clean energy generated. We could also look to emissions-based metrics, including avoided emissions, which is something that GIC is evaluating. For solutions such as DAC, the relevant metric could be how much carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. Metrics could also be revenue-based, such as measuring the percentage of green revenues generated by the company based on globally accepted taxonomies.Forcioli: Investors are looking for a greater level of transparency in portfolio companies and a higher utility level from deployed capital. The measurement and tracking of impact largely depends on the level of disclosure from portfolio companies and the availability of data. In general, impact measurement can be conducted via quantitative assessment and mission-alignment measurement. For a quantitative assessment, a manager may employ a proprietary impact assessment tool to identify and assess ESG objectives, which are tracked using indicators such the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals or other climate-related science-based targets. For example, corporates may report active emission-reduction targets by years or Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.Alternatively, an investment manager may select bespoke KPIs for each investment to align mission and measurement. However, this approach may limit the ability to make comparisons across different investments, as the metrics can differ. With the rapid development of climate tech, investment managers have also evolved their own measurement methodologies with the help of sustainability consultancies and agencies, but industry standardisation remains a work in progress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The IEA estimates that the investible opportunity for the global energy sector to reach net zero by 2050, is about US$126 trillion over the next 30 years.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67GV-5N21-DYX4-00M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Contrary to all expectations, higher rates have brought sanity to the market, not a bloodbath. For fixed-income investors, that's a very good thing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Barring unforeseen events, it looks as if 2024 will finally end a dark era for global bond investors and the world economy -- a regime led by zero and even negative interest rate policies that forced investors and savers to take on uncomfortable amounts of risk. History will not look back favourably at this period and the many unintended consequences such policies brought. </p><p> The new regime, with rates higher but likely not rising any further, presents something of a Goldilocks scenario for fixed income. Finally, \"yield is destiny\". In other words, while we can always expect periods of volatility, long-term fixed-income investors should see elevated yields manifest as elevated returns, with little to fear from interest-rate risk eating away at their positions. </p><p> How should investors think about repositioning themselves for a big year in the fixed-income market'</p><p> One could say a big year for bonds has already happened in the last two months of 2023. Leveraged loans, investment-grade and corporates and high-yield issues -- which at times last year were great value -- look less attractive now, as much of the juice has already been squeezed out. But despite the rally, attractive values can still be had in a number of areas, with yield characteristics quite attractive overall. That's where individual security selection matters.</p><p> The commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market has been tainted by concerns around commercial real estate since the pandemic broke out. But ever since the global financial crisis, CMBS structures have tightened, with subordination reducing credit risk and providing investors with a quicker path to being repaid in the event of defaults. </p><p> While worries persist about the immediate future of office space in a world where many more people are working from home, the asset class is trading at an attractive discount and the worst predictions of lasting damage to the commercial market seem overblown. In general, there's value in high-quality structured products.</p><p> Financials are another area that stand to benefit from stable or falling rates in this new regime. While there was much hand wringing about the health of the banking system -- especially regional banks -- after Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in March 2023, deposit outflows have since stabilised. </p><p> Banks have been able to rebuild capital, and should soon see increased stability with Basel III Endgame, a new set of banking regulations, on the horizon. These new regulations would increase capital buffers for the biggest banks in the banking system and guard against the issues that caused the collapse of the US regionals.</p><p> There are also significant tailwinds for emerging markets (EM), which were first to raise rates in response to inflation and will likely be the first to cut. Favourable developments for EM include fierce competition between the US and China for hegemony in the global south; the movement of supply chains out of China and growing foreign direct investment in other EMs; and the rising demand for commodities like lithium and copper to build out new technologies and green infrastructure. </p><p> With inflation in EM countries falling faster than developed markets, the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle would greatly benefit EM growth as real rates remain positive. Of course, not all emerging markets are the same. Investors should look at countries such as Indonesia, India and Mexico that are growing rapidly and benefitting directly from the shift in supply chains.</p><p> Investors in European bonds may have more time to adjust to a new regime. </p><p> Recently, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde indicated Europe could see rate cuts in the summer. Europe will likely remain patient for lower inflation numbers and less buoyant profit margins. However, our base case assumes rates will be cut by 50 basis points by Q4 2024.</p><p> How much staying power this new regime of higher rates will have will be determined by the stickiness of inflation. Investors should watch the US labour market, where upward pressure on wages, particularly in the services sector, continues to be buoyed by low unemployment rates even as labour demand has eased. Geopolitical headwinds, such as the threat to shipping lanes in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine, may strain supply chains and further elevate prices. These factors will likely keep the Fed from a dovish turn in the near term.</p><p> While a recession could necessitate rate cuts sooner than expected, we place the odds of a US recession at only 25 per cent. Self-inflicted wounds, however, such as a federal government shutdown, may change that calculus. Historically, for each week that the government is closed, current quarter real GDP contracts by 20 basis points on average. </p><p> In the big picture, however, rates hitting a plateau is the ideal time to invest in bonds. </p><p> Once the Fed and central banks across the globe start cutting rates, we should expect to see even more investors pare back on stocks and cash holdings, and return to more traditional portfolio allocations, which means a massive shift into bonds, and a subsequent fall in yields.</p><p> Investors who fail to lock in higher rates now may end up losing out in the long run.</p><p> The writer is co-chief investment officer, PGIM Fixed Income </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>There was much hand wringing about the health of the banking system after Silicon Valley Bank's collapse in March 2023, but deposit outflows have since stabilised.

It takes a deeper look at the \"priority skills\" needed in the three areas, rating them on two aspects: how much demand has grown since the pre-pandemic year of 2018, and whether they are transferable across different jobs and industries. </p><p> Workers can use the report to assess which skills they already have, and what skills they could seek to gain to become more employable, said SSG in a release. The report is a result of SSG's work with workforce analytics firms to draw data from job portals and talent networks to identify new and emerging skills, said Chan. </p><p> In the green economy, for instance, demand has grown the most for skills in green infrastructure and mobility -- rising almost 200 per cent between 2018 and 2021 -- as well as in energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation.</p><p> Examples of skills needed in green infrastructure and mobility include green facilities management, which might be needed by a building supervisor; electric vehicle and hybrid vehicle maintenance management, for an automotive technician; and climate-mitigating features in the built environment, for an architectural associate.</p><p> There is also growing demand for skills in sustainable finance, urban farming, food technologies and food development.</p><p> Highly transferable skills include those in environment and sustainability management, required in more than 400 roles across areas such as business development, engineering project development and facilities management.</p><p> In the digital economy, software development skills have the highest demand growth of 83 per cent between 2018 and 2021, as well as high transferability. These include software testing, user experience design and software design, for job roles such as software engineer, product designer and quality assurance tester.</p><p> In the future, more job roles will also require skills in e-commerce and digital marketing -- such as customer experience management -- as well as in artificial intelligence, data and analytics.</p><p> For the care economy, human resource advisory and career coaching were found to have both high demand growth and transferability.</p><p> This year's report also looks at potential upskilling and career options for mid-career Singapore workers in their 40s and 50s, based on their existing work experience and expertise. </p><p> \"We are keen to support them in job switches within the same sector or across sectors by highlighting possible upskilling pathways and available resources,\" said Chan.</p><p> For example, they could take up new skills to enter jobs in the three high-growth economies; reskill for opportunities in roles adjacent to their current one; or upskill to stay relevant in their current role, he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-NNV4FU</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XM-CR81-JCF2-829X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
