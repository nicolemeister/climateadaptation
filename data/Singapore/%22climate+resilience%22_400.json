While this may be true for some risks, such as broader economic transition risks, it is clear from repeated headlines that extreme weather events pose an unparallelled risk to businesses worldwide today -- both in terms of financial cost and operational resilience. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> With disasters escalating in frequency and severity, the impact on Singapore businesses and their operations and supply chains around the region continues to grow exponentially. This impact is expected only to grow if net-zero targets are missed and higher levels of carbon are emitted into the atmosphere, further modifying global weather patterns.</p><p> For organisations to not just survive but also remain competitive in the face of these changes, understanding and preparing for climate risks must become an integral part of business strategy. </p><p> Rising costs of a changing climate The statistics speak volumes. According to Nature, climate change could cost the global economy as much as US$24.7 trillion annually by 2060. For context, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and heatwaves have already accrued over US$2.8 trillion in costs since the early 2000s. These risks are no longer hypothetical; they are here, and they are costing businesses millions -- if not billions -- each year. </p><p> The question isn't whether climate risks will affect Singapore companies, but how extensively. This new landscape requires businesses to rethink resilience and prepare for both short and long-term challenges ahead. </p><p> Understanding climate risks Climate risks fall under two primary categories: physical risks and transition risks. Both demand a firm grasp to effectively plan, adapt and safeguard operational continuity. </p><p> Physical risks: Physical risks -- think floods, hurricanes, or heatwaves -- can disrupt supply chains, damage property, and increase operating costs. These events aren't isolated to specific industries; though agriculture, leisure, construction, and retail are particularly vulnerable, no sector is immune. Businesses must evaluate potential vulnerabilities, whether they stem from damaged infrastructure or unexpected supply chain bottlenecks. </p><p> For example, when flooding disrupts warehouses in one region, it can cascade across multiple points in manufacturing or distribution networks, creating financial blowback that compounds over time, threatening revenue and the bottom line. </p><p>Singapore itself is also not immune, facing significant physical risk through more extreme rainfall and potential sea level rises -- about 30 per cent of the island nation is less than five metres above sea level.</p><p> Carbon emitted to date has already exacerbated physical risks today through modification of global weather patterns, and these effects are not expected to reverse even if the global economy achieves net-zero by its stated targets.</p><p> Transition risks: The movement towards a low-carbon economy brings its own set of challenges known as transition risks. These can include shifting consumer preferences, legislation forcing greener operations, and reputational pressures. Transition risks are multifaceted, encompassing: </p><p> The need for modelling climate risks  To act strategically against these risks, climate risk modelling has become non-negotiable. Forward-looking models aren't just about compliance; they provide businesses with critical, actionable insights to safeguard and optimise operations for years to come. By assessing risks under varying future warming scenarios, decision-makers can proactively adapt strategies instead of scrambling reactively in the wake of disaster. </p><p> Effective modelling can help businesses answer essential questions:</p><p> Retailers, for example, are already taking preemptive action -- designing flood-resistant buildings, replacing vulnerable materials such as sheet roofing, geographically diversifying their supply chain, or relocating operations altogether. Small adjustments today could prevent massive disruptions tomorrow. </p><p> Additionally, it's important to note that regulators from jurisdictions including Singapore, the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, and the US state of California are shifting from voluntary recommendations to mandatory disclosure requirements, starting as early as 2025. These rules ask businesses to report both risks and opportunities associated with climate change, in line with frameworks developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) -- pushing organisations to assess impact not only defensively but also with an eye towards growth. </p><p> Opportunities beyond risk management While climate risks dominate headlines, the flip side is often overlooked. Addressing these risks provides fertile ground for innovation, operational efficiencies, and brand differentiation. Many organisations are already capitalising on green opportunities by investing in renewable energy, developing sustainable products, and streamlining resource usage. </p><p> From adopting carbon-neutral logistics to innovating in areas such as carbon capture and electric technology, these strategies don't just limit exposure -- they create new competitive advantages. By integrating sustainability into corporate practices, businesses can build stronger relationships with consumers, investors, and employees alike. </p><p> Climate change presents looming challenges, but it also provides an unprecedented moment for leadership in Singapore -- something the Singapore government and many businesses here have taken up the mantle on already.

Meanwhile, countless local communities remain overlooked-communities with rich traditions, sustainable practices, and untapped entrepreneurial potential. It can feel as if they are fighting alone, disconnected from the innovation economy, their livelihoods stuck in cycles of survival rather than growth.</p><p>But what if more founders build with them, and not for them-unlocking models that resonate with nature, empower communities, and create lasting economic value?</p><p>Forest commodities: Rich, regenerative, and undervalued</p><p>Southeast Asia's next wave of startups could emerge from these nature-based sectors, leveraging sustainable conditions, regenerating ecosystems, and uplifting local communities.</p><p>With consumer preferences shifting toward products with deeper environmental and social impact, there is growing room for founders to reimagine innovation, combining natural resources, community empowerment, and climate-positive practices to build businesses that deliver both profit and purpose.</p><p>The blue economy: SEA's oceanic opportunity for climate and livelihoods</p><p>Across Southeast Asia, forest landscapes are not just ecological treasures; they are also home to some of the world's most valuable natural commodities. Indonesia, for instance, produces over 70 per cent of the world's  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/nutmeg-market\">nutmeg.</url></p><p>Meanwhile, it dominates over  <url normalizedValue=\"https://ultranl.com/naturals-indonesia-update/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">90 per centof global patchouli oil production, shipping up to 1,500 MT annually, largely from smallholder farms, alongside cardamom, candlenut, and other high-value forest products. Yet, most of these commodities are exported as raw materials, with local communities receiving minimal benefits from their production.</url></p><p>This opportunity extends beyond forests. Southeast Asia's oceans-through regenerative aquaculture, seaweed farming, and blue food industries-hold similarly transformative potential. A recent report by Standard Chartered Bank suggests that the blue economy could unlock up to  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sc.com/en/campaigns/blue-economy/\">US\u202f$15 trillion in value and mitigate 40 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing even the climate impact of ocean renewables or transport.</url></p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/how-business-leaders-can-become-the-messiah-for-climate-change-20190903/\">Burning urgency: Why businesses must mobilise against forest fires and climate change</url></p><p>While ocean-based industries like seaweed farming and shrimp aquaculture already exist, many current practices fail to prioritise environmental health. In places like  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2024/10/a-tipping-point-for-mangrove-restoration-and-shrimp-farming-in-indonesia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Delta Mahakam, Indonesia, monoculture shrimp ponds have destroyed climate-critical mangrove forests and contaminated groundwater.</url></p><p>In  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/how-flood-finance-sustainable-seafood-could-help-save-ocean-2025-01-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Mindanao, Philippines, over-intensified seaweed farms have smothered seagrass beds, damaged coral reefs, and worsened microplastic pollution. Excessive reliance on chemicals, antibiotics, and unsustainable feed further strains fragile ecosystems.</url></p><p>Yet, done differently, these industries can become powerful forces for restoration. Sustainable aquaculture can relieve pressure on wild fish stocks, while regenerative seaweed farming can sequester carbon, improve water quality, and support coastal livelihoods. With better practices, Southeast Asia's oceans offer a blueprint for businesses that deliver both climate resilience and economic opportunity.</p><p>A call to founders: Build beyond the cities</p><p>The future of Southeast Asia's startup ecosystem doesn't have to be limited to urban tech. From the bounty of our forests to the resilience of our oceans, there is a unique opportunity to build businesses that heal ecosystems, empower communities, and offer global consumers products with real impact.</p><p>It's time for founders-and investors-to look beyond the cities, and start building with nature at the heart of innovation.</p><p>-</p><p>Editor's note:e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

Bayan Group is spearheading cooperative governance training, while Mayani will deliver climate-smart and sustainable agriculture modules.</p><p>Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Facility: This facility is designed to finance climate-resilient infrastructure, including smart greenhouses, precision irrigation, rainwater harvesting systems, drought-resistant seed varieties, and bio-fertilisers. These upgrades aim to enable year-round, adaptive production while reducing vulnerability to environmental shocks.</p><p>The initiative also includes creating a cooperative development manual to ensure scalability and replicability across other regions.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/trumps-trade-barriers-and-crypto-bets-rewriting-the-rules-of-global-markets-20250711/\">Trump's trade barriers and crypto bets: Rewriting the rules of global markets</url></p><p>'This important partnership will aim to support local farmers and fishermen to adapt climate-resilient practices and strengthen their businesses, while also striving to contribute towards the improvement of food security in the Philippines,' said Sandeep Uppal, CEO of HSBC Philippines.</p><p>For Mayani and Bayan, the strategy is both grassroots and systems-oriented. 'If agricultural cooperativesare effectively mobilised to serve as agents of climate adaptation, social, economic, and even environmental benefits could potentially be delivered to its millions of members,' said Prof. Carlo Sagun, CEO of Bayan Group.</p><p>Mayani co-founder Ochie San Juan framed the intervention as a response to intensifying climate risks: 'We see [climate hazards] as known constants in agriculture, and it's high-time we tackle them head on.'</p><p>The program will begin in vulnerable food corridors in Luzon and Visayas this year and plans to expand into the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in 2026. The latter phase integrates peacebuilding and economic revitalisation into the agricultural agenda, addressing ecological and socio-political fragility.</p><p>In a country where over 70 per cent of the food supply is produced by smallholders, climate change has emerged as a compounding threat to livelihoods and food security. Vulnerable to increasingly erratic weather patterns yet under-resourced for adaptation, Filipino farmers face a dual crisis. The situation is especially acute for women smallholders, who face disproportionate challenges due to limited access to training, financing, and agricultural inputs.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/profitable-ai-driven-and-ipo-ready-inside-carros-next-chapter-20250711/\">Profitable, AI-driven, and IPO-ready: Inside Carro's next chapter</url></p><p>Against this backdrop, Mayani and Bayan's collaboration aims to operationalise clustered, smallholder-led cooperatives that integrate regenerative farming practices and climate-smart technologies to future-proof rural food production.</p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/hsbc-funding-to-scale-climate-smart-agriculture-for-filipino-smallholders-20250711/\">Mayani, Bayan tap HSBC funding to scale climate-smart agriculture for Filipino smallholders appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/hsbc-funding-to-scale-climate-smart-agriculture-for-filipino-smallholders-20250711/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG11931401JZWH4VKJVQERPW3TJEK23YBS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G7M-2GG3-RTFS-Y4FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><timeReceived>10:36 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Beyond showing a green upside to projects, they must also make a compelling business case for them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The central challenge for today's CSO is how to deliver on sustainability goals profitably while balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders. This means making the most of recent financial and technological innovations. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This new pressure is a key finding of CBRE's 2025 Asia Pacific Real Estate Chief Sustainability Officer Survey. We interviewed executives from nearly two dozen corporates in Asia-Pacific -- most notably Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore and mainland China -- divided equally between landlords and investors in commercial real estate. </p><p> The survey reveals a maturing landscape: Nearly 90 per cent of these companies have a dedicated sustainability function -- up 10 per cent in two years -- and 70 per cent of their CSOs are full-time. When asked to identify their most pressing challenges, these leaders highlighted three issues that have grown sharply in importance since 2024. </p><p> First, the CSOs pointed to the complexity of the current policy and business environment.</p><p> Second, they cited the difficulty of establishing clear financial benefits of meeting their sustainability goals, and the typically lengthy payback periods for sustainability investments. </p><p> Finally, CSOs find that they increasingly must do more with less. More than 60 per cent said they had no plans to expand their sustainability teams, despite heightened operational challenges.  </p><p> One reason for this corporate caution is a regional step change. Sustainable buildings are no longer the exception in Asia-Pacific, they are becoming the norm. </p><p> CBRE research indicates that the share of green-certified Asia-Pacific office floorspace crossed the 50 per cent threshold in 2024. Our 2025 survey reflects this momentum: Almost two-thirds of respondents said that by 2028, at least 80 per cent of their portfolio will consist of green-certified buildings. </p><p> While this is good news for sustainability, it also means that the scope for a green premium is fading. Tenants now expect sustainability features and performance as a standard offering, not an extra for which they will pay higher rent. </p><p> The exception is in less mature Asia-Pacific markets, where the supply of green buildings is tighter and occupiers remain willing to pay more for a building that aligns with their sustainability goals. </p><p> This leaves CSOs in the position of needing to meet tenant expectations for green buildings -- 60 per cent reported pressure from tenants in this regard -- while also satisfying internal stakeholders to justify sustainability investments in financial terms, as opposed to treating sustainability as an end in itself. </p><p> Several CSOs said they needed to demonstrate a return on investment to win approval for projects.</p><p> How, then, should CSOs go about this? The path forward involves shifting the focus from purely environmental benefits to the underlying business case and asset resilience.</p><p> The first step is to recognise that green is the new normal. The sustainability of commercial buildings in Asia-Pacific is quickly transitioning from a \"nice to have\" to a \"must have\" -- an essential component of the asset's value. </p><p> Additionally, assessing the risk of assets becoming stranded as a result not only of changing tenant expectations but also regulatory change, must be a core part of the calculus for CSOs in establishing the business case for sustainability investments. </p><p> Next, while sustainability tends to focus on carbon emissions, energy savings and cost savings usually go hand in hand. Sustainable building materials offer an example -- for instance, the use of abundant bamboo instead of timber in China. Energy dashboards that optimise lighting as well as heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems around building footfall reduce both costs and emissions. </p><p> Energy retrofits that limit energy waste can have the same impact, although some CSOs noted government incentives are often needed to make these projects viable. </p><p> On the positive side, the financial sector also offers additional help. Energy upgrades and new green construction are often eligible for green finance. Sustainability-linked loans are the most common instrument, which 77 per cent of survey respondents reported using, alongside green loans, green bonds and other similar instruments. Concessional financing can substantially improve the business case for sustainability projects. </p><p> Lastly, as climate change poses a direct physical threat to buildings, investing in building resilience is a core part of protecting an asset's long-term value. Taking an integrated approach that prioritises resilience alongside other factors makes sense at a time when under-insurance against climate risks is a growing challenge. </p><p> Overall, CSOs can build a stronger business case by focusing on projects that strengthen an asset's green credentials while simultaneously lowering its energy costs and bolstering its climate resilience. This approach then becomes as much about the bottom line as it is about cutting carbon emissions.  </p><p> Ultimately, real estate leaders who integrate sustainability with profitability will set the pace for the region's future.</p><p> The writer is head of research for Asia-Pacific at CBRE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-T6KCCDJ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFF-BSD3-RRPT-1500-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Good afternoon to all of you. It is my pleasure to join you today at this SEAPAW Ecosperity event.</p><p>Impact of climate change on Southeast Asia</p><p>2. It is fitting that this event is called \"Water at the Core: Accelerating Climate Adaptation in Southeast Asia\", as climate change impacts are becoming more apparent worldwide in the form of more extreme weather events, such as droughts and storms. Although the world has made some progress in climate mitigation since the Paris Agreement, efforts remain insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. If global temperature rise overshoots this and reaches 2 degree Celsius, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that 50% more of the world's population would live under water stress.</p><p>3. Water stress arises from the extremes of too little and too much water. Too little water, and many of Southeast Asia's economic activities, such as agriculture and tourism which depend on water, will be severely affected. Too much water, and this could lead to sea level rise and flooding, threatening our people given our geography comprising long coastlines, low-lying islands, and dense urban centres.</p><p>Singapore Water Story</p><p>4. These are among the starkest environmental challenges facing Singapore. As a small island city-state with limited natural catchment, Singapore is amongst the most water stressed in the world. Our Water Story demonstrated that acknowledging our vulnerabilities can spur us to overcome them by leveraging technologies to diversify our water sources. Singapore began studying the feasibility of reclaimed water since the 1970s, and today NEWater has become one of our weather-resilient sources in Singapore's \"Four National Taps\" strategy.</p><p>5. At the same time, being situated in the tropics also results in the problem of too much water within a short span of time. In the 1960s and 1970s, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon season. While Singapore has invested in expanding our drainage infrastructure, it is not feasible to expand our drains to cater for every extreme rainfall event. We are thus enhancing community resilience by supporting our community to better prepare for and respond to flood incidents, such as by issuing early warnings of potential flood. The next chapter of flood resilience will be coastal protection to deal with rising sea levels. Many of you would have heard about initiatives such as our Long Island, which will not only protect our low-lying east coast from sea level rise, but also create new land for future opportunities.</p><p>Investing in Climate Resilience</p><p>6. Our experience has shown us that it is important to understand our risks clearly, start early and invest conscientiously to strengthen our climate resilience. However, there is serious underinvestment worldwide. According to a report by the Climate Policy Initiative, global investments in climate adaptation and resilience initiatives made up only 5% of total annual climate finance and 20-30% of projected annual climate adaptation financing needs. I would like to touch on two areas where there are opportunities to do better.</p><p>7. First, the private sector. We need to increase the private sector's awareness of physical climate risks and the cost-of-inaction. Understanding climate risks is key to business strategy and future-proofing your business. When it comes to addressing climate risks, prevention is better than cure. A small investment in climate resilience today can help to address broader risks, and mitigate potentially larger future losses. There are many ways to help companies tackle climate risks. First, we need better climate projections, such as the findings from Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study (V3), which we completed last year. V3 provides the highest resolution of climate projections over Southeast Asia for parameters such as rainfall and temperature. Through our recently launched V3 Data Sharing Portal, companies can tap on V3 climate projections to understand the climate risks in their supply chains under future conditions. Next, climate disclosure frameworks can encourage companies to pay closer attention to their climate risks across geographies and supply chains. Beginning Financial Year (FY) 2025, there will be a move towards mandatory climate-related disclosures for listed companies and large non-listed companies in Singapore. These disclosures will be aligned with the framework developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). This will raise companies' awareness and spur them to take a more informed view of addressing climate risks. I encourage companies to leverage climate projections such as V3 for your climate risk assessment, and to undertake climate disclosure seriously.</p><p>8. With climate disclosure, the risks become more apparent, and companies would seek to reduce their climate exposure. One way would be to relocate their operations to another place with less climate risk. A more beneficial approach would be for companies to invest in where they operate, increasing the community's climate resilience while also strengthening their supply chain resilience. For example, Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company (SSMC) is Singaporean wafer fabrication company who has been recycling water at an average of 67%, above the industry average of 45%. This improves onsite water efficiency and decreases water consumption, leading to a more water-resilient supply chain, especially during the dry months of the year. I would like to challenge companies to explore how you can do likewise for your operations throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p>9. The second area we can focus on is to enhance adaptation finance. We can do so by making climate adaptation projects more bankable through blended finance, and also by building capability in climate finance.</p><p>10. Collectively, we should explore how to support blended finance in climate adaptation, so that we can create more bankable projects that crowd in private capital to plug the gap in adaptation financing. This is important as only about 2% of adaptation finance comes from private and philanthropic sectors. Blended finance can make adaptation projects more bankable through a combination of concessional capital, technical assistance and de-risking mechanisms. Concessional capital could comprise grants or guarantees, with technical assistance covering areas such as project development to strengthen investor confidence and project bankability. We need to reduce the project risks sufficiently to attract private commercial capital.</p><p>11. Putting these altogether, we should also recognise the critical role that local partners and NGOs like SEAPAW play. SEAPAW builds on the Singapore International Foundation (SIF)'s track record over the past 34 years, whose projects have created community benefits in more than 28 countries. Through SEAPAW's network of partners, it can localise global solutions and partner them with the right financing options which are suited to the needs of communities. One example is SEAPAW's project in Sarawak, Malaysia, which aims to bring clean water to rural communities. The project uses advancements in membrane technology in the water purification process to enhance water resilience and address the issue of clean water supply. At the same time, it is powered sustainably by a renewable energy source. Once the pilot is successful and partnered with the right financing, it can be scaled up to benefit many more communities within Southeast Asia. This multi-stakeholder approach taken by SEAPAW allows them to harness the strengths from across the public, private and philanthropic sectors, and bring them to bear in addressing the climate challenges we face in our region.</p><p>Closing</p><p>12. In closing, similar to how Singapore made early investments in NEWater, which is now a key pillar for our water resilience, we need to invest now for the future for our climate resilience. We need to act decisively today for the long-term, by increasing the knowledge on risks and encouraging climate adaptation finance. I encourage organisations and individuals across sectors to explore how you can contribute to this collective effort. Whether through funding, innovation, or community support, do join SEAPAW in accelerating Southeast Asia's climate resilience.</p><p>[Category: Water Utilities, Utilities, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066247606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRS-KJ83-SH6C-G1P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1580\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 6, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards 2025 showed how, across Asia and beyond, startups, NGOs, government agencies, and investors could come together to respond to the world's most urgent disasters. They are doing so not just with technology, but with the trust and coordination needed to scale impact where it matters most. From climate resilience in public health to real-time disaster mapping and comprehensive early warning systems, this growing community is redefining what it means to be ready.</p><p>Created by Prudence Foundation, the Awards drew 112 applications from 31 countries. Indeed, this shows that innovation in disaster technologies is gaining momentum. The seven finalists selected for the 2025 cohort reflected not just technical excellence, but deep relevance to on-the-ground needs. From drone-enabled healthcare logistics to wildfire detection AI, each offered a glimpse into what's possible when resilience is designed to serve people first. Far more than a competition, the SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards became a launchpad for partnerships and catalytic support to further develop and scale their solutions. It has become a catalyst for systems change and a proof point that resilience is a shared responsibility.</p><p>The challenge tracks: Building for now and what's next</p><p>This year, the Awards centered around two core challenge tracks: 1) Climate &amp; Health, and 2) Smart Resilience. Each track reflected a critical dimension of disaster response. The former addressed the compounding health risks driven by environmental change. Meanwhile, the latter focused on strengthening systems to better anticipate, withstand, and recover from crises.</p><p>The Climate &amp; Health track spotlighted technologies that confront the growing intersection of climate volatility and public health. From air quality deterioration and disease outbreaks to post-disaster medical access, these challenges demand solutions that work in both low-resource settings and high-impact zones. Finalists in this category brought forward ideas that made resilience tangible: drone logistics for essential healthcare supplies, solar-powered warmth for displaced families, and data-backed systems for clean indoor air.</p><p>Also read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/climate-health-under-threat-tech-life-saving-solutions-20250319/\">Climate and health under threat: How tech can provide life-saving solutions</url></p><p>The Smart Resilience track, on the other hand, explored how real-time information, community engagement, and infrastructure monitoring can reshape the speed and scale of response. These are systems that learn and adapt using AI, crowdsourced data, and IoT to close the gap between early warning and real-world action. From civic tech platforms to anticipatory action planning, these tools were grounded in the communities they serve and designed for long-term impact.</p><p>Each track was a reminder that resilience is never just about bouncing back. It is also about building forward, better and stronger.</p><p>Also read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/smart-resilience-harnessing-tech-disaster-preparedness-response-20250513/\">Smart Resilience: Harnessing tech for disaster preparedness and response</url></p><p>What real-world resilience really demands</p><p>Representatives of Climate &amp; Health category runner-ups Mat Zero and Nafas at Echelon Singapore 2025</p><p>The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards illuminates how innovation becomes impactful. One of the clearest takeaways? Resilience isn't just a technical challenge, but a systems challenge. The most effective solutions revealed a playbook for cross-sector alignment.</p><p>Startups, for one, must design with NGOs and responders in mind. The strongest tools weren't just cutting-edge-they were embedded in humanitarian operations. For instance, Smart Resilience winner  <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.petabencana.id/\">PetaBencana's real-time maps are part of Indonesia's national disaster protocol. The PetaBencana.id platform-and the open source software that powers not just PetaBencana.id, but also multiple platforms across Southeast Asia and beyond-is built entirely through a process of co-research with the widest variety of stakeholders. Every line of code is directly informed by the communities who use it, ensuring the technology evolves directly from the realities on the ground. It is proof that when the people who face disaster design the tools they use, resilience becomes not just possible but scalable.</url></p><p>In addition, first runner-up  <url normalizedValue=\"https://dastaa.anticipatoryaction.org/\">DASTAA's household-level risk assessment approach aims to shift the disaster management paradigm from response-based to data-driven and preparedness-focused. However, DASTAA itself is just a technology and it's the local governments that are in the driver's seat, implementing these data-driven solutions. Innovation works because it brings together data, technology, and people.</url></p><p>Representatives of Smart Resilience category runner-ups DASTAA (Naxa), YoujiVest, and Robotics Cats at Echelon Singapore 2025</p><p>Governments, too, must enable innovation through progressive regulation and procurement.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.skyeair.tech/\">Skye Air, winner of the Climate &amp; Health category, has autonomous drone deliveries that are only possible because the Government in India supports drone delivery operations and has classified it's airspace in Green, Yellow and Red zones allowing likes of Skye Air to conduct various flight operations in Green and Yellow zones.</url></p><p>Similarly,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://caz.nafas.co.id/\">Nafas, the Climate &amp; Health second runner-up, designed its Clean Air Zone service to help organizations meet indoor air quality targets aligned with national and international standards. When regulation opens the door, the right technologies scale faster and safer.</url></p><p>Resilience also needs new thinking from investors and insurers. Smart Resilience second runner-up  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youjivest.com/en/\">YoujiVest's climate risk platform transforms dynamic climate analytics into actionable strategies-proving sustainability and profitability are not contradictory. By integrating real-time physical risk evaluation (e.g., wildfire/flood vulnerability) and transition risk pathways into underwriting and portfolio decisions, YoujiVest turns costly corporate responsibilities into cost-effective risk mitigation. For capital allocators, YoujiVest's insights enable resilience-focused investing-where climate adaptation isn't just ethical, but a core driver of competitive returns.</url></p><p>When communities lead, resilience follows</p><p>Building resilience also requires NGOs to move beyond aid distribution and into active adoption of emerging technologies. Climate &amp; Health first runner-up  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.matzero.com/\">Mat Zero's solar-heated mats, for instance, were field-tested in the Himalayas in Nepal, with plans to roll out further collaborative pilots internationally. Smart Resilience third runner-up</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://roboticscats.com/\">Robotics Cats' wildfire detection tech is deployed not only in public infrastructure, but also in conservation zones, where organisations like Hong Kong Bird Watching Society (HKBSW) use it to monitor both wildfire risks, wetland restoration, and wildlife behaviours. This signals a broader shift: NGOs aren't just delivery channels-they're becoming innovation partners.</url></p><p>Just as critically, survivors of disaster events are no longer passive aid recipients - they are co-creators of community-wide resilience. Platforms like  <url normalizedValue=\"https://info.petabencana.id/\">Peta Bencana are built on citizen-contributed data, turning everyday digital behaviour into real-time disaster intelligence. Other members of the community like</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/bikescoutsphilippines/\">Bike Scouts and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://alertoph.com/\">Alerto PH harness grassroots connectivity, enabling people to alert one another in places where infrastructure breaks down. These models prove that resilience works best when it's not handed down but built from the ground up.</url></p><p>The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Community shows that when each sector plays to its strengths and shares ownership of the outcome, resilience stops being a buzzword. It becomes infrastructure and part of a system that saves lives before, during, and after disaster events. And that's where real impact is materialised.</p><p>Also read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/safe-steps-d-tech-awards-2025-highlights-global-innovations-in-disaster-resilience-20250617/\">SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards 2025 highlights global innovations in disaster resilience</url></p><p>Join the community shaping what comes next</p><p>The SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards 2025 is created by the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.prudentialplc.com/en/prudence-foundation\">Prudence Foundation, in partnership with UNDRR (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifrc.org/\">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services (AWS),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://avpn.asia/\">Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN),</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://mranti.my/\">Malaysian Research Accelerator for Technology &amp; Innovation (MRANTI), and</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.

This was announced by Senior Minister of State for Sustainability and the Environment Dr Amy Khor in her speech at the launch of Go Green SG 2025, our national sustainability movement.</p><p>Tackling Overcooling</p><p>2. Buildings account for over 20 percent of Singapore's carbon emissions, with air-conditioning being a key contributor to building energy consumption. Overcooling not only increases electricity usage but also accelerates climate change and exacerbates the urban heat island effect. This creates a vicious feedback cycle: hotter cities demand more cooling, which generates more emissions and heat, further raising ambient temperatures. This is not sustainable.</p><p>Science-Backed Approach to Sustainable Cooling</p><p>3. A growing body of research affirms the benefits of setting air-conditioning temperatures optimally. A study in partnership with Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Centre for Environmental Sustainability (CfES) showed energy savings of up to 12 percent for each degree raised in air-conditioning temperature from 23C to 25C in offices, with no reported increase in occupant discomfort. Additional energy savings can be achieved when air-conditioning temperatures are set above 25C. Hybrid cooling solutions - which set air-conditioning at a higher temperature complemented with secondary cooling measures such as fans - can bring even greater energy savings.</p><p>4. Go 25 encourages a shift towards sustainable cooling, where higher air-conditioning temperature setpoints reduce air-conditioning energy loads without compromising thermal comfort, to maintain liveability in Singapore's tropical climate in the long run.</p><p>Key Initiatives under Go 25</p><p>5. As part of the Go 25 movement, there will be a series of initiatives and activities to raise awareness on sustainable cooling best practices, and to support businesses and building owners.</p><p>Go 25 Pledge</p><p>6. The Go 25 Pledge is a voluntary industry commitment to sustainable cooling. This initiative enables building owners, businesses, and organisations to commit to:</p><p>*Setting indoor temperatures at 25C or higher, or as close to 25C as possible if it cannot be achieved without compromising comfort due to infrastructural constraints.</p><p>* Adjusting temperature gradually to ease transition for occupants.</p><p>*Providing alternatives such as fans and encouraging relaxed dress codes.</p><p>*Displaying indoor temperatures and promoting the pledge publicly via a downloadable Go 25 Toolkit (includes poster templates, social media assets, and infosheets).</p><p>7. The Go 25 Pledge creates a platform to galvanise Singaporeans to commit to energy-efficient cooling practices. We welcome building owners, businesses, and organisations to pledge via <url normalizedValue=\"https://go.gov.sg/go25\">https://go.gov.sg/go25</url>.</p><p>Go 25 Industry Guide</p><p>8. A Go 25 Industry Guide will be published in the third quarter of 2025 to help facilities managers and building operators implement higher indoor temperatures on their premises. Developed by SGBC and BCA, the Guide will serve as a technical reference for the process and considerations needed when raising indoor ambient temperature, while maintaining occupant comfort. Refer to Annex for the Go 25 factsheet for more information.</p><p>Go 25 Indoor Comfort Quiz and Snapshot</p><p>9. The Go 25 Indoor Comfort Quiz is a fun, interactive online personality quiz that reveals a user's ideal temperature profile and highlights the benefits of higher indoor temperatures. The insights gathered will be aggregated into a report - \"Indoor Comfort Snapshot\" - to showcase temperature preferences, basic energy savings potential and quick actions for businesses to reference along their journey to Go 25. The quiz can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://go.gov.sg/go25\">https://go.gov.sg/go25</url>.</p><p>10. \"When we make our indoor spaces too cold with air conditioning, it is not just uncomfortable, but it takes up a lot of energy. Air conditioning makes up nearly a quarter and half of average household and building energy consumption respectively, which adds to our carbon emissions. Ironically, our unsustainable cooling habits contribute to a warmer climate and in turn, a greater need for air-conditioning,\" said Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment.</p><p>11. \"Overcooling our spaces is not just energy-inefficient; it actively undermines the climate resilience we've embedded into our green buildings through passive design, smart ventilation, and thermal comfort optimisation,\" said Mr. Allen Ang, President of the SGBC. \"Go 25 isn't a compromise - it's an opportunity. Each degree upwards saves energy, and reduces the urban heat island effect. For building owners, this means lower operational costs. For occupants, it means not compromising thermal comfort. And for Singapore, it's a tangible step toward our climate ambitions.\"</p><p>[Category: Engineering and Construction, Construction and Materials, New Offerings, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066312766</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FTW-MH53-RRYX-D128-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 16, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Business &amp;

This prevailing modus operandi is based on the premise of US exceptionalism -- characterised in recent years by the strengthening of the US dollar, US equity markets and investment assets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But of late, the Trump administration's approach towards tariffs, geopolitics and macro-prudential policies has raised questions about the risk premium of investing in US-based and USD-denominated assets. USD weakness -- year to date the USD Index (DXY) has dropped 9.5 per cent -- has eroded overall returns when translated into investors' home currencies, in spite of underlying bullish stock market conditions. The S&amp;P 500 Index has forged new highs. </p><p> Besides prompting a rethink about the vulnerability of outsized allocation to USD-based investments, the recent volatility has also raised questions among investors and asset allocators (including sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurers and high-net-worth investors) about what constitutes safe-haven assets in the long run. </p><p> At Bank of Singapore, we highlighted in our 2025 Supertrends report that a fragmented world order of geopolitical rivalry, rising trade barriers, hostility to immigration and widening populism is rapidly replacing the US-led order of free markets, free trade and globalisation that prevailed after the end of the Cold War. Without multilateralism and globalisation as basic tenets, coalitions and alliances will be founded instead on common interests and agenda. </p><p> Over the next decade, heightened uncertainty will result in volatility in inflationary expectations, interest rates, currencies, and strengthen the search for safe-haven assets. All around the world, fiscal burdens will rise as national security demands higher defence spending; changing demographics call for social expenditure; and infrastructure spending is required for energy security and climate resilience.</p><p> In our view, a \"robust asset allocation\" approach is suited for building long-term portfolios. This analytical optimisation architecture explicitly acknowledges the inherent uncertainty of market inputs (including risk, expected returns and correlation) across a range of outcomes, making for more resilient portfolios that align with investors' long-term goals.</p><p> To reduce portfolio concentration in USD assets, investors can consider geographical diversification to include Europe, Asia and emerging markets, as well as gold and alternative asset classes like private markets. Another viable strategy is to adjust overall portfolio currency exposures to free-floating alternatives such as euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc and Japanese yen, as well as allocations into the SGD.</p><p> Here are some reasons that support an allocation into SGD assets.</p><p> SGD stabilityAs a small open economy with a sizeable financial centre, Singapore's currency exhibits traits of a long-term store of value, with parallels drawn to the Swiss franc. Following independence in 1965, Singapore's currency was first pegged against the GBP and the USD, at around S$3 per USD. When the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates was dissolved in the 1970s, the SGD began to strengthen considerably to as high as S$1.20 against the USD in 2011.</p><p> It currently trades at S$1.28, which is still far above levels in the1960s. As the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) targets the SGD rather than interest rates to manage inflation, the currency is managed against a basket of currencies of Singapore's main trading partners to maintain price stability. </p><p> In the latest July monetary policy review, the MAS maintained the rate of appreciation of the S$NEER policy band, with no change to its width and the level at which it is centred. The central bank assessed the monetary policy settings to be consistent with ensuring medium-term price stability based on the prevailing growth and inflation outlook. It said: \"MAS is well-positioned to respond to the evolving outlook, having already eased monetary policy in January and April this year.\"</p><p> Economic fundamentals: adaptability and resilienceStagflationary risks have risen with the harsh tariffs the US has levied on dozens of countries, including Mexico (25 per cent), Canada (35 per cent), Switzerland (39 per cent) and India (25 per cent plus 25 per cent secondary tariff). </p><p>Yale Budget Lab estimates the US average tariff rate now stands at 18.3 per cent, the highest since 1934. Singapore's exports to the US are subject to baseline tariffs of 10 per cent, but the country is externally exposed to the overall global economic impact of the tariff regime. </p><p> The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) upgraded its full-year growth forecast range on Tuesday (Aug 12) to a range of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent, from 0 to 2 per cent before.</p><p> While Singapore's relative economic stability stands out amid global geopolitical and economic uncertainties, the government proactively convened the Singapore Economic Resilience Taskforce chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong to support businesses and jobs, in anticipation of the grave challenges ahead.</p><p>Singapore's past success was due to carefully planned developments and investments to transform from a manufacturing hub in the 1960s to 1970s, to become an advanced digital nation today. Singapore sits at the confluence of capital markets -- supported by intra-Asia growth, a wealth management hub benefitting from rising affluence and long-term structural trends of innovation and sustainability.</p><p> Fresh impetus for Singapore equitiesThe recent re-rating of the Singapore equity market has been attributed to foreign investor inflows, earnings resilience of listed companies and government measures to boost the local bourse.</p><p> The MAS and the Financial Sector Development Fund announced a S$5 billion Equity Market Development Programme to earmark investment into locally-listed equities to increase the market's breadth beyond large-cap stocks. </p><p> Equity market reform is underway with programmes that focus on increased shareholder engagement, market liquidity for retail and institutional investors, as well as cross-border partnerships, as announced by the Equities Market Review Group. </p><p> In our overall tactical asset allocation, we remain overweight in Singapore equities within Asia ex-Japan, on the back of this ongoing review, attractive capital return programmes and healthy fundamentals in the large-cap space. </p><p> Quality small- and mid-caps with defensive cashflow profile and strong growth trajectories will also come into increasing investor focus. </p><p> Defensive fund flows into Singapore and our expectation of medium-term SGD strength support the case for exposure to Singapore equities. </p><p> For yield-seeking investors, Singapore listed companies have consistently offered steady growth in dividend income, with average dividend yield of 5 per cent (based on FSSTI index stocks), according to Bank of Singapore CIO Investment Institute estimates.</p><p> Investment themes for the Singapore equity market include the banking sector which is committed to overall shareholder returns; industrials that benefit from structural tailwinds; communications services with regional footprint; and selective mid-cap stocks backed by fundamentals and valuations, despite the recent run-up.</p><p>  In general, stock selection is key as a stronger SGD can be a double-edged sword for export-oriented companies or those with globally-sourced income. </p><p> For wealth management portfolios focused on long-term growth and stability, allocation to SGD-denominated assets could be an important investment decision, as a part of globally diversified multi-asset portfolios amid the shifts in international geo-economics.</p><p> The writer is global chief investment officer, Bank of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Bank of Singapore has an overweight call on Singapore equities within Asia ex-Japan, on the back of the ongoing review of the market, attractive capital return programmes and healthy fundamentals in the large-cap space.

These were ahead of sheltered walkways (66 per cent), sports facilities (57 per cent), and community centres (45 per cent).</p><p> Within residential developments, respondents also ranked green spaces and rooftop gardens as the most important communal facilities, ahead of fitness facilities like swimming pools and social spaces such as barbecue pits and function rooms. </p><p> The inaugural Quality of Life report, by property consultancy Knight FrankSingapore and global market research firm Ipsos, surveyed 1,000 Singapore residents earlier in 2025 to find out how expectations of the city-state's built environment are evolving.</p><p> The hope is that the study, carried out to celebrate Knight FrankSingapore's 85th anniversary, will be valuable to policymakers and developers in meeting the changing aspirations of the population, said the company's head of consultancy Alice Tan. </p><p> Respondents, who were spread across all age groups from 18 and up, ranked emotional and mental well-being as the most important factor in quality of life, ahead of economic stability and job security. This was followed by financial security, and then physical health and well-being.</p><p> The report noted that while respondents listed job security, inflation and the high cost of raising a child as their top concerns, they defined quality of life primarily through mental well-being and financial stability.</p><p> \"These results call attention to a significant shift in how Singapore residents define quality of life (and) reflects a growing recognition that psychological resilience and emotional balance are central to daily life satisfaction, more important than the popular perception that Singapore residents are only absorbed in one-dimensional material gain,\" said the authors.</p><p> At the workplace, 68 per cent of respondents said natural lighting and good ventilation was the most important workplace feature, followed by ergonomic office furniture and quiet zones for focus. On the other hand, perks such as nap pods, shower facilities and nursing rooms were chosen by fewer than three in 10 respondents.</p><p> Eight in 10 respondents also chose work-life balance policies -- such as flexible work arrangements and more paid time off -- as the top factor for work fulfilment, ahead of compensation (73 per cent), benefits (66 per cent) and company culture (38 per cent).</p><p> \"Traditional notions of job satisfaction such as office layout or even career advancement appear to have taken a backseat to more fundamental human needs like rest, autonomy, and financial security,\" said the report, which noted that most respondents were satisfied or moderately content with their jobs. </p><p> \"The modern worker is looking for a sustainable, human-centered experience that supports both their livelihood and lifestyle.\"</p><p> When it came to recreational activities, respondents said ease of access and value-for-money were top factors, with scenic beauty and relaxing environments in third place, followed by warm hospitality and authentic cultural experiences. Conversely, a vibrant nightlife scene ranked low, as did seasonal events and festivals and venues that may photograph well for social media.</p><p> These findings could signal a pivot away from high-energy activities towards leisure activities that are more focused on introspection and relaxation, with nightlife no longer being a mainstream leisure priority due to high costs and changing social preferences, said the report. A majority of respondents also said they prefer to have their office and leisure amenities between 20 minutes' and 30 minutes' commute from where they live, with fewer saying they want live, work, and play functions to be separate venues or spaced out geographically.</p><p> The authorities have said that they are aiming for eight in 10 households to be within a 10-minute walk of an MRT station by the 2030s, and to have 20-minute towns by 2040. This means residents should be able to reach the nearest neighbourhood centre within 20 minutes by walking, cycling or public transport.</p><p>Knight FrankSingapore and Ipsos said the findings signal a societal transition where residents \"are not merely seeking to live well in material terms, but to feel well, cope better, and find stability in a complex, fast-moving city\".</p><p> More emphasis has to be placed on greenery and parks, as well as sheltered leisure infrastructure, in response to a growing demand for a healthier urban experience, driven by both mental well-being and climate resilience, said the report.</p><p> The survey also suggested that future urban planning focus on mixed-use developments, mobility infrastructure, and liveable precincts.</p><p> \"For planners and policymakers, the key takeaway is the need to design a more equitable, biophilic, and flexible city that supports not only infrastructure and economic growth, but also human-scale quality of life across live, work and play,\" it said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In terms of recreational activities, respondents surveyed for the Quality of Life report said ease of access and value-for-money were top factors.

As a small island nation of six million people, its economic ascent has been propelled by strategic location, good governance and pragmatic policymaking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> From a bustling trading post in precolonial times to an independent state in 1965, Singapore swiftly industrialised by attracting foreign direct investment and leveraging low-cost labour for export-oriented growth.</p><p> In the 1970s, tightening labour markets and rising wages prompted a shift towards higher-value industries. Economic setbacks followed: oil shocks in 1975 and 1979, and a recession in 1985 due to eroded competitiveness.</p><p>Singapore responded decisively, cutting wages and rebounding swiftly. A similar resilience was seen during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, and the global financial crisis a decade later.</p><p> Structural reforms in the 2000s diversified the economy into financial and business services, high-tech manufacturing and the biomedical industry.</p><p> Despite recent shocks -- including economic disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, higher global inflation and interest rates triggered by the war in Ukraine, protectionist trade policies and heightened US-China tensions -- Singapore has responded by skilfully leveraging its fiscal buffers to turn adversity into opportunity.</p><p> Embracing technological transformationSingapore now enters a critical phase of economic restructuring, driven by rapid advances in digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p> The advent of generative AI, process automation and robotics presents a powerful opportunity to boost productivity and efficiency amid rising costs, a tight labour market and an ageing population.</p><p> However, it also poses risks of widespread disruption to employment -- particularly in middle-skill, routine and data-intensive jobs across manufacturing, finance, law, healthcare and transport. New entrants to the workforce will struggle to find employment in traditional sectors. This shift demands a deliberate and inclusive national response.</p><p> To maintain global competitiveness, the government must support both startups and incumbent enterprises in adopting emerging technologies and reshaping business models.</p><p> Government agencies such as Enterprise Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority should enhance funding and advisory services that help businesses embrace and pivot to digital and AI-augmented operations. Regulatory sandboxes and public-private test beds can help scale innovation while managing risk.</p><p> At the same time, Singapore must proactively upskill its workforce. SkillsFuture must evolve into a dynamic, AI-enabled platform that offers real-time, individualised reskilling paths aligned with fast-changing job market needs.</p><p> Workforce Singapore and tripartite partners should coordinate to deliver stackable skill credentials, apprenticeship programmes and career conversion programmes that offer portable skills across sectors.</p><p> Protecting displaced workers and ensuring that young graduates have meaningful pathways into the new economy are essential for inclusive growth.</p><p> Leveraging green growth as a strategic advantageThe global climate change agenda is not just a moral imperative, but a strategic opportunity for Singapore to lead in green growth.</p><p> Far from being a compliance exercise, the green transition is a source of innovation, investment and long-term competitiveness. As countries impose carbon pricing, border adjustment taxes, and stricter environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates, early movers such as Singapore can gain significant strategic advantages.</p><p>Singapore should aim to be the regional hub for carbon services, including carbon credit trading, emissions verification, and green finance.</p><p> The Singapore Exchange and Monetary Authority of Singapore have been proactive in developing the regulatory framework and promoting sustainable finance, including green bonds, transition finance and ESG disclosure standards. Regional initiatives, such as Project Greenprint, can serve as models for digital infrastructure that enable reliable tracking of carbon emissions and sustainability metrics.</p><p> Domestically, Singapore must accelerate decarbonisation by investing in solar energy, green hydrogen partnerships, energy storage systems and circular economy practices. Buildings and transportation -- two high-emission sectors -- should be fast-tracked for transformation through innovation grants and building codes.</p><p> Climate resilience is equally critical. Defending coastal infrastructure and adapting to extreme weather must remain top priorities. Policymaking should align green objectives with commercial incentives to drive private-sector innovation and participation in the transition.</p><p> Strengthening regional integrationWhile Asia will remain the growth engine for the global economy in the coming years, the global trading system is being challenged by protectionist policies and the global supply chains that are reconfiguring in response. As in the past, the supply chain reconfiguration presents an opportunity for Singapore to play a facilitating and coordinating role.</p><p> Despite rising costs, Singapore remains a premier gateway to Asean and broader Asia. Deepening regional integration can mitigate domestic constraints and broaden opportunities.</p><p>Singapore should champion seamless cross-border data flows, harmonised standards for e-commerce, and interoperable digital payment systems within Asean. Its leadership in the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement can help shape future-ready trade infrastructure.</p><p> In professional services, Singapore's legal, healthcare and education sectors can be further internationalised by forming partnerships and regulatory bridges with neighbours.</p><p> Additionally, Singapore can leverage its strengths in governance, dispute resolution and project finance to co-lead regional infrastructure development. Initiatives such as the Belt and Road -- if aligned with transparency and sustainability -- offer platforms where Singapore can serve as a neutral, trustworthy intermediary.</p><p> Building an inclusive and resilient societyA high-tech economy must not come at the cost of social cohesion. Technological and structural changes will exacerbate inequalities if left unmanaged.</p><p> As the gig economy grows and traditional employment declines, Singapore must fortify its social compact by revamping and enhancing the social protection framework to reflect new modes of work and emerging vulnerabilities.</p><p> Gig workers, freelancers and part-time workers require access to portable benefits including health insurance, Central Provident Fund-style retirement savings and unemployment support. The rise of platform work necessitates adaptive policy tools -- such as centralised benefits administration and universal access to basic protections -- while preserving flexibility.</p><p> Beyond labour reform, Singapore must address demographic pressures by empowering women, seniors and marginalised communities.</p><p> Family-friendly policies -- including affordable childcare, parental leave and caregiver support -- can enhance workforce participation and help reverse declining fertility. Age-inclusive hiring, flexible working arrangements and senior training programmes are critical to extend productive lifespans. The goal is a society that is not just future-ready, but also future-inclusive.</p><p> Redefining educationSingapore's world-class education system has underpinned its economic success, but the education system must now evolve to keep up with the rapid rise of AI and digital technology, and their impact on the workplace.</p><p> The nature of work is evolving more rapidly than traditional curricula can accommodate. Success in the AI era will depend not only on technical proficiency and knowledge acquisition, but also on agility, creativity and the capacity for lifelong learning.</p><p> Education must become more experiential, interdisciplinary and learner-centric.</p><p> Beyond academic rigour, schools should nurture curiosity, collaboration and ethical decision-making. Students should learn to be more discriminating in their consumption of news and information in the age of social media. Tertiary institutions must partner with industry to co-design programmes that equip students with evolving job market skills needed to operate in an AI-augmented environment.</p><p> Most importantly, learning must continue throughout life. Lifelong learning should be normalised through incentives, digital credentials and recognition frameworks that value all forms of growth.</p><p>Singapore has repeatedly turned challenges and adversity into opportunities and success -- through industrialisation, globalisation, and constantly upgrading and moving up the global value chain.</p><p> The next transformation will be more complex and challenging -- balancing technological efficiency with social equity, environmental sustainability with growth, and geopolitical risk with regional cooperation.</p><p> The nation's small size need not be a weakness, but a strength -- enabling agility, precision and unity of purpose. With visionary leadership, an inclusive society and a willingness to adapt and innovate, Singapore can once again defy the odds.</p><p> The next decade offers not only challenges, but also an opportunity to write the next chapter of resilience, renewal and reinvention.</p><p> The writer was chief economist of Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (Amro) from 2016 to 2025, where he was responsible for country and regional surveillance, as well as related research activities, of the Asean+3 economies.

From public housing to floodplains, the country's development reflects deliberate choices supported by good design.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This has helped Singapore build a global reputation for turning constraints into possibilities as it transformed limited land into neighbourhoods of thriving communities through urban planning, and used architecture to manage climate risks. This distinct design-led development also earned the city-state a UNESCO Creative City of Design recognition in 2015. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> According to Dawn Lim, Executive Director of the DesignSingapore Council (DSG), the same approach remains key as Singapore enters its next chapter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"In the early days, design was about getting the basics right. We needed to house a nation, build infrastructure, and get people connected to jobs and services. That was foundational design, and it was incredibly effective,\" she says. \"Today, we see Care, Sustainability, and Emerging Technologies as key issues where design can make a deep impact on Singapore's future.\" </p><p> Design that builds better livesA striking example of Singapore's pioneering mindset is Pinnacle@Duxton. Designed by local architectural firm ARC Studio Architecture + Urbanism and launched in 2009, it was Singapore's first 50-storey public housing project. With its sky gardens, walkways, and communal decks, it showed that high-density public housing can be both liveable and appealing as it picked up international awards like the World's Best Housing Development at the World Architecture Festival in 2010.</p><p> Design has likewise reshaped Singapore's spaces for public good. Led by landscape architect and President*s Design Award 2023 Designer of the Year, Leonard Ng, the 53-hectare Jurong Lake Gardens was transformed into an inclusive community garden, restoring biodiversity while enhancing climate resilience in the process. Using a nature-based approach, the park doubles as a floodplain, capturing and slowing stormwater before it reaches the lake. </p><p> In healthcare, hospices such as Oasis @ Outram demonstrates the critical role of design. Lekker Architects and The Care Lab reimagined palliative care through human-centred design of the space and programmes at Oasis @ Outram which bring healing and dignity to the patients. </p><p> Design has also changed how government services are delivered to be more intuitive and accessible. Apps like LifeSG put hundreds of services on a single interface, while ServiceSG centres offer in-person assistance for those who prefer a human touch. </p><p> As Lim points out, these design solutions -- whether in physical spaces or online -- are not just functional, they reflect empathy and an understanding of everyday needs. \"Singapore is designing not just structures, but experiences. Whether it's how someone navigates a hospital, a hawker centre or a digital service, we're thinking more deeply about the human experience,\" she explains. </p><p> Intergenerational design journeySingapore's story would not be complete without the individuals who have shown what local design can achieve. Take Nathan Yong, an industrial designer trained at the former Baharuddin Vocational Institute, Singapore's first design and applied arts school. His storied career includes being the recipient of both the Red Dot Concept Design Award from 2006 to 2007 and the President*s Design Award for 'Designer of the Year' in 2008. He has created furniture for Ligne Roset, Sancal and Herman Miller through his line Nathan Yong Design and further licensed his designs for exports -- proving that local design can be commercially successfully.</p><p> \"I never approached design with the idea of 'local' or 'international'. Human needs are quite universal. If you want your designs to have a future, they need to be relevant globally,\" says Yong. Today, the designer is paying it forward as a Programme Leader at LASALLE College of the Arts, where he mentors and nurtures the next generation of designers in Singapore. </p><p> Other homegrown studios such as STUCK Design, co-founded by a DSG scholar Yong Jieyu, Lee Tze Ming and Donn Koh, are blazing a trail with their standout designs as seen in the award-winning AIR+ Smart Mask, cult-favourite Morning Coffee machine, and its latest AI-powered creativity tool, Hypersketch.</p><p> \"Keeping the human element at the centre isn't just a design principle for us -- it's the reason we design in the first place. STUCK's shift from design consultancy to developing tools like Hypersketch has been about rethinking how creativity can be sparked and shared more widely. It is something that could empower anyone to access and grow their creative potential,\" says STUCK's Koh. \"In our journey, DesignSingapore Council has been a vital partner. The Council nudged us to think bigger. Much of what we've dared to pursue -- and the scale at which we now think -- is rooted in the confidence and stretch that came from working with them.\" </p><p> The global stage Globally, Singapore is positioning itself as a hub for bold design solutions for the world, through platforms like the Singapore Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale, World Expo, and the yearly showcase of Singaporean designers at Milan Design Week. This forward-thinking approach carries significant long-term economic implications. As countries worldwide grapple with complex challenges in an ageing population, healthcare, public services, and sustainability, Singapore is uniquely positioned to offer answers to global challenges in areas such as healthcare, sustainability, and urban living.</p><p> In the latest Future Impact 3: DESIGN NATION at Milan Design Week this year, design stalwart FARM tied up with Changi General Hospital and technology firm Vouse to present a digital twin of an emergency department, which demonstrates design technology at work in healthcare. The event also highlighted emerging talents: Nazurah Rohayat presented an AI-powered textile work blending tradition with technology while E Ian Siew displayed Auxobrace, a James Dyson Award-winning sternal rehabilitation device.</p><p> Equipping talent for the futureThis momentum reflects a deeper national movement: integrating design thinking into education to cultivate future-ready innovators and promoting design literacy in the community. To help groom a pipeline of design talent, DSG has been running workshops for students aged 7 years onwards through its Learning by Design initiative which is open to schools. In addition, it has worked closely with the Design Education Advisory Committee to prepare the next generation for a future where design and technology must go hand in hand.</p><p> Education institutions are already at the forefront of this development. The Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) is investing $50 million to integrate AI into its curriculum; its first cohort of Design and AI graduates has entered the workforce. Meanwhile, Temasek Polytechnic's Design School has launched a generative AI lab to give students a hands-on experience with AI tools. </p><p> It's not just the schools which are adapting. Local SMEs like LionsBot are proving that design-led innovation is a competitive edge. The robotics company clinched top honours at this year's The Business Times and SUTD Design, AI and Tech Awards for its fleet of AI-powered cleaning robots which are designed to be accessible to the elderly and less tech savvy, according to the company's head of design Tan Wei Hua. </p><p> The big pictureDesign has long been integral to Singapore's nation-building story. Looking ahead, Singapore must not only continue to cultivate great designers, it will require a society that thinks and problem-solves like one. The collective mindset must also evolve for Singapore design to gain greater appreciation and depth. </p><p> \"The idea of 'Singapore design' is reliable, functional, well-engineered, but less often seen as soulful or distinct. That's changing slowly. When we start valuing and supporting those things more intentionally, Singapore design can evolve beyond being well made into being deeply felt,\" shares Yong.</p><p> Summing up, Lim says: \"If design helped build this nation, it will shape what we become next -- an even more caring, inclusive and thoughtful society.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-2BJ5DFI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GF1-DGW3-S251-004R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

You see, if countries had tech resumes, Singapore's would stand out to most hiring committees. \"Early adopter of mainframes.\" Check. \"Built a national broadband network before some cities had stable electricity.\" Check. \"One of the most digitalised cities in the world with an internet penetration rate of around 96 per cent and ranked second globally in the IMD Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025.\" Double check.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet, as we commemorate this milestone, the tides are turning. Tariffs and geopolitical tensions have stirred up uncertainty and volatility. It is timely then, that on Aug 4, Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the launch of the Economic Strategy Review (ESR), aimed at strengthening Singapore's competitiveness. Five committees will be tasked to do a comprehensive review of Singapore's economic strategy, one of which will look at harnessing technology and innovation, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to drive economic growth and competitiveness. The other committees will focus on areas such as entrepreneurship, human capital, and the impact of restructuring the economy. </p><p> AI, front and centreWhile the key areas are not a surprise, it was interesting to note the prevalence of AI across the board. The rise of AI has led to a structural shift of the Singapore economy, for example. Plans are also under way to develop local AI talent, while attracting global specialists. And of course, there is a need to raise AI fluency and adoption. All this points to the growing importance of AI in Singapore's future economic success. Can it truly have a transformative effect, or are we overhyping AI? </p><p> As we unpack this, let us rewind to 1963. In the early years, Singapore was not exactly Silicon Valley, but installing a mainframe paved the way to laying the digital bricks of a future where technology is second nature. By the 1980s, we had the National Computer Board. And by the 1990s, we were surfing on Singapore One, our very own broadband network. In 2014, the Smart Nation initiative was launched to integrate the internet of things (IoT), data platforms and sensor networks into everyday life -- from lamppost sensors to transport systems. Entrepreneurial environments such as Blk71 and one-north flourished. Singpass lets you renew your passport, pay your taxes, and register your kid's PSLE score faster than you can say \"two-factor authentication\". Hawker stalls accept PayNow. </p><p> And now comes AI. If digitalisation was about making things faster and more convenient, AI is about making them even smarter. But this comes with worries about hallucinations and whether students are over-reliant on it.</p><p> One thing to remember is that tech revolutions do not arrive fully formed. They need time to marinate and mature. AI is no different. While the potential benefits are enormous, we are still in the euphoric stage when every company wants to slap \"AI\" on their pitch books and hope for higher valuations. AI is not a magic wand, but an expensive, energy-hungry tool that could over-promise results if not deployed with discipline and wisdom. To use it well you need strategy and to ask tough questions, such as, \"What is the real business case here? Is the cost justified by the outcome? Is the AI mature enough to handle real-life situation trade-offs'\" </p><p> The good news is that Singapore, naturally, has a game plan. </p><p> The first National AI Strategy (NAIS) was unveiled back in 2019 and NAIS 2.0 in 2023 -- both rightly focus on high-impact use cases, from health to climate. The overarching principle is to embrace AI as a \"force for good\" and harness it to uplift and empower people and businesses. </p><p> Growing old, getting hotSingapore faces two structural medium-term challenges -- our rapidly ageing population and that minor issue of the planet getting uncomfortably hot. </p><p> Let us start with ageing. By 2030, one in four citizens will be over 65. We are on track to become the world's most gracefully greying tech utopia. But graceful does not come cheap. The healthcare bill is ballooning, the workforce is thinning, and honestly, who is going to look after all of us when we are 85 and trying to reset our retina-scanning Singpass because we forgot the password again? Here is where the optimist says AI can come to the rescue -- AI can help diagnose chronic diseases early, manage eldercare through companion robots, and automate boring hospital admin that nurses are too overworked to do. </p><p> At the global level, AI has revolutionised human understanding of protein folding and accelerated drug discovery. At the local level, the Singapore Civil Defence Force is already utilising AI to optimise ambulance dispatch, and predictive analytics help to forecast emergency hot spots and reduce response times -- this is about saving lives, not just saving seconds. </p><p> AI can also predict which parts of Singapore are most likely to flood or face extreme hot spots. In a climate-stressed world, there will be many use cases for disaster preparedness. But let us not get ahead of ourselves. AI is not quite ready to replace good bedside manners of doctors or a comforting touch when one is in pain. The human factor is important even in an AI-enabled economy. </p><p> While AI may boost productivity, it could also potentially displace some jobs. An IMF study recently estimated that about 77 per cent of jobs of Singapore's employed workers are highly exposed to AI. That is not just your Grab driver being potentially displaced by autonomous vehicles, it is also possibly your accountant, your insurance underwriter, maybe even your therapist. There could be a potential backlash from workers who fear being replaced before they can retrain. Thankfully, Singapore is not sleepwalking into this dystopian future. SkillsFuture credits are pushing the needle on inclusive adoption of AI and AI literacy. Managing and pacing this shift with empathy will be key.</p><p> For the climate crisis, Singapore, being a low-lying island, is quite literally on the front lines of rising sea levels. AI can be a powerful ally to that $100 billion coastal protection plan by modelling coastal erosion, optimising energy usage, powering smart grids, and detecting leakages in water infrastructure. In fact, Singapore could have a real shot at becoming a hub for \"green AI\" -- the kind that helps build climate resilience and reduce emissions. We have the research infrastructure, a hyper-urban test bed, and the political will to turn sustainability into economic strategy. </p><p> But when it comes to AI, the risk is not just one of falling behind; it is also that we will run ahead without looking where we are going. The message is clear: digital resilience is as important as digital ambition. For one thing, we must ensure small and medium-sized enterprises, which are Singapore's economic backbone, do not get left behind in the AI gold rush. Big companies have the funds to hire AI engineers. Aunty Mary's small bakery in Toa Payoh does not. That is where public policy comes in with simple, sector-specific solutions and cost-efficient tools that can move the top-line and reduce manpower headaches. </p><p> Arthur C. Clarke said \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\". But just because something seems magical does not mean we should not question how it works. Responsible AI governance is also important. Singapore has the chance to be the model on AI ethics and governance others can learn from. </p><p> Going back to the ESR, it makes sense to relook Singapore's economic strategy beyond the 2030 runway. The Committee on the Future Economy, which issued a report in 2017, had previously outlined the economic strategy to 2030. Economic resilience is key in the current, uncertain geopolitical landscape and that requires pre-empting potential risk factors, including the challenges of AI. </p><p> At the end of the day, it is not just about driving GDP growth, but creating a nation where technology empowers us and creates meaningful jobs that provide for families. </p><p> Imagine if Singaporean students, regardless of socio-economic class, can learn to code from a free AI tutor, while a Singaporean worker can individually customise upskilling advice with AI-identified skill gaps, and an elderly Singaporean can get medical check-ups through a voice bot that speaks fluent Hokkien. And that, if you ask me, is the real upgrade we should all be aiming for in our vision of an AI-enabled Singapore. </p><p> Selena Ling is chief economist and head of global markets research and strategy at OCBC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, the risk is not just one of falling behind; it is also that we will run ahead without looking where we are going, says the writer.

The logic was simple: SaaS is scalable, asset-light, and investor-friendly. But experience has taught me that impact-real, tangible change-often comes not from what's hosted in the cloud, but from what reaches the ground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In emerging markets like Indonesia, startups that deal with physical products often face more friction-regulatory, logistical, or financial. Yet it is these startups that are bridging the most vital sectors of our time: agriculture and healthcare. They don't just solve problems; they solve survival.</p><p>The overlooked power of physical innovation</p><p>Today, food security and public health are no longer siloed issues. They're deeply interconnected.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview\">According to the World Bank, disruptions in agriculture directly undermine nutritional access, increasing the burden on already strained health systems. Meanwhile, the</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet\">World Health Organisation emphasises the importance of food systems in preventing malnutrition and diet-related illnesses.</url></p><p>In this context, startups that innovate in the overlap between these sectors-what I call the AgriHealth frontier-are not only relevant, they are essential. Imagine IoT-enabled soil sensors that optimise micronutrient delivery in crops, or solar-powered cold chains that transport vaccines and fresh produce to remote areas. These aren't futuristic dreams-they're prototypes being tested today.</p><p>Why the world still needs physical products</p><p>The startup world's obsession with SaaS has, to some extent, blinded us to the enduring value of hardware and physical goods. But here's the truth: in many rural regions, digital-only solutions fall flat. Farmers need sensors they can touch, irrigation pumps they can repair, and clinics need mobile diagnostic kits that work offline.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/in-an-era-where-agriculture-both-drives-and-bears-the-brunt-of-climate-change-digital-technologies-offer-a-path-to-empowerment-20240427/\">Unlocking agritech's potential: Can Southeast Asia rise to the challenge?</url></p><p>The World Economic Forum highlights that hybrid solutions-integrating digital tools with physical infrastructure-are driving the next wave of social innovation, especially in food and health security. Startups that combine data-driven insights with deployable products are not only viable-they're resilient.</p><p>Startups in the middle</p><p>We are seeing a new breed of entrepreneurs emerge. They don't call themselves 'agritech' or 'healthtech.' They build solutions where tractors meet tablets, where wearable devices meet water pumps. These are startups that operate at the intersection, the Venn diagram middle, where creativity meets critical need.</p><p>And yes, their products are often physical.</p><p>The human side of innovation</p><p>As a founder, I've seen first-hand the trust a community places in something they can see, feel, and use. A farmer may not fully grasp blockchain, but she understands a smart scale that tells her when to harvest. A clinic in a remote area may not be paperless, but it will embrace a low-cost diagnostic device if it saves lives.</p><p>Innovation is not just about disruption-it's about empathy. It's about meeting people where they are.</p><p>In closing: It's time to rethink what's 'sexy'</p><p>Let's stop thinking SaaS is the only smart choice. Let's start building what the world actually needs. At the heart of food systems, climate resilience, and health equity lies a quiet truth: physical solutions are not outdated-they're just underfunded and underestimated.</p><p>And in the era of AgriHealth, they may just be our best hope.</p><p>-</p><p>Editor's note:e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

In 2011, Singapore's City in a Garden vision was introduced.</p><p> Parks were linked up via the park connector network and developers were encouraged to incorporate skyrise greenery into buildings so as to further integrate nature into urban spaces.</p><p> \"The regimental planting of the Garden City era was replaced by mixed plantings that mimicked forest structure, with native species playing a bigger role,\" said Dr Lahiru. </p><p> \"The idea of a manicured garden in a specific place gave way to a city being incorporated into a garden.\"</p><p> In 2020, the green vision progressed further. </p><p>Singapore now wanted to become a City in Nature, which aims to provide a green, liveable and sustainable home for Singaporeans and wildlife to co-exist. </p><p> Initiatives under this vision included expanding the nature park network, naturalising gardens and parks, restoring greenery in urban areas and connecting green spaces, said the National Parks Board (NParks).</p><p> \"The key distinction of being a City in Nature is in how Singapore understands nature's role in national survival and climate resilience,\" said Dr Lahiru.</p><p> Being a City in Nature is about how Singapore takes a holistic approach towards the environment and celebrating life in all forms, beyond birdwatching or admiring pretty plants, said Dr Shawn Lum, a senior lecturer at NTU's Asian School of the Environment.</p><p> The 'forest lapis' One of the goals of a City in Nature is to link up Singapore's fragmented habitats. </p><p> The roll-out of nature ways, or routes planted with specific trees and shrubs to replicate the structure of a natural forest, could help with this.</p><p> Natural forests have different layers, comprising vegetation that grows to varying heights to support wildlife species that have different feeding and breeding preferences. </p><p> NParks aims to complete 300km of nature ways by 2030. Currently, there are 54 nature ways in Singapore, stretching 240km in total.</p><p> An example of a nature way is the Lornie Nature Corridor, which comprises a nature way and a park connector, and acts as a buffer to the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The corridor has more than 100 species of trees and shrubs so far. </p><p> For example, the pink mempat (Cratoxylum formosum) and kempas (Koompassia malaccensis), which are both native and endangered, were planted to provide food and habitat to support various insects and birds.</p><p> NParks has also tried to re-introduce endangered plant species such as the native Singapore kopsia (Kopsia singapurensis), a tree that is considered critically endangered here.</p><p> Nature ways can help wildlife move around to find food and mates, said butterfly expert Khew Sin Khoon. </p><p> \"They are not merely green corridors, they are critical ecological highways that enable urban biodiversity to move between major nature nodes across the island,\" added Mr Khew, who is also head of Singapore butterfly interest group ButterflyCircle. </p><p> Butterflies such as the rustic (Cupha erymanthis lotis) are usually found in forests. </p><p> But these can now be seen in park connectors and even urban parks, Mr Khew said.</p><p> This could be due to the planting of the caterpillar's host plant, rukam masam (Flacourtia inermis) along roads, park connectors and urban gardens, said Mr Khew.</p><p> NParks has also planted native shrub species like the common sendudok (Melastoma malabathricum) which attracts birds like the scarlet-backed flowerpecker (Dicaeum cruentatum) and insects such as the striped nomia bee (Nomia strigata).</p><p> Improved connectivity between Singapore's green spaces will improve the gene flow between populations and also increase the butterfly's resilience to environmental changes, Mr Khew added.</p><p> A separate study by NTU in February found that road verges with a higher diversity of flowering plants attract more butterflies due to the year-round availability of nectar, as plants bloom at different times.</p><p> The researchers include Dr Tharaka Priyadarshana and Associate Professor Eleanor Slade from the Tropical Ecology and Entomology Lab at NTU's Asian School of the Environment. </p><p> While the road verges studied are not formally part of Singapore's nature ways, the researchers said they serve a similar ecological function on a smaller scale by providing resources such as nectar and shelter.</p><p> They also serve as important connectors that help butterflies move across urban landscapes of unconnected greenery, complementing the broader connectivity provided by nature ways, said the researchers.</p><p> Mr Khew said: \"Nature ways represent a science-based, scalable solution to keep Singapore's City in Nature vision alive -- not just for humans, but for the butterflies, birds, and countless other species that share our city.\" </p><p> Planting trees,  growing rootsAs part of the City in Nature push, Singapore in 2020 launched the OneMillionTrees movement. </p><p> The aim is to plant a million more trees across the island by 2030. </p><p> As at June, 800,868 trees have been planted across Singapore, according to NParks' website.</p><p> More trees have been planted in places such as schools and residential and industrial estates since the launch of the movement. </p><p> On industrialised Jurong Island, for example, more than 34,000 trees have been planted since 2020. More than 80 species of trees such as the common sterculia (Sterculia parviflora) and the shore laurel (Neolitsea cassia) were chosen to line the island -- one of Singapore's warmest areas. </p><p> The tree species were chosen based on their ability to tolerate drought, their colourful flowers and wide crowns that can provide shade. </p><p> Trees act as natural air filters, providing clean air. They also provide cool and shaded environments, helping to reduce the urban heat island effect -- where urban structures trap heat in the day and release it at night.</p><p> Forests also provide habitats for wildlife like the critically endangered straw-headed bulbul, a songbird, and the Sunda pangolin, and store carbon to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p> A nation's transformationAs Singapore celebrates its 60 years of independence, the country's transformation over the decades is reflected in its greening journey, said experts. </p><p> \"In a way, this whole journey mirrors the growth of a nation -- from trying to survive, to trying to impress, to now trying to sustain,\" Dr Lahiru said. \"It reflects how we think as a society, how we see ourselves, and what we believe we need in order to survive and thrive.\"</p><p> As Singapore transitions from Garden City to City in a Garden to City in Nature, Dr Lahiru said that the City in Nature could be the \"most honest\" version of what the country has been trying to do -- to create a home for both humans and nature. \"It brings in ideas of resilience, biodiversity, and responsibility. It's no longer about making things green -- it's about making sure nature survives, so we do too,\" he noted.</p><p> Dr Lum added: \"It is now up to all of us to embrace the City in Nature, and to nurture this seed and to care for it so that it can become an inspiring thing of beauty and wonder.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As vegetation runs through the urban landscape and nature is restored in the city via \"rewilding\", animals once thought to be extinct in Singapore, such as the oriental pied hornbill, have made a comeback.

As a small island nation of six million people, its economic ascent has been propelled by strategic location, good governance and pragmatic policymaking. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> From a bustling trading post in precolonial times to an independent state in 1965, Singapore swiftly industrialised by attracting foreign direct investment and leveraging low-cost labour for export-oriented growth.</p><p> In the 1970s, tightening labour markets and rising wages prompted a shift towards higher-value industries. Economic setbacks followed: oil shocks in 1975 and 1979, and a recession in 1985 due to eroded competitiveness. </p><p>Singapore responded decisively, cutting wages and rebounding swiftly. A similar resilience was seen during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, and the global financial crisis a decade later. </p><p> Structural reforms in the 2000s diversified the economy into financial and business services, high-tech manufacturing and the biomedical industry. </p><p> Despite recent shocks -- including economic disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, higher global inflation and interest rates triggered by the war in Ukraine, protectionist trade policies and heightened US-China tensions -- Singapore has responded by skilfully leveraging its fiscal buffers to turn adversity into opportunity.</p><p> Embracing technological transformationSingapore now enters a critical phase of economic restructuring, driven by rapid advances in digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI). </p><p> The advent of generative AI, process automation and robotics presents a powerful opportunity to boost productivity and efficiency amid rising costs, a tight labour market and an ageing population. </p><p> However, it also poses risks of widespread disruption to employment -- particularly in middle-skill, routine and data-intensive jobs across manufacturing, finance, law, healthcare and transport. New entrants to the workforce will struggle to find employment in traditional sectors. This shift demands a deliberate and inclusive national response.</p><p> To maintain global competitiveness, the government must support both startups and incumbent enterprises in adopting emerging technologies and reshaping business models. </p><p> Government agencies such as Enterprise Singapore and the Infocomm Media Development Authority should enhance funding and advisory services that help businesses embrace and pivot to digital and AI-augmented operations. Regulatory sandboxes and public-private test beds can help scale innovation while managing risk.</p><p> At the same time, Singapore must proactively upskill its workforce. SkillsFuture must evolve into a dynamic, AI-enabled platform that offers real-time, individualised reskilling paths aligned with fast-changing job market needs. </p><p> Workforce Singapore and tripartite partners should coordinate to deliver stackable skill credentials, apprenticeship programmes and career conversion programmes that offer portable skills across sectors. </p><p> Protecting displaced workers and ensuring that young graduates have meaningful pathways into the new economy are essential for inclusive growth.</p><p> Leveraging green growth  as a strategic advantageThe global climate change agenda is not just a moral imperative, but a strategic opportunity for Singapore to lead in green growth. </p><p> Far from being a compliance exercise, the green transition is a source of innovation, investment and long-term competitiveness. As countries impose carbon pricing, border adjustment taxes, and stricter environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates, early movers such as Singapore can gain significant strategic advantages.</p><p>Singapore should aim to be the regional hub for carbon services, including carbon credit trading, emissions verification, and green finance. </p><p> The Singapore Exchange and Monetary Authority of Singapore have been proactive in developing the regulatory framework and promoting sustainable finance, including green bonds, transition finance and ESG disclosure standards. Regional initiatives, such as Project Greenprint, can serve as models for digital infrastructure that enable reliable tracking of carbon emissions and sustainability metrics.</p><p> Domestically, Singapore must accelerate decarbonisation by investing in solar energy, green hydrogen partnerships, energy storage systems and circular economy practices. Buildings and transportation -- two high-emission sectors -- should be fast-tracked for transformation through innovation grants and building codes.</p><p> Climate resilience is equally critical. Defending coastal infrastructure and adapting to extreme weather must remain top priorities. Policymaking should align green objectives with commercial incentives to drive private-sector innovation and participation in the transition.</p><p> Strengthening regional integrationWhile Asia will remain the growth engine for the global economy in the coming years, the global trading system is being challenged by protectionist policies and the global supply chains that are reconfiguring in response. As in the past, the supply chain reconfiguration presents an opportunity for Singapore to play a facilitating and coordinating role. </p><p> Despite rising costs, Singapore remains a premier gateway to Asean and broader Asia. Deepening regional integration can mitigate domestic constraints and broaden opportunities.</p><p>Singapore should champion seamless cross-border data flows, harmonised standards for e-commerce, and interoperable digital payment systems within Asean. Its leadership in the Asean Digital Economy Framework Agreement can help shape future-ready trade infrastructure. </p><p> In professional services, Singapore's legal, healthcare and education sectors can be further internationalised by forming partnerships and regulatory bridges with neighbours.</p><p> Additionally, Singapore can leverage its strengths in governance, dispute resolution and project finance to co-lead regional infrastructure development. Initiatives such as the Belt and Road -- if aligned with transparency and sustainability -- offer platforms where Singapore can serve as a neutral, trustworthy intermediary.</p><p> Building an inclusive  and resilient societyA high-tech economy must not come at the cost of social cohesion. Technological and structural changes will exacerbate inequalities if left unmanaged. </p><p> As the gig economy grows and traditional employment declines, Singapore must fortify its social compact by revamping and enhancing the social protection framework to reflect new modes of work and emerging vulnerabilities.</p><p> Gig workers, freelancers and part-time workers require access to portable benefits including health insurance, Central Provident Fund-style retirement savings and unemployment support. The rise of platform work necessitates adaptive policy tools -- such as centralised benefits administration and universal access to basic protections -- while preserving flexibility.</p><p> Beyond labour reform, Singapore must address demographic pressures by empowering women, seniors and marginalised communities. </p><p> Family-friendly policies -- including affordable childcare, parental leave and caregiver support -- can enhance workforce participation and help reverse declining fertility. Age-inclusive hiring, flexible working arrangements and senior training programmes are critical to extend productive lifespans. The goal is a society that is not just future-ready, but also future-inclusive.</p><p> Redefining educationSingapore's world-class education system has underpinned its economic success, but the education system must now evolve to keep up with the rapid rise of AI and digital technology, and their impact on the workplace.</p><p> The nature of work is evolving more rapidly than traditional curricula can accommodate. Success in the AI era will depend not only on technical proficiency and knowledge acquisition, but also on agility, creativity and the capacity for lifelong learning.</p><p> Education must become more experiential, interdisciplinary and learner-centric. </p><p> Beyond academic rigour, schools should nurture curiosity, collaboration and ethical decision-making. Students should learn to be more discriminating in their consumption of news and information in the age of social media. Tertiary institutions must partner with industry to co-design programmes that equip students with evolving job market skills needed to operate in an AI-augmented environment.</p><p> Most importantly, learning must continue throughout life. Lifelong learning should be normalised through incentives, digital credentials and recognition frameworks that value all forms of growth.</p><p>Singapore has repeatedly turned challenges and adversity into opportunities and success -- through industrialisation, globalisation, and constantly upgrading and moving up the global value chain. </p><p> The next transformation will be more complex and challenging -- balancing technological efficiency with social equity, environmental sustainability with growth, and geopolitical risk with regional cooperation.</p><p> The nation's small size need not be a weakness, but a strength -- enabling agility, precision and unity of purpose. With visionary leadership, an inclusive society and a willingness to adapt and innovate, Singapore can once again defy the odds. </p><p> The next decade offers not only challenges, but also an opportunity to write the next chapter of resilience, renewal and reinvention.</p><p> The writer was chief economist of Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (Amro) from 2016 to 2025, where he was responsible for country and regional surveillance, as well as related research activities, of the Asean+3 economies.

During his official visit to Singapore on 12 July 2025, the UK Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, David Lammy, announced a landmark pledge of up to 70 million to Singapore's Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) initiative, as part of the collaboration.</p><p>2. This announcement comes as the UK marks 60 years of diplomatic relations with Singapore - a strategic partnership built on shared interests, mutual respect, and a commitment to security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>3. The UK's funding, to be delivered through British International Investment (BII), will deploy investment capital and provide blended finance to support low-carbon energy projects and innovative business models, bolstering energy security and climate resilience. This significant move marks a major step forward in the UK-Singapore Strategic Partnership and reflects both countries' commitment to support Asia's green energy transition and sustainable development.</p><p>4. The UK and Singapore are working together to accelerate sustainable infrastructure and investment across the region. This includes supporting early-stage project development through joint technical assistance and encouraging private sector involvement, with a focus on practical solutions to help countries transition to cleaner energy.</p><p>5. By actively participating in the FAST-P initiative, alongside Singapore and other international partners, the UK is helping to mobilise critical capital and close infrastructure financing gaps.</p><p>6. Gan Kim Yong, Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Minister for Trade and Industry and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said, \"We are delighted to welcome the UK to join the FAST-P initiative. FAST-P has gathered a network of like-minded, global public, private and philanthropic partners, coming together to mobilise capital for a common goal - Asia's transition. We look forward to closer collaboration with our key partners on the FAST-P journey.\"</p><p>7. David Lammy, UK Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, said, \"This year, the UK and Singapore mark 60 years of diplomatic relations. ASEAN is set to be the fastest-growing economic bloc this decade. We need to keep investing in our friendships, making them resilient and focused on the future.\"</p><p>8. Srini Nagarajan, Managing Director and Head of Asia, BII, said, \"As the UK's development finance institution, we have a specific mandate to support Southeast Asia's green energy transition. We look forward to deepening our collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore on FAST-P. This is an important partnership in our plan to deliver our commitment of accelerating the development of climate projects and mobilising private capital in the region.\"</p><p>About the Monetary Authority of Singapore</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank and integrated financial regulator. As a central bank, MAS promotes sustained, non-inflationary economic growth through the conduct of monetary policy and close macroeconomic surveillance and analysis. It manages Singapore's exchange rate, official foreign reserves, and liquidity in the banking sector. As an integrated financial supervisor, MAS fosters a sound financial services sector through its prudential oversight of all financial institutions in Singapore - banks, insurers, capital market intermediaries, financial advisors and financial market infrastructure. It is also responsible for well-functioning financial markets, sound conduct, and investor education. MAS also works with the financial industry to foster the growth of Singapore as an international financial centre.</p><p>About British International Investment</p><p>British International Investment is the UK's development finance institution and impact investor. The organisation invests in businesses in developing countries to improve people's lives and help protect the planet. BII's work targets the underlying causes of poverty and the climate crisis, helping countries break free from aid dependency for good. Between 2022-2026, at least 30 per cent of BII's total new commitments by value will be in climate finance. BII is also a founding member of the 2X Challenge which has raised over $33.6 billion to empower women's economic development. The company has investments in over 1,600 businesses across 70 countries and total net assets of 9.87 billion.</p><p>About Financing Asia's Transition Partnership</p><p>The Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (\"FAST-P\"), a Singapore-led blended finance initiative in collaboration with key global public, private and philanthropic partners, aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk and finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia. The Singapore Government will pledge up to US$500 million as concessional capital, to match dollar-for-dollar, concessional capital from other partners, including other governments, multilateral development finance institutions and philanthropies. This combined pool of concessional capital will be used to crowd in commercial capital and other sources of finance to support Asia's green energy transition.</p><p>[Category: Renewable Energy, Electric Utilities, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066685249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8G-K1H3-RRRJ-72YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1052\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 14, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Initiative &amp;

This is by \"observing how portfolio managers calibrate their investment decisions when their performance is measured against climate indices instead of conventional market capitalisation-weighted indices\", MAS explained.</p><p> Next steps could include developing a framework to assess the performance of active portfolio managers, taking both investment returns and climate resilience into account. Climate metrics could include carbon emissions, green revenue, and climate value-at-risk. </p><p> \"Monitoring of portfolio managers' active investment strategies will also improve understanding of the drivers of financial performance and climate risk profile of the portfolio,\" said MAS. </p><p> Such monitoring includes reviewing deviations in countries, sectors, and companies between the active portfolio and climate benchmarks.</p><p> \"This process will help refine and enhance the design of the active investment programme over time, and achieve its dual financial and climate risk mitigation objectives,\" added MAS.</p><p> Corporate bondsThe central bank has also decided to \"gradually tilt\" its corporate bond portfolio towards less carbon-intensive exposures. It plans to align the portfolio more closely with the low-carbon transition, using climate indices. \"We will initiate the programme with a small allocation, with the aim of scaling up over time,\" MAS said.</p><p> It noted that corporate bonds are relatively less impacted by climate risks than equities, as bonds generally have shorter duration. Corporate bond investors are also higher up the capital structure as creditors, compared to shareholders.</p><p> However, climate risks can still cause corporate creditworthiness to deteriorate, impacting bond values, MAS noted. </p><p> \"Implementing appropriate climate risk mitigation measures for corporate bonds is also important for creating a climate-resilient portfolio.\"</p><p> Lowering emissionsMAS' total emissions for FY2024 fell 21.8 per cent compared to the previous year. The chiller plant upgrading in Currency House brought Scope 2 emissions down by 9.1 per cent. Meanwhile, emissions from outsourced currency operations fell 36.4 per cent.</p><p> MAS said that it is on track to achieve its emissions reduction targets. </p><p> The central bank aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions from business air travel, by 17.5 per cent by FY2025, compared to FY2018. The FY2030 target is a 30 per cent reduction.</p><p> It also plans to reduce Scope 3 emissions from outsourced currency operations by 10 per cent by FY2025, and by 20 per cent by FY2030. </p><p> The central bank has encouraged Singaporeans to avoid withdrawing newly-printed notes for the Chinese New Year, instead opting for good-enough existing notes, called \"Fit-for-Gifting\" notes. </p><p> During this year's festivities, the number of Fit-for-Gifting notes exchanged rose 38 per cent to 16.2 million. </p><p> This translates to emissions savings of 517 tCO2e, comparable to powering 280 four-room HDB flats annually.</p><p> Emerging areasMAS plans to continue working with the financial industry on emerging areas, such as nature-related risks and opportunities. </p><p> The central bank seeks to be \"risk-proportionate, pragmatic and flexible\" in its engagement, said Tan.</p><p> Talent development is another key focus. </p><p> Since the launch of the Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map in last year, at least 4,100 financial sector professionals across over 100 financial institutions have been trained in sustainable finance through IBF-accredited or recognised courses.</p><p> Over 8,200 Skills Badges have also been awarded to individuals who have completed IBF-accredited sustainable finance courses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-83JMUT6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G78-6G43-RRTV-M3S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1014\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Taking action early will better enable us to adjust to and thrive in a climate-impacted global economy,\" he said. </p><p> Transition in Asia also presents economic opportunities, Mr Gan added, with an estimate that renewable energy-related manufacturing in South-east Asia could create up to six million jobs by 2050 and generate up to US$100 billion (S$128.1 billion) in annual revenue by 2030. </p><p> \"As an organisation, we continue to demonstrate leadership through reducing our corporate carbon emissions and managing a climate-resilient portfolio,\" he said. </p><p> For instance, MAS is reducing carbon emissions across the currency value chain through initiatives like getting people to adopt its \"fit-for-gifting\" notes for Chinese New Year. </p><p> Fit notes are used currency notes that are generally clean and of suitable quality for recirculation, including for festive gifting.</p><p> MAS worked with banks to expand their network of pop-up and branch ATMs to dispense such notes. Hence, 16.2 million pieces of \"fit\" notes were exchanged in the 2025 festive season, an increase of 38 per cent compared with the Chinese New Year period in 2024.</p><p> This translates to emissions savings of around 517 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from not issuing an equivalent amount of new notes to meet festive demand -- comparable with powering about 280 four-room Housing Board flats annually.</p><p> When it comes to investments and portfolios, MAS said it will also continue to strengthen the climate resilience of the Official Foreign Reserves portfolio. </p><p> MAS manages the Official Foreign Reserves. These reserves are accumulated when MAS buys US dollars in exchange for Singdollars to moderate the appreciation of the Singdollar exchange rate.</p><p> It is also working to help companies with their sustainability disclosures.</p><p> MAS worked with the Singapore Exchange to get listed companies to start incorporating climate-related disclosure requirements aligned with global standards from fiscal year 2025. </p><p> \"Aligning disclosure requirements to internationally recognised standards such as the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards will enhance the consistency and comparability of quality climate-related information. This in turn enhances market discipline, investor protection, as well as access to new business opportunities,\" MAS said.  </p><p> IFRS stands for International Financial Reporting Standards, used for global accounting and sustainability disclosures. </p><p> MAS is also studying a new disclosure framework on climate-related financial risks for the banking sector, as well as requirements for the insurance sector. </p><p> The climate transition also provides more job opportunities. </p><p> After the jobs transformation map for sustainable finance was launched in April 2024, MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance started initiatives to support the upskilling of the financial sector workforce in sustainable finance.</p><p> Since then, at least 4,100 financial sector professionals across more than 100 financial institutions have been trained in sustainable finance through recognised courses, MAS said. </p><p> NUS Business School also recently introduced a specialisation in sustainable finance for its undergraduates majoring in finance.</p><p> When it comes to social and sustainability-related bonds and loans, MAS supports global and Asian companies in accessing green and transition financing. </p><p>Singapore is Asean's largest market for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds and loans, accounting for more than half of the market, MAS noted. </p><p> The amount of such loans that originated from Singapore hit an annual high of more than $48 billion in 2024. This figure has been increasing year on year, over the last seven years. </p><p> MAS chief sustainability officer Gillian Tan said South-east Asia's sustainable finance market has demonstrated resilience, with sustainable finance proceeds raised from bonds and loans in the region increasing to record highs and growth outpacing that of other regions in 2024.</p><p> \"The region's low-carbon transition continues to present significant economic opportunities.\"</p><p> She added that MAS provides risk-based guidance and supervisory engagement. </p><p> \"This enables financial institutions to bolster their resilience to environmental risks and finance the transition to a more climate-resilient economy, while also adapting their actions to changing global and local circumstances,\" she said. </p><p> \"As a financial sector developer, MAS' strategies are aimed at ensuring financial institutions are able to support Singapore and the region's transition through financing and other solutions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-F1JMQ8O</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G78-6G43-RRTV-M3TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It focuses on regional cooperation across seven areas that include peace and security, climate change and disasters, technology and connectivity, and human rights.</p><p> \"Our Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing package was specially tailored to complement this strategy and supports the Pacific's priorities in areas like climate resilience, cyber security and international law,\" he said.</p><p> This is Mr Rabuka's second visit to Singapore. During his first visit in 1998, an orchid was named after him. </p><p> \"The orchid continues to thrive today,\" PM Wong said. \"It is a fitting symbol of the friendship between our two countries and how it has grown and blossomed since we first established ties in 1971.\"</p><p> PM Wong said he hopes to welcome even more Fijian and Pacific officials to Singapore.</p><p> \"Individually, our countries are small. But by working together, both bilaterally and with the rest of the Pacific, we can make an outsized impact in the areas that matter most to us.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Prime Minister Lawrence Wong meeting Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka at Parliament House on April 22.

A kreisel tank is a specialised one used to house delicate marine creatures such as jellyfish.</p><p> Another exhibit, Singapore's Coast, features mangrove-inspired landscapes and interactive habitats that highlight native biodiversity.</p><p> In the Open Ocean zone, visitors can get up close to reef manta rays and zebra sharks, which swim among thousands of other marine animals behind a 36m-wide viewing panel.</p><p> The oceanarium has also partnered top academic institutions to \"push the boundaries of marine research\", RWS said.</p><p> These include a five-year applied research collaboration with the National University of Singapore and a two-year research collaboration with the Earth Observatory of Singapore at Nanyang Technological University on climate resilience and marine conservation.</p><p> Adjacent to the oceanarium will be a research and learning centre equipped with immersive learning laboratories, collaborative workspaces, seminar rooms and a rooftop event space.</p><p> The centre enhances Singapore Oceanarium's educational offerings and provides advanced facilities for scientists and researchers to conduct research work and drive marine science outreach on-site, RWS said.</p><p> \"Singapore Oceanarium represents the next frontier for marine education and sustainability,\" said Mr Tan Hee Teck, chief executive of RWS. \"We have created not just a destination, but also a catalyst for change, a place where curiosity transforms into knowledge, and knowledge into real action.\"</p><p> S.E.A. Aquarium closed for renovation on April 30 after 12 years of operations.</p><p>Singapore Oceanarium's vice-president Lam Xue Ying added that the transformation of the facility has been years in the making.</p><p> \"We are dedicated to inspiring a new generation of ocean stewards by taking ocean education and interactive storytelling to the next level, through naturalistic habitats and immersive technology,\" said Ms Lam.</p><p> Further details, including on programmes and ticket prices, will be available soon, said RWS.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-0EILLN9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX3-FP43-RSDS-N123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The orchid continues to thrive today. And it is a fitting symbol of the friendship between our two countries and how it has grown and blossomed since we first established ties in 1971.</p><p>Although we are in different parts of the world, Fiji and Singapore do share much in common.</p><p>We are small island states and gateways to our respective regions, we share a common belief in the importance of international law, multilateralism, and free trade.</p><p>And we are also diverse and multicultural societies, with a belief in the values of mutual respect, inclusivity and cooperation for the common good.</p><p>And in this increasingly uncertain and turbulent world, as we discussed this morning, it has become more vital than ever for like-minded countries like us to come together - to collaborate for mutual benefit, and to uphold the rules-based international order.</p><p>This morning, Prime Minister Rabuka and I reaffirmed our commitment to deepen bilateral cooperation in areas like trade, investment, and connectivity. We also agreed to expand our collaboration in climate resilience and human capital development.</p><p>As Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Singapore and Fiji are vulnerable to the effects of climate change and that is why we are both pushing for more global action, including at multilateral forums, like the Forum of Small States (FOSS) and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), to amplify our collective voice.</p><p>Singapore will also do our part to support Fiji's human capital development, something which I have shared with the Prime Minister this morning.</p><p>To date, over 1,500 Fiji officials have participated in the Singapore Cooperation Programme.</p><p>And through this and other customised courses, we will continue to offer capacity-building programmes in areas like digital transformation and good governance, or other areas that Fiji would like us to focus on.</p><p>Our strong bilateral ties also provide a good foundation for Singapore's broader engagement with the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF).</p><p>We are honoured to have become a Dialogue Partner of the PIF in 2022, during Fiji's Chairmanship.</p><p>We also support the PIF's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, which was launched under Fiji's leadership.</p><p>Our Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing (SPARKS) package was specially tailored to complement this strategy, and supports the Pacific's priorities in areas like climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law.</p><p>We have also convened the Singapore-Pacific High Level Visit to engage Pacific Ministers on issues of common interest.</p><p>I hope to welcome even more Fiji and Pacific officials to Singapore, to further build on this exchange of knowledge and friendship.</p><p>Individually, our countries are small. But by working together, both bilaterally and with the rest of the Pacific, we can make an outsized impact in the areas that matter most to us.</p><p>I look forward to partnering with Prime Minister Rabuka to bring our partnership to greater heights.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, may I now offer and propose a toast:</p><p>To the good health and success of His Excellency President Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu;</p><p>To the good health and success of Prime Minister Rabuka;</p><p>To the peace and prosperity of Fiji, and to the enduring friendship between our two countries.</p><p>[Category: Hotels, Restaurants, &amp;

They will also take part in courses conducted by government agencies, law schools, bar associations, law societies, arbitration centres and other relevant institutions. </p><p>Singapore and China have also signed a letter of intent to explore establishing a Senior Officials' Exchange Programme, which is intended to deepen the two countries' longstanding human resource development cooperation and strengthen officials' mutual understanding and friendship through more frequent exchanges. </p><p> It will serve as an additional platform for the exchange of views on leadership development and dealing with common challenges, complementing the Singapore-China Forum on Leadership.</p><p> Another letter of intent was signed to jointly develop a Third Country Training Programme, for government officials from Asean member states and Timor-Leste. </p><p> This programme will focus on several key areas, such as clean-energy transition, sustainable urban development, climate resilience and support for the Asean Power Grid. It is expected to help raise regional capacity to tackle long-term challenges in sustainability and resilience.</p><p> Finally, a data-exchange agreement will enhance intellectual property data sharing, as both countries advance their digital capabilities and develop tech-driven solutions. The signing ceremony followed a meeting between PM Wong and Li earlier on Monday. </p><p> In their discussion, they took note of the launch of the Singapore-China over-the-counter bond market arrangement, under which participating Singapore banks will provide trading and custody services for onshore RMB bonds, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.</p><p> The arrangement will also enhance international investors' access to China's bond market, through Singapore, it added.</p><p> During this meeting, Li also updated PM Wong on his priorities for China. These priorities include China's continued reform, as well as its focus on achieving \"high-quality development\". </p><p> MFA noted: \"PM Wong expressed confidence in China's long-term economic development.\"</p><p> At the beginning of their meeting, PM Wong said that in a more uncertain and turbulent world, Singapore and China must not only forge stronger bilateral ties, but also work together in regional and multilateral platforms.</p><p> He agreed with Li's remarks that the current international landscape is \"marked by intertwined turbulence and changes, with increasing uncertainty and instability\".</p><p> Li said in Mandarin that under such circumstances, it is \"especially vital\" for China and Singapore to strengthen cooperation and exchanges.</p><p> PM Wong noted that the two countries' relationship has \"grown from strength to strength\", particularly following the upgrade of ties to an \"All-Around High-Quality Future-Oriented Partnership\" in 2023.</p><p> This partnership has provided a \"clear strategic direction\" for cooperation, and provides a basis for Singapore and China to come up with fresh ideas and continue to find new ways to strengthen cooperation, such as in the digital and green spaces, he said. </p><p> \"This deep level of trust and understanding cannot be taken for granted,\" said PM Wong. \"It has to be cultivated year after year, generation after generation.\"</p><p> In his remarks, he noted that his introductory visit to China comes shortly after Singapore's general election on May 3.</p><p> He said that some in his delegation are new members of his team. He added: \"I'm encouraging everyone in my Cabinet to continue visiting China regularly, so that we can continue to build and strengthen the close ties between our two countries.\"</p><p> Li similarly noted that PM Wong's \"decision to make China (his) first destination outside Asean after (his) re-election reflects the new Singapore government's strong emphasis on China-Singapore relations\".</p><p> This meeting at the Great Hall of the People took place shortly after a welcome ceremony for PM Wong. This was the first time the leaders have met since the Asean Summit in Kuala Lumpur in May.</p><p> PM Wong is in China until Thursday, for what is his first official visit to the country since becoming prime minister in May last year. His trip also takes place as Singapore and China celebrate the 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties, he noted.</p><p> For these reasons, the visit is \"extra meaningful\", he said.  </p><p> In addition to the meeting and the ceremony, Li also hosted PM Wong and his delegation to a dinner banquet on Monday night.</p><p> On Tuesday, PM Wong is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and China's third in command, National People's Congress chairman Zhao Leji.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang (left) and Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during a welcome ceremony at the North Hall of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing; PM Wong says that the two countries' relationship has \"grown from strength to strength\".

GoTo's Jakarta office raid, while not implicating the company directly, highlights the blurred boundaries between tech giants and state initiatives, especially when former executives like Nadiem Makarim transition into policymaking roles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the heart of the case is the alleged disregard of initial technical evaluations in favour of a massive Chromebook deal, raising troubling questions about influence, intent, and due process. The Attorney General's focus on a pivotal May 2020 meeting suggests that key decision-makers may have overridden expert input, potentially compromising educational outcomes for millions of students.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As investigators zero in on Nadiem and his former staff, the case also tests Indonesia's institutional capacity to hold high-profile figures accountable. That Nadiem was once seen as a symbol of reform and innovation adds to the gravity of the situation.</p><p>Regardless of its final outcome, the probe sends a strong message: Digitalisation alone is not a panacea. Without transparency and robust checks, even the most well-intentioned programmes risk being undermined by mismanagement or worse corruption. The real test is whether justice can be served without political shielding.</p><p>REGIONAL</p><p><url

The UN estimates that the current adaptation finance gap is US$194 billion (S$264 billion) to US$366 billion per year.</p><p> Ms Marisa Drew, chief sustainability officer at Standard Chartered Bank, said that defining the commercial opportunities involved in financing adaptation is key to getting the private sector involved. </p><p> \"Because we are private sector actors, we're here to make a return,\" she said. </p><p> She added that case studies are valuable in helping firms grasp the opportunities involved in the space. </p><p> \"Often, we talk about these things in a very big-picture way. But if we have proof points, your investments that are proving out the return or the project that worked... (we can say) here's a good one. Copy it. And... that's when you start to see that scaling effect start to take hold,\" said Ms Drew. </p><p> Mr Koh said the list of climate hazards that scientists have warned about can serve as \"shopping lists\" for technologies and solutions to deal with these challenges. </p><p> He cited one solution his firm will soon announce that it is funding: an artificial intelligence company that analyses satellite imagery for vegetation management for utilities. </p><p> \"Sparking from power lines, globally, is what causes the giant wildfires we are seeing in the United States, Australia and other countries where vegetation, trees, shrubs, grasses encroach too much on the transmission distribution lines,\" he said. </p><p> Currently, managing this threat is done manually, Mr Koh said, with one group of workers identifying trees growing too close to the power lines, and another group coming in to trim the limbs that are getting too close.</p><p> \"However, this is not a scalable strategy with the acceleration (of climate impacts) that we're seeing now in heat events, weather events, and the kind of wildfire risks that we have,\" he said. </p><p> \"But now we have applications of technology, artificial intelligence, and satellite and drone imagery to enable over 40 utilities today to manage that risk in a much more efficient way,\" Mr Koh said. </p><p> The session was moderated by Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at management consultancy Boston Consulting Group, and featured as panellists Mr Koh, Ms Drew and two other speakers. </p><p> The two other speakers were Mr Tom Moody, regional director for South-east Asia, climate and energy at the British government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and Mr Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for the Asia-Pacific at reinsurance giant Swiss Re.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-GO8TLRO</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BTR-8501-JCF2-801X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Spearheaded by Bond Sudarta, an early Airbnb operator and seasoned angel investor, the fund is designed to back startups that combine commercial scalability with deep social purpose.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We are not career VCs - we are operators and builders first,' says Sudarta, founder and general partner of 007 Venture Partners. 'The most valuable companies I have worked with were led by founders who had heart, hustle, and a deep sense of purpose.'</p><p>While the market is saturated with venture funds chasing early-stage deals, 007 Venture Partners aims to stand apart by investing in companies at the intersection of purpose and profit. Sudarta emphasises that this alignment is not just philosophical but strategic: companies built around mission-led founders often show stronger resilience and greater potential for long-term value.</p><p>'When evaluating potential investments, we place a strong emphasis on the founder's purpose,' he explains. 'It is about the founder's deep, personal connection to the problem they are solving - often informed by lived experience or conviction.'</p><p>Importantly, this mission must align with the company's business model. 'Solving a meaningful problem should be at the heart of the business, not just a form of virtue signalling,' he adds.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/ai-genai-and-beyond-navigating-the-next-wave-of-tech-investments-in-sea-20250330/\">AI, GenAI, and beyond: Navigating the next wave of tech investments in SEA</url></p><p>A Transpacific focus</p><p>Unlike many early-stage funds that remain geographically narrow in scope, 007 Venture Partners maintains a distinctly transpacific focus, actively investing across the US, Australia, India, and Southeast Asia (SEA). According to Sudarta, the region offers complementary strengths that are often siloed.</p><p>'The Asia Pacific region presents significant opportunities over the next decade, driven by a burgeoning middle class and populations seeking innovative solutions,' he says. 'From fintech inclusion in India to climate resilience in SEA, the potential for impact is immense and still largely untapped.'</p><p>Australia, too, plays a critical role in this ecosystem. Despite being frequently underestimated, Sudarta points to the country's strong R&amp;D culture and globally significant deep tech innovations - from the cochlear implant to CSIRO's Wi-Fi breakthroughs - as evidence of its latent potential.</p><p>Meanwhile, the US remains a powerhouse for software and AI innovation, offering an unmatched blend of capital, talent, and ecosystem maturity.</p><p>The fund's investment thesis targets high-impact sectors such as healthcare, fintech, edutech, B2B, and climate. Sudarta is particularly interested in solutions that address longstanding access gaps or inefficiencies in these domains.</p><p>In healthcare, this includes AI-powered diagnostics, personalised treatment platforms, and digital health tools tailored for underserved populations. In fintech, the focus is on mobile banking and financial tools that enable small businesses to thrive.</p><p>For climate, the fund is exploring innovations in renewable energy storage, sustainable food systems, and circular economy technologies. 'We are committed to investing in technologies that drive climate resilience,' Sudarta says.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/market-wrap-a-tale-of-tariffs-bitcoin-whales-and-corporate-crypto-adoption-20250415/\">Market wrap: A tale of tariffs, Bitcoin whales, and corporate crypto adoption</url></p><p>Edutech also plays a central role. 'We support solutions that upskill the next generation of workers,' he adds. 'Edutech stands at the forefront of an exciting and pivotal transformation.'</p><p>More than capital</p><p>007 Venture Partners offers more than financial support. The fund leverages a powerful network of advisors and LPs drawn from leading companies such as Airbnb, Meta, Uber and LinkedIn. This network, Sudarta notes, is key to providing operational support beyond the cheque.</p><p>'We are often the first call when it comes to scaling strategy, making key hires, or navigating a fundraising round,' he says. 'Many of us have been founders or early team members ourselves, so we understand the challenges intimately.'</p><p>The fund also co-invests alongside top-tier firms such as Y Combinator, Sequoia, a16z, Lightspeed and Accel. While not formal partners, Sudarta describes these relationships as mutually beneficial: 'Startups often allocate us a position on their cap table because we bring hands-on, founder-aligned support that complements larger investors.'</p><p>Looking ahead, Sudarta envisions 007 Venture Partners becoming a go-to investor for mission-driven founders across the Transpacific corridor. 'We want to be the fund that founders aspire to have on their cap table when they're tackling meaningful, challenging, and global problems,' he says.</p><p>For 007 Venture Partners, success is measured in financial returns and social impact. 'We believe that the most valuable returns will come from companies solving real-world problems,' says Sudarta. 'We're intentionally building a portfolio that demonstrates how impact and financial success can go hand in hand.'</p><p>-</p><p>Image Credit: 007 Venture Partners</p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/007-venture-partners-20250415/\">007 Venture Partners launches US$3.1M fund to back purpose-led startups across the Transpacific appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/007-venture-partners-20250415/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG119314545561426635252170147040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FK2-81S3-RT08-32HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><timeReceived>8:47 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion by 2030, with the amount expected to grow even larger thereafter amid worsening extreme weather events, a report has found.</p><p> The study, The Private Equity Opportunity in Climate Adaptation and Resilience, was launched by Boston Consulting Group and Temasek on Wednesday (May 7) at Ecosperity Week 2025, a sustainability event.</p><p> The rising need for financing is evident, as 87 per cent of countries now have at least one national-level climate adaptation policy, strategy or plan in place, the report showed. </p><p> Despite the projected growth in expenditure, current global spending on climate solution projects is only about US$76 billion a year, with public sources contributing the bulk of the amount.</p><p> \"To meet the rising needs by 2030, there is an opportunity for private investment in the current gap,\" the authors of the report said, also noting that the need for solutions is generating emerging value pools across value chains. </p><p> Such projects range from flood defence and wildfire protection to climate intelligence and water efficiency technologies. </p><p> Motivated to clear the misconception of climate projects being complex and nascent, lead author Daniel Oehling, a managing director and partner at BCG's Singapore office, said the report laid out the different types of investment opportunities in seven impact themes. </p><p> \"There are many companies that are sizable today, are specialised in what they do, highly profitable and fit to build for private industry networks,\" he said. </p><p> Examples with opportunities for both investments and exits include the flood defence business. </p><p> High levels of investment activityIn particular, the market for flood defence products, estimated at more than US$2 billion in 2024, would grow by 12 to 15 per cent at a compounded annual growth rate over the next five years.</p><p>  Its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) margin is estimated at 20 to 30 per cent, based on the report.</p><p> The segment is where several ventures, such as Germany's IBS Technics and Norway's AquaFence, are at different stages of growth.</p><p> The report also identified five factors that can help private equity investors determine the most promising projects, and assess their attractiveness in both the short and medium terms. </p><p> Projects that have pulled in high levels of investment activity but are putting out weak forward-looking signals include smart-grid management and precision agriculture. </p><p> On the other hand, projects in climate-resilient building design, as well as rainwater and run-off harvesting, are projecting strong forward-looking signals, but are getting limited investment traction. </p><p> At the same time, the report also warns investors to be mindful of potential conflicts in the environmental outcomes of some solutions. </p><p> For example, manufacturing of concrete and steel, while playing important roles in fortifying infrastructure assets against extreme weather, consumes large amounts of energy and carbon. </p><p> \"Investors in solutions such as low-carbon concrete and green steel, which address both climate adaptation and resilience and other environmental objectives, stand to benefit more in the long term,\" it said.</p><p> Speaking at a panel at the launch of the report, Jay Koh, co-founder and managing director of climate-resilience focused private equity firm The Lightsmith Group, highlighted the importance of investing in scalable solutions now, \"so that 15 years from now, when that inevitable future has arrived, we have the solutions available at scale to try to combat that\".

In fact, the push for economic resilience and self-sufficiency may ultimately accelerate investments in sustainable infrastructure across the regions.</p><p> Large-scale policy frameworks, such as the European Green Deal and the Japan Green Transformation initiative, are funnelling substantial capital into climate-related sectors. </p><p> In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is playing a similar transformative role -- directing hundreds of billions of dollars into clean energy, manufacturing and climate resilience over the next decade. </p><p> With its embedded incentives and bipartisan economic benefits, the IRA is helping to catalyse investments and innovations across both red and blue states, reinforcing the structural shifts underway. </p><p> Investors are watching these developments closely, but they are not standing still. Many continue to allocate their funds to climate and sustainability opportunities based on sound economics, long-term risk mitigation and structural market trends.</p><p> Structural drivers are stronger than everUrbanisation and population growth are driving global electricity demand, which is expected to double over the next 20 years. </p><p> Meeting this demand will require more energy of all types. But renewable energy -- particularly solar and wind -- stands out as the most cost effective. </p><p> Today, solar and wind energy are the cheapest sources of new electricity in most of the world, making it the preferred choice for new capacity, according to BloombergNEF. </p><p> As a result, global investment in renewables is nearly twice that of fossil fuels.</p><p> Another powerful driver is the rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI). </p><p> AI models are extremely energy and water-intensive. For instance, generating a 100-word e-mail with OpenAI's GPT-4 model can consume the equivalent of a 500 ml bottle of water and enough energy to power 14 LED light bulbs for an hour, according to a study conducted by The Washington Post in collaboration with the University of California, Riverside. </p><p> As AI adoption grows worldwide, global demand for energy-efficient data centres and low-carbon infrastructure solutions rises.</p><p> Sustainability here to stayAcross markets, from Asia to Europe to the Americas, investors are integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors not due to the desire for political alignment, but because the financial materiality of climate risk, evolving regulatory frameworks and consumer preferences are undeniable. </p><p> Many companies are also accelerating their own transitions, integrating ESG into their risk management frameworks and net-zero strategies. </p><p> Governments are reinforcing this momentum through supportive frameworks. </p><p> Whether it is the European Union taxonomy and carbon pricing, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 or China's Carbon Neutrality plan, public policies are aligning with long-term sustainability goals. This convergence of public and private capital is a key enabler of the transition. </p><p> Sustainable investing has become increasingly accessible as awareness grows and more investment solutions become available. Beyond simple exclusions, investors today are also considering the following approaches to sustainable investing:</p><p> Aligning with a changing worldFor investors looking to begin or deepen their sustainable investing journey, the key is clarity. </p><p> Define what you want to achieve -- whether it is managing risk, capturing growth or contributing to real-world change. Then choose the right mix of tools, which may be ESG integration, thematic strategies or impact-oriented solutions.</p><p> Sustainable investing is not a passing trend. It is a reflection of a world in transition -- in our economy, environment and society. </p><p> Regardless of political cycles, the transition is underway. Investors who recognise this early will be better positioned for long-term success.</p><p> The writer is head of asset allocation at Standard Chartered Bank's wealth solutions chief investment office</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Changes in government policy, whether in the US, Europe or Asia, can affect the near-term operating environment for clean energy and sustainability-linked sectors.

Surely there's money to be made there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's sovereign wealth investors certainly think so. Two separate reports by GIC, which manages Singapore's foreign reserves, and Temasek, which mainly invests in equities, focus on investment opportunities in climate adaptation.</p><p> Growing interestGIC, which wants to determine the long-term investment value of climate adaptation, estimates that global annual revenues from a set of adaptation solution categories could grow from US$1 trillion today to US$4 trillion by 2050. </p><p> The investment opportunity from these categories could increase from US$2 trillion today to US$9 trillion by 2050, of which US$3 trillion can be attributed to global warming. </p><p> These assume that global warming will reach 2.7 deg C by the end of the century.</p><p> Temasek's report, which focuses on private equity opportunities, reckons that annual worldwide demand for adaptation financing could grow to between US$500 billion and US$1.3 trillion from 2025 to 2030. </p><p> That is far more than current levels of adaptation financing, which averages around US$76 billion a year and is mostly from public coffers.</p><p> But interest is definitely growing. Temasek notes the launch of a number of dedicated adaptation and resilience investment funds since 2019, including the Lightsmith Climate Resilience Partners' US$185 million fund, the US$250 million Mirova Environment Acceleration Capital Fund and the targeted US$100 million InsuResilience Investment Fund Private Equity II fund.</p><p> Defining challengeClimate adaptation refers to the broad class of climate action that seeks to address the effects of climate change. It's distinct from climate mitigation, which is the type of climate action aimed at reducing climate change.</p><p> Global mitigation efforts have been insufficient so far to keep warming on track to stay below 1.5 deg C, a threshold past which catastrophic climate change becomes significantly more probable. That reality has made adaptation more important.</p><p> But what exactly counts as adaptation? Simple rules that investors can use to screen for potential investments are difficult to write. As Temasek explains, adaptation revenue streams \"tend to be embedded in pre-existing industrial sectors such as materials, engineering procurement and construction, and infrastructure\". This makes it difficult to clearly define adaptation solutions providers.</p><p> Temasek, with consultant BCG, maps the universe of investment opportunities into seven impact themes:</p><p> GIC, with Bain &amp; Co, identifies 14 categories of adaptation solutions that it deems to address the most likely and impactful climate hazards, and are investable:</p><p> Early bird benefitsBoth reports suggest that adaptation opportunities are still undervalued, and that it pays to invest early.</p><p> Temasek notes that due to the local nature of adaptation measures -- for example, North America uses detention and retention basis to curb inland flooding while Asia uses pipes and drains to divert floodwaters -- investors have the opportunity to enter at lower valuations before valuations account for the potential of market expansion.</p><p> However, pure plays might only comprise early-stage targets at this time; growth and buyout private equity investors might find only targets whose adaptation businesses are currently small but growing.</p><p> GIC estimates that 2050 revenues will exceed current business forecasts by 61 per cent largely because current models do not adequately price in growing demand for adaptation solutions.</p><p> Furthermore, GIC says its model's sensitivity to different climate scenarios is relatively low for the next 25 years because the impact of global warming only becomes more severe in the latter half of the century. This means that current investments can enjoy a fairly high level of confidence about returns.</p><p> Long-term investors have a \"unique opportunity to invest in a space where company earnings may positively surprise as demand for adaptation solutions increases\", GIC writes.</p><p> This article first appeared in BT's ESG Insights newsletter on May 9</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Exposed sandbanks due to drought at the Solimoes River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon River.

Two standout initiatives-Scentian Bio's VOC maturity assessment and the Biochar Field Trial 2024-already show promising results and potential long-term impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scentian Bio's pilot transforms traditional fruit maturity testing, which is typically slow and labour-intensive. Instead, the company is developing biosensors inspired by insect olfactory systems to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by ripening kiwifruit. The technology, paired with AI models, enables fast, accurate, and non-destructive maturity assessment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We see this as a game-changer,' says Jiunn Shih, Zespri's Global Chief Marketing, Innovation &amp; Sustainability Officer, in an email to e27. 'Growers can make more informed decisions, increase productivity, and deliver fruit at peak ripeness-while reducing post-harvest waste.'</p><p>Beyond operational efficiency, this innovation supports sustainability by improving harvest timing and resource use across the supply chain.</p><p>The Biochar Field Trial 2024 by M.B. Horticulture Ltd is another key climate tech initiative. It explores using biochar-a carbon-rich material made from organic waste-to enhance soil health, increase productivity, and store carbon in kiwifruit orchards.</p><p>'Think of it as a nutrient battery,' says Shih. 'Biochar improves nutrient retention, reduces leaching, and supports long-term soil vitality, while locking carbon in the soil for hundreds of years.'</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/wavemaker-impact-invests-in-zentide-to-scale-sustainable-seaweed-based-agriculture-20250304/\">Wavemaker Impact invests in Zentide to scale sustainable seaweed-based agriculture</url></p><p>Although biochar has been trialled in other crops, its use in perennial vines such as kiwifruit remains limited. This project offers growers practical, evidence-based guidance for adopting the method.</p><p>Early results are positive, highlighting environmental and economic benefits that align with Zespri's broader sustainability goals.</p><p>'These pilots give our growers the confidence to adopt practices that strengthen orchard resilience and deliver climate-positive outcomes,' adds Shih.</p><p>Through ZAG, Zespri is proving how climate tech and sustainability-focused innovation can future-proof agriculture and deliver lasting value to growers and the planet. In this interview, find out more about how they are doing it and what insight they can share about the climate and agritech sector.</p><p>The following is an edited excerpt of the conversation.</p><p>What are some of the most compelling agri- and climate-tech trends you see emerge across the Asia Pacific region? How do you plan to seize this opportunity?</p><p>In recent seasons, we have seen the impact of climate change more clearly through our growing systems and around the world. Working with solution providers, ZAG is focused on creating solutions that will help create sustainable, long-term value for our growers. These initiatives will examine how we can enhance productivity while caring for the land, enabling it to grow sustainably.</p><p>Agri- and climate-tech are booming, and there will be more developments in these sectors as we move forward in 2025. Precision agriculture is becoming more accessible, not just for large-scale farms but increasingly for smallholders too. At the same time, we are seeing a surge in nature-based solutions-agroforestry, soil carbon capture, water-efficient systems-all aligned with food security and decarbonisation goals.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/how-biotech-is-changing-the-global-agriculture-game-for-investors-20211202/\">How biotech is changing the global agriculture game for investors</url></p><p>Therefore, with ZAG, we plan to use these emerging technologies to tackle some of the industry's biggest sustainability challenges, such as automation, big-data value extraction, soil regeneration, supply chain optimisation, and packaging.</p><p>For instance, Zespri is collaborating with M.B. Horticulture on a biochar field trial, which explores the application of biochar as a stable form of carbon storage in kiwifruit orchards. Biochar has the potential to enhance soil health and productivity, directly contributing to Zespri's climate-positive goals. The ZAG fund is providing an opportunity for innovative new ideas, like using biochar in kiwifruit orchards, to be tested on a small scale to evaluate whether more in-depth work is warranted.</p><p>In essence, ZAG is a strategic investment to foster innovations that directly contribute to reducing Zespri's environmental footprint.</p><p>How do you see the intersection of data, automation, and sustainability shaping the future of food production in this region?</p><p>The intersection of data, automation, and sustainability is becoming the backbone of the next-generation food system in Asia Pacific. Data enables traceability and transparency across the entire value chain, from soil to shelf. That is critical, especially as consumers, regulators, and partners demand greater accountability around environmental and social impact. Automation is helping address labour shortages and increase operational efficiency, while reducing inputs like water, energy, and chemicals.</p><p>We are already seeing this come to life through the ventures we have supported via ZAG. Scentian Bio, for instance, is a pioneering initiative using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to transform kiwifruit maturity assessment. By replacing labour-intensive and time-consuming methods, this innovation could reduce operational inefficiencies and enhance supply chain planning. Growers could benefit from improved productivity and better decision-making, while customers and consumers receive consistently high-quality fruit delivered at peak ripeness.</p><p>How is climate change influencing how growers and producers in Asia Pacific adopt new technologies, particularly in sustainability and crop resilience?</p><p>Climate change is not just a future threat in Asia Pacific. It is a present reality globally, and growers across the region are already feeling the impact.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/agriaku-raises-seed-funding-round-led-by-arise-to-tap-into-indonesias-agriculture-market-20211221/\">Agriaku raises seed funding round led by Arise to tap into Indonesia's agriculture market</url></p><p>As we transition into the second year of ZAG, we are committed to not just maintaining the momentum we have had, but also amplifying our impact. The next phase will focus on strengthening climate resilience across food systems by advancing productivity and carbon-positive practices. By leveraging the successes and learnings from our first year, the next stage of ZAG aims to accelerate sustainable innovations that benefit the environment, communities, and people as we meet the growing demand for kiwifruit.</p><p>While our core priorities remain the same-strengthening climate resilience across food systems and creating solutions that advance productivity and carbon-positive practices-we are always open to exploring new partnerships that align with global and regional advancements in sustainability.</p><p>What are some key challenges agritech founders face in Asia Pacific, and how is ZAG helping them navigate these?</p><p>As with many in agriculture, we operate in a dynamic environment that drives us to innovate, adapt, and build greater resilience for the future. From climate change and increasing labour and input costs to the pressing need to boost productivity, these realities are why innovation is no longer optional; it is essential.</p><p>One of the most common hurdles for agritech startups in Asia Pacific is proving the commercial viability of their innovations. Many have strong ideas and prototypes, but limited access to funding or commercial environments to test them in real-world settings.</p><p>ZAG helps bridge this gap by funding pilot projects and proof-of-concept trials without taking equity. We offer startups direct access to Zespri's grower network, allowing them to validate their solutions in-market. If the technology proves successful, we will support scale-up efforts across our global supply chain.</p><p>This approach reduces early-stage risk for founders while helping Zespri explore innovations that could potentially create meaningful enhancements to sustainability and efficiency across orchards and operations.</p><p>[Another challenge is] climate change, which already impacts the kiwifruit industry. For Zespri, kiwifruit cultivation is highly dependent on specific climate conditions, wherein our kiwifruit needs around 1,000 hours of winter chill between two and four degrees Celsius.</p><p>Historically, New Zealand could reliably provide that. But today, we see increased climate variability, impacting flowering, bud break, and fruit development. More recently, we have experienced more extreme weather events.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-green-tech-wave-southeast-asias-agritech-stars-shine-bright-20250324/\">SEA's US$48B agritech revolution: Startups cultivating a smarter future</url></p><p>ZAG actively seeks solutions that help us and our growers adapt to these shifting conditions through orchard innovations, climate-resilient crop strategies, or technologies that improve planning and risk management.</p><p>By working with innovators worldwide, we are tackling these challenges head-on with a future-focused mindset. We are not only interested in solving problems for today; we're investing in resilience for tomorrow.</p><p>The ZAG Innovation Fund connects bold ideas with the infrastructure, expertise, and credibility needed to scale in Asia Pacific's unique agri-environment. We are not just funding pilots, we are building bridges between founders, growers, and global opportunities.</p><p>Looking ahead, what role does Zespri's ZAG Innovation Fund hope to play in advancing the agriculture and climate tech ecosystem across Asia Pacific?</p><p>Looking ahead, ZAG aims to support the best solutions in the agriculture and climate tech ecosystems, regardless of where they originate. As a global business, Zespri works with more than 4,000 growers across New Zealand, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and France, while our kiwifruit is enjoyed in over 50 countries worldwide.</p><p>Since our  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/zespri-wants-to-work-with-agritech-innovators-to-improve-kiwifruit-production-and-distribution-20231207/\">launch in November 2023, ZAG has united innovators worldwide to harness the power of collaboration and combine their ingenious ideas with ours. Out of more than 100 applications submitted to ZAG, we are proud to have onboarded 11 ongoing pilots.</url></p><p>ZAG focuses on the kiwifruit ecosystem, addressing challenges and opportunities across all growing regions and markets.

Based on a survey of over 4,000 businesses, the research explores how digital technology, financial access, and climate resilience are shaping urban economies, with particular attention to women entrepreneurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jakarta stands out for its notably high representation of women among MSE owners. Seventy per cent of MSEs in the Indonesian capital are owned by women, a stark contrast to Delhi, where women comprise only 11 per cent of business owners. This difference highlights the significance of local cultural and socioeconomic contexts.</p><p>While studies that focus only on formal businesses often report lower levels of women's participation due to systemic barriers, the inclusion of informal and mobile enterprises in this research offers a more balanced view. Previous estimates for Indonesia place women's participation at around 60 per cent, aligning closely with these findings and reinforcing the importance of creating inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystems.</p><p>The business structure in Jakarta further reflects these dynamics. Nearly half of all MSEs operate without employees, emphasising the dominance of solo enterprises. Moreover, 47 per cent of businesses are based at home, a factor closely tied to the high levels of women's ownership. Operating from home allows many women to balance income generation with caregiving responsibilities, providing a practical path to entrepreneurship within prevailing gender norms.</p><p>However, entrepreneurship in Jakarta often arises from necessity rather than opportunity. Only around half of business owners reported starting their enterprises by choice, with more than one in three citing a lack of alternative employment options as the driving factor. This necessity-driven entrepreneurship presents both opportunities and challenges for fostering sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/building-smarter-customer-centric-businesses-with-integrated-technology-in-asia-pacific-20250422/\">Building smarter, customer-centric businesses with integrated technology in Asia-Pacific</url></p><p>Despite the economic pressures that prompt many to start businesses, MSE owners in Jakarta are among the most risk-tolerant in the study. Nonetheless, a gender gap remains. Women entrepreneurs in Jakarta consistently report lower levels of risk tolerance and growth orientation compared to their male counterparts, even when education and experience are taken into account.</p><p>Furthermore, women are less likely to self-identify as entrepreneurs, suggesting that societal and systemic factors continue to shape women's aspirations and perceptions within the business landscape. This mindset disparity may pose additional hurdles for women seeking to scale their enterprises.</p><p>Financial services access and digital adoption play critical roles in the success and resilience of MSEs. Yet, in Jakarta, women MSEs face considerable challenges. While the city exhibits a gender gap in reported negative experiences with financial services-20 per cent of men compared to 12 per cent of women-this lower rate among women does not necessarily indicate greater satisfaction.</p><p>Rather, it may reflect limited engagement with financial systems or lower levels of awareness about financial rights and mechanisms for redress.</p><p>Across Jakarta's MSE landscape, a significant proportion of entrepreneurs, including women microentrepreneurs, report a limited understanding of financial products. Persistent concerns around data misuse, lack of transparency, and insufficient customer support amplify the risks associated with increased digital adoption.</p><p>Many cite complex processes as the primary reason for not taking action or raising complaints when issues arise, indicating a need for more accessible consumer protection measures.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/brands-as-forces-for-change-shaping-the-future-through-purpose-20240922/\">Brands as forces for change: Shaping the future through purpose</url></p><p>As digital technology continues to penetrate Jakarta's economy, exposure to consumer protection risks grows. The findings highlight the critical need for improved financial literacy programmes, stronger data protection frameworks, and more inclusive support services that cater to the specific needs of women MSEs.</p><p>-</p><p>Image Credit:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://unsplash.com/@fehua05?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Estefania Rainie on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-people-standing-around-a-market-byV6av5rpqk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</url></p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/women-mses-in-jakarta-face-growing-risks-amidst-digital-and-financial-shifts-report-20250429/\">Women MSEs in Jakarta face growing risks amidst digital and financial shifts: Report appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/women-mses-in-jakarta-face-growing-risks-amidst-digital-and-financial-shifts-report-20250429/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG119314546750625245252074201020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FP1-1S13-RRP9-G12K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"741\"/><timeReceived>3:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The next bound of The Ubin Project builds on the first tranche of projects that have been completed since 2014.</p><p>These updates were shared at Ubin Day 2025, which was graced by Guest-of-Honour Minister for Education and Minister-in-Charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee. He was hosted by Minister of State for National Development Alvin Tan. To celebrate the occasion and in commemoration of SG60, they joined FUN members and the community to plant 60 trees at Jalan Jelutong earlier today.</p><p>Good progress for next bound of The Ubin Project<br/><br/>The next bound of The Ubin Project, which was launched last year, is a holistic and long-term plan that charts efforts to ensure that Pulau Ubin's natural and cultural heritage continues to be conserved in partnership with the community in the coming 10 years.</p><p>In 2021, NParks, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and FUN kickstarted discussions to chart the future direction of Pulau Ubin. Focus group discussions with FUN members were carried out from 2022 to 2023, where they shared their suggestions on developing the next bound of The Ubin Project for the next decade (2024 to 2034).</p><p>NParks has been working closely with FUN to implement the proposals, and good progress has been achieved across various pillars of The Ubin Project:</p><p>1. Biodiversity Conservation</p><p>Introduction of Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin</p><p>The Cinnamon Bush Frog is a nocturnal species that mainly lives in terrestrial forests and breeds in phytotelms . It was selected for NParks' Species Recovery Programme due to its Vulnerable status in the Singapore Red Data Book.</p><p>Previously, this native rainforest species was mostly confined to the Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves and their surrounding Nature Parks. Following the successful introduction of the species into Singapore Botanic Gardens between 2017 and 2018, species recovery efforts for the Cinnamon Bush Frog were extended to Pulau Ubin.</p><p>Two batches of Cinnamon Bush Frog tadpoles, which were collected from the successfully translocated population from Singapore Botanic Gardens as well as the natural population from the Nature Reserves, have been introduced at two sites on the island where artificial phytotelm habitats were installed.</p><p>The first batch, which was introduced in June 2024, have matured into adult frogs and are living outside the artificial phytotelm habitats. This serves as an early indication that suggests Pulau Ubin may be a suitable habitat for this vulnerable species and that a population may be established outside of mainland Singapore. The second batch, which was introduced at another site on the island in March 2025, is still being monitored.</p><p>If the introduction of the Cinnamon Bush Frog into Pulau Ubin proves to be successful, this would expand its local distribution in Singapore and boost the chances of long-term survival for this vulnerable species.</p><p>Ongoing reforestation and habitat enhancement programmes</p><p>a. OneMillionTrees movement</p><p>As part of the Nature Conservation Masterplan, NParks has been carrying out reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin, and has planted more than 20,000 trees on the island since 2020.</p><p>This year, more than 3,600 trees of over 145 native species will be planted progressively across 15 sites, including Chek Jawa Wetlands, Jalan Durian, Ketam Mountain Bike Park and Sensory Trail Pond, as part of reforestation efforts on Pulau Ubin. They include Critically Endangered species such as the Paku Raja (Cycas edentata), Bayur Jantan (Pterospermum diversifolium) and Mengkudu Laut (Timonius finlaysonianus).</p><p>Such reforestation efforts will help provide more sites for food and shelter for native biodiversity on Pulau Ubin such as the Greater Mousedeer (Tragulus napu), Mainland Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), Sunda Pangolin (Manis javanica), as well as various species of pollinators such as birds, bats, bees and butterflies. At the same time, this will further the OneMillionTrees movement to plant one million more trees across Singapore and help enhance ecosystem resilience against the impacts of climate change in the longer term.</p><p>b. Shoreline restoration works</p><p>In line with NParks' broader efforts to harness nature-based solutions for enhancing coastal resilience, restoration works are currently underway to address ongoing erosion along Pulau Ubin's northern coastline and to prevent the loss of valuable coastal beach and mangrove habitats.</p><p>Preparation works are in progress to restore approximately 2.2 kilometres of the island's northern shoreline. As part of these efforts, headlands will be built near the coast to protect existing natural beach shorelines that are vulnerable to erosion and to encourage the accretion of sand over time. In addition, rock revetments will be installed beneath eroded mangrove undercuts to prevent further erosion and support the natural growth of mangroves along these structures.</p><p>2. Community, Heritage and History</p><p>FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration</p><p>As part of efforts to revitalise kampung life on Pulau Ubin and retain its heritage and rustic kampung charm, NParks has been working with FUN and the community since 2017 to progressively restore kampung houses on the island.</p><p>For more information on NParks' initiatives to enhance liveability for Ubin's community, please refer to the Media Factsheet.</p><p>In 2024, NParks announced that it would develop a Kampung House Restoration Programme, which would kick off with the restoration of five non-residential houses for community and commercial use. To do so, NParks will be establishing the FUN Workgroup for Kampung House Restoration, which will comprise several FUN members as well as stakeholders from architecture and heritage-related fields.</p><p>NParks will work closely with the workgroup to explore the adaptive reuse of the restored kampung houses. The five kampung houses to be restored under the programme are: No. 6-J, No. 25, No. 27, No. 31 and No. 425-B.</p><p>Interested parties are invited to share proposals on how these kampung houses can be restored and used.</p><p>3. Education and Research</p><p>The Ubin School initiative was rolled out in 2024 to promote environmental education and stewardship among youths through multi-disciplinary programming and experiential learning. The initiative's programmes incorporate projects under The Ubin Project, involve the Pulau Ubin community, and celebrate the island's rich natural and cultural heritage.</p><p>Tapping on citizen science for habitat enhancement efforts<br/><br/>To transform Pulau Ubin into a learning classroom set in nature, the Ubin School initiative is tapping on citizen science to support habitat enhancement efforts for Pulau Ubin. For example, in 2024 and 2025, students from Meridian Secondary School contributed to the monitoring of reforestation sites on the island by tagging the planted trees and measuring their height and girth, supporting long-term ecological data collection.</p><p>To foster greater student involvement in environmental stewardship, these efforts will also be extended to more schools such as Anchor Green Primary School and Raffles Girls' School this year. This will also complement other ongoing habitat enhancement efforts with students, such as coastal clean-ups and invasive species management.</p><p>Experiential learning through interactions with Ubin villagers</p><p>Several learning journeys conducted this year have involved members of the Pulau Ubin community. For instance, as part of their learning journey on the changing landscapes of Pulau Ubin and the relationship between the island and its villagers, students from North Vista Secondary School's Outdoor Activities Club visited a kampung house and interacted with a villager to understand the Ubin way of life. During their visit, students learnt about the cultivation of fruit trees and medicinal herbs and had the opportunity to experience drawing water from traditional wells.</p><p>Similarly, as part of Commonwealth Secondary Schools STEM Elective, which aims to nurture scientific thinking and environmental stewardship, Secondary 3 and 4 students observed the daily routines and eco-friendly practices of the island's villagers.</p><p>Furthermore, schools are encouraged to cater meals from the island's eateries, with additional time allocated for meals to allow students to visit shops and interact with villagers at the Main Village and form deeper connections with the island and its community.</p><p>Ubin as an outdoor classroom</p><p>To further position Pulau Ubin as an outdoor classroom for experiential learning, NParks has extended the Ubin School initiative to include biology student teachers from the National Institute of Education (NIE).</p><p>A pilot cohort of biology student teachers participated in the Ubin School initiative in 2024, with a second batch taking part earlier this year. Through the initiative, these student teachers are given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the logistical and pedagogical aspects of planning and conducting educational activities on Pulau Ubin to deepen students' understanding of the island's rich biodiversity, heritage and culture.</p><p>4. Nature-based Recreation</p><p>Upgrading and enhancing amenities on Pulau Ubin</p><p>NParks has completed trail improvement works on the earth tracks leading up to Puaka Hill and to Chek Jawa Wetlands from Jalan Durian, enhancing the visitor experience for those on foot or bicycles. In addition, NParks worked closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to repave roads and carry out rehabilitation works on Pulau Ubin's bridges.</p><p>To alleviate flooding during high spring tide periods, a new drain was created at the back of the Main Village earlier this year to divert rainwater away from the low-lying kampung houses. The drain beside the Wayang Stage has also been widened, improving drainage flow to the sea.</p><p>NParks will continue to work with FUN to provide and enhance amenities on Pulau Ubin, while ensuring they are in harmony with the island's natural environment. This includes ongoing efforts to upgrade and enhance interpretive displays and signage to improve wayfinding for visitors.</p><p>Shaping the future of Ubin with the community</p><p>Under the next bound of The Ubin Project, NParks has been working with FUN to engage stakeholders on charting the future direction of Pulau Ubin. To date, most villagers have been engaged through interviews to seek their views and ideas. Their feedback reflects broad support for enhancing Pulau Ubin's attractiveness while conserving its cultural heritage and natural environment.</p><p>In 2024, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) also presented the plans for the next bound of The Ubin Project as part of their Recreation Master Plan roving exhibition, to seek the public's suggestions. These suggestions will be taken into consideration as the plans for Pulau Ubin are developed.</p><p>As Singapore transforms into a City in Nature, NParks will continue to build on the first tranche of The Ubin Project and work closely with FUN to engage stakeholders on how to best preserve Pulau Ubin's rustic charm and heritage, natural environment and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p>Ubin Day 2025</p><p>Ubin Day is a culmination of Pesta Ubin, a festival organised by NParks, FUN members and the community. First held in 2002, this is the 14th edition of Ubin Day, celebrating the different facets of the island. During the two-week-long Pesta Ubin this year, close to 1,000 participants took part in over 40 activities on Pulau Ubin. Participants learnt more about Pulau Ubin's rich biodiversity and natural history through themed guided walks for photography and birdwatching, kampung heritage tours, cycling tours, mangrove kayaking and more.

There is a sizeable market for such investments today, he said, noting: \"They are highly profitable, and they are companies that you can act on as an investor.\"  </p><p> The BCG and Temasek report identified seven areas where climate change is currently having the greatest impact -- food, infrastructure, health, businesses and communities, water, energy, and biodiversity.  </p><p> The authors looked at the groups of solutions that can help to reduce the impact of climate change on these sectors, and zoomed in on specific solutions that exist or are being developed. </p><p> For example, the report pinpointed \"climate-adapted agricultural inputs\" as helping to improve the resilience of food systems. It cited specific examples of such input, such as climate-resilient seeds and crop varieties. </p><p> The investment opportunity of six \"families\" of solutions is further elaborated on in the report. </p><p> They are climate intelligence solutions such as hazard warning providers or catastrophe risk modelling, climate-resilient building materials, flood defence solutions, urban and industrial water efficiency, emergency medical products and services, and climate-adapted agricultural input.</p><p> These sectors, noted the report, are expected to grow by between 4 per cent and 15 per cent over the next five years. </p><p> Climate intelligence solutions, in particular, have the highest growth potential of around 15 per cent. Flood defence solutions have a growth projection of between 7 per cent and 10 per cent, while emergency medical products and services are expected to grow by between 8 per cent and 10 per cent. </p><p> With the impact of rising temperatures and extreme weather events intensifying, the market for climate adaptation and resilience solutions will only continue to grow, the authors noted. </p><p> \"By investing in this space, private equity firms can position themselves to capture a rapidly expanding market and contribute to global climate resilience across industries, communities and ecological systems,\" BCG and Temasek said. </p><p> \"By acting now, investors can help build a more resilient world while securing a stake in one of the defining markets of the future.\"</p><p>Singapore is moving to counter climate change. For instance, studies are ongoing to determine the best sea-level-rise protection efforts for different segments of the coastline. The Republic is cushioning food supply chain shocks by diversifying import sources and increasing the capacity of local farms. </p><p> The 11th edition of Ecosperity Week gathers business leaders, policymakers, investors and civil society to discuss how Asia's efforts to tackle climate change can be accelerated. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>With the impact of rising temperatures and extreme weather events intensifying, the market for climate adaptation and resilience solutions will only continue to grow, said the report by BCG and Temasek.

A global approach gives the world our best chance at addressing the challenges of climate change. As a small low-lying island state, climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. We are firmly committed to working within a rules-based multilateral system to maintain the momentum of global climate action to ensure Singapore's environmental sustainability and climate resilience.</p><p>2. To meet our climate goals, Singapore has developed an ambitious, forward-looking and diversified suite of measures that will reduce the carbon footprint of our economy and society. To fulfil our obligations under the Paris Agreement, we submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 10 February 2025, where we committed to reduce emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2035. This builds on our previous climate commitments and sets us on a trajectory towards net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>3. We are also partnering the global community, including other governments, corporations, academia, International Organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations, through various bilateral and plurilateral mechanisms to develop low-carbon solutions and technologies, support the energy transition, enable green financing, create green economic opportunities, and accelerate implementation through knowledge sharing and collaboration.</p><p>4. Notwithstanding the announcement by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, we continue to be open to engaging and partnering like-minded stakeholders to pursue our shared aspirations for a low-carbon, climate resilient society and economy.</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065789521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5B-BG43-S1RF-M49F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"378\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 18, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

I understand this is the first session of its kind organised globally. I would like to thank the IFRS Foundation and the International Federation of Accountants, or IFAC, for choosing Singapore as the host country for this timely initiative to help organisations prepare for sustainability reporting using the ISSB Standards.</p><p>2. To all participants, thank you for making time to attend this training. Your presence reflects the strong commitment across our ecosystem to enhance sustainability reporting capabilities.</p><p>Singapore's commitment to climate action</p><p>3. Climate change is a pressing reality. Recent research shows that the world may not meet its Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to below 1.5C by the end of this century[1]. Without timely policy action, the world could face significant consequences of rising temperatures.</p><p>4. Southeast Asia is amongst the most vulnerable regions threatened by climate change. By 2050, parts of Asia may face more severe heat waves and more extreme weather - from hurricanes to droughts[2]. These threats are real, and they will affect the way we live. Based on Singapore's 3rd National Climate Change Study, we may see temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius for up to 189 days a year by 2050[3]. That is more than half a year of very hot days. We will also become more vulnerable to fluctuations in global food supply and prices as we import more than 90% of our food[4].</p><p>5. We need to be prepared for the future and to stay resilient. That is why Singapore is committed to climate action. We recently submitted our 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, targeting to reduce emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2035[5]. We also aim to reach net-zero by 2050 and to be a climate-resilient society.</p><p>Importance of Sustainability Reporting / Climate-Related Disclosures</p><p>6. As we build climate resilience, stakeholders are also demanding companies to act on climate change. According to the 2024 Global Climate Investing Survey conducted by Robeco, 62% of global investors consider climate change as a significant or central factor in their investment policy. For investors based in Asia-Pacific, this figure is higher at 79%[6]. For companies seeking to tap onto these opportunities, climate-related disclosures can provide a competitive edge in attracting investments.</p><p>7. Besides meeting stakeholders' demands, climate-related disclosures can be a catalyst for meaningful change. When done right, these reports become powerful tools that help companies navigate risks. What makes these disclosures valuable is the accountability it creates. By measuring and disclosing emissions and plans to reduce them, companies are making commitments that translate into measurable targets and concrete actions.</p><p>8. Just as investors rely on audited financial statements, the credibility of climate-related disclosures is equally crucial. This is where an added layer of assurance on the information disclosed plays an important role as it provides stakeholders with the trust and certainty they need to make informed decisions, building market confidence. This in turn drives investment decisions, unlocking capital for sustainable initiatives.</p><p>9. As sustainability reporting preparers and assurance service providers, your role has never been more important. Every target you help to set, every report you prepare, every metric you verify - all these contribute to growing your company, as well as building a more sustainable and resilient future.</p><p>Launch of BOK</p><p>10. We understand that preparing sustainability reports is a challenging task that demands time and resources. Over the last few decades, multiple sustainability reporting standards were developed, creating a complex reporting landscape. However, the issuance of the ISSB Standards in 2023 has been a promising game-changer. It sets a global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures, consolidating various frameworks and providing that much needed consistency across the globe. It is notable that the adoption of the ISSB Standards is gaining momentum. In a recent survey conducted by the IFRS Foundation, nearly every jurisdiction surveyed - 47 out of 49 - has either already adopted the ISSB Standards or plans to adopt them[7]. With efforts to improve the interoperability of the ISSB Standards with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards and the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, the ISSB Standards will help companies streamline their sustainability reporting processes.</p><p>11. ACRA is fully committed to helping companies build capabilities in sustainability reporting. In 2023, the Green Skills Committee (GSC) was set up by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in partnership with Skills Future Singapore, to drive the development of green skills in Singapore. Under the GSC, ACRA co-chaired the Sustainability Reporting and Assurance (SRA) sub-workgroup with Enterprise Singapore and City Developments Limited to look into the skills and training needed for companies to prepare climate and sustainability reports using international standards, and for assurance providers to audit greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.</p><p>12. Our industry engagements revealed a gap in the market - professionals need more than just basic sustainability courses. They need advanced, practical training to develop the specialist skills required to fully understand and apply the relevant sustainability reporting and assurance standards.</p><p>13. Today, I am pleased to announce the launch of ACRA's Sustainability Reporting Body of Knowledge, or SR BOK. This document aims to guide training providers in designing specialist training programmes for professionals in the sustainability reporting field. The BOK outlines the key knowledge areas required for sustainability reporting, covering the relevant ISSB Standards as well as reporting requirements under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Each key knowledge area includes learning objectives, learning outcomes, and resources to help training providers develop their curriculum and learning materials.</p><p>14. The BOK has been validated by more than 50 key industry stakeholders. They include members of the Sustainability Reporting and Assurance sub-workgroup, company preparers, assurance providers, professional bodies, Institutes of Higher Learning and private training providers. Many of you are here today, and I would like to express our appreciation for your valuable input in shaping this initiative.</p><p>15. Following the launch of the BOK, our next step would be to work with training providers to align their existing programmes or new programmes with the BOK. We are also developing a similar BOK for sustainability assurance. With the BOK, training providers would be able to develop high quality programmes that not only prepare professionals for sustainability reporting but also meet the increasing market demands.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>16. The quality of sustainability reporting ultimately depends on the capabilities of the people behind it. Whether you're a preparer, an assurance provider, or a training provider, each of you play a vital role in this ecosystem. With your commitment and our collective efforts, we can build a strong foundation for high-quality sustainability reporting in Singapore.</p><p>17. Thank you, and I wish you a fruitful training session ahead.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] World Meteorological Organization.

We're living in a time of extreme volatility-geopolitically, climatically, and technologically. Yet, in that volatility lies opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For decades, supply chains were a backend function-something startups outsourced, optimised, or ignored. But this assumption no longer holds. In today's world, supply chains aren't just operational-they're strategic, visible, and investible. They define your startup's resilience, sustainability, and ultimately, its valuation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the Fosus Asia Pacific Supply Chain Sustainability Summit 2025, I presented why global trade is shifting under the weight of multipolarity, climate change, and AI-driven digitalisation. For Southeast Asian founders, these aren't distant megatrends. They're the tectonic forces shaping how you build, scale, and exit in this decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Through this article, I hope to shine light on the opportunities startups and founders like yourself can capture in this geopolitically volatile world.</p><p>Multipolarity: Startups can't be neutral in a fragmenting trade world</p><p>In a multipolar world, neutrality is a myth. The post-Cold War era of globalism, led by US-dominated institutions like the WTO, is fracturing. Regional blocs are replacing multilateral consensus.</p><p>BRICS+ now includes not just Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, but also Indonesia, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia-emerging as a counterweight to the G7.</p><p>The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) ties together ASEAN with China, Japan, and Australia, unlocking intra-Asian growth.</p><p>The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), led by the US, focuses on digital standards and clean economy norms.</p><p>For SEA startups exporting hardware, electronics, or even food products-this fragmentation means regulatory balkanisation. You'll face divergent data privacy rules, compliance requirements, and tariff barriers based on which markets or investors you align with.</p><p>To give an example, if your supply chain touches Taiwan, Singapore, India, and Europe-you're no longer just managing logistics. You're navigating a complex geopolitical chessboard. And you need to be good at it.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/rethinking-supply-chains-and-trade-in-southeast-asia-amid-global-tariffs-20250508/\">Rethinking supply chains and trade in Southeast Asia amid global tariffs</url></p><p>Trade is a weapon, and you're probably in the crossfire</p><p>Startups relying on AI chips, electric vehicle parts, or rare earths need to know this: access to critical resources is now political.</p><p>In December 2023, China banned the export of rare earth extraction technologies, reinforcing its grip on materials that power EVs, drones, and smartphones.</p><p>In early 2025, the US expanded AI chip export controls, placing Southeast Asian nations into 'tiered compliance categories' that limit access to cutting-edge compute for data centres and LLMs.</p><p>Ukraine peace talks now include rare earths in the negotiation table, which the long-awaited deal on the U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund was recently signed in May 2025.</p><p>Grain shipments out of Ukraine are conditional.</p><p>LNG is rerouted via Singapore due to energy realignments in Europe.</p><p>These aren't abstract events. They will shape your cost of goods sold, your product timelines, and whether your next big AI product even gets the compute power it needs.</p><p>So ask yourself: is your startup's tech stack or component source geopolitically vulnerable?</p><p>Climate change will break your supply chain (or rebuild it smarter)</p><p>The IPCC's 2023 report made clear: global infrastructure-especially its ports and coastlines-is highly vulnerable to extreme weather.</p><p>Take the Panama Canal drought in 2023. El Ni\u00f1o triggered severe water shortages, reducing ship capacity from 50 feet to 44 feet. Vessels had to offload cargo. Shipping delays stretched for weeks. Costs ballooned-groceries, parts, everything.</p><p>If you're a founder building a physical product in the SEA region, and you don't have climate disruption contingencies-you're already behind.</p><p>But here's the upside: climate change is also opening up new frontiers.</p><p>Arctic trade routes are becoming navigable, slashing 30-40 per cent off shipping time between Asia and Europe.</p><p>Countries like Russia are investing in Arctic infrastructure. The Northern Sea Route could become the next BRI. Who will build the predictive shipping platforms, port automation systems, and insurance products for these new lanes? That's startup territory.</p><p>Sustainability isn't just policy-it's a funding advantage</p><p>Climate regulation is no longer a regulatory burden. It's a market signal and a capital attractor.</p><p>The IMO's carbon reduction targets and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) mean your startup needs a carbon data story.</p><p>If you're in manufacturing, logistics, or agri-tech, expect Scope 3 emission disclosures to be part of tender requirements, partnerships, and funding due diligence.</p><p>Green shipping corridors like Singapore-Rotterdam are leading the way in scaling zero-emission shipping, with clear investor interest.</p><p>If your startup contributes to carbon tracking, waste-to-value loops, or port-side optimisation, you're building not just a business-you're de-risking national infrastructure. Investors are watching.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/enhancing-cyber-supply-chain-resilience-a-vision-for-singapore-20230914/\">Enhancing cyber supply chain resilience: A vision for Singapore</url></p><p>AI and digitalisation: The supply chain itself is becoming smart</p><p>If you think AI is just for apps, think again. It's transforming the physical layer of how trade works.</p><p>77 per cent of WEF Lighthouse Factories now use analytical AI for predictive maintenance and logistics optimisation.</p><p>Generative AI is already being used to automate procurement workflows, simulate design specs, and validate manufacturing feasibility.</p><p>Midea in China, for instance, slashed product design lead times by 45 per cent using an in-house PLM platform. That's not a SaaS unicorn-that's what smart manufacturing looks like in 2025.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xiaomi's Su7 EV factory has gone fully 'dark'-718,000 sqm of space, 700 robots, only 30 humans. Car produced every 76 seconds.</p><p>The opportunity? Founders building for factory intelligence, robotics coordination, predictive quality control, or blockchain-tracked ESG compliance are sitting on untapped verticals.</p><p>DAOs, tokenised trade, and the borderless supply chain</p><p>Enter the next frontier: Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs).</p><p>Imagine a smart contract-based procurement system that doesn't rely on a central platform-but executes payments, delivery terms, and ESG verification automatically. With blockchain as a backbone, carbon data becomes immutable. Trade financing becomes instantaneous. Supplier compliance is no longer manually audited-it's verified on-chain.</p><p>Sounds fringe? Ethereum did it. Supply chains will do it next.</p><p>And if you're building infrastructure for DAOs, smart contract standards, or cross-border digital trust layers-you're not early. You're right on time.</p><p>To conclude: In 2025, supply chains are a founder's edge</p><p>At the Fosus Summit, I said that supply chains are no longer invisible-they're now geopolitical chess pieces, climate resilience testbeds, and digital battlegrounds.</p><p>Founders who master this space-who understand that the new battlegrounds of commerce are not only price and product but route, regulation, and resilience-will lead the next generation of SEA unicorns.</p><p>And investors: if your thesis doesn't include supply chain resilience, digital trade infrastructure, or decarbonisation platforms, you may be underestimating where the next breakout opportunity will come from.</p><p>Supply chains and geopolitics are no longer in the back office anymore.

But the longer we delay, the more disorderly the eventual transition will be.</p><p>Climate action will be critical in Asia - for two reasons.</p><p>First, Asia is where the fight against climate change will be won or lost.</p><p>*Asia accounts for 50% of global emissions.</p><p>*90% of the world's future growth in energy demand will come from Asia.</p><p>*More than 150 million people in Asia still lack access to electricity.</p><p>*Without decarbonising Asia, the world will not reach net zero.</p><p>Second, Asia will suffer the most from climate change - lives and livelihoods.</p><p>*By 2080, over 1 billion people in South and Southeast Asia could be affected by extreme heat.</p><p>*Asia's climate-induced losses could reach about 40% of GDP by 2100.</p><p>Yet, Asia remains severely underfunded to drive decarbonisation and build climate resilience.</p><p>*Asia's funding gap for climate mitigation and adaptation stands at over 800 billion US dollars annually.</p><p>*Public capital is willing but insufficient. Private capital is ample but unwilling to commit in a big way because the risks are too high.</p><p>This is a time for philanthropy to play a larger role in driving climate action in Asia.</p><p>*A partnership across public, private, and philanthropic capital can help to effectively plugs the gaps in Asia's climate finance.</p><p>But the climate philanthropic space remains at a nascent stage.</p><p>*Globally, less than 2% of philanthropic giving goes towards preventing climate change. Of this, only 12% goes to Asia, despite the region's outsized needs.</p><p>*When engaging philanthropies, I often hear that they are unsure where to direct their resources in the climate space.</p><p>Let me outline three areas where I think philanthropic capital can support climate action.</p><p>*Crowding in private capital</p><p>*Enabling public goods</p><p>*Ensuring just transition</p><p>First, crowding in private capital for decarbonisation projects.</p><p>*Decarbonisation projects are often capital-intensive and require large upfront investments.</p><p>*This goes beyond the capacity of any single stakeholder.</p><p>Philanthropies can leverage innovative funding instruments such as blended finance to maximise the impact of their contributions.</p><p>*The premise of blended finance is to use concessional capital to de-risk and crowd in commercial capital.</p><p>*This concessional layer - coming from public and philanthropic capital - accepts first-loss and lower returns, thereby catalysing significantly more private capital.</p><p>*Compared to direct grants, blended finance allows philanthropies to amplify the impact of their giving.</p><p>Let me make a pitch for Singapore's FAST-P or Financing Asia's Transition Partnership.</p><p>*FAST-P is a blended finance platform to support green and transition projects in Asia - from phasing out coal and strengthening grid infrastructure to electrifying transportation and decarbonising industrial processes.</p><p>*The Singapore Government has pledged 500 million US dollars as concessional capital to be matched dollar for dollar by other sources of concessional capital.</p><p>*The aim is to use this 1 billion dollar base of concessional capital to crowd in four times more private capital for a total fund size of 5 billion US dollars.</p><p>*FAST-P has already attracted philanthropic funds from partners such as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, the Asian Development Bank, and Allied Climate Partners.</p><p>Second, enabling public goods for climate action</p><p>*Many parts of Southeast Asia lack sufficient climate data, hindering mitigation and adaptation efforts.</p><p>*Philanthropies can fund data collection, enhance access, and build local capacity in data analysis.</p><p>*Let me share three specific examples where philanthropies can help.</p><p>The Global Mitigation Potential Atlas is a digital tool which identifies cost-effective emissions reduction opportunities.</p><p>*Developed by an international consortium of researchers and piloted in nine Southeast Asian countries, it is now being expanded to the US, China and Australia.</p><p>*Workshops have been conducted for officials in Southeast Asia on using this tool to help develop actionable decarbonisation policies.</p><p>The Climate Action Data Trust is a digital platform which enhances transparency in carbon markets.</p><p>*Established by Singapore, the World Bank, and the International Emissions Trading Association, the platform aggregates and standardises carbon credit data, covering 85% of all credits issued globally.</p><p>The Cambodia-Mekong Delta Aquifer Project uses science-based assessments to address sustainability challenges in the Lower Mekong Basin.</p><p>*Funded by the Global Environment Facility, this project aims to enhance resilience in agriculture, drinking water and biodiversity for millions in Cambodia and Vietnam.</p><p>*Philanthropies are in a good position to work with the scientific community and national authorities on transboundary climate risk assessments that often fall through the cracks.</p><p>Third, ensuring a just transition for communities.</p><p>The transition to a low-carbon economy will disrupt communities and livelihoods.</p><p>*Decarbonisation entails changes in long-standing economic activities - be it changing agricultural practices or phasing out fossil fuel power generation.</p><p>*We need to re-skill workers and empower communities to ensure they are able to navigate the transition.</p><p>*Philanthropies are well-placed to support just transition given their experience working directly with communities.</p><p>*Let me share two examples of just transition.</p><p>*The Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory seeks to decarbonise rice cultivation while securing the livelihoods of smallholder farmers by improving food security.</p><p>*The Coal-to-Clean Credits Initiative has stipulated that 2% of the revenues from carbon credits generated by the early phase-out of coal should go into redeploying displaced coal workers to new jobs.</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Amid the disruptions entailed by the transition to a lower carbon world, we need philanthropy to help communities successfully navigate the change.</p><p>Amid the growing risks to lives and livelihoods from the climate crisis, we need philanthropy to help communities adapt and thrive.</p><p>Philanthropy cannot do all this alone. Governments must play their part. The business community and private capital must step up.</p><p>But philanthropy can be the catalyst to forge new partnerships, to enable the collective action necessary to safeguard the future of our planet and its people.</p><p>The Greek root of the word philanthropy means \"love for humanity\".</p><p>And this is what philanthropy brings to the table: where there is division and fragmentation, to be a force for the collective good of humanity.</p><p>Source: National Climate Change Secretariat,Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066269595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FSD-GVM3-SG6P-F118-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1326\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 5, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp;

In July alone, extreme weather \u2014 primarily heavy rains and floods \u2014 caused 76.85 billion RMB (US$10.1 billion) in economic losses, affecting over 26.4 million people, displacing 1.1 million and damaging thousands of homes.</p><p>                        These staggering impacts highlight China\u2019s vulnerability to climate change, with rising coastal flooding, urban waterlogging, droughts and heavy rainfall intensifying climate risks nationwide. Notably, recent extremes \u2014 including the highest national temperature on record and Beijing receiving 60% of its annual rainfall in just 83 hours \u2014 demonstrate the growing threat. The economic toll is substantial, with flooding alone costing about 1% of China\u2019s gross domestic product annually.</p><p>                        Projections paint an even more alarming picture. By the end of the century, heatwaves could triple, and water scarcity could worsen, deepening regional disparities. Economic losses are expected to soar, with a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase potentially leading to US$112 billion in direct flooding-related losses \u2014 four times the level seen between 2006-2018. Coastal cities like Shanghai face additional risks from extreme high tides. These projections highlight the pressing need for China to prioritise climate resilience and adaptation as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe.</p><p>                        This file photo taken on 17 September 2024 shows buildings silhouetted as clouds drift past the sun in Shanghai.</p><p>                        In response to growing concerns over climate change, Beijing has recognised the urgent need for effective adaptation strategies to protect infrastructure and maintain the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s legitimacy. This approach is influenced by Mao Zedong\u2019s belief that \u201cman must conquer nature\u201d, and has led to a focus on climate resilience and infrastructure in national policies, driven by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts.</p><p>                        Managing extreme weather has long been tied to political legitimacy in China. Historically, failures in this area \u2014 particularly flooding \u2014 have been seen as signs of a loss of authority, linked to the ancient concept of the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d. This practice dates back more than 4,000 years, to Yu the Great of the Xia dynasty, who is said to have tamed the Yellow River.</p><p>                        \u2018Sponge city\u2019: mismanagement impacting effectiveness</p><p>                        Challenges lie ahead. One of the biggest concerns being the potentially high costs of climate adaptation projects. The \u201csponge city\u201d concept (\u6d77\u7ef5\u57ce\u5e02), introduced in 2015 in Chinese cities to manage stormwater through permeable surfaces and green infrastructure, exemplifies these challenges. </p><p>                        Although the central government initially allocated 400-600 million RMB per city involved in the 16-city pilot infrastructure-driven programme, total spending on sponge city projects by 2017 had surpassed US$12 billion, with Beijing covering only 15-20% of the costs. The remainder is shouldered by local governments and the private sector.\u00a0</p><p>                        ... many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. \u2014 Professor Kongjian Yu, Dean, College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University</p><p>                        Despite over 1 trillion RMB (US$140 billion) being invested by cities between 2016-2020, these projects have struggled to cope with severe flooding, highlighting concerns about their effectiveness. Notably, in 2021, \u201chistorically rare\u201d rainfall led to devastating floods in Zhengzhou, affecting over 14 million people, causing 398 deaths and 53.2 billion RMB (US$8 billion) in economic losses. </p><p>                        However, some critics have argued that the sponge city design, intended to handle one-in-30-year rainfall, proved inadequate in the face of such extremes. Media reports at the time suggested that sponge city infrastructure can handle a maximum of 200 millimetres (mm) of rain per day. </p><p>                        A view of Zhengzhou in Henan province, 12 December 2024.</p><p>                        In contrast, Zhengzhou saw rainfall in excess of 200 mm in just one hour. Others note that mismanagement by local officials, who ignored early flood warnings, exacerbated the crisis. </p><p>                        Professor Kongjian Yu, dean of the College of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture, Peking University, and a champion of the sponge city concept, said in a recent interview that the fact that cities are flooding shows that they are not creating enough sponge-like infrastructure. From his perspective, many cities started using the term \u201csponge city\u201d to obtain central government funding, but did not actually invest enough into adequate suitable infrastructure. </p><p>                        Further complicating the situation, local governments already burdened by debt may struggle to prioritise such expensive and long-term climate adaptation projects. In the face of a national economic slowdown, many localities are resorting to asset liquidation to address immediate revenue shortfalls in a process described as \u201csmashing iron pots and selling the steel\u201d. This short-term focus risks undermining long-term climate resilience, as local authorities may prioritise quick fixes over necessary investments in sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>                        Disconnect between Beijing and local governments and among regions</p><p>                        As the central government pushes forward with projects aimed at mitigating climate impacts, the widening gap between high-level planning and on-the-ground implementation becomes increasingly apparent, raising concerns about the sustainability and effectiveness of these efforts in addressing climate resilience in cities. Without a unified approach, the effectiveness of China\u2019s climate adaptation efforts will remain in question.</p><p>                        ... China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        Completed in 1957, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was the first major bridge built over the Yangtze river.</p><p>                        The dangers of fragmented policy and poor coordination between municipalities and regional governments, particularly in flood-prone areas, must be considered too. Recent studies have highlighted this issue, using the example of China\u2019s Yangtze and Pearl River Deltas where the lack of comprehensive, delta-wide plans has led to a fragmented approach to disaster management. Without unified land zoning and prioritised investments across the region, disaster response remains disjointed.\u00a0</p><p>                        The consequences of this were seen notably, in the aftermath of the 2023 Beijing floods. For instance, netizens pointed out that government bodies often look after their own jurisdiction, responding in isolation rather than through coordinated regional efforts. In their haste to manage the immediate crisis, efforts to divert floodwaters upstream only worsened conditions in downstream areas.</p><p>                        ... the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        Major overhaul</p><p>                        In the face of the challenging situation, the Chinese government is likely to intensify its efforts to enhance climate resilience in the coming years. Recognising the urgent need for coordinated action, Beijing aims to strengthen local governments\u2019 capacity to address climate change by integrating adaptation strategies into urban planning and infrastructure development.\u00a0</p><p>                        This photo taken on 29 June 2024 shows an aerial view of flooded buildings after a flood peak on the Wuyang river at Qiandongnan, in China\u2019s southwest Guizhou province.</p><p>                        In line with this, the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (2022\u20132035) lays out a framework for resilience, emphasising improved weather monitoring, and bolstered agricultural, water, and urban infrastructure systems. However, the successful implementation of this strategy will require significant investment, coordination across government departments, and a shift in how policies are executed at the local level.</p><p>                        As extreme weather intensifies, China is prioritising disaster prevention and community preparedness but bridging the gap between ambitious plans and on-the-ground implementation is crucial for long-term climate resilience.</p><p>                        Related: Storing sunshine: How northwest China is making renewable energy reliable | China\u2019s environmental focus in South China Sea: Questionable motivations | China\u2019s booming nuclear sector lobbies for green vouchers to ensure profits</p><p>                        The photo taken on 6 July 2024 shows an aerial view of a partially submerged Guanyin temple in floodwaters in the swollen Yangtze River in Ezhou, central China\u2019s Hubei province.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-5486700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DPC-RXH3-RS5N-106F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Minister for National Development Chee Hong Tat launched the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Draft Master Plan 2025 (DMP2025) Exhibition this morning - a showcase of Singapore's land use development blueprint for the next 10 to 15 years. The DMP2025 is shaped through URA's most extensive public engagement exercise to date. As Singapore celebrates 60 years of independence (SG60), DMP2025 presents a milestone in our development as a city-state. It is an opportunity to reflect on our shared journey as a nation and collective citizenship in overcoming challenges and shaping a future together.</p><p>2. The DMP2025 showcases islandwide land use plans and strategies for more inclusive, accessible homes and neighbourhoods; refreshed business nodes and vibrant workspaces; and a more resilient Singapore that is better able to respond to economic, social and climate challenges in the years to come. Together, these proposals aim to create a more liveable, inclusive and endearing Singapore, by offering Singaporeans from all walks of life with more choices for living, working and leisure, as well as a deepened sense of identity and place.</p><p>3. Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer, URA, said \"Over the past two years, we have engaged Singaporeans and communities across generations and backgrounds to better understand their aspirations. Their feedback has helped to shape a more holistic plan that reflects the priorities and concerns of our people, while addressing key challenges such as climate change and an ageing population. We thank all who have contributed to shaping the next chapter of Singapore's story. URA will continue working closely with the community to ensure that the Master Plan remains a living blueprint, rooted in our shared values and responsive to Singapore's evolving needs.\"</p><p>Building our future, together</p><p>4. Singapore's long-term and integrated planning approach is underpinned by two key frameworks: the Long-Term Plan, which sets strategic directions for the next 50 years and beyond; and the Master Plan, reviewed every five years, which translates these strategies into detailed land use proposals. The DMP2025 builds on the strategies developed in the last Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) in 2022, translating them into detailed land use plans that will guide Singapore's physical transformation over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>5. Since October 2023, URA has engaged almost 220,000 people for their feedback on development plans of varying scales in the DMP2025, shaped around four themes: (i) Shaping A Happy Healthy City; (ii) Enabling Sustainable Growth; (iii) Strengthening Urban Resilience and; (iv) Stewarding Nature and Heritage. Through multiple platforms, including exhibitions, dialogues, focus group discussions and surveys, URA carried out its most extensive public engagement effort to date, to ensure that the DMP2025 balances diverse priorities at the national, community and individual levels.</p><p>6. See Annex A [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32a.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32a.pdf</url>] for more information about the DMP2025 and engagement journey.</p><p>(I) Shaping a Happy Healthy City: Building stronger communities and catering to diverse aspirations</p><p>7. The DMP2025 presents plans for a more vibrant and inclusive city where everyone can have better access to essential services, lead more active lifestyles and move around with ease. A variety of housing options will be introduced islandwide to cater to different needs, ages and backgrounds. They will enable more Singaporeans to benefit from convenient access to transport connectivity and a good range of amenities. At the same time, the DMP2025 plans will also create endearing neighbourhoods with lively public spaces, pedestrianised streets and cycling connections that support social bonding, ageing-in-place, wellness and active lifestyles. Each neighbourhood will also be shaped with a distinctive identity to anchor residents' sense of place.</p><p>8.  In addition to the plans for new neighbourhoods in more central locations at Pearl's Hill, Marina South, Bukit Timah Turf City, the former Keppel Golf Course site and Mount Pleasant that URA showcased at the 'My City, My Home' exhibition in November 2023, the DMP2025 outlines plans for more new homes and neighbourhoods across the island.</p><p>New neighbourhoods for every need and lifestyle</p><p>9. A mix of public and private homes, along with amenities will be introduced at Dover-Medway along Dover Road in the Greater one-north area. The new Dover-Medway neighbourhood will support residents who wish to stay close to work and learning spaces in the knowledge hub. It is home to leading technology, media and biomedical firms and Institutes of Higher Learning.</p><p>10. Up in the north at Kranji, the site occupied by the former Singapore Racecourse will be redeveloped into a new housing estate that capitalises on its rustic surroundings to blend recreation and leisure attractions with daily living. After the relocation of existing uses from 2028, the Sembawang Shipyard area will be progressively transformed into a distinctive mixed-use waterfront district where the design of the future housing estate will take into consideration the area's coastal and maritime character.</p><p>11. Following the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base from the 2030s onwards, the site and its surrounding areas will gradually undergo a major transformation into a community-centric and future-ready town. It will feature an extensive network of green and blue spaces, well-connected mobility options and a distinct aviation character.</p><p>12. The development of the new neighbourhoods will be paced out, to allow for flexibility to review and adjust plans regularly in tandem with evolving needs and trends. At the same time, existing towns such as Pasir Ris and Yishun will also be rejuvenated with new homes and amenities, adding to the range of housing options for different preferences and needs.</p><p>13. There will also be more opportunities to live in and near the city centre, with a new Newton neighbourhood planned next to the Newton MRT station. Comprising three clusters at Newton Circus, Scotts Road and Monk's Hill, the neighbourhood will be shaped as a vibrant mixed-use 'urban village' with new homes set amidst greenery. At the doorsteps of Orchard Road, the new Paterson neighbourhood will be transformed into a bustling mixed-use hub with new residential developments, shops and public spaces.</p><p>14.In addition to planning for inclusive homes and neighbourhoods that cater to residents of all ages and abilities, we will provide more assisted living options and active ageing centres, to support seniors in ageing actively and independently across more neighbourhoods. This includes Community Care Apartments (CCA), which is a public assisted living typology jointly developed by MND, MOH and HDB, that pairs senior-friendly housing with on-site social activities and care services. Private assisted living apartments such as the upcoming Parry Avenue project will also present other options for senior-friendly homes with care services and wellness amenities.</p><p>Bringing recreation and amenities closer to all</p><p>15. Planning for recreational spaces to support residents' well-being and a good quality living environment has always been a priority. At the roving exhibitions for the Recreation Master Plan from April to September 2024, URA received feedback from more than 66,000 people on their recreational aspirations. In response to feedback for more affordable and inclusive recreational options near homes as well as spaces that support wellness and active lifestyles, URA will plan for better access to recreational spaces and amenities such as sports facilities, retail and community spaces, in addition to every household being a 10-minute walk from a park.</p><p>16. The DMP2025 provides for new integrated community hubs in several towns, including proposed hubs in Woodlands, Yio Chu Kang and Sengkang. Conveniently located near transport nodes, these integrated community hubs will bring together sports, recreational, healthcare and retail facilities under one roof to better serve residents' needs. Residents can also look forward to six new Sport-In-Precinct (SIP) projects islandwide that are currently being built in Choa Chu Kang, Keat Hong, Ulu Pandan, Whampoa, Tampines North and Pasir Ris East, with more being studied by agencies.</p><p>17. Besides integrating recreational facilities into new neighbourhoods, we are working with agencies to activate underutilised areas such as spaces below MRT viaducts and the rooftops of HDB multi-storey car parks for social and recreational activities. Examples include the Bukit Gombak MRT viaduct that has been turned into a space for community art installation, and an upcoming SIP facility atop the multi-storey car park of 19A Dover Crescent.</p><p>More efficient, greener journeys</p><p>18. Singapore is on track to have 8 in 10 households be within a 10-minute walk from a train station by the 2030s, as part of the national objective to enhance connectivity while reducing car dependency. Additionally, our cycling network will be expanded to around 1,300km by 2030 to encourage healthier and greener journeys. In support of the goal of shaping Singapore as a more connected city for walking and cycling, the DMP2025 showcases plans for a new pedestrian bridge connecting Marina Centre and Bay East Garden, providing pedestrians and cyclists with a more direct connection between the city and the East Coast along the Round Island Route by 2029.</p><p>19. See Annex B [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32b.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32b.pdf</url>] for more details of the initiatives under 'Shaping a Happy Healthy City'.</p><p>(II) Enabling Sustainable Growth: Sustaining a thriving, open economy to meet evolving needs of our nation, businesses and workers</p><p>Strengthening economic gateways and business nodes</p><p>20. URA's decentralisation strategy aims at sustaining a competitive and open economy for Singapore while creating vibrant workspaces and opportunities across the island for Singaporeans to thrive. Since decentralisation commenced in the early-1990s, we have progressively established a hierarchy of economic gateways and business nodes islandwide, bringing jobs and amenities closer to homes, while spreading transport flows and reducing the need to travel to the city centre. The focus of the DMP2025 is to continue driving Singapore's economic growth by strengthening our economic gateways and business nodes, rejuvenating key precincts, and supporting innovation.</p><p>21. The Northern, Eastern and Western Gateways will continue to grow as important economic hubs. Upcoming developments in Woodlands Regional Centre will capitalise on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone and upcoming Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link, which is targeted to be ready by end-2026. The opening of Changi Airport Terminal 5 in the mid-2030s will reinforce Singapore's position as a global aviation hub, the PSA Supply Chain Hub and Tuas Port, scheduled to be completed in 2027 and 2040s respectively, will enhance Singapore's logistics capabilities and port capacity.</p><p>22. Agencies will embark on plans to redevelop Town Centres to support decentralisation efforts. Bishan Sub-Regional Centre for example, will undergo rejuvenation with the introduction of new workplaces, amenities, and pedestrian-friendly streets. Agencies are studying the potential of transforming Bishan Place into a landscaped pedestrian mall as well as plans for a new polyclinic and potential hawker centre that could be integrated with an upgraded bus interchange. In addition, a few government agencies are currently exploring the feasibility of relocating their offices here to jumpstart the development of this business node.</p><p>Revitalising our city centre</p><p>23. Our city centre remains a vital destination for business, tourism and culture, anchoring Singapore's status as a global hub. Rejuvenation plans are underway for our Orchard and Downtown areas. This includes plans to create a new destination park in the heart of the city by merging Istana Park and Dhoby Ghaut Green with a 500-metre stretch of Orchard Road. In addition, an elevated pedestrian link bridge between Dhoby Ghaut Green and Fort Canning Park is also being planned. When implemented, these enhancements will create a refreshed and well-connected green space offering visitors a family-friendly area to gather in the city centre.</p><p>24. Over at Marina Bay, new attractions will be introduced to boost our city's capacity to host international events in a vibrant environment for locals, businesses and leisure travellers alike. This includes a planned wellness destination and recreational spaces in the bay such as NS Square and PAssion Wave Outpost @ Bayfront, as well as the expansion of Marina Bay Sands. These efforts will further enhance Marina Bay as an inclusive and welcoming destination.</p><p>25.

As part of efforts to involve the public in shaping vibrant and endearing workspaces for the future, JTC and URA launched the \"Reimagining Former Jurong Bird Park and Jurong Hill\" ideas competition in October 2024 to seek innovative ideas that reimagine the site for both work and play. The DMP2025 has unveiled the winners of the ideas competition, who envisioned the area as a mixed-use precinct that blends work and leisure and is anchored by the site's unique terrain and industrial identity. This complements the proposed conservation of Jurong Hill Tower, as a symbol of Singapore's industrial transformation since independence. Agencies will distil suitable ideas and concepts into planning and design principles to guide the site's future redevelopment and uses.</p><p>27. See Annex D [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32d.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32d.pdf</url>] for more details of winning submissions of the ideas competition.</p><p>(III) Strengthening Urban Resilience: Safeguarding a liveable future by protecting against effects of climate change and leveraging innovative solutions to optimise land</p><p>28. The DMP2025 outlines strategies to address the impact of climate change, such as rising temperatures and sea level rise, and presents further efforts in optimising land use both above and below ground. These initiatives will continue to be expanded and refined to ensure that Singapore remains liveable and adaptable in the face of future challenges, alongside ongoing efforts to redevelop the city in response to the changing needs of our people.</p><p>Leveraging technology to protect against climate change</p><p>29. With Singapore's mean temperature projected to rise significantly by 2100 due to climate change, efforts are underway to design a cooler and more comfortable urban environment, even as we continue to develop. Environmental modelling tools are being developed in collaboration with local universities to facilitate more data-driven and scenario-based urban planning. These include digital technology to simulate wind and heat conditions, helping us create more climate-sensitive urban design, which contribute towards a more comfortable environment for precincts.</p><p>Progressing with plans for 'Long Island'</p><p>30. With rising sea levels posing a critical threat, Singapore is advancing plans for 'Long Island' - an integrated solution along the East Coast that will meet multiple national objectives. Beyond coastal protection, water and flood resilience, 'Long Island' will create land for future needs and recreational opportunities. Over 3,000 members of the public and stakeholders have contributed their ideas and feedback for this long-term project, and technical studies are currently ongoing to explore potential engineering and nature-based solutions that could be introduced, amongst others.</p><p>Exploring further possibilities for underground space</p><p>31. We will continue to tap on our underground space to free up valuable surface space for people and build robust infrastructure to support long-term growth. Significant progress has already been made over the past few decades, with underground infrastructure such as MRT tunnels, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System and Jurong Rock Caverns helping to free up valuable surface land, while supporting the development of infrastructure.</p><p>32.As part of the DMP2025, we will expand the strategic use of underground space, including exploring deep caverns at sites like Gali Batu for storage of construction aggregate, while identifying more possibilities for new underground developments through research and capability-building to enhance technical expertise in this field.</p><p>33. See Annex E [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32e.pdf</url>] for more details of the initiatives under 'Strengthen Urban Resilience'</p><p>(IV) Stewarding Nature and Heritage: Anchoring our sense of belonging and enhancing our natural capital</p><p>34. Striking a balance between social, economic and environmental considerations remains a key tenet of the DMP2025. Beyond enhancing our heritage spaces, we will leverage innovative approaches to ensure that Singapore continues to develop sensitively as a City in Nature.</p><p>A greener city</p><p>35. Our vision towards becoming a City in Nature has progressed steadily. Since 2021, 130 ha of new parks have been added and our Park Connector Network has grown to about 390km. Over the next five years, we will target to implement more than 25 new parks and over 50km of park connectors. The upcoming Kranji Nature Corridor for instance, will strengthen ecological connectivity in the northern region of the island between the Mandai Mangrove and Mudflat Nature Park and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and provide new nature-based recreation opportunities for all.</p><p>36. See Annex F [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32f.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32f.pdf</url>] for more details of the new Kranji Nature Corridor.</p><p>Celebrating our built heritage and enhancing familiar places</p><p>37. Building on the Heritage &amp; Identity Plan conceptualised in the last LTPR, URA has engaged stakeholders over the past year to develop a new thematic narrative framework covering key pillars of Singapore's history and development as an independent nation: Economy, Housing, Social and Defence. The framework aims to illustrate the roles that our built heritage plays in charting Singapore's more recent history, and guides strategies to recall heritage as Singapore continues to develop, whether through adaptive reuse of selected buildings, or enhancing the characters of areas through sensitive urban design and placemaking initiatives. Agencies will continue to review the feasibility of adapting these buildings for new uses to serve our needs as well as integrate them with future developments to make them more accessible to the public.</p><p>38. In addition to the five sites and buildings1 which were announced in May 2025 to be proposed for conservation as part of the DMP2025, URA has further proposed conserving the NatSteel Steel Pavilion, the former Pasir Panjang English School as well as selected buildings at Bukit Timah Turf City.</p><p>39. See Annex G [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2025/Jun/pr25-32g.pdf</url>] for more details of the new thematic narrative framework and buildings proposed for conservation.</p><p>40. Apart from conservation, we will also pursue other ways of recalling heritage to strengthen our sense of identity. URA has engaged over 2,300 residents and stakeholders to co-create proposals to enhance the three Identity Corridors2 of Historic East, Kallang River and Inner Ring.</p><p>41. Following public and communities' feedback and ideas, URA has identified three new identity nodes at Siglap, Moonstone Lane Estate, and Newton. They add to the 18 existing identity nodes which URA previously identified based on their distinctive local character and identity and progressively enhanced over the years. The extensive public consultations have also led to plans to enliven the Identity Corridors with more inclusive spaces, including a new pedestrian mall at Katong and new parks along Kallang River, such as at the Moonstone-Bendemeer and Potong Pasir-St Andrew's areas.</p><p>42. See Annex H [PDF, 153kb] for more details of the Identity Corridors and upcoming initiatives.</p><p>Be part of the DMP2025: Peek into the plans for tomorrow and visit the islandwide DMP2025 Exhibition</p><p>43. URA invites the public to visit the DMP2025 Exhibition to learn about the plans for Singapore and their neighbourhoods. The exhibition will be held at The URA Centre Atrium at 45 Maxwell Road from 25 Jun 2025 to 29 Nov 2025.

The country also has similar pacts with Bhutan, Ghana and Papua New Guinea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Under the Paris Agreement, countries can buy carbon credits generated in other jurisdictions to meet domestic climate targets. </p><p> One carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that is either removed from the atmosphere, such as through a restoration project, or prevented from being released, such as when a forest is saved from the axe. Buyers of carbon credits can include countries or companies. </p><p>Singapore has indicated that it plans to use such credits to meet its climate change targets, although it has not yet purchased any offsets. </p><p> Credits used to offset national emissions can be purchased only from carbon projects in countries that Singapore has bilateral pacts with. </p><p> At the same time, carbon tax-liable companies here can also buy carbon credits from projects in these partner countries to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. </p><p> The pact between Singapore and Peru was signed virtually by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Peruvian Environment Minister Juan Carlos Castro Vargas.</p><p> In a statement, Mr Castro noted that Peru is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, home to vast Amazon and Andean forests that play a crucial role in stabilising the global climate. </p><p> \"The implementation agreement between Peru and Singapore underscores our shared dedication to fostering high-integrity carbon markets as a tool to achieve our ambitious climate goals, protect our natural resources and support local communities,\" he said. </p><p> The Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement on April 1 that under this pact, the carbon projects in Peru will promote sustainable development and deliver tangible benefits to local communities, such as creating jobs, improving access to clean water and energy security, and reducing environmental pollution. </p><p>Singapore has also agreed to voluntarily contribute 5 per cent of proceeds from the carbon credits it purchases to help Peru finance ways to reduce the impact of climate change. In the pact with Bhutan, for example, the 5 per cent will go to the country's heat management measures and climate-resilient agriculture. </p><p> There are two main types of carbon credits -- nature-based ones and technological ones, such as switching from pollutive firewood to cleaner cookstoves. Nature-based credits could come from projects such as forest restoration and conservation, as well as sustainable agriculture.</p><p> News of the signing of the implementation agreement between Singapore and Peru comes as the Republic looks to buy its first set of nature-based carbon offsets to meet its 2030 climate change target. </p><p> The Government had in September 2024 called on carbon project developers and credit suppliers to propose nature-based projects that can deliver at least 500,000 credits each. </p><p> This request for proposal drew 17 submissions before it closed in mid-February. It is not immediately clear whether any of the submissions included proposals to purchase carbon credits from projects in Peru. </p><p> Of the three other implementation agreements that Singapore has, most progress has been made with Ghana. </p><p> In September 2024, Singapore and Ghana called for project developers to submit applications for their carbon credit projects in Ghana to be authorised. These applications are now being assessed. </p><p> A Singapore Government spokesperson told The Straits Times that some possible project types that may be authorised in Ghana are related to clean water supply and clean cooking. </p><p> The Republic is also progressing on negotiations with more than 15 other countries on this front, in the hope of advancing those partnerships into implementation agreements. These include Malaysia, Cambodia and Colombia.</p><p> Dr Kim Jeong Won, a senior research fellow at the NUS Energy Studies Institute, said it is quite likely that high-quality nature-based projects will emerge from the Peru-Singapore pact.</p><p> Possible projects could be related to rainforest restoration and the conservation of watersheds -- land areas where rainwater drains into a final lake or river -- given that Peru has been recently leveraging nature to address water scarcity and climate resilience issues, she said.</p><p> But successful nature-based projects need stringent measures and environmental and social safeguards, she cautioned. </p><p> \"Poorly planned nature-based solutions may have adverse impacts on ecosystems and human communities, as well as exacerbate climate change by releasing more carbon than sequestering -- harming indigenous species, and displacing local residents,\" added Dr Kim. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The implementation agreement between Singapore and Peru was signed virtually by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Peru's Environment Minister Juan Carlos Castro Vargas on April 1.

While this may be true for some risks, such as broader economic transition risks, it is clear from repeated headlines that extreme weather events pose an unparallelled risk to businesses worldwide today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both in terms of financial cost and operational resilience. With disasters escalating in frequency and severity, the impact on Singapore businesses and their operations and supply chains around the region continues to grow exponentially. This impact is expected only to grow if net-zero targets are missed and higher levels of carbon are emitted into the atmosphere, further modifying global weather patterns.For organisations to not just survive but also remain competitive in the face of these changes, understanding and preparing for climate risks must become an integral part of business strategy. </p><p>Rising costs of a changing climate The statistics speak volumes. According to Nature, climate change could cost the global economy as much as US$24.7 trillion annually by 2060. For context, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods and heatwaves have already accrued over US$2.8 trillion in costs since the early 2000s. These risks are no longer hypothetical; they are here, and they are costing businesses millions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not billions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c each year. The question isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t whether climate risks will affect Singapore companies, but how extensively. This new landscape requires businesses to rethink resilience and prepare for both short and long-term challenges ahead. Understanding climate risks Climate risks fall under two primary categories: physical risks and transition risks. Both demand a firm grasp to effectively plan, adapt and safeguard operational continuity. Physical risks: Physical risks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think floods, hurricanes, or heatwaves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can disrupt supply chains, damage property, and increase operating costs. These events aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t isolated to specific industries; though agriculture, leisure, construction, and retail are particularly vulnerable, no sector is immune. Businesses must evaluate potential vulnerabilities, whether they stem from damaged infrastructure or unexpected supply chain bottlenecks. For example, when flooding disrupts warehouses in one region, it can cascade across multiple points in manufacturing or distribution networks, creating financial blowback that compounds over time, threatening revenue and the bottom line. Singapore itself is also not immune, facing significant physical risk through more extreme rainfall and potential sea level rises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 30 per cent of the island nation is less than five metres above sea level.Carbon emitted to date has already exacerbated physical risks today through modification of global weather patterns, and these effects are not expected to reverse even if the global economy achieves net-zero by its stated targets.Transition risks: The movement towards a low-carbon economy brings its own set of challenges known as transition risks. These can include shifting consumer preferences, legislation forcing greener operations, and reputational pressures. Transition risks are multifaceted, encompassing: discThe need for modelling climate risks \u00c2\u00a0To act strategically against these risks, climate risk modelling has become non-negotiable. Forward-looking models aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about compliance; they provide businesses with critical, actionable insights to safeguard and optimise operations for years to come. By assessing risks under varying future warming scenarios, decision-makers can proactively adapt strategies instead of scrambling reactively in the wake of disaster. Effective modelling can help businesses answer essential questions:discRetailers, for example, are already taking preemptive action \u00e2\u20ac\u201c designing flood-resistant buildings, replacing vulnerable materials such as sheet roofing, geographically diversifying their supply chain, or relocating operations altogether. Small adjustments today could prevent massive disruptions tomorrow. Additionally, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to note that regulators from jurisdictions including Singapore, the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, and the US state of California are shifting from voluntary recommendations to mandatory disclosure requirements, starting as early as 2025. These rules ask businesses to report both risks and opportunities associated with climate change, in line with frameworks developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d pushing organisations to assess impact not only defensively but also with an eye towards growth. Opportunities beyond risk management While climate risks dominate headlines, the flip side is often overlooked. Addressing these risks provides fertile ground for innovation, operational efficiencies, and brand differentiation. Many organisations are already capitalising on green opportunities by investing in renewable energy, developing sustainable products, and streamlining resource usage. From adopting carbon-neutral logistics to innovating in areas such as carbon capture and electric technology, these strategies don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just limit exposure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they create new competitive advantages. By integrating sustainability into corporate practices, businesses can build stronger relationships with consumers, investors, and employees alike. Climate change presents looming challenges, but it also provides an unprecedented moment for leadership in Singapore \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something the Singapore government and many businesses here have taken up the mantle on already. Businesses that recognise this urgency, model accurately their exposure, and adopt forward-looking strategies will not only outpace competitors but also help lead industries toward a more sustainable future. The time for complacency has passed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to prioritise proactive climate risk modelling and make resilience a key pillar of every corporate agenda.The writer is vice-president, climate solutions, at FISPolicy and legal risks: Governments worldwide are stepping up policies to mitigate climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from phasing out fossil fuel vehicles to mandating net-zero targets. Failure to comply can lead to litigation, regulatory penalties, or marketplace exclusion. Additionally, climate litigation cases \u00e2\u20ac\u201c against companies for insufficient climate action or misleading claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have more than doubled since 2015, signalling intensified scrutiny.\u00c2\u00a0Technology risks: Emerging green technologies disrupt existing systems and industries, from electric vehicles to renewable energy solutions. While these open doors for innovation, they also pose challenges for corporations slow to adopt or integrate these changes effectively, which could lead to stranded assets.\u00c2\u00a0Market risks: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consumers are increasingly seeking sustainable products, with 69 per cent changing their habits due to climate awareness. Failing to meet this demand risks both lost revenue and diminished brand relevance over time.\u00c2\u00a0Reputation risks: Public \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stakeholder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expectations are rising. A majority of consumers and investors now expect corporations to take visible and impactful action on environmental issues. Those who fail to meet these expectations risk lasting reputational damage.\u00c2\u00a0How will rising sea levels impact our physical locations or suppliers'\u00c2\u00a0Will new carbon regulations significantly raise overhead costs'\u00c2\u00a0How should we adjust our logistics networks to withstand frequent extreme weather events?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singapore faces significant physical risk through more extreme rainfall and potential sea level rises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about 30 per cent of the island nation is less than five metres above sea level.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJV-S6N1-JCF2-80KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1259\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Some also expect Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, who is also the finance minister, to speak about infrastructure for adapting to climate change in the Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18). The cost and talent requirements for sustainability reporting are key concerns for companies. All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. These disclosures include a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\u00e2\u20ac said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p>Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\u00e2\u20ac he said. He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\u00e2\u20ac Chia said. The reporting of Scope 3 emissions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which arise from a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upstream and downstream value chains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date. We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\u00e2\u20ac said Ng. Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate. Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). From 2024, companies subject to Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.Carbon markets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\u00e2\u20ac, said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\u00e2\u20ac he said. To spur the supply of carbon credits, start-up incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit. EY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.While no announcements are expected on Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\u00e2\u20ac said Dr Rao.Targeted help for SMEsSeveral market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. While Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\u00e2\u20ac, said Helge Muenkel, DBS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief sustainability officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\u00e2\u20ac he said. Eric Lian, UOB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\u00e2\u20ac To accelerate SMEs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. Climate adaptationSome industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lim: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\u00e2\u20acEY\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tekchandani similarly expects a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\u00e2\u20ac. This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience. Budget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\u00e2\u20ac he said.

All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025. Large non-listed companies will also have to do so from FY2027. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These disclosures include a company's direct, or Scope 1, emissions as well as their Scope 2 emissions, which arise indirectly from energy purchase and usage.</p><p> Last year, Singapore unveiled the Sustainability Reporting Grant (SRG) to assist large companies with annual revenues of S$100 million and above. It will cover up to 30 per cent of qualifying costs for the preparation of a company's first sustainability report, capped at S$150,000 per company.</p><p> Mike Lim, a partner at venture capital firm Trirec, suggested that the SRG could be expanded to cover the cost of sustainability initiatives that are part of the reporting process, while also incorporating incentives for early adopters. </p><p> \"Companies that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting ahead of the mandatory timeline could receive additional incentives, such as tax breaks or higher grant amounts,\" said Lim, whose firm invests in clean energy and climate tech companies. </p><p> Kelvin Lim, managing director of property player LHN Group, said that more support is needed for the technical aspects of emissions reporting. </p><p> \"One of the challenges we faced was gathering, compiling and computing the data required to translate into emissions data. More support is needed in doing so, and having a national standardised software with data templates could be introduced to reduce the complexity of reporting,\" he said. </p><p> He also believes that the SRG could also be expanded to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that voluntarily adopt sustainability reporting, to encourage more participation.</p><p> Chia Poh Hui, a director at tech investor Vickers Venture Partners, called for structured courses that can upskill employees in sustainability reporting. </p><p> \"The government can also provide tax incentives for companies that invest in training of employees in sustainability reporting and management, or decarbonisation efforts,\" Chia said. </p><p> The reporting of Scope 3 emissions -- which arise from a company's upstream and downstream value chains -- is another area where more support is needed, said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer at OCBC.</p><p> Challenges include the sheer complexity of a company's entire value chain and the lack of quality data from company stakeholders, he noted. </p><p> \"Given these challenges, the processing of reporting Scope 3 emissions has been largely proxy-driven to date.</p><p> \"We hope to see more support for companies to capture accurate and credible emissions data across their value chains, including their SME suppliers,\" said Ng. </p><p> Carbon marketsThe market for carbon credits is another area where companies are seeking more clarity and assistance. </p><p> Chia believes that Budget 2025 could provide more details on carbon credit usage and the verification process to encourage more businesses to participate.</p><p> Toh Shu Hui, tax services partner at EY, expects to see more guidance for companies on the sourcing and tracking of international carbon credits (ICCs). </p><p> From 2024, companies subject to Singapore's carbon tax are allowed to use ICCs to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions. The country has thus far signed agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana on carbon credits cooperation.</p><p> Carbon markets \"need a policy push for it to gather momentum for the future\", said Professor Lawrence Loh, director of the Centre for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore Business School. </p><p> \"While the rest of the world may be recalibrating their country and corporate involvements in the carbon market spaces, Singapore may well take this opportunity to double down on invigorating the demand and supply of carbon credits,\" he said. </p><p> To spur the supply of carbon credits, startup incentives could be given to carbon credit producers registered in Singapore and contributing to the economy, said Prof Loh. </p><p> On the demand side, he suggested that tax incentives, such as deductible expenses, could be considered for companies that purchase carbon credits, up to a determined limit.</p><p> EY's Toh similarly hopes to see liberalisation of the goods and services tax treatment for input tax claims on expenses related to carbon credit trading, to alleviate business costs and enhance Singapore's attractiveness as a carbon credit trading hub.</p><p> While no announcements are expected on Singapore's carbon tax rate, business leaders are hoping for more clarity on how the proceeds from the carbon tax will be allocated to support green infrastructure development, said Dr Vinika Rao, director of the Insead Hoffmann Institute and Africa Initiative.</p><p> \"This will enable affected businesses to understand where future public support will be directed, and make their own investment decisions accordingly,\" said Dr Rao.</p><p> Several market players also called for more support for SMEs in their sustainability journeys. </p><p> While Singapore's carbon tax applies mainly to large emitters, \"there may be knock-on effects on SMEs in hard-to-abate sectors\", said Helge Muenkel, DBS' chief sustainability officer.</p><p> \"Enabling access to the right support, including funding as well as help to adopt low-carbon solutions, will be important to ensure businesses have the resources and capabilities to transition and no one is left behind,\" he said.</p><p> Eric Lian, UOB's head of group commercial banking, echoed this sentiment, noting: \"SMEs with high energy consumption, (such as those in) manufacturing, logistics and food processing, will welcome support to meet rising expenses amid other inflationary pressures.\"</p><p> To accelerate SMEs' sustainability journeys, Singapore could introduce new policy grants such as a circular economy and waste reduction fund or a sustainable supply chain support scheme to encourage green procurement and logistics, added Lian. </p><p> The expansion of financing options for SMEs to access sustainability-linked loans or green bonds, will also be welcome, said Praveen Tekchandani, Singapore climate change and sustainability services leader at EY. </p><p> Some industry players expect PM Wong to emphasise efforts on climate adaptation. Said LHN's Lim: \"As climate risks intensify, we expect climate resilience and adaptation measures -- such as enhanced drainage infrastructure, coastal protection and flood management -- to be key priorities in Budget 2025.\"</p><p> EY's Tekchandani similarly expects a \"strong emphasis on climate adaptation strategies, in light of increasing climate-related risks such as flash floods and heat waves\". This could include funding for infrastructure projects that enhance climate resilience.</p><p> Challenging timeBudget 2025 comes at a challenging time for climate action, as the Trump administration backpedals on climate policies and focuses on fossil fuel. </p><p> But it is precisely because of such negative sentiment under Trump that other countries should persevere in climate efforts, said Prof Loh.</p><p> \"Singapore, in particular, should continue to demonstrate its commitment to be a responsible country even if it is a small city-state,\" he said. </p><p> DBS' Muenkel expects Budget 2025 to continue Singapore's pragmatic and long-term approach, \"balancing economic competitiveness with sustainable development\". </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>All Singapore-listed companies are required to make climate disclosures aligned with the International Sustainability Standards Board from FY2025.
