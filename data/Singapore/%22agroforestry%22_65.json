In doing so, those developer teams can focus their full attention on their dApp's functionality, without worrying about the overheads that normally come with creating a blockchain, or working within the confines of an existing network that struggles with scalability, such as Ethereum. The Aurora Cloud Console will generate all of the underlying code and deploy the customized blockchain as a Virtual Chain on NEAR Protocol's high-performance, EVM-compatible network, with rapid transaction speeds and enterprise grade security.</p><p>Aurora's Virtual Chains can be further refined with a series of Web3 plugins available in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://marketplace.auroracloud.dev/\">Cloud Console Marketplace</url>, where developers can integrate ready-made services such as decentralized identity protocols, reputation management, compute, domain name services and so on, with just a couple of clicks.</p><p>In this way, Aurora is setting a new standard for blockchain accessibility, eliminating the need for extensive engineering and programming skills, so anyone can build a dedicated chain for their dApp.</p><p>Who's Building Virtual Chains?</p><p>Aurora launched the Aurora Blocks Incubator to encourage dApp developers to see what they can build with its unique platform. The program offers access to Aurora's infrastructure, partner mentorship and strategic support \u2013 including grants \u2013 and after six very busy weeks, it unveiled its first cohort at a special Demo Day event last month.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/5FuBsq9yzw\">https://t.co/5FuBsq9yzw</url></p><p>\u2014 Aurora (@auroraisnear) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/auroraisnear/status/1950943671261778392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 31, 2025</url></p><p>The five projects span a wide range of blockchain applications. For instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.optima.financial/\">Optima Financial</url> says it's the first EU-regulated tokenized investment platform, offering DeFi users the chance to engage with hedge fund-level investing strategies and \"earn like the top 1%\". The strategies are bundled into separate tokens that are automatically rebalanced and traded as regulated blockchain certificates. For instance, the OP20 token is a basket of the top 20 performing cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, while OPAI is a basket of tokens designed to power blockchain-based AI projects. Optima Financial built its protocol atop of the Optima Virtual Chain to ensure speed and stability, with governance powered by its native OPTIMA token.</p><p>Another interesting project is <url normalizedValue=\"https://sproutlyrwa.com/\">Sproutly</url>, which is the first UN-verified carbon credit platform, offering access to tokenized CO2 offsets and trees, targeting companies striving to achieve their net-zero targets. Sproutly aims to bring real-world climate impact on-chain, with its NFTrees certified by agroforestry systems, incentivizing carbon capture projects by translating them into real-world yield.</p><p>Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coineasy.xyz/\">EasyChain</url> is all about easing Web3 accessibility, simplifying the way non-crypto natives interact with decentralized networks. It abstracts away all of the complexity involved in blockchain, so newcomers can participate in gamified quests and earn social rewards within a familiar, Web2-like environment.</p><p>While the above projects are all building on existing ideas, a couple are forging new concepts entirely. For instance, <url normalizedValue=\"https://tradable.app/\">Tradable</url> is a consumer-focused, automated crypto trading platform powered by artificial intelligence, designed to help anyone better navigate the volatility of the crypto markets. Its Aurora-based Virtual Chain is designed to perform encrypted, on-chain AI queries, processing them privately off-chain before returning the results to the network, ensuring verifiable market insights with maximum privacy for users.</p><p>As for <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/OmegaNetw0rk\">Omega Network</url>, it's pioneering a novel \"hybrid Layer 1.5\" architecture that aims to simplify DeFi development. It's a high-performance, sovereign network that unifies liquidity and scalability and streamlines real-world asset integration. Omega promises to solve common problems developers face on existing networks, such as slow and expensive transactions (Ethereum), a lack of composability (Avalanche) and a lack of sovereignty (Arbitrum), while enabling frictionless dApp development.</p><p>What's Coming Next?</p><p>The first cohort dramatically enhances the utility available within Aurora's nascent ecosystem of Virtual Chains, but more importantly they demonstrate its infrastructure's ability to support the kinds of sophisticated dApps found on more established networks such as Ethereum, Solana and Avalanche. The Demo Day pitches can be viewed on Aurora's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/pBX1D93JrmE?t=1s\">YouTube channel</url>.</p><p>While Aurora Aurora Blocks Incubator will now turn its attention to identifying candidates for its second cohort, Aurora Labs promised it will continue to support the growth of the original five, in line with its grand ambition to foster an ecosystem of as many as 1,000 Virtual Chains by the end of the year.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In 2011, Singapore's City in a Garden vision was introduced.</p><p> Parks were linked up via the park connector network and developers were encouraged to incorporate skyrise greenery into buildings so as to further integrate nature into urban spaces.</p><p> \"The regimental planting of the Garden City era was replaced by mixed plantings that mimicked forest structure, with native species playing a bigger role,\" said Dr Lahiru. </p><p> \"The idea of a manicured garden in a specific place gave way to a city being incorporated into a garden.\"</p><p> In 2020, the green vision progressed further. </p><p>Singapore now wanted to become a City in Nature, which aims to provide a green, liveable and sustainable home for Singaporeans and wildlife to co-exist. </p><p> Initiatives under this vision included expanding the nature park network, naturalising gardens and parks, restoring greenery in urban areas and connecting green spaces, said the National Parks Board (NParks).</p><p> \"The key distinction of being a City in Nature is in how Singapore understands nature's role in national survival and climate resilience,\" said Dr Lahiru.</p><p> Being a City in Nature is about how Singapore takes a holistic approach towards the environment and celebrating life in all forms, beyond birdwatching or admiring pretty plants, said Dr Shawn Lum, a senior lecturer at NTU's Asian School of the Environment.</p><p> The 'forest lapis' One of the goals of a City in Nature is to link up Singapore's fragmented habitats. </p><p> The roll-out of nature ways, or routes planted with specific trees and shrubs to replicate the structure of a natural forest, could help with this.</p><p> Natural forests have different layers, comprising vegetation that grows to varying heights to support wildlife species that have different feeding and breeding preferences. </p><p> NParks aims to complete 300km of nature ways by 2030. Currently, there are 54 nature ways in Singapore, stretching 240km in total.</p><p> An example of a nature way is the Lornie Nature Corridor, which comprises a nature way and a park connector, and acts as a buffer to the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. The corridor has more than 100 species of trees and shrubs so far. </p><p> For example, the pink mempat (Cratoxylum formosum) and kempas (Koompassia malaccensis), which are both native and endangered, were planted to provide food and habitat to support various insects and birds.</p><p> NParks has also tried to re-introduce endangered plant species such as the native Singapore kopsia (Kopsia singapurensis), a tree that is considered critically endangered here.</p><p> Nature ways can help wildlife move around to find food and mates, said butterfly expert Khew Sin Khoon. </p><p> \"They are not merely green corridors, they are critical ecological highways that enable urban biodiversity to move between major nature nodes across the island,\" added Mr Khew, who is also head of Singapore butterfly interest group ButterflyCircle. </p><p> Butterflies such as the rustic (Cupha erymanthis lotis) are usually found in forests. </p><p> But these can now be seen in park connectors and even urban parks, Mr Khew said.</p><p> This could be due to the planting of the caterpillar's host plant, rukam masam (Flacourtia inermis) along roads, park connectors and urban gardens, said Mr Khew.</p><p> NParks has also planted native shrub species like the common sendudok (Melastoma malabathricum) which attracts birds like the scarlet-backed flowerpecker (Dicaeum cruentatum) and insects such as the striped nomia bee (Nomia strigata).</p><p> Improved connectivity between Singapore's green spaces will improve the gene flow between populations and also increase the butterfly's resilience to environmental changes, Mr Khew added.</p><p> A separate study by NTU in February found that road verges with a higher diversity of flowering plants attract more butterflies due to the year-round availability of nectar, as plants bloom at different times.</p><p> The researchers include Dr Tharaka Priyadarshana and Associate Professor Eleanor Slade from the Tropical Ecology and Entomology Lab at NTU's Asian School of the Environment. </p><p> While the road verges studied are not formally part of Singapore's nature ways, the researchers said they serve a similar ecological function on a smaller scale by providing resources such as nectar and shelter.</p><p> They also serve as important connectors that help butterflies move across urban landscapes of unconnected greenery, complementing the broader connectivity provided by nature ways, said the researchers.</p><p> Mr Khew said: \"Nature ways represent a science-based, scalable solution to keep Singapore's City in Nature vision alive -- not just for humans, but for the butterflies, birds, and countless other species that share our city.\" </p><p> Planting trees,  growing rootsAs part of the City in Nature push, Singapore in 2020 launched the OneMillionTrees movement. </p><p> The aim is to plant a million more trees across the island by 2030. </p><p> As at June, 800,868 trees have been planted across Singapore, according to NParks' website.</p><p> More trees have been planted in places such as schools and residential and industrial estates since the launch of the movement. </p><p> On industrialised Jurong Island, for example, more than 34,000 trees have been planted since 2020. More than 80 species of trees such as the common sterculia (Sterculia parviflora) and the shore laurel (Neolitsea cassia) were chosen to line the island -- one of Singapore's warmest areas. </p><p> The tree species were chosen based on their ability to tolerate drought, their colourful flowers and wide crowns that can provide shade. </p><p> Trees act as natural air filters, providing clean air. They also provide cool and shaded environments, helping to reduce the urban heat island effect -- where urban structures trap heat in the day and release it at night.</p><p> Forests also provide habitats for wildlife like the critically endangered straw-headed bulbul, a songbird, and the Sunda pangolin, and store carbon to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p><p> A nation's transformationAs Singapore celebrates its 60 years of independence, the country's transformation over the decades is reflected in its greening journey, said experts. </p><p> \"In a way, this whole journey mirrors the growth of a nation -- from trying to survive, to trying to impress, to now trying to sustain,\" Dr Lahiru said. \"It reflects how we think as a society, how we see ourselves, and what we believe we need in order to survive and thrive.\"</p><p> As Singapore transitions from Garden City to City in a Garden to City in Nature, Dr Lahiru said that the City in Nature could be the \"most honest\" version of what the country has been trying to do -- to create a home for both humans and nature. \"It brings in ideas of resilience, biodiversity, and responsibility. It's no longer about making things green -- it's about making sure nature survives, so we do too,\" he noted.</p><p> Dr Lum added: \"It is now up to all of us to embrace the City in Nature, and to nurture this seed and to care for it so that it can become an inspiring thing of beauty and wonder.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As vegetation runs through the urban landscape and nature is restored in the city via \"rewilding\", animals once thought to be extinct in Singapore, such as the oriental pied hornbill, have made a comeback.

The report outlines how Elevarm's integrated ecosystem model is revolutionising farming practices, improving farmer livelihoods, and advancing sustainable agriculture across the archipelago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Indonesia's food security depends on empowering farmers with the right tools, knowledge, and support,' says Bayu Syerli Rachmat, co-founder and CEO of Elevarm, in a press statement. 'By directly addressing sustainability at the grassroots level, Elevarm is proud to help close the productivity gap while protecting the environment.'</p><p>In 2024, Elevarm supported more than 16,000 smallholder farmers. These farmers experienced a remarkable transformation, with 36.5 per cent reporting increased yields and average incomes rising from IDR12.1 million (US$735) to IDR14.1 million (US$857) per crop cycle.</p><p>Beyond financial gains, farmers saw a 14 per cent reduction in chemical usage, thanks to Elevarm's organic solutions such as vermicompost, produced and distributed in-house.</p><p>At the core of Elevarm's achievements lies its integrated ecosystem service model, designed to create 'triple wins': boosting livelihoods, enhancing food security, and strengthening environmental resilience. Through a blend of advanced technology, tailored financing, market infrastructure, and advisory services, Elevarm addresses systemic challenges in Indonesian agriculture.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/in-an-era-where-agriculture-both-drives-and-bears-the-brunt-of-climate-change-digital-technologies-offer-a-path-to-empowerment-20240427/\">Unlocking agritech's potential: Can Southeast Asia rise to the challenge?</url></p><p>Tech-driven cultivation support</p><p>Elevarm leverages cutting-edge tech to deliver tailored cultivation practices. Farmers are equipped with high-quality inputs, including seeds, organic fertilisers, and biostimulants. The company also employs tech-driven solutions such as soil testing, monitoring dashboards, IoT-based field devices, and a dedicated farmer app that offers real-time insights and personalised guidance.</p><p>Addressing one of smallholder farmers' most significant barriers, Elevarm provides affordable loans tied to harvest repayment. This financial support covers an average of 62.5 per cent of farmers' working capital needs, reducing dependence on informal lending channels.</p><p>Moreover, crop and life insurance options protect farmers from risks associated with climate events, pests, and unforeseen personal tragedies. By shifting reliance away from informal lending, the company intends to help farmers gain financial stability and peace of mind.</p><p>To ensure farmers have reliable markets for their produce, Elevarm has established a comprehensive market infrastructure. Under its Farmer Partnership Model, farmers commit to selling their entire harvest to Elevarm at mutually agreed-upon fair prices. This approach guarantees off-take certainty and strengthens market trust, reflected in the growing volume of produce sold directly to the company.</p><p>Sustainable and professional farming practices</p><p>Sustainability remains central to Elevarm's vision. The company promotes Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), polyculture (adopted by 42.1 per cent of its farmers), organic fertilisation, and reduced chemical and water usage. Their flagship vermicompost and NextBio products are pivotal in improving soil health, enhancing plant resilience, and driving long-term environmental benefits.</p><p>A rigorous data-driven approach underpins Elevarm's operations. The company employs stratified sampling, historical yield analysis, field surveys, and third-party datasets to measure impact accurately. This meticulous data collection informs strategic decisions and ensures transparency in reporting outcomes.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/automation-ai-and-agritech-power-vietnams-vc-momentum-20250423/\">Automation, AI, and agritech power Vietnam's VC momentum</url></p><p>A robust governance framework incorporating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and comprehensive risk management supports Elevarm's model. This structure ensures consistent service delivery, timely input distribution, efficient payment processing, and reliable claim verification.</p><p>A vision for nationwide transformation</p><p>Looking ahead, Elevarm is poised to scale its model nationally. Following its focus on impact in 2024, the company plans significant expansion in 2025, targeting new high-value commodities such as shallots, tomatoes, and beans. It will also venture into agroforestry, revitalising underutilised lands in Purwakarta, West Java.</p><p>By 2026, Elevarm intends to extend operations to Sumatra and Sulawesi, with an eye on institutionalising its model through policy advocacy and government collaboration.</p><p>The company is also developing a predictive AI-powered digital platform that aims to become an indispensable tool for farmers, offering even more precise and timely insights.</p><p>As part of its growth strategy, Elevarm plans to introduce third-party audits and Social Return on Investment (SROI) analyses to further validate its SDG-linked outcomes. These efforts will expand the scope of measurable indicators, including gender impact, environmental footprint, and income stability.</p><p>-</p><p>Enjoyed this read?

Well over 100,000 people have been subject to mandatory evacuation orders, while early estimates have put the likely insured losses at US$20 billion and the potential overall economic loss as high as US$57 billion. Quantifying the human suffering and emotional loss is impossible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the cause of the fires is yet to be established, it is likely that last year's heavy rains from the El Nino weather system fuelled vegetation growth, which has since dried during a recent prolonged dry spell. Combined with strong winds, this has created the ideal conditions for wildfires to spread. </p><p> The broader science is clear -- climate change and today's methods of landscape management are accelerating the wildfire risk globally. </p><p> A key challenge in California -- as also in the Mediterranean, which too has seen a rising threat from wildfires in recent years -- is the rural-urban interface where the town meets the countryside, with a disproportionate number of residences now located in high wildfire-risk areas. </p><p> Holistic strategies neededAs residential areas expand deeper into wilderness, the risk to homes and businesses rises. It is estimated that, globally, insurance claims due to wildfires have risen to US$10 billion annually, a figure that now looks set to be dwarfed in 2025. Indeed, many homeowners caught up in the LA fires are without home insurance, after insurers hiked costs or simply cancelled provision altogether in recent years due to the escalating wildfire risks.</p><p> In addition to urban spread, climate change and the way we plan and manage our landscapes are thought to be the key factors. </p><p> As temperatures rise, and droughts become more frequent, the tinderbox conditions that spark and spread wildfires are increasingly common. </p><p> Across the world, this new generation of wildfires are exceeding our capacity to suppress them. As we face mounting environmental, economic and social threats, we must move from tactical suppression to holistic mitigation-adaptation strategies, to minimise the risk of extreme fires breaking out, and create resilient landscapes that are capable of recovering quickly should a fire occur. </p><p> Recent years have seen substantial scientific and technical advances in how land management practices can integrate prevention-preparedness, detection-response, and restoration-adaptation. </p><p> Climate-smart forestry, for instance, which puts resilience and climate benefits at the forefront of forest management, is emerging as an effective tool for creating landscapes that are resilient to wildfires and other extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. </p><p> One major issue, however, is -- how do we finance these strategies'</p><p> The key to achieving this goal is the growth of the circular bioeconomy -- in essence, by replacing today's extractive, fossil-based economy with an economy based on nature's regenerative power, we can cut the emissions that lead to global heating and reduce the risk of extreme weather events while attracting the necessary investments to transform landscapes and businesses in an integrated manner. At the local level, the bioeconomy flourishes where nature thrives, meaning that economic growth goes hand in hand with the creation of healthy, biodiverse, climate- and fire-resilient landscapes.</p><p> Forests and agroforestry, with their multifunctional roles and wide range of ecosystem services, offer great opportunities to build this new economic model. New technologies are creating unprecedented opportunities to transform plant-based compounds into many of the fossil-based materials we use today, including construction materials, textiles, plastics, and chemicals. Managing forests to produce these resources regeneratively also enhances the ecosystem services that forests provide, improving carbon sequestration, soil health, and water retention, and reducing a forest's susceptibility to fire. </p><p> The same can be said for agroforestry and regenerative farming, which provide us with food while enhancing ecosystem services. </p><p> This is not the case in conventional agriculture, which provides food while generating environmental externalities.</p><p> Seize the opportunity As the bioeconomy grows, so does the economic opportunity. In the Amazon alone, the bioeconomy could be worth up to US$4 trillion, while globally the bioeconomy is expected to be valued at US$7.7 trillion by 2030.</p><p> For investors, the growth of the circular bioeconomy is creating an opportunity for private finance and public-private partnerships to target returns while creating fire-resistant and resilient landscapes through nature-based solutions, such as regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and sustainable forestry, which can target better long-term economic profits and a rise in land values while enhancing biodiversity- and water-, soil- and climate-related ecosystem services. </p><p> Whether this is through companies that are turning monoculture coffee plantations into healthy agroforests, producing coffee that sells at a premium, grown on climate-resilient farms that sequester more carbon than they emit, or carbon and biodiversity credit markets that give investors the chance to target sustainable returns and diversify their portfolios, opportunities abound. However, to bring these and other mechanisms to scale, innovative financial tools will be needed. </p><p> Think out of the boxFrom real asset strategies that deploy capital to transform degraded or non-adapted land assets to resilient and regenerative assets, to schemes such as the Australian Emissions Reduction Fund, and the USA's Forest Resilience Bond -- which allows private capital to play a role in public land management -- such mechanisms must become the norm rather than the exception. </p><p> To do that, the finance industry needs to build a better understanding of the key role of nature as the true engine of our economy. Bringing scientific experts to the investment and finance industry needs to be the norm in the coming years.</p><p> In a world where losses from environmental disasters are growing -- in total, climate disasters cost the global economy US$320 billion in 2024 -- urgent action is needed, and investors have an essential role to play. </p><p> As we search for new ways to finance the fight against wildfires, we must take a multifaceted approach, integrating science, finance and policy to build a circular bioeconomy that addresses the root causes of extreme events. </p><p> In today's era of climate change, we must take our lead from nature and build resilience from the ground up. </p><p> The writer is chief nature officer at Lombard Odier Investment Managers.

Two standout initiatives-Scentian Bio's VOC maturity assessment and the Biochar Field Trial 2024-already show promising results and potential long-term impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scentian Bio's pilot transforms traditional fruit maturity testing, which is typically slow and labour-intensive. Instead, the company is developing biosensors inspired by insect olfactory systems to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by ripening kiwifruit. The technology, paired with AI models, enables fast, accurate, and non-destructive maturity assessment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'We see this as a game-changer,' says Jiunn Shih, Zespri's Global Chief Marketing, Innovation &amp; Sustainability Officer, in an email to e27. 'Growers can make more informed decisions, increase productivity, and deliver fruit at peak ripeness-while reducing post-harvest waste.'</p><p>Beyond operational efficiency, this innovation supports sustainability by improving harvest timing and resource use across the supply chain.</p><p>The Biochar Field Trial 2024 by M.B. Horticulture Ltd is another key climate tech initiative. It explores using biochar-a carbon-rich material made from organic waste-to enhance soil health, increase productivity, and store carbon in kiwifruit orchards.</p><p>'Think of it as a nutrient battery,' says Shih. 'Biochar improves nutrient retention, reduces leaching, and supports long-term soil vitality, while locking carbon in the soil for hundreds of years.'</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/wavemaker-impact-invests-in-zentide-to-scale-sustainable-seaweed-based-agriculture-20250304/\">Wavemaker Impact invests in Zentide to scale sustainable seaweed-based agriculture</url></p><p>Although biochar has been trialled in other crops, its use in perennial vines such as kiwifruit remains limited. This project offers growers practical, evidence-based guidance for adopting the method.</p><p>Early results are positive, highlighting environmental and economic benefits that align with Zespri's broader sustainability goals.</p><p>'These pilots give our growers the confidence to adopt practices that strengthen orchard resilience and deliver climate-positive outcomes,' adds Shih.</p><p>Through ZAG, Zespri is proving how climate tech and sustainability-focused innovation can future-proof agriculture and deliver lasting value to growers and the planet. In this interview, find out more about how they are doing it and what insight they can share about the climate and agritech sector.</p><p>The following is an edited excerpt of the conversation.</p><p>What are some of the most compelling agri- and climate-tech trends you see emerge across the Asia Pacific region? How do you plan to seize this opportunity?</p><p>In recent seasons, we have seen the impact of climate change more clearly through our growing systems and around the world. Working with solution providers, ZAG is focused on creating solutions that will help create sustainable, long-term value for our growers. These initiatives will examine how we can enhance productivity while caring for the land, enabling it to grow sustainably.</p><p>Agri- and climate-tech are booming, and there will be more developments in these sectors as we move forward in 2025. Precision agriculture is becoming more accessible, not just for large-scale farms but increasingly for smallholders too. At the same time, we are seeing a surge in nature-based solutions-agroforestry, soil carbon capture, water-efficient systems-all aligned with food security and decarbonisation goals.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/how-biotech-is-changing-the-global-agriculture-game-for-investors-20211202/\">How biotech is changing the global agriculture game for investors</url></p><p>Therefore, with ZAG, we plan to use these emerging technologies to tackle some of the industry's biggest sustainability challenges, such as automation, big-data value extraction, soil regeneration, supply chain optimisation, and packaging.</p><p>For instance, Zespri is collaborating with M.B. Horticulture on a biochar field trial, which explores the application of biochar as a stable form of carbon storage in kiwifruit orchards. Biochar has the potential to enhance soil health and productivity, directly contributing to Zespri's climate-positive goals. The ZAG fund is providing an opportunity for innovative new ideas, like using biochar in kiwifruit orchards, to be tested on a small scale to evaluate whether more in-depth work is warranted.</p><p>In essence, ZAG is a strategic investment to foster innovations that directly contribute to reducing Zespri's environmental footprint.</p><p>How do you see the intersection of data, automation, and sustainability shaping the future of food production in this region?</p><p>The intersection of data, automation, and sustainability is becoming the backbone of the next-generation food system in Asia Pacific. Data enables traceability and transparency across the entire value chain, from soil to shelf. That is critical, especially as consumers, regulators, and partners demand greater accountability around environmental and social impact. Automation is helping address labour shortages and increase operational efficiency, while reducing inputs like water, energy, and chemicals.</p><p>We are already seeing this come to life through the ventures we have supported via ZAG. Scentian Bio, for instance, is a pioneering initiative using volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to transform kiwifruit maturity assessment. By replacing labour-intensive and time-consuming methods, this innovation could reduce operational inefficiencies and enhance supply chain planning. Growers could benefit from improved productivity and better decision-making, while customers and consumers receive consistently high-quality fruit delivered at peak ripeness.</p><p>How is climate change influencing how growers and producers in Asia Pacific adopt new technologies, particularly in sustainability and crop resilience?</p><p>Climate change is not just a future threat in Asia Pacific. It is a present reality globally, and growers across the region are already feeling the impact.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/agriaku-raises-seed-funding-round-led-by-arise-to-tap-into-indonesias-agriculture-market-20211221/\">Agriaku raises seed funding round led by Arise to tap into Indonesia's agriculture market</url></p><p>As we transition into the second year of ZAG, we are committed to not just maintaining the momentum we have had, but also amplifying our impact. The next phase will focus on strengthening climate resilience across food systems by advancing productivity and carbon-positive practices. By leveraging the successes and learnings from our first year, the next stage of ZAG aims to accelerate sustainable innovations that benefit the environment, communities, and people as we meet the growing demand for kiwifruit.</p><p>While our core priorities remain the same-strengthening climate resilience across food systems and creating solutions that advance productivity and carbon-positive practices-we are always open to exploring new partnerships that align with global and regional advancements in sustainability.</p><p>What are some key challenges agritech founders face in Asia Pacific, and how is ZAG helping them navigate these?</p><p>As with many in agriculture, we operate in a dynamic environment that drives us to innovate, adapt, and build greater resilience for the future. From climate change and increasing labour and input costs to the pressing need to boost productivity, these realities are why innovation is no longer optional; it is essential.</p><p>One of the most common hurdles for agritech startups in Asia Pacific is proving the commercial viability of their innovations. Many have strong ideas and prototypes, but limited access to funding or commercial environments to test them in real-world settings.</p><p>ZAG helps bridge this gap by funding pilot projects and proof-of-concept trials without taking equity. We offer startups direct access to Zespri's grower network, allowing them to validate their solutions in-market. If the technology proves successful, we will support scale-up efforts across our global supply chain.</p><p>This approach reduces early-stage risk for founders while helping Zespri explore innovations that could potentially create meaningful enhancements to sustainability and efficiency across orchards and operations.</p><p>[Another challenge is] climate change, which already impacts the kiwifruit industry. For Zespri, kiwifruit cultivation is highly dependent on specific climate conditions, wherein our kiwifruit needs around 1,000 hours of winter chill between two and four degrees Celsius.</p><p>Historically, New Zealand could reliably provide that. But today, we see increased climate variability, impacting flowering, bud break, and fruit development. More recently, we have experienced more extreme weather events.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-green-tech-wave-southeast-asias-agritech-stars-shine-bright-20250324/\">SEA's US$48B agritech revolution: Startups cultivating a smarter future</url></p><p>ZAG actively seeks solutions that help us and our growers adapt to these shifting conditions through orchard innovations, climate-resilient crop strategies, or technologies that improve planning and risk management.</p><p>By working with innovators worldwide, we are tackling these challenges head-on with a future-focused mindset. We are not only interested in solving problems for today; we're investing in resilience for tomorrow.</p><p>The ZAG Innovation Fund connects bold ideas with the infrastructure, expertise, and credibility needed to scale in Asia Pacific's unique agri-environment. We are not just funding pilots, we are building bridges between founders, growers, and global opportunities.</p><p>Looking ahead, what role does Zespri's ZAG Innovation Fund hope to play in advancing the agriculture and climate tech ecosystem across Asia Pacific?</p><p>Looking ahead, ZAG aims to support the best solutions in the agriculture and climate tech ecosystems, regardless of where they originate.

The initiative began in 1995 with local communities helping to conserve state and customary forests by growing crops on once barren and degraded land. </p><p> Under the initiative, sales of food produced by the millions of social forestry farmers, including key raw goods such as rice, corn, soya bean and coffee, came to 1.1 trillion rupiah (S$83.9 million) in 2023. Indonesia's whole agriculture industry in the same year was worth 2,617 trillion rupiah. </p><p> In 2015, the government overhauled the scheme, giving legal rights to these rural communities for up to 35 years, to manage 12.7 million ha of state and customary forests -- equivalent to the size of Java island. This was planned as a way to address poverty and reduce conflicts over land tenure. </p><p> It has so far handed over 8.1 million ha to 1.3 million social forestry households. Many  have kept the forests free from fires and helped maintain the ecological balance. </p><p> The government is still in the process of identifying produce from the social forestry farmers that can be used for the free meal scheme, said Dr Mahfudz Muchtar, the Forestry Ministry's director-general for social forestry and environmental partnerships.</p><p> Dr Mahfudz said the government will provide support in various forms -- from seeds and fertilisers to livestock -- to farmers to boost output from activities related to agroforestry, silvopasture and silvofishery. With agroforestry, farmers plant trees along with crops, while in silvopasture and silvofishery, they combine farming with tending livestock and cultivating seafood like fish and shrimp.</p><p> Although the social forestry scheme has been operating for decades, the initiative's target is primarily environmental conservation.</p><p> Given the required amount of food for the free meal initiative, the  farmers are encouraged to scale up and take on a bigger role in supplying milk and food, such as vegetables, fruit and meat. </p><p> The campaign will also involve private companies, including small and mid-sized ones, officials said.</p><p> The free meal programme aims to distribute nutritious meals to 82.9 million schoolchildren and pregnant women across Indonesia and will cost about 400 trillion rupiah annually. </p><p> According to the National Food Agency, there will be around 30,000 meal distribution centres. Each one, catering to 3,000 children, will need 200kg of rice, 350kg of vegetables and 600 litres of milk, among other items, daily.</p><p> Together with the National Planning Agency, the Forestry Ministry is also proposing a national strategic project to support food security, which will run from 2025 to 2029 and involve social forestry farmers and villages.</p><p> While critics doubt the ability and cost-effectiveness of the free meal programme to help address the problem of malnutrition, economists say that tapping farmers at the regional level will bring greater impact to the economy.</p><p> For one thing, by procuring food for the programme on a more local level, distribution costs will be lower across the vast archipelago.</p><p> \"The food procurement at the local level will allow the budget for the programme to benefit local farmers and boost sales of small and medium-sized enterprises. It will also help distribute jobs,\" said Mr Bhima Yudhistira, executive director of Jakarta-based think-tank Centre for Economic and Law Studies. </p><p> Farmer Edi Santoso leads a collective of social forestry farmers, consisting of 641 families in Lumajang, East Java province. He hopes the free meal programme can increase revenue for his community. </p><p> Since the Covid-19 pandemic, prices of their produce have fluctuated significantly, even leading a number of the farmers to quit farming due to big losses.</p><p> They are also at the mercy of middlemen, who buy their produce at low prices and sell them at higher prices. </p><p> \"We've been facing fluctuations in prices set by the middlemen. Hopefully (being part of the free meal) programme will help standardise the prices,\" Mr Edi told ST. </p><p> He expects the prices of vegetables they grow to rise by 30 per cent with demand from the programme.</p><p> Another farmer, Mr Ahmad Juansyah,  said he faced a similar situation as Mr Edi's -- where middlemen set the prices for products such as coffee and bok choy. </p><p> As such, prices of bok choy have been known to fluctuate from 3,500 rupiah a kilogram, which just covers the production cost and allows for a small profit, to as low as 500 rupiah a kilogram throughout the year. </p><p> The Forestry Ministry's senior policy analyst Bambang Supriyanto told ST the government will encourage a few farmers' collectives in one region to focus on several crops needed by the free meal programme to enable them to scale up. </p><p> \"By doing it this way, the free meal programme can get sustainable food supply, while the farmer collectives can get greater market access and added value for their products,\" he said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An Indonesian farmer tending to his vegetables in West Java province.

In 2025, significant drivers of structural change include the implementation of US President Donald Trump's post-election promises and key regulatory decisions in global markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These will prompt new business plans and budgets at the corporate level, influenced by supply-chain dynamics, potentially higher funding rates, and intensified merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity. The following analyses and insights are driving our high-conviction themes for 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Fintech and financials back in favourFintech experienced a robust resurgence in 2024, driven by strong operational results, attractive valuations, and optimism surrounding Trump 2.0. Traditional financials also thrived, buoyed by \"higher for longer\" rates and increased net interest income. </p><p> Looking ahead, economic growth, reduced regulation, and fintech initial public offerings are expected to sustain momentum. Although the interest rate cycle may be nearing its peak, we do not anticipate a significant decline in banking profits, as many banks continue to benefit from strong fee-based income streams that are less sensitive to interest rate changes. </p><p> Additionally, lower rates could stimulate more M&amp;A activity, unlocking scale, innovation, and profits in fintech and traditional financial sectors. </p><p> In the consumer space, the demand for immersive, personalised experiences across travel, entertainment, and digital platforms is rising. Increased digitalisation is driving demand for credit solutions and cross-border transactions, particularly in underserved markets, boosting traditional payment companies such as Visa.</p><p> The broadening of markets and reduced emphasis on the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) should also benefit financials, particularly fintech, which is rich with overlooked and underappreciated artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Tech innovations.</p><p> Digital innovation: AI must show real gainsIn 2024, AI once again emerged as the driving force behind technological innovation and earnings growth. Investors and corporates will increasingly demand tangible productivity gains over speculative potential in the high-performance semiconductor and supportive infrastructure sectors.</p><p> Software sector revenue growth is forecast to accelerate to 14 per cent by 2025, with cloud computing and software-as-a-service revenues projected to expand at nearly twice that rate, underscoring the growing influence of AI-enabled platforms in driving real digital transformation across the economy.</p><p> AI is making significant inroads into the physical world, arriving at a critical time when production bottlenecks and geopolitical security concerns renew interest in reshoring manufacturing. AI, robotics, and automation will help overcome reshoring challenges such as high labour costs, worker shortages, and rapid operational scaling. Consequently, we anticipate accelerated spending on new and retrofitted manufacturing facilities that integrate AI. </p><p> Healthcare: diverse trends and innovationA shortage of doctors and rising healthcare costs indicate that AI will be valuable for the healthcare sector. AI-powered advances in medical imaging and life-science tools are enhancing early detection, treatment outcomes, and personalised therapies. </p><p> On the dietary front, the shift towards healthy and sustainable foods benefits upstream ingredient companies, supporting superior growth, compared with downstream consumer-facing staples. </p><p> Trump's healthcare agenda is expected to drive the performance of pharmacy benefit managers, managed care networks, Medicaid beneficiaries, and vaccines in the first half of 2025. In the long term, population growth, higher life expectancies, shifting demographics, rising lifestyle disease burdens, and the emerging middle class will drive strong demand for healthcare services. </p><p> Circular economy: stricter laws boost circular producersA key principle of the circular economy is replacing hazardous substances with non-harmful alternatives and preventing their release into the environment. This includes the recent US Food and Drug Administration's push to simplify nutrition labels on food packaging. These efforts are expected to drive growth among companies specialising in naturally non-toxic ingredients for food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products.</p><p> Additionally, a growing number of food chains are dedicated to bio-labels and healthy food alternatives. The European Union's newest packaging laws will also benefit holdings involved in recycling and biodegradable packaging. </p><p> Smart grids: solution for security and power demandsGlobal electricity demand is accelerating, underscoring the urgency to expand infrastructure. The International Energy Agency projects that power consumption from data centres, AI, and the cryptocurrency sector may double by 2026. In the near term, renewables, gas, and storage solutions are the most viable technologies to meet surging demand. </p><p> Energy security remains a top political priority, with government incentives for clean energy infrastructure driving new construction projects to upgrade energy systems and modernise the grid. </p><p> Although policy risks may challenge offshore wind and higher-cost technologies, increased US protectionism could benefit domestic solar module manufacturers. </p><p> Growing power demand, driven by data centre expansion, favours low-carbon, low-cost electricity developers and utilities.</p><p> Mobility: revving up EV markets China's overall electric vehicle (EV) penetration rate could climb to 75 per cent in 2025, according to some industry experts. In Europe, stricter new fleet CO2 emission standards will drive the production of new EV models and increase consumer uptake. </p><p> The growing use of cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries will further support consumer adoption and producer profitability. Declining lithium prices in 2025 are expected to create significant investment opportunities in smart mobility.</p><p> Assisted and autonomous driving is poised to be a life-changing AI application, with 2025 likely to be its breakout year. </p><p> Water: diverse demands make it an evergreen investment Water challenges are set to intensify as stringent regulations target pollutants and biological threats. Clean drinking water and micropollutant control remain bipartisan priorities in the US for 2025, positioning advanced water treatment and infrastructure providers for long-term growth. </p><p> Additionally, the demand for treated water is increasing from US-based industries and municipalities, driven by reshoring trends for semiconductors, EVs, and other manufacturing sectors, which fuels advancements in water-testing and analytics, recycling, and wastewater management.</p><p> Biodiversity: new laws and practicesResource scarcity and degrading ecosystems are elevating biodiversity in corporate and political agendas. The EU's Nature Restoration Law, enacted in 2024, sets binding targets to rehabilitate EU ecosystems, benefiting industries such as engineering consulting, construction, and forestry. </p><p> Sustainable practices such as organic farming, agroforestry, and advanced land management are expected to drive biodiversity investments, enhancing soil health, water quality, and carbon sequestration.</p><p> Smart materials and manufacturingManufacturing capital expenditure and construction are strengthening, thanks to Trump's \"America First\" industrial policies. </p><p> Although tariffs and trade tensions may be challenging in the short term, they are expected to accelerate investments in automation and robotics in response to reshoring trends. </p><p> An anticipated fiscal stimulus should also reignite automation investments in China. </p><p> Electrification and automation segments are expected to grow robustly in the mid-20 per cent range, further supported by lower interest rates and the re-emergence of M&amp;A activity. Inflationary pressures are expected to moderate in 2025, creating opportunities in commodities and critical minerals as demand stabilises.</p><p> Structural trends such as renewable energy adoption and energy independence should drive demand for lithium, copper, and rare earths, while decarbonisation policies and financing from the EU Green Deal will provide tailwinds for energy-efficient materials. </p><p> We are constantly reminded that AI is the future, and this drives investors to eagerly seek opportunities. </p><p> However, decades of thematic investing have shown that innovation does not occur in isolation. Regulation, macroeconomics, and resource scarcity are crucial to its deployment, adoption and scaling. </p><p> Investors should factor in the technological, political, and market currents to best position their investments for short and long-term growth. </p><p> By closely navigating these themes and their impacts, they may enhance portfolio returns while helping to reshape the future. </p><p> The writer is head of thematic investing, Robeco</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Although tariffs and trade tensions may be challenging in the short term, they are expected to accelerate investments in automation and robotics in response to reshoring trends.

Since inception, it has completed US$6 billion of investments across 220 loans.</p><p> Last year, it entered into a partnership with Seviora Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Temasek, to collaborate and build on ADM Capital's sustainability-integrated investment strategy. Seviora, which manages US$52 billion, has taken a minority stake in ADM Capital.</p><p> Prakash reckons that beyond trade, the second stage of Asia for Asia may take the form of Asia-centric investments and acquisitions, driven particularly by the growing pool of private wealth looking to invest close to home. \"Opportunities are not necessarily dependent on the US,\" she said. </p><p> International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva said in a recent speech that the world may appear to be retreating from integration, \"but regionally, countries are leaning in\". Over the past four decades, intra-regional trade in Asia has risen by 43 per cent. Today, more than half of Asian trade is regional. </p><p> Financing opportunitiesADM Capital focuses on what it sees as the \"sweet spot\" of financing opportunities, on companies needing between US$20 million and US$80 million in \"growth credit\", which may be unavailable from banks. </p><p> \"Due to a lot of consolidation that has happened in private credit, large alternative investment managers are willing to put in US$100 million or more. The space that's ignored, with less financing, is where we focus on.\"</p><p> Portfolio companies may be \"nascent\" in their track record, with three to five years in business and revenues starting from around US$50 million. </p><p> \"We'd like to see companies move towards a run rate of profitability, but at the same time, it depends on the markets... The companies want to scale up, but are not finding financing.\"</p><p> Its funds are diversified in terms of country and sector exposures, and even exit opportunities.</p><p> Over the past couple of years, private debt assets have been in strong demand, particularly among wealth managers whose clients have an evergreen appetite for yield. </p><p> By Preqin's forecast, assets under management in private credit, currently more than US$1.6 trillion, are expected to hit US$2.6 trillion by 2029. </p><p> Last year was something of a challenge for smaller managers, however, as investors gravitated towards \"mega\" funds.</p><p> Prakash said: \"The current fundraising environment in Asia is throwing up more diversity of funding sources, including greater availability of local capital, private wealth, regional pension funds and insurance companies and, in many cases, strong stock market performance, which again helps diversifies exit channels.\"</p><p> Exit strategies include refinancing, cash flows from operations or asset sales, new equity and even innovative options such as asset-backed tokens. </p><p> \"Some of these exit options may be affected by macro conditions such as equity market sentiment, and hence the importance of having other fundraising options available,\" she said.</p><p> The firm is currently raising capital for a \"smart city\" fund, an infrastructure-themed fund in emerging Asia. It was widely reported to seek US$300 million in capital. \"The region has been investing in infrastructure very actively, and there is huge demand financed by banks and large credit funds. But, many SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in the supply chain of the infrastructure projects can't find financing,\" said Prakash.</p><p> \"The confluence of infrastructure, technology and sustainability is very interesting, and will underlie the industries of tomorrow.\" </p><p> Capital deploymentShe said the firm has secured a cornerstone investor, and is in advanced discussions with other private investors. \"There are already various investee companies lined up.\"</p><p> The firm takes a bottom-up approach in deploying capital and pride in its ability to offer flexible terms. </p><p> \"From top down, we try to identify sectors that could be useful. The beauty of our strategy is that despite the rise and fall of interest rates, our returns are stable and consistent...</p><p> \"Companies come to us because we're quick, nimble and flexible on structure, tenor, coupon. We're able to customise the deal to the nature of company cash flows.\" Generally, the firm aims to generate annual returns of 15 per cent.</p><p> The firm integrates ESG into its investment due diligence and portfolio management.

The remaining 14 per cent will come from restoring degraded habitats through replanting, for example. </p><p> The researchers calculated that conserving and restoring these habitats can reduce about 770 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent annually. This amount is nearly double Malaysia's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, they said. </p><p> These findings were published in scientific journal Nature Communications on Jan 28. Scientists from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and James Cook University in Australia also contributed to the study.</p><p> Mangroves can store up to five times as much carbon as tropical forests. Although swampy peatlands cover just 3 per cent of the earth's land surface, they store twice as much carbon as all of the world's forests combined. </p><p> But peatlands have for decades been viewed as unproductive wasteland, eyed by agriculture giants and farmers for conversion into plantations and farmland. Between 2001 and 2022, about 40 per cent of peat swamp forests in South-east Asia in 2000 were lost. </p><p> By 2017, the annual rate of loss of these forests had been 108,458ha a year, the study found. The size of that annual loss is larger than Singapore's land area, which is over 71,000ha.</p><p> Peatland fires caused the 2015 haze that shrouded Singapore and the rest of the region, producing emissions higher than the levels in the whole of the European Union. </p><p> Therefore, losing more of these carbon reserves to forest fires and agricultural use will pump enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. </p><p> \"Conservation is the most effective strategy to mitigate emissions from peatlands and wetlands. So it's an easy win if we just conserve these ecosystems, as opposed to developing a lot of funding and projects in restoration that provide fewer benefits when compared to conservation,\" said Assistant Professor Pierre Taillardat, a co-author of the paper and scientist at the NTU Asian School of the Environment's Wetland Carbon Lab. </p><p> At the same time, avoiding deforestation of peatlands allows more carbon to be absorbed, compared with regrowth in the short term, particularly in the context of countries' net-zero goals by 2050. This is because of the extended time taken by a regenerating forest to reach maturity and achieve maximum carbon accumulation, stated the paper.</p><p> Its senior author, Associate Professor Massimo Lupascu from the NUS Department of Geography, also noted that restoration is costlier than conservation. </p><p> Restoring peatlands costs up to US$7,000 ($9,500) per hectare, compared with a few thousand dollars per hectare for conservation. It is also known to be difficult to successfully reforest a degraded mangrove or peat forest due to technical complexities and governance barriers. </p><p> \"Maintaining a high water table in tropical peatland is one of the key elements to prevent carbon loss, but it's very difficult. Restoration involves replicating ecological conditions that have developed over centuries. And mangroves depend on tidal dynamics. In many of the degraded areas, the hydrology and physical conditions of the coasts have been altered,\" explained Prof Lupascu. </p><p> \"And on top of that, peatlands have the risk of fires. As for governance challenges, many restoration projects struggle to succeed because there are overlapping land claims, unclear tenure rights and weak law enforcement.\" </p><p> A 2024 global study found that planted mangroves fall short in carbon storage compared with natural mangrove forests. Although planted mangroves can store up to 73 per cent of the carbon found in an intact mangrove forest of the same coastal environment, this level of carbon storage is achieved only after around 20 years of growth, the study showed. </p><p> While conservation should take higher priority, restoration still has a role, said the researchers, given the huge amounts of carbon both ecosystems store.</p><p> According to the Asean Peatland Management Strategy 2023-2030 report, there are very few, if any, pristine peatlands left in the region. Some projects on the ground incorporate both conservation and restoration. </p><p> Commenting on the research, Dr Lahiru Wijedasa, an ecologist at environmental consultancy and agroforestry firm ConservationLinks, said that what needs to be done on the ground is to map out the completely intact peatlands, slightly degraded sites, and completely degraded ones under threat. </p><p> \"Prioritise the easy ones first, and get those conserved, with the idea that these are not just for carbon source and environmental health, but also the seed stock for restoration later,\" he said. </p><p> Conservation is not easy. Dr Lahiru said the amount of money generated by large plantations and smallholder farms is so significant that no amount of conservation programmes will generate the funds needed to replace them.</p><p> \"But the only thing that's going to ever generate the money to do that is the carbon market,\" he said.</p><p> However, generating carbon credits from conserving peatland -- that is, putting a price on avoided emissions -- is tricky. For one thing, the project needs to prove that the land is genuinely at risk of deforestation and logging, said Prof Taillardat. </p><p> And even though Indonesia has a forest-clearing ban for plantations, deforestation has continued to be reported by environmental groups. </p><p> Conservation is not just about leaving the forests untouched. It also requires proper systems in place to prevent fires, encroachment and poaching. </p><p> Dr Lahiru added: \"For a huge protected area that the government needs to run, they don't really have the people, money and infrastructure to do this.\" </p><p> He and the researchers also said conservation needs to be balanced with community livelihoods. One way is to help communities switch to crops suitable for wet peat, thus preventing the draining of peatlands for agriculture and small-scale oil palm. </p><p> Prof Lupascu said: \"If we propose to switch to water spinach, sago or jelutong (wood), from a business point of view, it's not that appealing for small-scale farmers because they generate lower profits. So there needs to be some incentive to make that switch happen.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-9EG33AS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F3B-SGM3-RRJ7-T32P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1088\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The revenue would come from a variety of carbon projects potentially worth up to US$267.7 billion by 2050, according to the report authored by carbon markets platform Abatable, the Asean Alliance on Carbon Markets, and an Indonesian-focused consultancy Equatorise. Projects aiming to curb deforestation under the United Nations (UN)\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (Redd+) framework could have a potential value of US$27.8 billion, while blue carbon projects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which refer to carbon stored in coastal ecosystems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could be worth up to US$95.9 billion. The remaining US$144 billion could potentially come from biochar projects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which refers to storing carbon in soil \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a novel project type that Asean may look to develop, said the report. It is estimated that these various carbon projects could, in total, reduce emissions by more than 1.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year by 2050, and create 13.7 million jobs within these new green industries. </p><p>Types of carbon projectsAsean countries are naturally endowed with abundant carbon stocks (referring to the amount of carbon stored in a habitat) and therefore have a lot of potential to supply carbon credits through nature-based projects. Around 47 per cent of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total land area is covered by forest ecosystems, although research has found that some 610,000 km2 of forest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than half of its original forest cover \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been deforested between 2001 and 2019. In addition, Asean has around 35 per cent of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mangrove forests. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are therefore significant opportunities for Asean to look to expand Redd+, afforestation, reforestation and revegetation (ARR), and blue carbon projects to protect and expand forests and marine ecosystems,\u00e2\u20ac the report said. Given that Asean countries are among the largest global producers of rice in the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with about 195.5 million tonnes of rice produced in 2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are opportunities for soil carbon and agroforestry projects to reduce emissions in this sector. This also opens up room for the region to develop carbon credit methodologies that focus on the reduction of emissions from rice production, which are gaining prominence in the market. The report added that nature-based projects tend to produce significant additional benefits, as local communities within the project boundaries can gain employment, have their homes protected through additional ecosystem services, and benefit from social initiatives around the project.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nature-based projects can also play a significant role in protecting and restoring biodiversity, which is crucial to Asean as three of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world are located in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines,\u00e2\u20ac added the report. Another potential area for the region to generate carbon credits is through the closure of coal power plants before their original retirement. Known as transition credits, they present an avenue to finance the early closure of coal plants and their replacement with renewable energy so that plant owners would be able to recover their revenue loss.The Monetary Authority of Singapore and several partners are studying the viability of using transition credits to shut down these plants. The report noted that Asean also has potential in developing biochar projects, given the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abundance of forests, rice husks and palm. Biochar is created from agricultural or forestry residues and then fed back into soil to facilitate carbon removal from the atmosphere. Biochar also has added benefits of improving soil health and reducing fertiliser usage, therefore offering a circular solution for many Asean countries to reduce both agricultural waste and emissions, as well as improve agronomic productivity. With projections that global demand for voluntary carbon credits will reach 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually by 2030 and 5.4 billion tonnes every year by 2050, the report noted that Asean countries \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are in a good position to utilise their natural endowments to meet this expected growing demand and be compensated for this\u00e2\u20ac. The region is not new to the voluntary carbon market, and has in fact been an active supplier of carbon credits to the market. The report estimated that projects in South-east Asia have generated carbon credits corresponding to the reduction or removal of 233 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent between 2009 and 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c representing 7 per cent of global issuances in total. This is estimated to have brought about between US$466 million and US$1.2 billion of revenue to the region. Indonesia, the seventh-largest global supplier of carbon credits since 2009, and Cambodia, ranked 10th, have dominated historical supply. Their supply provision is dominated by Redd+ projects, while other Asean members have been large suppliers of renewable energy and cookstove projects.fullChallenges and policy recommendationsHowever, there are challenges limiting both the supply and demand of carbon credits, preventing Asean from achieving its revenue potential.The report made several policy recommendations for Asean governments to consider.It noted a need for clear and detailed regulations, such as properly defining the role of the voluntary carbon market in achieving a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national climate targets, as well as developing processes and mechanisms for the international transfer of carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. At the recently concluded UN COP29 climate summit, countries adopted standards governing international carbon trading rules covered under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. Article 6.2 governs the bilateral trading of carbon credits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This would enable Asean countries to diversify into additional carbon activities under Article 6.2 and 6.4 (of the Paris Agreement) as well as the established voluntary market. Governments must be conservative when developing national rules for Article 6 engagement so as not to risk the achievement of their (national climate) targets,\u00e2\u20ac the report said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Missing targets, or revoking previously authorised credits, will have a negative impact on market perception by investors, participants and buyers, and have a damaging impact on a country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment environment.\u00e2\u20acArticle 6 carbon credits with corresponding adjustments, which means that the emissions being offset are counted only once by the country that bought the credits, while the country that produced them gives up the right to use the credits to meet its own national climate targets. This is to avoid the double-counting of underlying emissions reductions or removals when carbon credits are traded.Formulating Article 6 frameworks, such as the eligible sectors and activities, as well as crediting standards, in addition to establishing processes for projects approval, authorisation and registration, would help open new avenues to international demand. It added that Asean could engage in discussing the elements needed for intra-region cooperation as a way to position the region as an important hub for the trading of Article-6-aligned carbon credits. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It could become an attractive region to buyer countries who would be able to maximise supply access while only having to engage with the formalities of a single type of agreement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a template shareable by all Asean members... A regional multilateral agreement would be a landmark, placing Asean as a global carbon market leader and drawing investment to the region,\u00e2\u20ac the report said. Another important policy lever is the setting of a carbon price, whether through the form of a carbon tax, or an emissions trading system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By implementing compliance schemes... governments can put a cost on emitting companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 balance sheets, incentivising decarbonisation,\u00e2\u20ac the report noted.Governments can drive demand towards carbon projects that reduce or remove emissions in their jurisdictions by allowing the use of carbon credits to meet compliance requirements. However, they must ensure that the price level of the compliance instrument is sufficient to incentivise action on emissions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Lush forests at the Southern Cardamom project, which protects 497,000 ha of tropical rainforest in South-west Cambodia.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DKX-KVG1-DYX4-01WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Instead of being rich and dark, the red soil is barren and desert-like, robbed of nutrients -- scars from the monoculture farming that has taken place on this land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As our group of about 20 walks, Mr Chua urges us to ponder over the state of the degraded soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We are not just here to learn, but to also observe and feel. Some of us who are more sensitive may feel pain, anger and sadness, wondering why we have done this to our land. But it's okay to let yourself feel as much as possible,\" he says.</p><p> It is the first sign that this is not your usual farm tour. In February, I visited A Little Wild's (ALW) monthly open farm day in Kota Tinggi, a town in Johor, Malaysia. </p><p> Online, the ALW team outlines its plan to transform a 55ha land parcel, which has been a palm oil plantation since the 1980s, into an educational agroforest flourishing with fruits and vegetables. But I did not fully grasp what that meant until my visit.</p><p> A land scarredAs the group traipses through the first plot of palm oil trees, co- founder Imran Hassan, the farm's 38-year-old full-time manager, explains the origins of monoculture farming in industrial agriculture. This refers to the practice of growing one, or a few, crop species at a time.</p><p> Large-scale monoculture plantations were established in South-east Asia by the early capitalist endeavours of European colonists. These ranged from rubber and coffee to tea and palm oil plantations. </p><p> This intensive farming system forces the land into an unnatural state, where yields and uniformity are prized. Farmers use chemicals to kill pests, weeds and organisms in the soil.</p><p> As a result, people are eating very \"stressed fruits\" that rely on costly and resource-intensive methods. Soil is viewed as a lifeless medium, its quality steadily stripped of its natural nutrients and complex life, says Mr Imran, who has worked in various regenerative farms and other projects across South-east Asia since 2010. </p><p> Soil destruction creates a vicious circle. When topsoil deteriorates, it loses its ability to hold carbon below and above ground. This carbon is released into the atmosphere, causing the planet to get hotter. More difficult soil and climate conditions require more chemicals and pesticides to achieve the same yields. </p><p> ALW's guiding ethos is to help the land heal. </p><p> \"Every land dreams of becoming a forest,\" says Mr Chua, one of the farm's four founders along with Mr Imran and two more friends. </p><p> The quartet founded the farm in 2020, coming together through their shared disillusionment with the modern food system. </p><p> They saw food production, in addition to being a cause of chronic diseases, as accelerating biodiversity loss and climate change. </p><p> The land was bought with a goal of showing that regenerative agriculture can be financially viable, and to share their experience and applied research with current and aspiring farmers who want to transform the food production system.</p><p> Mr Chua spends four to five days a week at the farm, where he helps out in the plots, supports the building of new facilities, assists with tours and workshops and manages volunteers. </p><p> A former public servant working in Singapore and civil engineer with a master's degree in public policy, he also co-founded Feed Our Loved Ones (Folo), a community farm in Johor using compost made out of food waste to produce organic vegetables.</p><p> To heal the landALW bills itself as South-east Asia's first commercial-scale syntropic agroforestry farm. This means it does not rely on irrigation, with no agricultural inputs such as chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides.</p><p> Founders draw inspiration from Swiss farmer Ernst Gotsch, who pioneered the syntropic farming movement. This approach mimics natural ecosystems by integrating diverse crops and trees, enhancing soil fertility and biodiversity.</p><p> Having experimented with syntropic agroforestry for the last three years, Mr Chua says this is one of the best nature-based solutions in the tropics to heal soil life -- regenerating forests and drawing down carbon while growing food.</p><p> \"Syntropic agroforestry is a solution that does not require more intense energy and resource extraction because it harnesses the billion-year wisdom of the tropical forest in harvesting the sun, the rain and nutrients to sustain life,\" he explains.</p><p> At ALW, the process looks like this. </p><p> Initially, degraded soil supports only pioneer species, normally known as weeds, such as mimosa, senduduk and lalang. So, farmers choose the best weeds -- typically mombasa grass which regrows fast and produces plenty of biomass (organic matter such as wood, forest residue or plant material) -- to enrich the barren soil. </p><p> From there, the team plants varieties of species in layers, based on their complementary characteristics. Diversity is key, with more than 80 species in every tree row to mimic the stratification, natural succession and dynamics of a biodiverse rainforest.</p><p> Towering above the forest are emergent trees -- such as the acacia, coconut and durian -- which require constant sunlight. </p><p> Next are the canopy trees that do not mind a bit of shade, like the jackfruit or rambutan tree, followed by the medium layer, which includes mangosteen and lime. Finally, they plant the low- lying layer of coffee, cacao and ginger family plants. </p><p> Mr Chua says that when they mimic the agro-ecological conditions of nature, trees are able to act as a community, building collective resilience to ward off diseases and insects. </p><p> As we meander through the lush greenery, we witness how the land has slowly come back to life. The soil is dark and moist, packed with mycelium, bacteria and all types of organisms. Now, the forest is home to civet cats, wild boars and the like. We pause by the water body, which plays host to a resident eagle and heron. </p><p> Along the way, we chance upon other delightful sights, including a field of tall Mexican sunflowers surrounded by butterflies, red dragon fruit perched on thorny leaves, sweet papayas and flowering coffee trees in abundance. </p><p> The output is modest as the agroforest system is young and the soil is still healing, but the farmers are grateful for its output. The farm has produced pineapples, papayas, 15 types of bananas and rollinia (similar to custard apples), along with a scattering of passion fruit, dragon fruit and breadfruit. </p><p> The farm sends around 120kg of produce to Singapore each week, including to customers who order fruits delivered to their doorstep and to restaurants, such as farm-to-table joint Air CCCC in Dempsey. </p><p> Lessons from the landPart history lesson, part activism and part philosophy lecture, sprinkled with spiritual teachings, the tour takes us on a surprisingly emotional journey.</p><p> We learn that each plant and tree plays its own unique roles to help one another blossom.</p><p> Take, for instance, the sun-loving papaya, which needs fairly good soil over a period of three to five years. To help it thrive, the ALW team plants a tall acacia tree to supply it with nitrogen and a companion ciku plant so that the papaya grows vigorously to take care of it. </p><p> More than process, agroforestry carries a philosophy.</p><p> Near a shady plot of banana plants, Mr Chua poses a question to the group: What does the banana do to help the land become a forest'</p><p> Because of its large size, each banana produces a lot of biomass and oxygen. It is also an ideal home for hundreds of earthworms, whose nutrient-rich excrement replaces fertiliser. </p><p> Mr Chua dramatically slices through the banana stalk, revealing a cross-section of glistening water that can feed nearby plants and trees for a week. He describes the plant as a giver, where 60 per cent of its energy is used to grow itself, while the remainder goes back to the soil and other trees.</p><p> \"A banana plant is so wonderful that, sometimes, it even gives us bananas,\" he says happily.</p><p> As the group moves on, I spy a trio of friends who grab fallen banana leaves to form makeshift umbrellas under the hot sun. </p><p> At another plot, Mr Chua offers a lesson in gratitude.</p><p> Just as people's grandparents and parents created good lives for them, the pioneering early-stage trees and shrubs -- such as acacia, cassava and Mexican sunflower -- paved the way for the next generation of plants to thrive. Now, the land has become lush, flowering and beautiful, like the jackfruit, orchid and cacao plants we see today, he says.</p><p> Stewards of the landGiven the urgency of the climate crisis, the ALW team is on a mission to share its journey with more people.</p><p> Besides open farm days and private tours, the farm welcomes volunteers, who can stay for a minimum of two weeks, to help meet its goal of planting another 40ha of agroforest and re-wilding more areas in the coming years.</p><p> From May, it also plans to roll out weekend syntropic agroforestry basic workshops, as well as agroforestry and mindfulness retreats. </p><p> Already, the tour has seeded new ideas among my fellow participants, some of whom comprise former and current staff at social enterprise Green Nudge in Singapore.</p><p> \"Farmer Will's thoughtful inclusion of the farm's philosophy enriched our understanding of the importance of connecting with our food sources,\" says Singaporean Charmayne Lee, 24, Green Nudge's marketing and communications associate.</p><p> It is nearly noon by the time we return from the tour, hot and sweaty. </p><p> In a warung made of re-engineered wood waste designed by a Kuala Lumpur architect, volunteers have laid out a spread of the forest's gifts: cold cuts of rollinia fruit and papaya topped with passion fruit seeds, jackfruit murukku and steamed cassava served with hot sauce and various dips prepared by Folo Farm. </p><p> We snack on chips made from bananas, yam and cassava by Orang Asli -- indigenous communities in Pahang who attended ALW's workshops. This is done in partnership with international non-profit organisation Global Peace Foundation, which works with Orang Asli in Pahang to teach them how to farm. </p><p> There is also an enzyme bar, where we are served gut-friendly fermented fruit drinks by a long-term farm apprentice who had spent some time in a New York sake brewery. </p><p> As I munch and mingle with the participants on the tour -- a mix of Singaporeans, Malaysians and overseas guests -- we share a newfound sense of gratitude for the food nourishing our bodies. </p><p> I think about how more city folks like myself feel an increased yearning to connect with the earth again. We need to start questioning the systems we have in place and carve out alternative models of land stewardship. Drawing on shared strength in the community, we can chart a new way forward. </p><p> 1.

These tokens establish an open and comprehensible system for reporting and fulfilling regulatory requirements by digitizing sustainable assets, including the results they have, waste reduction, and quantifiable real-world consequences. This is especially important for businesses looking for finance options related to ESG.</p><p>Photo: Galaxy</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452223622001225\">Studies reveal</url> that a considerable proportion of businesses acknowledge engaging in greenwashing, indicating that transparency is still a top priority in sustainability initiatives. By offering an unchangeable record of operations and data about assets on a public ledger, tokenized RWAs solve this problem by boosting accountability and lowering the possibility of making false claims regarding environmental effects.</p><p>Empowering Smallholder Farmers Through Tokenization</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://dimitra.io/real-world-assets/\">Dimitra is an initiative that assists smallholder farmers and demonstrates one noteworthy use of tokenized RWAs in sustainable agriculture.</url> Dimitra makes it possible to partially own assets like cocoa plantations and avocado trees by tokenizing crop farms. This system gives farmers access to modern tools for quality evaluation, production optimization, and surveillance of crops.</p><p>Through the creation of \"digital twins\" of farmed assets, Dimitra's method enables blockchain-based asset tracking and information access for farmers and other stakeholders. The benefits of this transparency are felt by farmers, vendors of inputs, authorities, carbon credit auditors, and crop exporters along the whole value chain. In order to give local farmers access to enterprise-grade tech solutions and improve production transparency, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.freshplaza.com/north-america/article/9631409/blockchain-and-ai-are-transforming-avocado-farming-in-kenya/\">Dimitra and OMA collaborated to digitize 10,000 avocado trees on the Polygon in Kenya.</url></p><p>Due to its effectiveness, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/20/amazon-community-creating-a-future-out-of-chocolate\">Amazon Cacao Project</url> has been expanded to other areas, including Roraima in Brazil. The objective of this effort is to enhance productivity and diversify agricultural processes for local farmers by extending the regions under cocoa production and using contemporary agricultural techniques.</p><p>Additionally, tokenized RWAs are being used to solve global issues like water shortage. <url normalizedValue=\"https://files.lak3.io/LAKE_Whitepaper.pdf\">Through a decentralized network, LAKE, a firm offering a \"New Water Economy,\"</url> connects water providers to customers, companies, and communities directly using a tokenized method. Water is not tokenized by LAKE, but it is made accessible through the usage of its ecosystem and LAK3 token, which enables token holders to purchase, sell, secure, give, and invest in water sources.</p><p>Challenges and Future Prospects of Tokenized RWAs in Sustainability</p><p>The use of tokenized RWAs for sustainability confronts a number of obstacles despite the possible advantages. It is still challenging to verify that the underlying assets of tokenized RWAs actually satisfy certain sustainability standards; this calls for third-party audits and certification procedures. Inconsistencies and distrust may result from the industry's lack of consistency in measuring and reporting.</p><p>The legal frameworks governing tokenized RWAs are sometimes ambiguous and differ between nations. To maintain safe and legal operations, this calls for close adherence to national legislation. Additionally, growers and farmers who may not be familiar with these technologies may become confused due to the intricacy of blockchain principles and terminology.</p><p>Tokenized RWA proponents, however, think that its implementation will soon be required due to the need for more sustainable techniques in the agricultural industry and other areas. As the worldwide focus on sustainability develops, the built-in mechanisms of RWAs decrease risks within supply chains by offering a permanent record of operations.</p><p>There is plenty of room for development in the tokenized asset market; estimates indicate that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://web-assets.bcg.com/1e/a2/5b5f2b7e42dfad2cb3113a291222/on-chain-asset-tokenization.pdf\">market might reach $16 trillion by 2030</url>. The potential for tokenization to open up new investment options across a variety of asset classes, including U.S. Treasuries, fiat currencies, equities, and commodities, as well as growing interest from traditional financial businesses, are the main drivers of this expansion.</p><p>Photo: mezen</p><p>GRWAs, or sustainable and green real-world assets, are particularly attractive for tokenization. These resources, which include waste management, carbon offsetting, and renewable energy initiatives, are all centered on environmental sustainability. Tokenization allows a wider variety of investors to engage in initiatives that were previously only available to large institutions or affluent people by facilitating fractional ownership and trade of these assets.</p><p>The potential of GRWAs is demonstrated by creative efforts like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.treetoken.io/\">TREE Token</url>. With the help of this crypto-impact fund for forestry and climate, 100 million trees and plants will be planted in agroforestry climate initiatives over the course of five years, possibly producing 33 million tons of CO2 equivalent. The TREE Token facilitates public co-investment in climate-positive agroforestry initiatives, offering possible financial rewards in addition to environmental advantages.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rebalance.earth/\">Rebalance Earth</url> is another example; it is creating a token to encourage the preservation of priority species that are essential for ecological resilience and carbon capture. This project serves as an example of how tokenization may stimulate conservation efforts and open up new marketplaces for environmentally friendly products.</p><p>Asset tokenization has environmental advantages that go beyond particular initiatives. Tokenization lessens the need for physical documentation and distribution by digitizing assets and facilitating their transfer and ownership using blockchain. This lowers energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. This digital strategy also reduces the amount of resources used, especially paper, which helps to lower pollution and deforestation.</p><p>Are GRWAs Even Beneficial?</p><p>Eco-friendly tokenization is already showing clear advantages in real-world applications. One initiative that encourages the use of energy-efficient washing machines and lowers water and energy usage is the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dualmint.com/how-dualmint-is-changing-the-game-with-high-value-tokenized-assets\">EcoWash token project</url>. Asset tokenization has been used in supply chain management by organizations such as IBM to improve transportation routes and lower fuel and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The promise of blockchain in environmental preservation is exemplified by the tokenization of carbon credits, as exemplified by platforms such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatetrade.com/\">Climate Trade</url>. These platforms provide the efficient and transparent trade of carbon credits, assisting companies in more efficiently offsetting their carbon footprints and aiding in the worldwide fight against climate change.</p><p>Other noteworthy examples are <url normalizedValue=\"https://plasticbank.com/about/\">Plastic Bank</url>, which employs tokenization to combat plastic pollution and encourage recycling, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.powerledger.io/\">Power Ledger</url>, which facilitates peer-to-peer trade of renewable energy.

Despite uncertainties in the pace of energy transition, the trend towards lower-carbon sources is crucial for major investors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than 80 per cent of Nuveen's 2024 EQuilibrium survey respondents consider or plan to consider energy transition in their investments; 55 per cent believe they can significantly influence it through capital allocations. Institutional investors worldwide are eager to align with this unprecedented capital movement, projected to require US$275 trillion in cumulative spending on physical assets till 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We have identified 10 key indicators to help investors evaluate their portfolios and uncover compelling opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 1. Clean-energy capital expenditure: Capital expenditure is crucial for scaling up low-carbon energy and displacing high-carbon sources. Over the past decade, lower costs and improved technologies have made renewables economically attractive. More renewable capacity is projected to be built in the next five years than the total installed since clean energy became viable, and the evolution of capital deployment will have widespread impacts. </p><p> If clean-energy investments lag, global warming may increase, creating more adaptation opportunities and risks. Conversely, faster clean-energy investment could disrupt commodity demand and shift geopolitical dynamics, initially causing inflation but potentially deflation in the long term.</p><p> 2. Electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure: Expanding EV-charging infrastructure is crucial to reduce oil demand, as transport accounts for about 50 per cent of global oil consumption. However, high upfront costs for building and connecting fast chargers are slowing this expansion. Government subsidies and technological innovations can help, but significant growth is needed.</p><p> If all new car sales were EVs, public charging stations would need to increase from four million to 31 million. Improved infrastructure will boost EV demand, have an impact on critical mineral and battery producers, and increase electricity demand. Accelerated adoption could lower oil prices, affecting inflation, interest rates, and the fossil fuel industry.</p><p> 3. Corporate carbon reduction: Capital expenditures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among major corporate emitters are crucial for climate finance and emissions reduction, enhancing business model resiliency. While the supply and demand of low-carbon energy drive decarbonisation, monitoring corporate strategy and capital expenditure changes reveals economic shifts. </p><p> Influenced by stakeholders, many companies have set voluntary carbon-reduction targets, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050. In 2022, corporations contributed US$192 billion to climate finance, and investors must monitor corporate commitments to ensure progress towards net-zero targets.</p><p> 4. Emerging-market cost of capital: Emerging markets have significant economic growth potential, driving increased energy demand. Ensuring that this growth is met with clean energy is crucial to decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. About 88 per cent of the electricity demand between 2019 and 2040 is expected to come from these markets, making their energy choices pivotal for global carbon emissions. </p><p> Clean-energy projects face high upfront costs and limited affordable financing, creating a climate investment trap. Financial support from entities such as the Green Climate Fund and blended finance mechanisms can mitigate risks and enhance investment appeal. Reducing financing costs can accelerate the energy transition, benefiting both investors and emerging markets.</p><p> 5. Carbon pricing: Carbon trading and pricing schemes are vital for climate financing and incentivising decarbonisation. Effective carbon pricing can mobilise substantial funds for energy transition, with higher prices and broader industry coverage significantly boosting required capital. In 2023, carbon pricing generated over US$104 billion but covered only 24 per cent of global GHG emissions.</p><p> International trade tariffs based on carbon content could encourage countries to adopt their own pricing schemes, retaining revenue domestically. Compliance and voluntary carbon markets face challenges such as low prices and the lack of standards. Investors should expect higher carbon taxes and broader coverage, driving investments in clean technologies and potentially increasing inflation.</p><p> 6. Coal phase-out: As countries committed to the Paris Agreement work towards reducing GHG emissions, phasing out coal plants becomes crucial. Each country's climate action plan outlines specific strategies to curb emissions, leading to stricter regulations. Reliable substitute power generation, such as utility-scale solar, battery assets, or natural gas, is essential for this transition. </p><p> In 2023, 23 gigawatts of coal capacity were retired, but global coal power capacity continues to rise, driven by China, India, Japan, Indonesia, and Russia. Increasing energy demands, driven by the rising use of artificial intelligence and the reshoring of manufacturing, add pressure to coal phase-out plans. Monitoring coal plant retirements offers investors insights into growth opportunities for low-carbon power generation.</p><p> 7. Trade policy: Countries aiming to compete globally now face stronger incentives to decarbonise, with energy security becoming increasingly important. Economic nationalism has led to subsidies and tax credits for clean-energy projects, while businesses reduce the carbon intensity of exports to gain a share in the clean-energy technology value chain. Government funding through policies such as the European Union's Green Deal and the US' Inflation Reduction Act is expected to stimulate private financing, creating investment opportunities.</p><p> Carbon border adjustments (CBAs) and tariffs based on carbon intensity incentivise cleaner production methods. Investors should consider the impacts of CBAs, tariffs, and major industrial policies on global trade dynamics and sovereign debt, as well as the potential for substantial private-capital investment.</p><p> 8. Land management: Forests, oceans, and soil act as carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide than they release and mitigating climate change. Despite efforts, deforestation continues at high rates, releasing stored carbon. Comprehensive reforestation policies are lacking, limiting large-scale restoration and carbon sequestration. Carbon-friendly agricultural practices such as agroforestry and conservation tillage are not widely adopted.</p><p> However, policies to protect carbon sinks are emerging. Investors should consider the impact of stringent environmental regulations on companies reliant on natural resources, and explore opportunities in sustainable land-use practices.</p><p> 9. Climate-tech funding: Innovation and technology diffusion are crucial for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and enhancing decarbonisation incentives. Technological advancements in energy production and consumption improve efficiency, lower costs, and make low-carbon activities more attractive. This is vital for emerging markets to bypass carbon-intensive development paths.</p><p> Private equity and venture capital funding are essential for developing technologies such as energy storage and green hydrogen. Climate tech now accounts for more than 10 per cent of global investments, up from less than 2 per cent in 2014. As these technologies mature, they attract more investors, especially in hard-to-abate sectors such as cement, mining, steel, and chemicals.</p><p> 10. Nuclear as well as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS): Nuclear power and CCUS are vital for ensuring baseload power and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Emerging technologies such as small modular reactors and nuclear fusion could revolutionise the energy sector, despite challenges such as cost overruns and supply chain issues. </p><p> CCUS growth is driven by capital deployment, subsidies, industry coordination, and the willingness of customers to pay for low-carbon products. Investors should consider carbon-free baseload power and the longevity of fossil-based activities with CCUS, transitioning to stable, growth-oriented opportunities.</p><p> Rebuilding the world's energy system is a monumental task that demands significant effort and resources. This unprecedented shift in capital will have far-reaching consequences for investment portfolios, influencing both opportunities and risks. </p><p> To extract value and mitigate risk, investors may need to venture into unfamiliar territory, adopting innovative strategies to achieve a resilient and climate-aware strategic asset allocation. This approach not only ensures sustainability, but also aligns with the evolving global energy landscape.</p><p> The writer is managing director, Nuveen Responsible Investing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Expanding the infrastructure for charging electric vehicles is crucial to reduce oil demand.

This highlights the importance of conserving existing mangrove carbon stocks,\" she added. A petagram is equivalent to a billion metric tonnes.</p><p> The study's publication in the Science Advances journal in July comes amid a global resurgence of interest in nature restoration as a nature-based solution to tackle climate change. </p><p> Mangroves can store and lock carbon in the ground as they take in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. They can store three to five times more carbon compared with tropical forests.</p><p> \"Despite the perceived benefit of restoration, there is now no consensus on the timeline required for successful planted mangrove stands to recover or build up levels of carbon stocks similar to natural mangrove forests,\" noted the research team, which involved 24 researchers from institutions such as the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry, the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry, University of Malaya and University of Cambridge.</p><p> This information gap prompted the researchers to embark on the study to assess whether planted mangroves demonstrate a similar ability to store carbon as natural primary stands, including mangrove forests that were free from human degradation. </p><p> They found that despite an increase of 25 per cent of carbon stock in soil in the first five years after planting mangroves, there was not much change thereafter as the amount stayed at about 75 per cent between five and 40 years after planting compared with existing mangrove forests. </p><p> Dr Bourgeois said that 77 per cent of the team's entire database was collated from countries in the Indo-Malaysian region, including Singapore, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. </p><p> Mangroves around the world are usually found in tropical and subtropical coastal areas because they thrive in environments with warm temperatures, high humidity and abundant rainfall.</p><p> Globally, mangrove coverage shrank by 3.4 per cent between 1996 and 2020. </p><p> The lost coverage of 5,245 sq km is slightly smaller than the size of Brunei, according to the UN Environment Programme's biodiversity centre, which provides data analysis on global biodiversity and environmental issues. </p><p> The loss in mangrove coverage is about seven times the size of Singapore, and is mainly due to human activities such as agriculture, aquaculture and urban development, and natural challenges such as erosion and extreme weather. </p><p> Professor Daniel Friess, a mangrove expert from Tulane University, who was not involved in the latest study, said the research showed that planted mangroves were still able to bring back a proportion of the carbon lost when the mangroves were removed. </p><p> \"This study provides further incentive to restore mangroves in Singapore and the region to help mitigate climate change, but nothing beats conserving what we already have and not losing it in the first place,\" he added. </p><p>Singapore has experienced a significant decline in its natural mangrove forests. An estimated 85 per cent of mangroves and tidal flats have been lost, mostly since 1953, according to a 2023 study conducted by Prof Friess and researchers from institutes such as NUS, NTU and Old Dominion University.</p><p> Given that Singapore has lost the majority of its mangroves, the study offers a positive outlook on the potential for restoration, said Dr Radhika Bhargava, a research fellow at NUS' department of geography.</p><p> \"Investing in bringing back the nature that does its job of reducing carbon emissions could help in bringing a more carbon-neutral economy forward... It's something that Singapore can take action on right away,\" she added. </p><p> Assistant Professor Tang Hao from NUS' geography and biological sciences departments noted that planting mangroves does not necessarily guarantee a high carbon stock. This is because carbon accumulation is subject to local environmental conditions, and many plantation attempts have failed because the mangrove species were planted in an unsuitable place.</p><p> \"Thus, for areas with lack of space but rich in mangrove habitats, it is more efficient to invest in conservation and protection of primary mangrove forests rather than simply expanding plantations into new areas,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A mangrove area at Semakau Landfill.

Now, it's very different and if we are not careful, it can be lost,\" said Dr Zia, 47.</p><p> These ecosystems are crucial in humanity's bid to tackle climate change. </p><p> Mangroves are coastal defenders. Their sturdy roots can withstand the impact of strong waves and prevent soil erosion. Their tangled webs of roots trap sediment from the tides, enabling the mangroves to keep pace with sea-level rise, protecting inland communities. Mangroves are also powerful carbon stores -- they can absorb three times more carbon than tropical rainforests. </p><p>Indonesia is home to more than a fifth of the world's mangroves. </p><p> Over the years, the mangroves have thinned as they make way for fishing, agriculture, settlements, and illegal and legal logging.</p><p> But all is not lost. Dr Zia is sowing hope -- not least among his students -- at a restoration site in the Banyuasin district of South Sumatra.</p><p> \"It's like my baby is born into the world,\" he said, describing the growth of a mangrove seedling. </p><p> Banyuasin lost around 10,000ha of mangroves from 2014 to 2019. The district covers an area of approximately 1.2 million ha, with around 130,000ha of mangroves inside and outside Sembilang National Park.</p><p> At the Banyuasin villages, the communities have noticed that the felling of mangrove trees had increased the susceptibility of the area to flooding when the tides are high. </p><p> The Sungsang Mangrove Restoration and Ecotourism (Smart) project aims to restore the mangroves, so as to improve their potential to absorb more planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. The project is a collaboration between Sriwijaya University, the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF), the South Sumatra Watershed Forum, and the Banyuasin District Government. Singapore's Temasek Foundation is supporting the project.</p><p> Since the project started in 2021, it has already achieved its goal of restoring 15ha of damaged mangroves -- equivalent in size to 21 football fields -- with more than 40,000 seedlings planted over that area.</p><p> Restoring a mangrove is hard work and can even be discouraging when seedlings are damaged.</p><p> \"What you see now wasn't like this three years ago,\" Dr Zia said, pointing to a restored mangrove plot that was once failed agricultural land. \"It is not alakazam and it suddenly happens -- it's a process.\"</p><p> This area, one of four zones, is the biggest at 7.7ha, with more than 31,000 mangrove seedlings planted.</p><p> Seeds are first planted at a nursery. After three to four months, seedlings are collected and transported to the site, where about 30 people do the planting.</p><p> The restoration team began working with around 10 species and eventually decided on four that are suitable for the environment: Bruguiera gymnorrihiza, Kandelia candel, Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata.</p><p> One of Dr Zia's students, Mr Muhtadi S. Kel, 25, said: \"I learnt how patience is important because it was very easy to get pessimistic during the first period of planting because many seedlings died. But we persevered.\"</p><p> Seedlings are at risk of attack by natural predators like crabs and getting washed away by strong currents. To protect the seedlings from these threats, they use a bamboo sheath to surround the plant.</p><p> \"If you plant but you don't monitor, I can guarantee you that the seedlings will not grow. Planting is easy but making sure the mangroves grow well is very difficult,\" said senior scientist Herry Purnomo, country director for CIFOR-ICRAF in Indonesia.</p><p> At this site, only about 50 per cent of planted seedlings survive, he said.</p><p> Monitoring is critical so damaged seedlings can be replanted. It is done through an app-based system. The app captures information such as how many mangrove plants stay alive, which ones die and where, and pest infestations.</p><p> The researchers also pointed to the importance of getting the support of the local community for the restoration efforts, without which the replanted stands of mangrove trees could be cut down again. </p><p> Many coastal communities throughout South-east Asia, including the villages in Banyuasin, rely on nature for their livelihoods.</p><p> To support their families, mangroves in the area had been cleared to make room for agriculture use such as coconut plantations.</p><p> Understandably, the villagers were not supportive of the initial mangrove restoration efforts, as they were afraid their livelihoods would be compromised, said Dr Zia. \"When I first asked for directions, they pointed me the wrong way,\" he added. </p><p> Currently, three alternative income-generating activities are being explored at the site -- the sale of mangrove seedlings to companies, ecotourism, and crab-rearing. </p><p> Former fisherman Ratam, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, now earns an income from the sale of mangrove seedlings to state-owned companies.</p><p> So far, some 30,000 seedlings have been sold, amid a global resurgence of interest in nature-based solutions such as mangrove restoration as a way of tackling climate change.</p><p> On the ecotourism front, the village hopes the restored mangrove site can be an eco-education tourism hub, attracting students, researchers and visitors.</p><p> Some 1,300 visitors have visited the mangrove ecotourism area -- their visits boosting local incomes with food sales, homestays and transportation.</p><p> A group from the nearby Marga Sungsang Village approached CIFOR-ICRAF to restore mangroves in their village to support the creation of a crab farm. </p><p> They told Dr Zia: \"We know that without mangroves, there are no mangrove crabs.\"</p><p> Said Dr Zia: \"Usually, projects start from the top down but this project started from the bottom up. So I was very surprised.\" He noted how silvofishery -- a farming method where mangrove conservation is integrated with food production -- was a collaborative effort between villagers and CIFOR-ICRAF.</p><p> The first harvest in 2024 produced around 240kg of crabs.</p><p> \"We are now targeting harvest for the new year and Chinese New Year, and we hope we can produce 1 tonne of crabs to sell,\" said Mr Tahang, 50, head of the crab silvofishery group.</p><p> Said Ms Heng Li Lang, head of climate and liveability at Temasek Foundation: \"We hope that this pilot programme can scale further to drive greater impact for the people and the planet today and for generations to come.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Left: Visitors climbing down from a treehouse on a sandbank island known as Pasir Hitam in Banyuasin Regency in South Sumatra.

The event at The Fullerton Hotel gathered policymakers, industry delegates, representatives of non-government groups, academics and the media. </p><p> In her speech, Fu said the Power Integration Project that Singapore has with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia has been a \"pathfinder\" for a wider regional grid. Under this project, Singapore will import up to 100 megawatts of hydropower from Laos, via Thailand and Malaysia.</p><p> \"The next step is to expand regional energy trading and aim for an Asean-wide power grid,\" she said. The reasons for this are the uneven distribution of renewable energy resources and the intermittency of such power sources, she said.</p><p> On her call for Asean to harmonise standards of climate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), she said: \"This will not only enhance the accountability of our climate actions, but will also support the development of interoperable carbon markets,\" she said.</p><p> Asean and Japan have worked together since 2019 to build MRV capabilities through an initiative known as the Partnership to Strengthen Transparency for Co-Innovation, or Pasti. </p><p> \"The next step is a pilot implementation of greenhouse gas emission monitoring and reporting guidelines across Asean member states,\" she said.</p><p> Another suggestion that she made was for Asean to boost its green value chain -- by building an integrated feedstock pathway for biofuels in the region.</p><p> The regional bloc can also promote and share solutions for sustainable agroforestry, so that these systems can act as carbon sinks, enhance agriculture and lower the risk of forest fires, Fu added.</p><p> Climate change is a pressing issue for Asean's 10 member countries, which are already experiencing the effects of extreme weather. The minister noted that Myanmar recently recorded its highest April temperature of 48.2 degrees Celsius, and that Thailand's heat index exceeded 52 deg C.</p><p> The region is, however, heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, and in urgent need of green financing to make the transition to sustainable energy.</p><p> Fu acknowledged efforts on this front, such as Singapore's launch of the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or Fast-P initiative, that aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk energy-transition projects.</p><p> She called on Asean to pool the experience of all member states and facilitate the sharing of best practices on climate action. </p><p> On its part, Singapore will share data from its Third National Climate Change Study with the Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre, so that the data can be used by member states to craft climate adaptation plans.</p><p> \"It is imperative that Asean work together to accelerate its green transition. Asean can leverage the benefits of regional complementarity, create economies of scale and drive opportunities for green growth,\" said Fu.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu also called for Asean to boost its green value chain.

By 2030, the tax will eventually reach $50 to $80 per tonne of CO2 emissions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Companies can purchase carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided that the carbon projects they invest in meet Singapore's eligibility criteria, which include having permanent emissions reductions, for instance. </p><p> A similar carbon credit agreement was signed between Singapore and Papua New Guinea on Dec 8, 2023, at the United Nations' COP28 climate conference in Dubai. </p><p> In a joint statement on May 27, Singapore's National Climate Change Secretariat, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment said the collaboration between Singapore and Ghana will advance climate ambitions for both countries and channel financing towards climate mitigation efforts. </p><p> The carbon credit projects authorised under the agreement will seek to promote sustainable development and generate benefits for the local communities, such as creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction of environmental pollution. </p><p> Under the agreement, carbon credit project developers will be required to make a contribution equivalent to 5 per cent of the share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana, which helps Ghana to prepare and adjust to the impact of climate change. </p><p> The project developers will also be required to cancel 2 per cent of authorised carbon credits at first issuance, to contribute to the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> The agreement was signed virtually between Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Ghana's Minister of Environment for Science, Technology and Innovation Ophelia Hayford. </p><p> The bilateral agreement comes as Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has already been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. </p><p> A Straits Times report published in July 2023 said the first phase of the project was to start in the last quarter of 2023, with the second phase beginning in 2027. </p><p> The project, which is a collaboration with Singapore-based AJA Climate Solutions, will involve replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield these plantations from potentially damaging climate impact such as floods, heat stress and pests. </p><p> AJA Climate Solutions is focused on generating and managing climate mitigation projects in Africa and South-east Asia. </p><p> The project area within the Kwahu region had been a lush forest about 40 to 50 years ago, but was heavily exploited for timber over the past few decades. </p><p> The deforestation has led to Ghana losing more cocoa hectares year on year, which is damaging for the country economically as it is among the world's largest cocoa producers. </p><p> In the second phase of the forest restoration project, the focus will shift to regenerating native tree species across degraded forests.

In recent times, it has been focusing on infusing sustainability into its cocoa supply chain in the Ivory Coast, in the West African coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Straits Times in April went to the plantations in the Ivory Coast capital Abidjan that provide the cocoa that gets transformed into the finest Barry Callebaut chocolate products. </p><p> The Swiss cocoa giant operates out of over 45 countries, employs a global workforce of more than 13,000 people and generates sales of about 8.1 billion Swiss francs (S$12.1 billion) annually.</p><p> The appetite for chocolate in Asia has grown over the past decade, with cocoa businesses grinding 904,094 tonnes of cocoa in 2022, up from 606,622 tonnes in 2012, according to the Cocoa Association of Asia. </p><p> But non-profit groups have raised concerns over the cost to poor communities in the global South, including Ghana and the Ivory Coast, that farm the popular ingredient and their forests, and which are cleared for cocoa monoculture.</p><p> In May, Barry Callebaut refined and postponed some of its targets to make chocolate sustainable by 2025, because it felt more time was needed -- until 2030 -- for systemic change to take place.</p><p> Mr Nicolas Mounard, Barry Callebaut vice-president for sustainability and farming, told media on April 27 that the company needs five more years to ensure that all its ingredients come from sustainable sources -- those that do not contribute to deforestation and whose products can be traced to the farm where they are produced. </p><p> Sustainable ingredients are expected to make up 75 per cent of production by 2025, said Mr Mounard. He added that the company is working with the European Union to meet its sweeping anti-deforestation law.  </p><p> This aligns with Barry Callebaut's efforts to map its entire supply chain and ensure that cocoa can be traced to plantations that do not encroach on virgin forests.   </p><p> Other efforts have focused on improving farmers' livelihoods through greater yields, with Barry Callebaut expecting to hit its original target of raising by 2025 the incomes of more than 500,000 cocoa farmers in poverty. </p><p> Farmer Noel N'Dri Yao, 53, who owns a plantation in Tiassale, said support from Barry Callebaut has helped him produce 420kg of beans when the bulk of cocoa is harvested. Three years ago, before he joined a cooperative Barry Callebaut works with, he produced about 300kg of beans. </p><p> He earns a living through cocoa farming, like nearly a quarter of the Ivory Coast population, according to data compiled by state regulator Coffee-Cocoa Council.</p><p> As a member of the cooperative, Mr N'Dri Yao gets insecticide, subsidised fertiliser and help from labour groups.</p><p> Speaking in French, Mr N'Dri Yao, who has nine children, said: \"Pest control has become easier after inspection by labour teams helped to uncover pests.\"</p><p> Under Barry Callebaut's agroforestry initiative, he is paid EUR50 (S$73) if 70 non-cocoa saplings survive for six months.</p><p> Agroforestry refers to the cultivation of trees and shrubs alongside agricultural crops to enhance food supply, income and ecological benefits, including siphoning carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p> In the Ivory Coast, Barry Callebaut gives out six species of non-cocoa saplings and trains farmers to care for these seedlings in a way that optimises the growth of shade-loving cocoa trees.</p><p> Said Mr Mounard: \"We're moving away from just distributing saplings because we noticed that farmers are reluctant to touch areas that are already dense with trees, and they tend to not be fans of shade because of fungus.</p><p> \"In exchange for forest services provided by the saplings that survive, we give them cash payments.\"</p><p> Advancing agroforestry simply by supplying saplings is not a silver bullet for re-foresting cocoa plantations, said several non-profit groups.</p><p> Low rates of adoption and tree survival, and a lack of common definitions across companies hinder the deployment and understanding of diverse agroforestry systems at scale, according to a report by the Cocoa Barometer published in December 2022.</p><p> The biennial report is put out by a global network of non-government organisations and trade unions championing sustainability in cocoa, and tackles issues like poverty, deforestation and child labour.</p><p> Mr Bakary Traore, the executive director of Ivory Coast biodiversity non-profit group IDEF, said producers often track sapling growth for an insufficient period of time. Trees, he added, need at least three years before they can be left on their own. </p><p> For Mr Traore, chocolate production can only be sustainable if manufacturers and the Ivory Coast government focus on boosting cocoa quality instead of the quantity by pushing for agroforestry practices and cutting the use of pesticide and fertiliser, which harm the environment and people.</p><p> These smaller yields with better quality will likely lead to higher prices, he added. He said: \"Attitudes of consumers will need to change. They need to accept that you can't have chocolate at low prices, that it's a luxury product.\"</p><p> However, Assistant Professor Chua Yeow Hwee, who teaches economics at Nanyang Technological University, said price remains the main concern for consumers in Singapore when it comes to grocery shopping, \"particularly in an environment with high inflation\".</p><p> There is also a lack of consumer attention to sustainably produced chocolate in Singapore, he added.</p><p> He said: \"We need to provide more accessible information that captures their attention. One way is to have an individual carbon scorecard, whereby we link individuals to their carbon footprint. </p><p> \"This will make choices of sustainable products more noticeable.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Farmers in Tiassale in the Ivory Coast transporting bags of cocoa beans to a cooperative, which acts as an intermediary to sell the beans to groups such as Barry Callebaut.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you once again for the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources. I thank Simon and his team from SIIA for organising this event. This year's edition coincides with some key developments.<br/><br/>2. First, the cost of renewable energy has fallen in recent years. Today, power from renewables has become comparable with those from fossil fuels. The International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, highlighted that the high fossil fuel prices will cement a structural shift in renewable energy being the cheapest source of power generation.<br/><br/>3. Second, many governments around the world are entering elections. There are concerns that the political commitment to tackle climate change might wane in some countries. However, changes in governments do not stop climate change. We must institutionalise climate action, so that they can be more resilient regardless of the political cycles.<br/><br/>4. Third, recent climatic events remind us that realities are changing. The region has experienced blistering heatwaves in recent months; Myanmar recording its highest ever April temperatures of 48.2C; and the Philippines and Thailand seeing record temperatures with new highs and Thailand's heat index listing above 52C.<br/><br/>5. Elsewhere, we see rising incidence in flooding events in Pakistan and China. Last month, northern ASEAN was blanketed with thick haze, and the UAE experienced the heaviest rainfall in 75 years.<br/><br/>6. These have a direct impact on health, the economy, productivity, and food production.<br/><br/>COP28 Global Stocktake<br/><br/>7. The inaugural Global Stocktake at COP28 acknowledged that the world has made some progress on climate action since the Paris Agreement, but emphasised the need for more urgent and decisive climate actions within this critical decade to keep our 1.5C goal within reach.<br/><br/>8. The Global Stocktake was an important milestone, as the international community collectively agreed to move from setting broad-based net zero targets to definitive steps towards the implementation of transition pathways and climate mitigation.<br/><br/>9. When the gavel fell at COP28, there was agreement by all Parties to transition away from fossil fuels in our energy systems, triple renewable energy capacity globally, and double energy efficiency improvements globally by 2030. Parties also agreed to accelerate zero and low-emission technologies, including nuclear, carbon capture, utilisation and storage and low-carbon hydrogen. This may not seem very earth-breaking shattering to industry outsiders, but within the climate circuit, technologies such as nuclear and carbon capture have not always been universally accepted. The fact that they were all mentioned as an acceptable pathway at COP28, to Singapore, a country that requires these technologies, was a significant step. It has a knock-on effect on the industry. It sends a signal to the industry and investors that these are acceptable technologies that will have its place in climate action.<br/><br/>10. It was also significant that Parties further agreed to strengthen their adaptation actions and to implement National Adaptation Plans by 2030. Our planetary ecosystems are intertwined. We have emphasised heavily on mitigation, but the world needs to focus on adaptation as well.<br/><br/>11. There will be resources needed for adaptation plans. We have seen in the Singapore Green Plan that adaptation measures impact our carbon footprint. Adaptation plans such as desalination is energy intensive, and it eats into our carbon footprint and budget. Singapore has included adaptation when we talk about our net zero goals. This means having to also offset carbon emissions incurred by adaptation measures. When countries discuss about their net zero goals, they must also include national adaptation into their climate action plans. It makes mitigation plans more complete and includes in this a significant element that has been missing from some countries' net zero chart. This approach ensures that no sectors or gases, including agriculture and methane emissions, are left out. That is an important move on UNFCCC's part to have our net zero target comprehensive, all-encompassing, and detailed.<br/><br/>12. Singapore is committed to following up on the UAE Consensus adopted at COP28. We have been advancing our transition efforts through the Singapore Green Plan, which includes pursuing efforts in greening the environment, promoting green transportation, pursuing zero waste, and increasing proportion of renewable energy in our energy mix, and adapting to sea level rise.<br/><br/>13. Today, I would like to focus on the opportunities in regional cooperation for green growth.<br/><br/>Green Growth Cooperation in ASEAN<br/><br/>14. A report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) stated that 5 out of the 20 countries most impacted by climate change will be in Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative for the region to accelerate climate action to safeguard lives and protect the economy. ASEAN countries need to ride on the momentum of the Global Stocktake and push ahead with their green ambitions.<br/><br/>15. It is reassuring that there is political consensus for climate action. All ASEAN nations have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and most have set net-zero targets.<br/><br/>16. However, a green, sustainable future cannot be achieved by any one country in isolation. Our collective efforts are more effective when we work together. We need effective partnerships and international cooperation to fast-track our region's energy transition. I would like to highlight some possible areas.<br/><br/>17. First, ASEAN can enhance trade of renewable energy. The Power Integration Project with Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore has been a pathfinder for a wider regional grid. By promoting renewable energy trade, ASEAN not only benefits by decarbonising the power sector, but also strengthens our joint grid resilience. This is well illustrated with the Ukraine-Russian War. Europeans, who relied on the grid that has been working well for the longest time, became more resilient when there was a disruption in the energy supply. We should take lessons from that and work on a resilient regional grid to help ASEAN weather any disruption in the future. The next step is to expand regional energy trading and aim for an ASEAN-wide power grid. The uneven distribution of renewable energy resources and the need to address the associated intermittencies of renewable energy compel us to move in this direction.<br/><br/>18. Second, ASEAN can collaborate to harmonise standards of monitoring, reporting and verification. This will not only enhance the accountability of our climate actions but also support the development of interoperable carbon markets. Since 2019, ASEAN and Japan have worked together through the Partnership to Strengthen Transparency for Co-Innovation (PaSTI), to build capabilities for MRV. The next step is a pilot implementation of greenhouse gas emission monitoring and reporting guidelines across ASEAN Member States.<br/><br/>19. Third, ASEAN can accelerate green value chain integration by leveraging trade complementarities. For example, an integrated feedstock pathway for biofuels in ASEAN can bring about win-win opportunities.<br/><br/>20. Fourth, ASEAN can attract and deploy green capital. As a financial hub, Singapore is supporting the development of transition financing. At COP28, we launched the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships (FAST-P) blended finance initiative to mobilise up to US$5 billion from public and private sector to derisk transition projects. We also launched the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION) with like-minded partners (such as DBS, OCBC, Standard Chartered, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) at COP28 to create solutions for transition credits.<br/><br/>21. Fifth, ASEAN can pool the experience of all Member States and facilitate sharing of best practices to advance climate action. Singapore offers the Sustainability Action Package of capacity-building programmes, which covers climate change adaptation, mitigation, and green finance. We will also be sharing data from the Third National Climate Change Study with ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre, so that the data can be used by ASEAN Member States to make better-informed decisions, particularly in our adaptation plans and strategies.<br/><br/>22. Finally, ASEAN can promote and share solutions for sustainable agroforestry. Properly managed agroforestry systems act as carbon sinks and enhances agricultural production. It helps to lower the risks of forest fires, which in turn will protect the lives and livelihoods of the farmers and local communities.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>23. It is imperative that ASEAN work together to accelerate its green transition. ASEAN can leverage the benefits of regional complementarity, create economies of scale, and drive opportunities for green growth.<br/><br/>24. In so doing, it not only helps ASEAN countries to meet their respective net-zero and sustainable development goals, it also brings prosperity to the 670 million population in the region through green investment and job creation.<br/><br/>25. I hope the 11th Singapore Dialogue for Sustainable World Resources will inspire stakeholders to push for greater regional collaboration, and I would like to thank SIIA once again for their efforts today.<br/><br/>26. I wish you fruitful discussions ahead.

These include carbon capture technologies, forest restoration, swopping pollutive cookstoves for cleaner ones, and renewable energy projects. </p><p> Not all projects can make the cut. In late 2023, Singapore released a set of eligibility criteria to ensure that credits and projects are of high quality. </p><p> For example, in calculating the amount of emissions removed by a mangrove planting project, the calculations must be made in a conservative and transparent way, and measured and verified by an independent third party. </p><p> The National Environment Agency also released a list of specific types of projects or methodologies that Singapore is willing to accept, based on existing carbon crediting programmes. These include international carbon credits that come from offshore wind technology and cleaner cookstoves. </p><p> Internationally, a recent oversupply of carbon credits from renewable energy projects failed to deliver additional climate benefits, noted Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p> How far along is Singapore in trading carbon credits'Of the 19 countries Singapore is collaborating with on carbon credits, two have finalised bilateral agreements with Singapore so far -- Papua New Guinea and Ghana. These are known as implementation agreements. </p><p> This means companies here can buy carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided the carbon projects in Papua New Guinea and Ghana meet Singapore's eligibility criteria. </p><p> Steps must be taken to prevent the double-counting of emission reductions in both the carbon credit buyer (Singapore) and the host country's national greenhouse gas inventories. </p><p> And in each agreement, climate adaptation for the host country and the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions must be prioritised. </p><p> For example, carbon credit project developers must contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana. </p><p> Project developers must also cancel 2 per cent of carbon credits at first issuance, so that those credits will not enter the carbon market. The 2 per cent has the sole purpose of reducing emissions.</p><p> These requirements are based on Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which governs the bilateral trade of carbon credits between countries. </p><p> Of the remaining 17 countries, Singapore has concluded negotiations on similar carbon credit schemes with Vietnam, Paraguay and Bhutan. The next step will be to sign the agreements. </p><p>Singapore has also signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with other countries such as Laos, Indonesia and Fiji, with the intention of collaborating on carbon credits.</p><p> A fair amount of negotiations takes place before an MOU becomes a bilateral agreement, said Ms Low. </p><p> \"This would include an assessment of the respective countries' climate targets and level of ambition and whether the respective countries have arrangements in place to transparently report on their greenhouse gas inventories,\" she added. </p><p> It took 10 months for Singapore and Ghana to conclude negotiations on their deal.</p><p> As at May, only one carbon credit transaction under Article 6.2 has taken place between Thailand and Switzerland. </p><p> According to a carbon market explainer by The Nature Conservancy, such international transactions will take time, and bilateral agreements are only the first step.</p><p> \"Countries still have several additional steps, such as providing letters of authorisation, complying with reporting requirements and, once the project is concluded, starting monitoring and verification processes. Only after the first monitoring cycle is completed can the first issuance and first transfer (of credits) take place,\" stated the report.</p><p> Checks by ST in January revealed that Singapore companies looking to buy carbon credits from Papua New Guinea must wait longer for eligible projects that are of high quality, as none of the available credits for sale currently meets the criteria set by the Singapore Government. </p><p> On June 20, it was announced that more than 100,000 improved cookstoves will be distributed to communities in Papua New Guinea that still rely on open-fire cooking. This project was approved by carbon crediting programme Verra. </p><p> The project's developer, Tasman Environmental Markets, said it is working with Singapore and Papua New Guinea to finalise the approval of its project under both countries' carbon credit agreement. </p><p> In July, Verra suspended 27 cookstove projects over allegations of over-issuance of millions of carbon credits, Ms Low pointed out.</p><p> \"So, it remains to be seen if cookstove projects in Papua New Guinea will eventually be eligible for use under Singapore's framework,\" she said.</p><p> Ms Low added that the authorities are organising a business mission to Ghana in July, and this may help companies in Singapore explore opportunities there. </p><p> How does carbon trading benefit Singapore and the host country'Carbon markets help to channel funds to nature-based and underfunded forest conservation projects that would not otherwise have been implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives. </p><p> Carbon projects can further the sustainable development of host countries, benefit local communities in terms of job creation and access to clean resources, and improve their energy security. Environmental pollution can also be reduced while protecting the rights of indigenous groups. </p><p> Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. It involves replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield the plantations from disasters and pests. </p><p> Jobs in farming and agroforestry training will be created, and there will be new income opportunities for indigenous communities. The verification of carbon credits from the Ghana project will begin in 2028.</p><p> As for Singapore, buying carbon credits can benefit carbon-tax-liable firms as the tax is set to increase. The carbon tax in 2024 has increased to $25 per tonne of CO2 emissions, up from $5 per tonne previously. By 2030, the tax will eventually reach $50 to $80 per tonne. </p><p> Companies can potentially cut their carbon tax liability if they can procure carbon credits that are lower than the prevailing tax rate of $25 per tonne, noted Ms Low. </p><p> Being an alternative-energy-disadvantaged country, Singapore can tap carbon credits to meet its national climate targets, also known as NDCs. </p><p> But this will have trade-offs for the host country. The more credits a host country exports to Singapore, the less mitigation can be claimed against its own climate goals, stated The Nature Conservancy explainer. </p><p> \"Even when domestic frameworks are in place, a more complex issue will arise as host countries define what sectors, how many units at what price they could transfer internationally without undermining the achievement of their NDCs,\" the report stated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. photo: genzero</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-4NB1DL9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CFM-TMF1-JCF2-801V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1340\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This leads to a continuous decrease in yield and threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods. Regenerative farming, on the other hand, solves climate adaptation and mitigation.

This unlocks higher farm-gate prices for farmers that RegenX supports through post-harvesting guidance and regenerative agriculture monitoring.</p><p>In turn, better farming economics incentivises regenerative practices, creating more supply for RegenX ingredients that buyers can secure, enabling a virtuous cycle. This approach sequesters more carbon, improves soil health, and fosters biodiversity and water conservation.</p><p>Using farming systems encompassing intercropping, agroforestry, and the elimination of harmful pesticides and herbicides, RegenX reduces farmers' input costs and aims at sequestering 100 Megatons of CO2e annually-or ~8 per cent of the 1.3 Gigatons of CO2eq emitted on Southeast Asian agricultural farmland.</p><p>This could regenerate 6 million hectares of arable land in Southeast Asia while significantly improving farmers' livelihoods and resilience to climate change.</p><p>\"The crux of having a sustainable agrifood production system is to make regenerative agriculture more profitable for farmers than conventional agriculture, and to do so in a commercially viable way. Though it may seem deceptively simple, executing has always been a huge challenge.

Another edition of the World Economic Forum (WEF) has come to an end -- but what have we learnt? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Compared with a year ago, the world seems a somewhat different place. Right before the start of the gathering in Davos, WEF released its annual Global Risks Report, effectively a survey of some 1,500 global leaders across business, academia, government and others. Last year, the cost-of-living crisis topped the near-term concerns, alongside nature risks and geo-economic confrontation. This year, the tone is different. \"Misinformation and disinformation\" led the list of near-term fears, with \"societal polarisation\" not far behind. </p><p> In a year in which some four billion people are eligible to vote in an election, conversations at Davos struck a markedly more geopolitical tone. Among the first to open this year of elections, Taiwan has already gone to the polls to vote through a third term of the ruling government, while the United States election will take centre stage later in the year. Markets remain undecided on the outcome, even as discussions on geopolitical conflicts seeped their way into the Davos formal and informal nightcap sessions.</p><p> One thing remains unchanged. While perceptions of near-term risks have shifted, nature risks top the 10-year outlook. Extreme weather events, critical changes to Earth's systems and biodiversity loss head the list of concerns. And with good reason. 2023 was, like the preceding year, the warmest year on record. At a nature dinner organised by Lombard Odier to kick off the week in Davos, Professor Johan Rockstrom reminded the audience that it is now inevitable that the world will overshoot the key 1.5 degree Celsius target, with a best outcome likely seeing increases to at least 1.7 deg C or 1.8 deg C in the coming decades, before we have a hope of returning to the 1.5 deg C target.</p><p> On the Promenade, a central road running through Davos, the sustainability billboards have largely disappeared. Instead, discussions on how to tackle transitions to net zero and, increasingly, a nature-positive economy, have moved from the outdoor signboards to panel discussions and fireside encounters. </p><p> Virtue-signalling is no longer the name of the game; figuring out who has the right strategy and partnerships to quickly adopt cleaner, greener and more efficient business models that can disrupt entire industries is the new play in town. A lone billboard that still declares \"sustainability is just a few steps away!\" feels eerily out of place. Inside the improvised meeting rooms that transform a skiing village into a meeting place for the global who's who, it is all too clear that these transitions will be far from easy, but may yet allow those with the right strategy to leapfrog forward.</p><p> Getting behind AIOutside, other billboards vie for attention. Replacing the proclamations of net-zero commitments are the new signs advertising each business' respective breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). A year ago, the sudden emergence of generative AI was already the word on the snowy streets of Davos. In 2024, AI and discussions on its myriad disruptive effects were on the agenda everywhere. The shift in advertising focus from sustainability to AI is perhaps a sensible one: one represents the challenge, whereas digitally enabled optimisation and innovation may well be a central part of the solution. </p><p> Besides AI, the wooden interiors of the Davos chalets and meeting rooms perhaps provided an appropriate setting for the other topic that ascended up the WEF agenda: nature. From sessions on risks to the global food system, to a heavily over-subscribed \"nature positive dinner\", WEF participants sought to come to grips with an inevitable and increasingly clear realisation: for all the maladies and opportunities facing the global economy, the economy is vitally dependent on the ecosystem services provided by natural capital, the world's single most productive asset. </p><p> The solutions too are beginning to emerge. Recognising the not-so-hidden value of nature is but a mere first step. Encouraging markets to adequately value and allocate capital to its preservation and restoration is the much greater challenge. Shortly before Davos, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures announced that an initial cohort of 320 businesses had signed up to its much-awaited framework aiming to drive the disclosure of nature risks and opportunities. In other roundtables, financial institutions looking to engage on nature recognised that allocation capital to nature-based solutions at scale, in fact, requires us to reconsider asset allocations -- with nature emerging as a new asset class. </p><p> At Lombard Odier's own \"re-nature\" dinner, speakers and the audience explored opportunities to put theory into action, highlighting investment opportunities around the development of regenerative value chains. Coffee is a US$225 billion example, dominated by production from tropical monocultures, often characterised by falling yields and degraded soils, and with as much as half of all coffee production at risk from climate change. Transforming extractive models to ones based on agroforestry and rewilding, and a shortening of value chains to consumers, may be part of the solution to begin to drive more capital to nature at speed and scale. </p><p> Keeping up with a fast-moving worldSo in the end, did Davos 2024 change the world? Perhaps that would be too high an expectation. The world is moving quickly, and perhaps the business community assembled at Davos was struggling to keep up. But, in a year where concern over misinformation and societal cohesion is rife, this year's theme of Rebuilding Trust appeared well-chosen. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer released just before the event, global levels of trust in institutions and leaders have been on the decline, but businesses today are more trusted than government leaders. With innovation and new global challenges facing business leaders and investors, maintaining that trust requires a balancing act. </p><p> To investors, there are plenty of takeaways. Transitions to a decarbonised economy are accelerating. Parallel concerns over energy security, energy affordability and clean energy all point to the single solution of a further ramp-up in investment in new energy systems. Transformation of value chains to more regenerative alternatives will drive investment to new technologies, business models and nature-based solutions. AI will accelerate all of these transitions, enabling solutions that outcompete existing alternatives in terms of efficiency, environmental impact and financial returns. The transition is in motion, and investors on board the Davos trains appeared to be on board. </p><p> The writer is head of sustainability research at Lombard Odier Investment Managers</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Nature was among the top concerns at the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, as participants came to grips with the fact that the global economy is vitally dependent on the ecosystem services provided by natural capital.

These credits may also be used to offset Singapore's national emissions.</p><p> The Singapore government has allowed companies to use high-quality, international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions, in lieu of paying the carbon tax. It is currently at S$5 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, but will be raised to S$25 in 2024 and 2025, and then S$45 in 2026 and beyond. </p><p> The plan is for the carbon tax to reach between S$50 and S$80 per tonne by 2030. </p><p> Carbon credits that come with corresponding adjustments mean that the emissions being offset is only counted once by the country that bought the credits, while the country that produced them would give up the right to use the credits to meet their own national targets. This is to avoiding the double counting of underlying emissions reductions or removals when carbon credits are traded.</p><p> The project is expected to generate around 20 million carbon credits over 30 years and intends to apply new methodologies under Verra -- a widely-used standard in the certification of carbon credits -- and be aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. </p><p> The MOU comes after governments of both countries have concluded negotiations on an implementation agreement that enabled the bilateral transfer of carbon credits, which is aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.</p><p> The article governs how countries can pursue voluntary cooperation to achieve their national net-zero targets, through the use of carbon credits. </p><p> The upcoming project, which is slated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, is located in the greater Kwahu area in the east of Ghana, and aims to regenerate an estimated 100,000 hectares of degraded lands, restore the landscape's biodiversity and transform it into an economically-productive ecosystem for the local indigenous population, said the Temasek-owned investment company in a media release. </p><p> It also aims to create new income opportunities for the local indigenous communities through agroforestry practices training and job creation, and empower 22,000 members of the local community with the opportunity to actively participate in the farming system and improve their livelihoods.</p><p> The first phase of the project will focus on regenerating deforested cocoa lands and rewilding off-reserve forests across Kwahu East, Kwahu South and Asante Akim North. </p><p> The second phase, targeted to start in 2027, will focus on regenerating native tree species across degraded forests at the Kwahu Afram Plains. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-QD2N6PU</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DS-DJD1-JCF2-80MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The creation of a new lake in the 1960s led to further deforestation.</p><p> The deforestation has led to Ghana losing more cocoa hectares year on year, which is damaging for the country economically as it is among the world's largest cocoa producers.</p><p> The project will involve replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield these plantations from potentially damaging climate impacts such as floods, heat stress and pests. </p><p> In the second phase, the focus will be on regenerating native tree species across degraded forests at the Kwahu Afram Plains, said GenZero. </p><p> More than 20 million native species seedlings will be planted over seven years.</p><p> Jobs in farming and agroforestry training will be created, and new income opportunities will emerge for the local indigenous communities, empowering some 22,000 families, said Mr Mason. </p><p> At the same time, conducive habitats will be created for biodiversity to thrive.</p><p> The verification of carbon credits from the Ghana project will then begin in 2028. </p><p> Asked about GenZero's considerations when embarking on the project, Mr Teo said the company evaluates several factors, such as its quality and commercial viability, and the timeframe needed for the project to achieve positive climate impact. </p><p> Additionality -- which essentially means the project will exist only as a result of the sale of carbon credits -- is another important consideration, he said. </p><p> From a governance and policy standpoint, Ghana has a clear climate change policy, committed climate mitigation targets, and a comprehensive carbon credit framework at play, said GenZero. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The degraded landscape in Kwahu, Ghana.

The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will rise by almost 90 per cent to 5.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over the same period.Mitigation gapThat growth rate will pose a challenge for the region to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The food, land and agriculture sector should reduce emissions by 72 per cent from base-year levels by 2050, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, according to the Science Based Targets Initiative.Ending deforestation - which occurs not only when land is cleared for livestock, but also to grow feed for animals - has the potential in most major Asian markets to lower the most emissions from the protein supply chain, ARE said.But even in the best-case scenario, in which the region achieves zero deforestation and peak industrial production by 2030, protein supply chains will not be able to sufficiently reduce emissions to be \"climate safe\" by sticking to conventional protein, which consists of meat, seafood, dairy and eggs. </p><p>To make up for that shortfall, consumption must shift significantly towards alternative protein, ARE said. Alternative proteins comprise plant-based and fermentation-derived meat substitutes, and cultivated meat.Take China, for instance. The world's largest consumer and producer of proteins, China's total annual protein consumption is expected to reach 24.9 million tonnes by 2060 under business-as-usual conditions, by ARE's estimate. That will place China's emissions at 17.9 gigatonnes of CO2e over what the country can afford in order to be climate safe. The best-case scenario from deforestation, food-waste reduction and other mitigation measures apart from transitioning to alternative proteins will reduce emissions by just 13.7 gigatonnes, leaving a shortfall of 4.2 gigatonnes.If China can switch half of its protein consumption to alternative proteins by 2050, that will reduce emissions by a further 3.8 gigatonnes, which would take the country closer to what is required to achieve net zero, ARE said.The non-protein-transition mitigation measures were insufficient in most of a further nine Asian markets that ARE analysed: India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Given that the non-protein-transition estimates were done on a best-case basis, ARE argued that transitioning towards alternative proteins is critical for the region to hit climate targets.Slow goingARE said that protein companies in Asia are slow to decarbonise. Of the 158 Asia-listed protein companies reviewed by ARE, none acknowledged the risk of deforestation-linked soya in their supply chains.While leading Chinese food companies are taking initial steps to evaluate deforestation risks in their supply chains and sourcing soya certified as \"deforestation-free\", few Chinese commodity companies, animal producers, retailers and restaurants have established verified sourcing or committed to zero deforestation, ARE said.Protein transition is still a developing space for banks in the region, ARE added. For instance, DBS has held off on committing to net-zero targets for the food and agribusiness segment, citing the lack of data and effective mitigation solutions in the sector.\"The opportunity in Asia for a first mover offering protein transition finance remains wide open\", ARE said.Still, a gradual transition to alternative proteins could be underfoot. A report by food company Kerry Group showed that 28 per cent of consumers in the Asia-Pacific have cut their meat consumption significantly, and another 32 per cent are actively trying to.Tasty opportunitiesThis could create more opportunities for alternative-protein producers. Mirte Gosker, managing director of the Good Food Institute Asia Pacific think tank, said that \"plant-based meat, seafood, and dairy companies are currently best-positioned to capitalise on this market opportunity because their manufacturing infrastructure is more mature, compared to relatively nascent segments of the alternative-protein field like cultivated meat\".\"Asian consumers are open-minded when it comes to alternative proteins - but only if products match or exceed the taste, nutrition, freshness, and affordability consumers currently associate with conventional meat and seafood,\" Gosker said.Doing so will require substantially more investment from public and private stakeholders into open-access research and development, she added. This will involve extensive product localisation to cater to the diversity of flavours across Asian culinary cultures.Rather than rushing the process and \"releasing sub-par foods into the market\", she urged alternative-protein investors to provide companies with \"patient capital\" to sustain their research and development in the long run. This will help to build the sector's reputation with consumers.Nicole Lee, food-tech programme manager at venture accelerator Brinc, said non-meat proteins are not a novel idea. Plant-based products such as tofu, tempeh and bean curd have long existed in Asian cuisine. The struggle lies in letting consumers distinguish traditional \"mock meat\" from new alternative protein, and making these products price competitive, she said.One relatively new area of alternative proteins worth watching is blended products, Lee said.Blended or hybrid products refer to plant-based protein products enhanced with the technology of cultivated meat. Using cultivated animal cells helps to make the plant-based protein taste and feel more like real meat, or increase its nutritional value.Freighter ship U-turningHowever, many critical gaps remain. For one, expanding the production of alternative proteins for mass consumption requires the development of Asia's technical talent pipeline, Gosker said.When it comes to completely eradicating animal agriculture, Lee is skeptical: \"I don't think that's reasonable... a lot of people's livelihoods still depend on agriculture, but I think the reality of our current system is that too much of our meat comes from extremely industrial warehouse farms.\"\u00c2\u00a0David Heng, chief executive of private equity impact investment firm ABC Impact, noted that \"many farmers in Asia still rely on conventional farming methods that are resource-intensive and environmentally damaging\".Facilitating the adoption of sustainable practices, such as organic farming, precision agriculture and agroforestry, may require extensive education, training, and technical support, he added.To enable the protein transition, Asian banks, food companies and governments must integrate and scale up alternative proteins into sustainable business strategies.\"Reimagining Asia's protein supply is akin to making a U-turn in a freighter ship,\" Gosker said. \"It's achievable, but requires that nations collaborate to further expand regional alternative-protein manufacturing infrastructure and rapidly coordinate regulatory frameworks.\"\"Failure to do so will mean that the compounding pressures of ecological and supply-chain instability will grow, resulting in a food system that falls woefully short of satisfying rising demand.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>China will reduce its emissions by some 3.8 gigatonnes of CO2e if it can switch half of its protein consumption to alternative proteins by 2050.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NC-H471-DYX4-01SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1252\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The corresponding greenhouse gas emissions will rise by almost 90 per cent to 5.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over the same period.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Mitigation gapThat growth rate will pose a challenge for the region to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The food, land and agriculture sector should reduce emissions by 72 per cent from base-year levels by 2050, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, according to the Science Based Targets Initiative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Ending deforestation -- which occurs not only when land is cleared for livestock, but also to grow feed for animals -- has the potential in most major Asian markets to lower the most emissions from the protein supply chain, ARE said.</p><p> But even in the best-case scenario, in which the region achieves zero deforestation and peak industrial production by 2030, protein supply chains will not be able to sufficiently reduce emissions to be \"climate safe\" by sticking to conventional protein, which consists of meat, seafood, dairy and eggs. </p><p> To make up for that shortfall, consumption must shift significantly towards alternative protein, ARE said. Alternative proteins comprise plant-based and fermentation-derived meat substitutes, and cultivated meat.</p><p> Take China, for instance. The world's largest consumer and producer of proteins, China's total annual protein consumption is expected to reach 24.9 million tonnes by 2060 under business-as-usual conditions, by ARE's estimate. That will place China's emissions at 17.9 gigatonnes of CO2e over what the country can afford in order to be climate safe. </p><p> The best-case scenario from deforestation, food-waste reduction and other mitigation measures apart from transitioning to alternative proteins will reduce emissions by just 13.7 gigatonnes, leaving a shortfall of 4.2 gigatonnes.</p><p> If China can switch half of its protein consumption to alternative proteins by 2050, that will reduce emissions by a further 3.8 gigatonnes, which would take the country closer to what is required to achieve net zero, ARE said.</p><p> The non-protein-transition mitigation measures were insufficient in most of a further nine Asian markets that ARE analysed: India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. Given that the non-protein-transition estimates were done on a best-case basis, ARE argued that transitioning towards alternative proteins is critical for the region to hit climate targets.</p><p> Slow goingARE said that protein companies in Asia are slow to decarbonise. Of the 158 Asia-listed protein companies reviewed by ARE, none acknowledged the risk of deforestation-linked soya in their supply chains.</p><p> While leading Chinese food companies are taking initial steps to evaluate deforestation risks in their supply chains and sourcing soya certified as \"deforestation-free\", few Chinese commodity companies, animal producers, retailers and restaurants have established verified sourcing or committed to zero deforestation, ARE said.</p><p> Protein transition is still a developing space for banks in the region, ARE added. For instance, DBS has held off on committing to net-zero targets for the food and agribusiness segment, citing the lack of data and effective mitigation solutions in the sector.</p><p> \"The opportunity in Asia for a first mover offering protein transition finance remains wide open\", ARE said.</p><p> Still, a gradual transition to alternative proteins could be underfoot. A report by food company Kerry Group showed that 28 per cent of consumers in the Asia-Pacific have cut their meat consumption significantly, and another 32 per cent are actively trying to.</p><p> This could create more opportunities for alternative-protein producers. Mirte Gosker, managing director of the Good Food Institute Asia Pacific think tank, said that \"plant-based meat, seafood, and dairy companies are currently best-positioned to capitalise on this market opportunity because their manufacturing infrastructure is more mature, compared to relatively nascent segments of the alternative-protein field like cultivated meat\".</p><p> \"Asian consumers are open-minded when it comes to alternative proteins -- but only if products match or exceed the taste, nutrition, freshness, and affordability consumers currently associate with conventional meat and seafood,\" Gosker said.</p><p> Doing so will require substantially more investment from public and private stakeholders into open-access research and development, she added. This will involve extensive product localisation to cater to the diversity of flavours across Asian culinary cultures.</p><p> Rather than rushing the process and \"releasing sub-par foods into the market\", she urged alternative-protein investors to provide companies with \"patient capital\" to sustain their research and development in the long run. This will help to build the sector's reputation with consumers.</p><p> Nicole Lee, food-tech programme manager at venture accelerator Brinc, said non-meat proteins are not a novel idea. Plant-based products such as tofu, tempeh and bean curd have long existed in Asian cuisine. The struggle lies in letting consumers distinguish traditional \"mock meat\" from new alternative protein, and making these products price competitive, she said.</p><p> One relatively new area of alternative proteins worth watching is blended products, Lee said.</p><p> Blended or hybrid products refer to plant-based protein products enhanced with the technology of cultivated meat. Using cultivated animal cells helps to make the plant-based protein taste and feel more like real meat, or increase its nutritional value.</p><p> Freighter ship U-turningHowever, many critical gaps remain. For one, expanding the production of alternative proteins for mass consumption requires the development of Asia's technical talent pipeline, Gosker said.</p><p> When it comes to completely eradicating animal agriculture, Lee is skeptical: \"I don't think that's reasonable... a lot of people's livelihoods still depend on agriculture, but I think the reality of our current system is that too much of our meat comes from extremely industrial warehouse farms.\" </p><p> David Heng, chief executive of private equity impact investment firm ABC Impact, noted that \"many farmers in Asia still rely on conventional farming methods that are resource-intensive and environmentally damaging\".</p><p> Facilitating the adoption of sustainable practices, such as organic farming, precision agriculture and agroforestry, may require extensive education, training, and technical support, he added.</p><p> To enable the protein transition, Asian banks, food companies and governments must integrate and scale up alternative proteins into sustainable business strategies.</p><p> \"Reimagining Asia's protein supply is akin to making a U-turn in a freighter ship,\" Gosker said. \"It's achievable, but requires that nations collaborate to further expand regional alternative-protein manufacturing infrastructure and rapidly coordinate regulatory frameworks.\"</p><p> \"Failure to do so will mean that the compounding pressures of ecological and supply-chain instability will grow, resulting in a food system that falls woefully short of satisfying rising demand.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>China will reduce its emissions by some 3.8 gigatonnes of CO2e if it can switch half of its protein consumption to alternative proteins by 2050.

That is a quarter of the estimated global CO2 emissions from human activity in 2022.</p><p> An estimated 2.7 billion hectares, or the combined area of China and Russia, must be further protected to achieve the 30 per cent goal.</p><p> The findings were derived by the Singapore and US conservation scientists using satellite images and statistics to model the benefits of doubling the amount of protected land areas by 2030.</p><p> Ocean and marine protection was not covered by the study led by the National University of Singapore Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions (CNCS). </p><p> Currently, almost 17 per cent of the planet's land area is protected from degradation and deforestation, according to online database Protected Planet.</p><p> On Wednesday, negotiations on a global target to protect at least 30 per cent of the planet's land and ocean by 2030 will begin at the United Nations' COP15 biodiversity conference in Montreal. </p><p> A few countries have already reached the target. More than 50 per cent of Bhutan and Luxembourg's land areas are protected.</p><p> But in land-scarce Singapore, only close to 5 per cent of its land is currently protected, and that includes its four nature reserves.</p><p> Dr Zeng Yiwen, research assistant professor at CNCS and lead author of the 30 per cent modelling study, said: \"The integration of nature into Singapore's landscape and various infrastructure is likely a good way of trying to maximise the amount of biodiversity benefits and ecosystem services given our existing limitations.\"</p><p> His paper, published in scientific journal Science Advances in June, modelled global land protection through nine scenarios.</p><p> One scenario prioritises preserving nature areas that are far away from human settlements and are not threatened by deforestation. Countries and regions could start eyeing those places because they might be easier to protect.</p><p> But many of those places tend to be the \"rock and ice\" areas that are not rich in biodiversity, such as northern Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia. </p><p> Furthermore, when land is gazetted for protection, indigenous communities and populations that rely on the land for their livelihoods could get hurt. Opponents of the nature-saving ambition have called it \"the biggest land grab in history\".</p><p> To find a middle ground, Dr Zeng said a portion of the protected land should allow for sustainable human activities such as ecotourism or agroforestry projects. </p><p> Avoided carbon emissions from a protected area could also be available to carbon markets, and this is where Singapore could play an important role, as it aspires to be a carbon services hub, said Dr Zeng.</p><p> For Dr Zeng, a conservation ecologist, what matters to him is what happens after the COP15 conference in Montreal. </p><p> \"How will governments fund the increase of protected areas? There is a huge cost for this, including the cost for establishing and managing protected areas.

Other types of projects, such as those that use technology to suck up carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, will be listed in the second half of this year.</p><p> As forests can take in planet-warming CO2 from the air through photosynthesis, every unit of CO2 absorbed by a forest can be sold as a credit.</p><p> There are currently about 10 to 15 such projects on the platform, including the Tambopata-Bahuaja Biodiversity Reserve located in the Peruvian Amazon.</p><p> The agroforestry project, which spans an area roughly the size of Los Angeles, entails the restoration of degraded areas there. Help is also given to local farmers to help them transition to sustainable cocoa production, reducing their need to cut down trees in the area.</p><p> CIX chief executive Mikkel Larsen said credits from nature-based solutions typically range from US$12 (S$16.35) to US$17 per credit.</p><p> He said he expects those listed on Project Marketplace will be \"on the higher end\", although the price will ultimately depend on the supplier.</p><p> The global trade in carbon credits essentially entails treating carbon as a commodity.</p><p> Each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions, so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions.</p><p> CO2, produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change.</p><p> Companies or countries that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits - essentially paying someone else to reduce emissions on their behalf.</p><p> CIX, which was jointly established last year by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek to facilitate the trade of carbon credits, said its marketplace will enable businesses of all sizes to participate in the voluntary carbon market.</p><p> The platform can also be used to \"retire\" the credits so they are never to be traded or swapped again, to ensure carbon savings are not double-counted.</p><p> The launch of the marketplace comes as the Government announced last month that large emitters in Singapore that have to pay a carbon tax can, from 2024, buy international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions.</p><p> Mr Larsen said creating marketplaces defined by transparency and integrity is of utmost importance for a rapidly evolving landscape like the voluntary carbon market, especially during periods of uncertainty.</p><p> \"Responsible corporates are looking for assurance that the credits they buy will deliver tangible, lasting climate impact... Our aim is to engender greater confidence amongst buyers and sellers of carbon credits,\" said Mr Larsen.</p><p> \"To achieve that goal, we focus on curating quality credits and offering credible data, insights and practical guidance to our wider community.\"</p><p> Project Marketplace will feature third-party ratings, supplemented with satellite monitoring technology data, of the various carbon projects listed on it.</p><p> Sylvera, a firm that provides data on nature-based offset projects, will provide information such as the permanence of the carbon removal, co-benefits of nature-based projects and risk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1029894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6511-H0F1-DYX4-003W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Human beings are displacing the planet's other species at an unprecedented rate, a disaster that the landmark UN Biodiversity Conference known as COP15 is focused on this week in Montreal. We are a unique menace, but we at least have a unique ability to recognise it and do something about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The first step towards recovery, of course, is admitting your problem, and the conference's draft plan warns upfront that a million species will face extinction if we do not clean up our act. But while the delegates in Montreal are pointing fingers at everything from plastics to pesticides to invasive species, biodiversity loss is not that complicated a mystery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The basic problem is that we have converted half of the earth's habitable land into agricultural land. We are destroying and degrading the habitats of other species to grow food for our own.</p><p> This means the fate of the world's bugs, bunnies and other creatures and critters -- and what is left of the forests, wetlands and other habitats they call home -- depends more than anything else on what we put in our mouths and how it gets made. Unfortunately, telling people what to eat and farmers how to farm are politically unpalatable tasks, which helps explain why yakfests like COP15 tend to obscure the problem with word salad.</p><p> Environmentalists hope to leave Montreal with commitments from governments to preserve 30 per cent of the earth by 2030 and to meet 21 other targets. But governments have already failed to achieve less ambitious conservation goals set for 2010 and 2020. There is also buzz around nailing down corporate commitments to greener supply chains, but COP15 is mostly dancing around the crux of the biodiversity crisis.</p><p> The crux is that if current eating and farming trends continue, the world will clear land equal to at least 1 1/4  Indias by 2050. That would be a disaster for the climate and wildlife, dooming carbon-rich and biodiverse ecosystems such as the Amazon and Congo rainforests.</p><p> So those eating and farming trends better not continue. Humanity needs to start shrinking our agricultural footprint and expanding our natural footprint, after thousands of years of doing the reverse.</p><p> This will be an extraordinary challenge, because we will also need to produce more than 7.4 quadrillion additional calories every year to feed our growing population, in an era when climate-fuelled droughts, heatwaves, floods, and blights could make it harder to grow food.</p><p> You can see why word salad can seem more appetising.</p><p> You can also see why promises to conserve land or promote deforestation-free products can ring hollow. Governments can pledge to ban land clearing, but when their people get hungry, land will get cleared. Some companies might sign agreements to avoid soya or beef from newly deforested land, but it would not do much if other companies keep buying soya or beef from newly deforested land.</p><p> If we are serious about cleaning up the mess we are making for less influential species, there are four things individuals as well as nations and corporations can do.</p><p> What we can doThe first is to eat less meat, which would be a lot easier if meat were not so beloved and delicious. Limiting access to cheeseburgers can turn politicians into former politicians, so it is no coincidence that the Montreal draft mentions changing diets only in passing in its 16th target. But the inconvenient truth is that when we eat cows, chickens and other livestock, we might as well be eating macaws, jaguars and other endangered species.</p><p> That is because livestock chew up far more land per calorie than crops. Producing beef is 100 times as land-intensive as cultivating potatoes, and 55 times as land-intensive as peas or nuts. Livestock now use nearly 80 per cent of agricultural land while producing less than 20 per cent of calories. Cattle are the leading driver of deforestation in the Amazon, followed by soya beans, another commodity, which get fed to pigs and chickens.</p><p> Meat consumption is expected to increase dramatically as billions of the global poor escape poverty. If Americans continue to average three burgers a week while the developing world starts to follow our path, it is hard to see how the Amazon survives.</p><p> But it is at least possible that we could shrink agricultural footprint by shifting our diets towards meat made without livestock, like the plant-based substitutes offered by companies such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat or maybe someday cultured meat grown from animal cells.</p><p> The next thing we need to do is waste less food. About a third of the food grown is lost or tossed before it reaches our mouths, which means a third of the land (as well as the water, fertiliser and other resources) used to grow that food is also wasted. But the Montreal text includes only a single mention of the need to \"halve per capita global food waste\", with no suggestions of what technological, behavioural and policy changes could help to meet such an ambitious goal.</p><p> Every hectare of land matters, because we desperately need to grow more food, provide habitats for more native flora and fauna and store more carbon to limit climate change. And that is why it is particularly crazy to use the earth's limited land to grow fuel. </p><p> The third way to ease the global land squeeze would be to stop using productive farmland for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel -- and to stop burning trees for power -- but the Montreal plan does not even address the topic.</p><p> In fact, there is global momentum to expand bioenergy's dominion over the land. A new paper in the journal Nature estimates that new European Union policies could wipe out half the continent's most biodiverse grasslands and divert a fifth of its cropland to energy crops, which would lead to land clearing overseas to replace the lost food. The EU is also promoting wood-burning power plants, a recipe for massive forest cutting around the world.</p><p> Farm and forest interests have so much political power that government efforts to increase demand for crops and wood are often considered untouchable. But if biodiversity is a real priority, they cannot be.</p><p> Finally, if we are going to shrink our agricultural footprint enough to stop deforestation and hopefully restore some degraded ecosystems, so they can once again serve as wildlife habitats and carbon sinks, farmers will have to supersize their yields enough to make a lot more food with a lot less land. And while the 20th-century's Green Revolution raised yields by using fossil fuel-derived fertilisers, toxic pesticides and other environmentally damaging innovations, the 21st century will require some greener ones that can ramp up productivity without messing up the planet.</p><p> Once again, this does not seem like a priority in Montreal. There has been much more focus on regenerative agriculture, agroforestry and other gentler, lower-yield alternatives to intensive industrial farming that can improve biodiversity on farmland. The problem is that they can require more farmland to produce the same amount of food, accelerating the destruction of the natural lands that provide far more biodiversity than farmland ever can -- and suck far more heat-trapping carbon from our overloaded atmosphere.</p><p> Earth now has more than 5 billion ha of agricultural land, an area twice the size of North America. Adding more is the surest way to wipe out more species -- and maybe, someday, our own.

But in none of these meetings is there a sufficient focus on how and what chief executives and businesses are struggling with in terms of a climate action playbook,\" he said.</p><p> Over the past two years, there has been a surge in the number of companies making net-zero declarations as nations pursue a \"green recovery\" from the Covid-19 pandemic in a way that also deals with the threats posed by climate change. But there are obstacles on the way towards achieving this, Mr Verghese said.</p><p> The first is the difficulty in measuring the carbon footprint of a company due to the lack of an internationally recognised measurement system.</p><p> Having a proper measurement system would allow firms to deal with the second challenge of decarbonisation: Identifying where emissions can be reduced.</p><p> DBS Group chief executive Piyush Gupta, who was also a panellist at the event, said that another obstacle is lack of international agreements about what constitutes a green transition pathway.</p><p> One of the biggest points of contention, for example, is whether natural gas is a \"transition fuel\", especially for developing economies. This is because natural gas is a cleaner fuel than coal and oil, but it is still fossil fuel. If burned, it will contribute to the planetary crisis confronting humanity today.</p><p> Lastly, businesses must find ways to work with their supply chain. Each company is but a tiny cog in the wheel, Mr Verghese said, but working with partners will enable the change to be scaled up.</p><p> Other panellists at the discussion included Ms Herry Cho, managing director and head of sustainability and sustainable finance at the Singapore Exchange (SGX), and Standard Chartered Bank group CEO Bill Winters.</p><p> Ms Cho said it is crucial for companies to develop a credible pathway to achieve their decarbonisation goal to avoid having their targets dismissed as \"greenwashing\".</p><p> Absolute emissions reductions must be pursued first, the panellists agreed. But beyond that, it will be hard to get rid of certain emissions completely. On that front, carbon credits could be used to offset some of those emissions.</p><p> When a company buys a carbon credit, it essentially pays others to reduce emissions on its behalf. These credits can be bought from firms that develop projects that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, such as a forest conservation project.</p><p> Another key issue raised by the panellists was financing and channelling capital to sustai-nable solutions.</p><p> Mr Gupta said the \"green push\" is opening new business opportunities in areas such as green buildings, alternative proteins and new low-carbon fuels. But beyond that, financiers such as banks must also bear in mind the risk of continued investments in pollutive industries such as coal.</p><p> \"If I (fund) a thermal coal project today, with a 20-or 25-year loan, there is a high likelihood that 10 years from now, those assets will be worth nothing. So, it is not sensible for me to take on that kind of stranded asset risk,\" he said.</p><p> He added that risk analysis will prompt financial institutions to shrink financing in some sectors.</p><p>Audrey Tan</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-847552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63R2-G7V1-DYX4-054B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 29, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0005JEZ</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK ZIMBABWE LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00064QT</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (THAI) PCL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DFWM</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NEPAL LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00080WB</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED AUSTRALIA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

This could lead to existing plantations being counted as forest and the establishment of new ones considered reforestation.  First proposed in 2018, such a move is gaining traction with a team of forestry experts at Bogor-based IPB University finalising research that includes water absorption, carbon emissions and wildlife diversity. The research has received funding from the Indonesian Oil Palm Growers Association. </p><p> The idea is to allow growers and companies to cultivate the valuable crop in degraded forest, Professor Yanto Santosa, leader of the research team, told The Straits Times in an interview. He underlined that he was against the move to clear natural forests for oil palm.  \"The fact is the government has yet to be capable of meeting its target to rehabilitate degraded forest that totalled around 14 million ha,\" he said, referring to 2018 data. Prof Yanto said that when oil palm is cultivated in degraded forest areas, it will count as reforestation. \"Oil palm planted in forest areas should not be a problem then,\" he said.  Around 126 million ha, or nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's land mass, are designated as \"forest area\". Much of it, or 70 per cent, still has tree cover, while the remainder is categorised as \"degraded\" forest.  However, any kind of clearing is normally prohibited on land classified under both categories. Certain \"productive\" activities, such as agroforestry and logging, are allowed, but oil palm cultivation is prohibited. Most oil plantations are on agricultural land.  The IPB proposal also encourages the inclusion of oil palm plantations in Indonesia's carbon reduction goals, in contrast to studies showing that clearing forests for oil palm causes a huge amount of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss.  Indonesia has 16.4 million ha of oil palm plantations and reclassifying oil palm as a forest crop will automatically result in additional forest area, said Prof Yanto.  \"That should be counted in the NDC (nationally determined contribution),\" he said. NDCs are national climate plans that are pledged under the United Nations' Paris climate agreement as steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Last July, Indonesia, among the world's top 10 carbon emitters, brought forward its target for net-zero emissions from 2070 to 2060 or sooner. It is also working towards a goal to cut emissions by 29 per cent by 2030 or by 41 per cent with international financial support. Forestry, energy and transportation make up 97 per cent of its NDC.  The dean of IPB's school of forestry, Dr Naresworo Nugroho, said oil palm can absorb 57.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare each year, more than other timber trees such as teak (21 tonnes) and pine (20 tonnes).  Other academicians and green groups, however, have criticised the proposal. Dr Sigit Sunarta, the dean of the forestry school at Yogyakarta-based Gadjah Mada University, told ST that if the proposal is adopted and oil palm is planted in forest areas, Indonesia will lose international recognition for its fight against deforestation.  Cultivating oil palm in forest areas will further \"change the configuration of Indonesia's tropical rainforest\", Dr Sigit said. Massive expansion of the plantations in forest areas has already triggered rampant deforestation, reduced biodiversity and significantly increased the frequency of ecological disasters such as drought, floods and forest fires, he noted.  An agroecology expert from the University of Jambi, Dr Asmadi Saad, echoed this view, saying that the widespread expansion of oil palm plantations in Jambi province in Sumatra has caused a number of ecological changes.  He cited Batanghari River in the province, where the flow of water has been affected because much of the land at its headwaters has been converted into plantations. The number of fish, such as eels, has also dropped sharply.  Dr Asmadi also fears that with the IPB proposal, forest will be destroyed first to turn it into \"degraded\" forest to justify the cultivation of oil palm. This has already been seen in the past when large areas of land earmarked as forest concessions for logging activity were converted into plantations.  Ms Anggalia Putri, the knowledge management manager at green group Madani Berkelanjutan, is concerned that the proposal will change mindsets, serving as justification for the expansion of oil palm plantations to grow the industry.  \"The time has come for Indonesia to put a cap (on the size of oil palm plantations it can have) and a road map on this commodity. Otherwise, the industry will get stuck in the upstream side and keep on expanding in idle forest areas,\" she told ST.      126m ha Indonesia's land mass designated as \"forest area\"  16.4m ha Area occupied by oil palm plantations.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1010031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64HW-H6G1-DYX4-00DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 14, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

He helms the new NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p>The most limiting scenario that accounted for all three constraints - financial, social and operational - showed that just 0.4 per cent to 6 per cent of the 121 million ha of land can be reforested, said the study's lead author, Dr Zeng Yiwen.</p><p>But the study also pointed to ways to overcome these constraints. \"Even a moderate reduction in opportunity costs could almost double the climate mitigation potential of reforestation,\" said Dr Zeng.</p><p>  \"Our analysis shows that when a combination of financial, land-use and operational constraints are taken into account, only a fraction of the climate mitigation potential of reforestation may be achievable,\" noted the authors.</p><p> The study was published on Monday in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change.</p><p> National University of Singapore (NUS) conservation scientist Koh Lian Pin, who supervised the research, said the study was the first to take a realistic look at reforestation in South-east Asia by considering such practical constraints.</p><p> Said Professor Koh, who helms the new NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions: \"The study's key take-home message is that the theoretical benefit of reforestation, or any climate solution, for that matter, needs to be tempered with a proper accounting of on-the-ground realities.\"</p><p> The most limiting scenario that accounted for all three constraints - financial, social and operational - showed that just 0.4 per cent to 6 per cent of the 121 million ha of land can be reforested, said the lead author of the study, Dr Zeng Yiwen, a post-doctoral fellow at NUS.</p><p> But the study also pointed to ways to overcome these constraints.</p><p> \"Even a moderate reduction in opportunity costs could almost double the climate mitigation potential of reforestation,\" said Dr Zeng.</p><p> This could include solutions such as involving farmers in the reforestation process through agroforestry initiatives, he said.</p><p> Such efforts, which involve the planting of stands of forests on agricultural land, could allow reforestation to be carried out without compromising on community livelihoods or food security.</p><p> Professor Nophea Sasaki, a forestry and carbon expert at the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand who was not involved in the latest study, said the paper provides useful information about the potential land availability for reforestation in South-east Asia and the implications for climate policy.</p><p> \"Reforestation can also improve ecosystem functions and services, and stimulate local economic growth through job creation and conservation of biodiversity,\" said Prof Sasaki.</p><p> But he noted the importance of selecting the right tree species for reforestation, as choosing non-native species could have adverse consequences for the environment.</p><p>                     More research needs to be done on how reforested lands can be managed to inform policy, he said.</p><p> For example, planting a single fast-growing exotic tree species could provide a steady supply of wood, but would negatively impact the ground, surface water and forest-dwelling animals that rely on a diversity of native plants for food.</p><p> \"Further study on how to manage the reforested lands could provide more insight about balancing reforestation with the need to meet increasing demand for raw materials,\" Prof Sasaki said.</p><p> Reforestation has been gaining traction among policymakers as a nature-based climate solution.</p><p> During the World Economic Forum in January, for example, the One Trillion Tree initiative was launched to urge governments, companies and grassroots organisations to plant new trees and avoid deforestation.</p><p> In April, Singapore launched a One Million Trees movement, which aims to plant a million trees or more over the next decade.</p><p> Dr Adrian Loo, group director at the National Parks Board (NParks), said the intensification of tree planting is possible through the application of ecology and science.</p><p> He pointed to the roadside planting of native trees and shrubs, saying these \"nature ways\" adopt the tiered structure of Singapore's forests and support native biodiversity.</p><p> \"Over time, a natural and sustainable landscape will establish,\" he said.</p><p> Dr Loo also pointed to the importance of involving the community in the movement, saying that partners such as NUS and Keppel Corp have committed to either planting more trees on their premises, or contributing funds to plant trees in Singapore's parks and nature reserves.</p><p> He added: \"With the support of the community and corporate partners, NParks hopes to galvanise wider community action and sustain active stewardship of the environment into the future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Reforestation has been touted as

Manuel Mamba.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was only late Friday and early Saturday that the general public was apprised of what was happening in Cagayan Valley.</p><p>The initial information came mainly from social media, in the form of cries for help from residents trapped in their homes and panicked by the powerful flood surge.</p><p>Despite its budget of P1.698 billion (S$47.24 million) for 2020, up from P1.4 billion in 2019, the the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO), was unable to rise to the challenge of crisis reporting so vital to this disaster-tossed archipelago.</p><p>Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, pleased by the boosted budget, was quoted in 2019 as promising to \"improve the quality of our reporting in PTV, also in Radyo Pilipinas, as well as in the Philippine News Agency - including the News and Information Bureau, the Bureau of Communications Services, and other branches of the PCOO.\"</p><p>The broadcast vacuum was obvious and palpable.</p><p>Its franchise killed by the House of Representatives, the giant network ABS-CBN had been forced to close its regional bureaus, depriving not only the residents of Cagayan Valley but also the general public of critical information.</p><p>But past midnight of Friday its TeleRadyo managed to reach Governor Mamba, who said Cagayan River had breached its banks because of the overflow of rainwater from nearby Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Ifugao, and Kalinga, \"exacerbated\" by the release of excess water from Magat Dam in Isabela.</p><p>By Sunday a horrific picture of the water world in Cagayan and Isabela had emerged, once more galvanising the private sector to engage in rescue and relief efforts for those made desolate and now afflicted by hunger and thirst.</p><p>It doesn't take much prodding for private citizens and groups to put their shoulder to the wheel of collective relief action, and Communications Undersecretary Lorraine Badoy's perverse itch to smear certain such persons and groups as \"red\" and therefore to be hounded and prosecuted is a gross disservice that taints the title she holds. They have exhibited the capability and competence to extend a helping hand, as well as the compassion so urgently needed in this year of constant suffering: from the eruption of Taal Volcano in January to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic that has claimed thousands of lives, ruined businesses, and reduced many of the unemployed to begging in the streets, to this season of weather disturbances so severe that those directly hit, like the residents of Catanduanes and other Bicol provinces, are pummelled yet again even before they can totter back to their feet from an earlier beating.</p><p>But Cagayan and Isabela were not directly hit by Ulysses and Typhoon \"Rolly,\" the strongest in the world this year.</p><p>The torrential rains brought by these and other typhoons and an enhanced monsoon, as well as huge volumes of water released from Magat Dam, caused the Cagayan River and its tributaries to swell, unleashing floodwaters that rose to an \"unprecedented\" 13.1 meters.</p><p>On Facebook, Mayor Cristina Antonio of the hard-hit town of Alcala wrote of how in 2019 her local government turned to science to address the perennial floods.</p><p>It consulted the marine geologist Dr Fernando Siringan, who, along with his fellow UP geologist Keanu Jershon Sarmiento, proceeded to study the Cagayan and Pared Rivers in Alcala, their depth and meander, as well as the lay of the land including the rocks, banks, vegetation, and communities impacted.</p><p>The study that took place only last July-September turned up, among other things, the fine and terrible details of what is generally known - the dire effects of deforestation, especially in Cagayan Valley - and also the necessity of far-reaching change through science-based methods and solutions, change more enduring than what the graft-prone dredging and dike-building that usually occur after a deluge can bring about.</p><p>\"My insight,\" wrote Mayor Antonio, \"is that the problem of flood in Alcala and Cagayan Valley cannot be attributed to just one cause outside of us, but to a complex, interrelated web with us right at the center.\"</p><p>Thus, Alcala farmers are shifting to agroforestry and have begun planting native trees in the watersheds that add up to 300 hectares.</p><p>The townsfolk have been engaged to plant \"tiny, dense native forests\" in all 25 barangays.</p><p>\"It's not just about Magat Dam protocols, although in our state of despair, Magat Dam is the most visible target,\" Antonio wrote.</p><p>It's about the destruction of forests, mountain slopes, watersheds, even the soil.</p><p>A mindset - \"as if we are apart from nature, as if what we do does not come back to us\" - that requires a radical overhaul.</p><p>The paper is a member of The Straits Times media partner, the Asia News Network, an alliance of 24 news media titles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Areas affected by typhoon Vamco during an aerial inspection in Cagayan region, northern Luzon, Philippines, on Nov 15, 2020.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61B3-N3R1-JCF2-854P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"872\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 18, 2020 (LOAD-DATE)</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Feeling doubtful? Then head over to South Sumatra or East Kalimantan, and hunt for the answer in a Pokemon-Go style game.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It is through these games that the new interactive app, Urundata, introduced by land project Restore+, hopes to marshal many minds to help save tropical rainforests in Indonesia, the world's largest after the Amazon and Congo basins, and support indigenous communities.</p><p> Launched in November last year, the crowdsourcing app has gained more than 800 users, mostly university students, contributing to nearly three million interpretations of publicly available satellite images.</p><p> \"The main attraction is that they compete, collect points and win,\" Mr Ping Yowargana, a coordinator at Restore+, told The Straits Times.</p><p> The consortium of organisations behind the Restore+ project in Indonesia is led by Vienna-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) and comprises US environment think-tank World Resources Institute (WRI), Nairobi-based research group, the World Agroforestry Centre, and the World Wide Fund for Nature.</p><p> The consortium hopes to garner four million interpretations of the images by the middle of next month through Pilahpilih, the Tinder-like game.</p><p> The Pokemon Go-style game, Jelantara, which requires users to answer questions based on field observations, is set for launch in April.</p><p> The organiser aims to expand roadshows nationwide to attract more users besides technologically savvy young people, said Ms Sakinah Ummu Haniy, a communications specialist at Restore+ from WRI Indonesia.</p><p> Ms Natalia Christiani, 22, has been spending two hours on weekends playing Pilahpilih since installing the Urundata app in November last year. She said it is a cause she can get behind.</p><p> \"It's fun. But I also need to think (of the answers) because the pictures can sometimes deceive me,\" she said. \"My points are often reduced because of wrong answers. For instance, I mistakenly identified secondary forests for farming land. And even though a forest looks dense, it's actually not always a primary forest.\"</p><p>Indonesia has long struggled to fight against massive deforestation, caused by rampant illegal logging and land clearing for plantations to grow commodities like oil palm.</p><p> Land conflicts between companies and local communities are also widespread.</p><p> The current administration under President Joko Widodo has launched a One Map policy, using only one standard map drawn by Indonesia's Geospatial Information Agency to serve as a reference for all stakeholders in addressing the issues.</p><p> Other initiatives, supported by technology, have also come from the private sector, communities and non-governmental groups like Urundata. Late last year, a number of the biggest palm oil companies set up a new radar system to help monitor forests.</p><p> Crowdsourcing to gather detailed, grounded descriptions of land is efficient and low-cost, compared with the time-consuming and costly process of engaging experts, said Mr Ping, a research scholar at IIASA.</p><p> The app compares the answers of many users to generate final interpretations.</p><p> Mr Ping said the data collected by Urundata will be transparent and can be used by any party. It will be published on the Urundata website, he said.</p><p> The consortium behind the Restore+, which is carrying out a similar mapping effort in Brazil, expects the website to identify a set of restoration options for government, indigenous communities and other stakeholders by 2022.</p><p> Professor Hasanuddin Z. Abidin, head of Indonesia's Geospatial Information Agency, acknowledged that Indonesia's vast land areas spanning 1.9 million sqm are a daunting challenge for nation-scale mapping given the lengthy time, huge budget and large number of personnel needed.</p><p> Describing Urundata as \"a good initiative\", he viewed the participatory mapping approach it introduced as a breakthrough to address the issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Crowdsourcing app Urundata has gained more than 800 users since it was launched in November last year.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-664470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8W-D3Y1-JCF2-80FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"683\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR APPLIED SYSTEMS ANALYSIS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

This is the second of a two-parter on the carbon credit market.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>David Fogarty</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the centre of Borneo island are two projects that protect patches of peat swamp forest three times the size of Singapore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Once threatened with destruction by palm oil and mining firms, these two privately run businesses were early movers in a United Nations-backed scheme called REDD+ that rewards investors who protect nature and fight climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tropical rainforests soak up huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and store the carbon in tree trunks, roots and leaf litter. By protecting the forest, every year the Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya projects in Central Kalimantan province prevent about 11 million tonnes of CO2 from being emitted - that's like taking about three million cars off the road annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Over its project life of 60 years, Katingan Mentaya, the project's developers estimate, would prevent 447 million tonnes of CO2 from being emitted, equivalent to the annual emissions of France - all from 150,000ha of forest.</p><p> Auto and insurance giants, oil and gas companies, tech firms and others buy carbon offsets from these projects, with each offset equivalent to a tonne of CO2 removed or locked away. The firms use these to meet their own emissions-cutting goals.</p><p> The Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya projects began more than a decade ago and their success is testament that forest carbon schemes work and, if done right, have the potential to curb the pace of global warming.</p><p> It also shows that carbon finance represents a vital, if still small, lifeline to fund conservation of fast-disappearing ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and wetlands. If scaled up, the benefits could be immense, potentially unblocking billions of dollars in conservation investments.</p><p> \"Forest protecting must be done right,\" says Mr Dharsono Hartono, co-founder of the Katingan Mentaya project. \"Natural forests with healthy biodiverse ecosystems create the best conditions for sequestering and storing carbon. Large-scale tree planting is a fantastic endeavour and should be encouraged, but we must prioritise protecting and restoring the forests we already have.\"</p><p> Globally, forests soak up billions of tonnes of CO2. But widespread clearing, such as with fires, and the growing impact of climate change are fast threatening this natural brake on global warming.</p><p> The world lost an area of tropical rainforest the size of the Netherlands last year, according to a recent assessment by the University of Maryland on the Global Forest Watch online platform of the World Resources Institute. Rainforest loss in Indonesia and Malaysia fell for the fourth year in a row last year, the analysis found, but the area was still about 345,000ha, or nearly five times Singapore's size. That represents a huge amount of CO2 emitted into the air and a large loss of rich plant and animal life.</p><p> TRUE VALUE The trade in carbon offsets, or credits, occurs through a well-established voluntary market where projects are designed to strict standards and are annually verified, and the credits sold directly to the buyer. Though small - about US$300 million (S$399 million) in 2019 - the market is changing the calculus of valuing nature.</p><p> Financing forest carbon projects, or nature-based climate solutions as they are also known, means forests can be worth more alive than dead - especially as demand is growing for offsets from high-quality projects as more and more companies and governments pledge to meet strict climate targets.</p><p> And few areas are more valuable than peat swamp forests.</p><p> Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya sit on carbon-rich peat domes that have accumulated hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon over the centuries in the form of dead plant matter. Clearing the forest and draining the swamps are a very bad idea: Once dried out, deep peat domes can burn for months and produce toxic haze and lots of CO2.</p><p> Both projects are also reserves for orangutans, proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards and other endangered wildlife and plants. Rimba Raya's 64,500ha also acts as a natural buffer zone to the adjacent Tunjung Puting national park.</p><p> Investors are increasingly seeing the potential of forest carbon projects, which are estimated to comprise the majority of future carbon credit flows. Investors, such as Pollination Group, a climate advisory in Australia, and banking giant HSBC, say that nature is greatly undervalued and billions of dollars of investment are needed to create nature as a new asset class.</p><p> \"It is critical to finance global rainforests,\" says Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founder. \"They are not only critical to climate change but also to the preservation of global biodiversity. They are disappearing at a rate of knots and they need large-scale climate finance. And critically they are home to indigenous communities. There is enormous potential for nature if we take the right approach.\"</p><p> Pollination and HSBC have formed a venture to invest in nature-based solutions, and other major investors around the globe, including Singapore, are also eyeing the burgeoning carbon market. That's good for Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya. Both have seen a surge in buying of their carbon offsets and expect prices to steadily rise from the present range of US$4 to US$8 a tonne, with buyers keen to lock in future flows of offsets even if prices are higher.</p><p> TRACK RECORD What helps is that both projects have a strong track record and have achieved the highest standards in the market covering carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection and community development. Rimba Raya last year was certified as meeting all 17 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> Both projects use carbon credit sales to support more than 40 villages - 34 for Katingan Mentaya and 11 for Rimba Raya. The projects have developed a wide variety of livelihood and health programmes, including food production as well as employing locals as fire wardens and in tree nurseries for replanting cleared areas. Katingan Mentaya employs more than 400 local people to protect the forest during the fire season and has also replaced \"river toilets\" with cleaner land-based latrines.</p><p> Rimba Raya has expanded its orangutan release sites deep in the forest, is replanting mangroves along the coast nearby and also launched a floating health clinic that travels along the Seruyan river, which borders the project.</p><p> \"We built a boat and staffed it with government nurses and doctors and it goes village to village. People line up for health checks. That's been an incredible success,\" says project co-developer Jim Procanik.</p><p> Mr Todd Lemons, chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based firm InfiniteEarth, which is the project's developer, says: \"Optometry has been the big one. Giving people glasses so they can see for the first time.\"</p><p> Mr Procanik adds: \"The other thing that is life-changing is we have dug wells in many of the villages and set up a water filtration system. We've set it up as a local business that they own.\"</p><p> Speaking from the US, they say that the increase in carbon revenues of late means that they can spend more on programmes, including more orangutan release sites and running the health clinic more often.</p><p> And, after more than a decade and spending about US$5 million, the project is finally paying for itself. \"We are just now beginning to pay back investors,\" says Mr Lemons. \"As things have improved, we are dramatically stepping up what we're doing this year and next year, things that we always wanted to do but were big-ticket items.\"</p><p> One of those is agroforestry by developing previously degraded areas and planting native crops in a mixed-crop fashion. \"But they will all be cash crops - spices, oils. So they can reforest in the most polycultural fashion possible and also that this will deliver permanent income to communities,\" Mr Lemons says.</p><p> GET WILD These sorts of community benefits, on top of carbon sequestration, are what many investors and credit buyers are looking for.</p><p> Ms Leah Wieczorek, business development lead - Asia, for South Pole, a leading global carbon offset project developer, says that there is a clear trend in the market for higher-impact carbon offsets.</p><p> \"While many companies were extremely price-driven in the past, today they are seeking more qualifications and co-benefits,\" she says, referring to credits eligible under the UN's aviation emissions reduction scheme as well as projects that support the health of women and children.</p><p> \"There is also a growing awareness that climate action and protecting ecosystems go hand in hand: We see a clear trend for nature-based solutions, especially when it comes to long-term offtake agreements,\" she says.</p><p> Looking ahead, Mr Procanik says that there is strong interest in selling Rimba Raya's future credits. \"Everyone in the market foresees there is going to be a robust liquid market. The market today is not yet liquid, I believe it will be soon, and definitely five years in the future. What I believe is that people are positioning themselves for the future.\"</p><p> By then, Mr Procanik and Mr Lemons expect their carbon credits to be worth US$20 to US$30 a tonne.</p><p> After a decade, both projects underscore that protecting nature is not easy and takes time. \"Protecting nature and addressing climate change have no quick fixes,\" says Katingan Mentaya's Mr Dharsono. \"We must create the right conditions for nature to do what it does best: grow, get wild and lock in carbon.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rimba Raya has launched a floating health clinic that travels along the Seruyan river in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province.

By protecting the forest, every year the Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya projects in Central Kalimantan province prevent about 11 million tonnes of CO2 from being emitted - that's like taking about three million cars off the road annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Over its project life of 60 years, Katingan Mentaya, the project's developers estimate, would prevent 447 million tonnes of CO2 from being emitted, equivalent to the annual emissions of France - all from 150,000ha of forest.</p><p> Auto and insurance giants, oil and gas companies, tech firms and others buy carbon offsets from these projects, with each offset equivalent to a tonne of CO2 removed or locked away. The firms use these to meet their own emissions-cutting goals.</p><p> The Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya projects began more than a decade ago and their success is testament that forest carbon schemes work and, if done right, have the potential to curb the pace of global warming.</p><p> It also shows that carbon finance represents a vital, if still small, lifeline to fund conservation of fast-disappearing ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrass meadows and wetlands. If scaled up, the benefits could be immense, potentially unblocking billions of dollars in conservation investments.</p><p> \"Forest protecting must be done right,\" says Mr Dharsono Hartono, co-founder of the Katingan Mentaya project. \"Natural forests with healthy biodiverse ecosystems create the best conditions for sequestering and storing carbon. Large-scale tree planting is a fantastic endeavour and should be encouraged, but we must prioritise protecting and restoring the forests we already have.\"</p><p> Globally, forests soak up billions of tonnes of CO2. But widespread clearing, such as with fires, and the growing impact of climate change are fast threatening this natural brake on global warming.</p><p> The world lost an area of tropical rainforest the size of the Netherlands last year, according to a recent assessment by the University of Maryland on the Global Forest Watch online platform of the World Resources Institute. Rainforest loss in Indonesia and Malaysia fell for the fourth year in a row last year, the analysis found, but the area was still about 345,000ha, or nearly five times Singapore's size. That represents a huge amount of CO2 emitted into the air and a large loss of rich plant and animal life.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TRUE VALUE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; The trade in carbon offsets, or credits, occurs through a well-established voluntary market where projects are designed to strict standards and are annually verified, and the credits sold directly to the buyer. Though small - about US$300 million (S$399 million) in 2019 - the market is changing the calculus of valuing nature.</p><p> Financing forest carbon projects, or nature-based climate solutions as they are also known, means forests can be worth more alive than dead - especially as demand is growing for offsets from high-quality projects as more and more companies and governments pledge to meet strict climate targets.</p><p> And few areas are more valuable than peat swamp forests.</p><p> Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya sit on carbon-rich peat domes that have accumulated hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon over the centuries in the form of dead plant matter. Clearing the forest and draining the swamps are a very bad idea: Once dried out, deep peat domes can burn for months and produce toxic haze and lots of CO2.</p><p> Both projects are also reserves for orangutans, proboscis monkeys, clouded leopards and other endangered wildlife and plants. Rimba Raya's 64,500ha also acts as a natural buffer zone to the adjacent Tunjung Puting national park.</p><p> Investors are increasingly seeing the potential of forest carbon projects, which are estimated to comprise the majority of future carbon credit flows. Investors, such as Pollination Group, a climate advisory in Australia, and banking giant HSBC, say that nature is greatly undervalued and billions of dollars of investment are needed to create nature as a new asset class.</p><p> \"It is critical to finance global rainforests,\" says Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founder. \"They are not only critical to climate change but also to the preservation of global biodiversity. They are disappearing at a rate of knots and they need large-scale climate finance. And critically they are home to indigenous communities. There is enormous potential for nature if we take the right approach.\"</p><p> Pollination and HSBC have formed a venture to invest in nature-based solutions, and other major investors around the globe, including Singapore, are also eyeing the burgeoning carbon market. That's good for Rimba Raya and Katingan Mentaya. Both have seen a surge in buying of their carbon offsets and expect prices to steadily rise from the present range of US$4 to US$8 a tonne, with buyers keen to lock in future flows of offsets even if prices are higher.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TRACK RECORD&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; What helps is that both projects have a strong track record and have achieved the highest standards in the market covering carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection and community development. Rimba Raya last year was certified as meeting all 17 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> Both projects use carbon credit sales to support more than 40 villages - 34 for Katingan Mentaya and 11 for Rimba Raya. The projects have developed a wide variety of livelihood and health programmes, including food production as well as employing locals as fire wardens and in tree nurseries for replanting cleared areas. Katingan Mentaya employs more than 400 local people to protect the forest during the fire season and has also replaced \"river toilets\" with cleaner land-based latrines.</p><p> Rimba Raya has expanded its orangutan release sites deep in the forest, is replanting mangroves along the coast nearby and also launched a floating health clinic that travels along the Seruyan river, which borders the project.</p><p> \"We built a boat and staffed it with government nurses and doctors and it goes village to village. People line up for health checks. That's been an incredible success,\" says project co-developer Jim Procanik.</p><p> Mr Todd Lemons, chief executive officer of Hong Kong-based firm InfiniteEarth, which is the project's developer, says: \"Optometry has been the big one. Giving people glasses so they can see for the first time.\"</p><p> Mr Procanik adds: \"The other thing that is life-changing is we have dug wells in many of the villages and set up a water filtration system.

There are many multi-stakeholders (to work with) ... But it's not going to be an overnight process,\" she said.</p><p>Further details about the certification will be announced later, said SEC.</p><p>In his speech, Mr Masagos commended the effort as a \"bold initiative\" that would set global standards by being the \"most holistic certification standard\" for pulp and paper worldwide. </p><p>It would also be a tool to \"empower consumers to make a very safe non-haze pro-conservation choice\".</p><p>Civil society plays a crucial role in pressuring companies to be more transparent and accountable, and in supporting sustainable businesses, he added, pointing to the ground-up efforts in last year's haze episode, the worst yet experienced by the Republic. </p><p>The SEC and the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) had jointly led a movement against unsustainable practices, with the SEC imposing a restriction on the use of its Singapore Green Label certification by companies allegedly linked to the haze. </p><p>This led to supermarkets such as NTUC FairPrice, Prime and Sheng Siong pulling the products of an affected company - Asia Pulp &amp; Paper - off their shelves.</p><p>He also cited the We Breathe What We Buy campaign in increasing public awareness on the sustainability of agroforestry products, which was led by partners such as the World Wildlife FundSingapore and People's Movement to Stop Haze.</p><p>He said: \"As consumers, each one of us can influence the agroforestry industry through our purchasing decisions. </p><p>\"We have choices, and we should make our choices count ...These actions demonstrate the significant power of a collective consumer voice, and an increasingly active and empowered consumer movement, led by civil society.\"</p><p>He also noted the importance of governmental efforts such as the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act in galvanising companies to take action, pointing out how prominent agroforestry companies had \"frantically taken out advertisements and gone on talk shows to show that they are doing something\".</p><p>\"My message to all these companies is simply this - companies practising unsustainable production that affect us with haze must know that their actions will not lead to profitability and that they will have to face the consequences sooner or later,\" he added.</p><p>Organised by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, the dialogue was attended by more than 350 stakeholders from government bodies, the agroforestry sector, banks and financial institutions, and non-governmental organisations.

In 2015, a severe El Nino brought hotter and drier weather to Indonesia and worsened the forest fires there.</p><p> But the hot and dry weather now is due to persistent cooler-than-usual sea surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Sumatra. This discourages the formation of rain clouds over the region, said Prof Koh.</p><p> Ms Aqeela Samat, palm oil demand specialist at the World Wide Fund for Nature, Singapore, said Indonesia is experiencing its worst annual fire season since 2015</p><p> Mr Timer Manurung, executive director of the Jakarta-based environmental group Auriga, said many factors could have contributed to this. Besides drier than usual weather, Indonesia's presidential election this year could have strained police and military resources, hampering quicker response to the forest fires, he said.</p><p> And while there have been some improvements in the way land management practices by agroforestry firms are regulated, there is still governmental inaction on many fronts, he said.</p><p> This includes, for instance, the lack of transparency over concession maps, which prevents civil society from holding companies to account over fires on their land, and confusion over which peatlands have been restored, he added .</p><p>                           Said Ms Aqeela: \"Unsustainable deforestation practices, combined with a hot and dry climate, have created killer conditions for uncontrollable fires.\"</p><p> The 2015 crisis prompted the Indonesian government and agroforestry firms to take more action to curtail the number of blazes, leading to three years of relatively clear skies in the region.</p><p> The steps included damming up canals to re-flood dried-up landscapes and moving to suppress the fires when they erupt. But Mr Manurung said the re-occurrence of haze this year shows more must be done.</p><p> Ms Aqeela said: \"Solutions do not lie in putting out fires, but in addressing the real cause of the fires by halting deforestation.\"</p><p> Robust forest governance, funding and legislation that support deforestation-free supply chains are essential, she added.</p><p> On their part, consumers can source for products that have been certified eco-friendly.</p><p> Eco-certifications such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, Forest Stewardship Council and Better Cotton Initiative are recognised by WWF as they meet the minimum benchmarks of sustainable production, she added.</p><p> Meanwhile, research done at National University of Singapore (NUS) has indicated that when haze hits, there is more than just breathing discomfort at stake for the Republic.</p><p> Finance, economics and real estate professor Sumit Agarwal from the NUS Business School found that haze episodes could have knock-on effects on household expenditure, tourism and labour productivity.</p><p> He had found that during the 2015 haze, households in Singapore spent $14.58 million more on electricity and water, as people opted to stay indoors in air-conditioned rooms, and took more showers to get rid of the feel of pollutant particles on their clothes.</p><p> Haze episodes could hit tourism, especially transient tourists who are on layover in Singapore.</p><p> \"We found that the haze in 2015 caused daily hotel room rates to decline by about 2 per cent, while the doubling of the PSI (Pollutant Standards Index - a measure of air quality) reading can cause hotel revenues to decrease by $0.28 million,\" he said.</p><p> \"This preliminary data can provide a baseline for future studies looking into the knock-on effects of haze for the Singapore economy, and could inform policy action in the future.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tourists taking photos with the Merlion, on Sept 14, 2019.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-619762</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X24-5411-JCF2-83PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 15, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp;

Last year, I spoke about the benefits that a sustainable agroforestry sector can bring to the region, and the roles that the government, civil society and the financial community play in encouraging the sustainable development of the sector. I am happy to see the progress made by the various stakeholders over the past year.</p><p>3. Sustainable development is often defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Extreme advocates of sustainability may come across as arguing against all forms of development - for example that every inch of forest must be saved in the same state as today. This extreme position is difficult to defend because it ignores the real and legitimate needs of the present generation. The palm oil sector, for example, brings important economic benefits to the region. Palm oil contributes an estimated 2-2.5% to the Gross National Product in Indonesia, and is the fourth largest contributor to Gross National Income in Malaysia. It also supports the transition of many communities out of poverty and significantly improves the lives of smallholder farmers. With demand for palm oil projected to grow by another 50% by 2020, there is tremendous potential for growth.</p><p>4. And yet, we are all acutely aware of the social and environmental costs that an expanding agro-forestry sector has brought. Social conflict between indigenous communities and corporates is common, due to discrepancies in land allocation. New areas for cultivation of palm oil often come at the expense of the rainforest, and all the resources it contains.</p><p>5. It is therefore critical that we continue to strike the right balance by actively shaping the agro-forestry sector into a more sustainable one. Let me elaborate on how various stakeholders can collectively work together to achieve sustainable supply chains for the agroforestry sector.</p><p>6. First, a credible, strong and vibrant civil society serves as a catalyst for change, to broaden and deepen environmental consciousness among the population. There have been promising domestic developments and ground-up efforts by civil society over the past year. Let me name a few.</p><p>7. WWF Singapore and founding members Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, have established the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO) in June last year. The Alliance sends an unequivocal signal to consumers that many major businesses are committed to the production, usage and trade of certified sustainable palm oil. I hope their numbers will grow quickly. These companies and organisations lend credibility to the alliance for sustainability. This is both because they walk the talk, but more importantly, they have a deep knowledge of sustainability issues in the real world and how to steer and shape them. Since the establishment of the Alliance, more Singapore based companies have been engaged on their sourcing and policies on palm oil. I encourage companies to make the transition to sustainable palm oil by joining like-minded companies to source responsibly through SASPO.</p><p>8. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) had in January this year announced a new and more holistic green label category for pulp and paper products which encompasses peatland management and fire prevention standards as part of its criteria. The new category maintains one of the most stringent environmental performance standards globally, and requires companies to have their entire supply chain audited against these criteria. The Government will support companies in this effort by only procuring printing paper with this label in future.</p><p>9. The SEC also launched a new certification category for palm oil-based products last year. When it has taken off, the new category for palm oil products under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) will lead to greater transparency in the palm oil supply chain and provide consumers greater assurance of sustainable sourcing.</p><p>10. Through its #GoHazeFree campaign, the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM. Haze) has been encouraging households and industry to switch to haze-free palm oil as part of its outreach programme. PM.Haze has also produced a \"Haze-Free Cooking Oil\" Guide.</p><p>11. The government strongly supports these ground-up initiatives that will allow for more informed purchasing decisions and influence consumers towards more environmentally sustainable attitudes and behaviours.But I hope that our NGOs will also deepen their expertise in the area they are championing. This is the best way the government and the civil society can work together so that as the government legislates for sustainability, NGOs have the credibility to help shape our society that supports sustainability.</p><p>12. Second, sustainability should no longer be an afterthought for companies, as it can directly impact the bottom line. With increasing global awareness of the impact of unsustainable farming practices, a lack of oversight over supply chains can result in serious reputational and financial risks for companies.</p><p>13. Hence, forward-looking companies are already taking steps to realize sustainability targets in their supply chain. Unilever is one such example. In 2015, Unilever only had 19% of its palm oil physically certified, but it has committed to increasing this figure to 100% by 2019. Others such as Mars, Mondelez, Nestle, Cargill and Olam have also taken steps in the same directions. They are sending a strong and right signal to the industry.</p><p>14. However, having a strong public showing of a company's sustainable commitment is not sufficient. In a landscape where the traceability of agroforestry commodities is often elusive, this has to be matched by the concrete actions a company takes to scrutinize its upstream suppliers. Recently, a report by the Rainforest Action Network uncovered illegal clearing activities at a UNESCO world heritage rainforest site in Sumatra. This prompted Nestle to raise concerns over unsustainably-produced palm oil that it could have acquired from its upstream supplier. Nestle's upstream supplier subsequently responded by putting on hold purchases from the alleged producer of unsustainable palm oil.</p><p>15. This episode shows that companies cannot let their guard down when it comes to upholding sustainability standards. It is only with continued vigilance - constantly making suppliers accountable, weeding out bad players, and so on - that we can move towards a truly sustainable and reputable agroforestry sector.</p><p>16. Third, governments in the region have moved individually and collectively to act on forest and land fires.</p><p>17. Our region has set its sights on achieving a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. Last year, ASEAN Member States developed and adopted a Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control.</p><p>18. Each ASEAN Member State is doing its part to turn this vision into reality. Indonesia has taken positive actions to contain the number of hotspots over the past year. In 2016, there were just over a hundred hotspots as compared to many thousands in 2015. After Riau and Jambi began experiencing land and forest fires from mid-Jan 2017 as a result of drier weather conditions, Indonesia acted expeditiously by declaring a state of emergency in Riau on 24 Jan 2017. This allowed for the timely deployment of resources and tighter coordination between the central and provincial authorities in containing the fires.</p><p>19. More importantly, there are longer-term measures being put in place to address forest and land fires at source. Just last year, the Indonesian Government announced a five-year moratorium on new licenses to establish palm oil concessions. The moratorium will halt the draining and clearing of new carbon-rich peatland. This decision extends to concession land previously licensed to plantation companies as well. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme Mr Erik Solheim recently praised this move by President Jokowi, calling it a positive and historic decision, both for Indonesia and for global efforts to tackle climate change[1].</p><p>20. While the central government actively tackles the haze problem, provincial governments also play a critical role. Under the leadership of Governor Alex Noerdin, the South Sumatra province is taking on an exemplary role by embarking on a Green Growth Development plan. As you have heard, the plan adopts a multi-stakeholder approach towards the sustainable management of forested lands. In June last year, more than 2,700 independent smallholders covering 5,500 ha in South Sumatra received the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. This is currently the world's largest individual group of independent smallholders to be RSPO-certified[2]. I was not in the room but was told that Governor Alex Noerdin made a pledge today that this year, there will be no haze coming from the South Sumatra region. Thank you Governor.</p><p>21. Since its establishment in 2016, Indonesia's Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) has also gone from strength to strength in its peatland mapping exercise despite the challenges it had faced with plantation companies. It has also achieved successes in working together with NGOs and local communities on peatland restoration projects.For instance, BRG recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Alliance of the Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago to drive peatland restoration efforts and empower indigenous communities economically. BRG's efforts bode well for the sustainable growth and development of the agriforestry sector.</p><p>22. Fourth, nascent sustainable financing efforts are gradually gaining a foothold in our domestic financial sector.</p><p>23. Following the launch of the Association of Banks of Singapore's (ABS) Responsible Financing Guidelines in 2015, ABS member banks are now expected to factor into their lending and investment policies sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, resource efficiency, labour standards, and corporate integrity. The local banks have since established internal taskforces on environment, social and governance issues, to help integrate the ABS Guidelines into their lending and business practices. Banks have also implemented environmental risk weightings as part of their loan assessment criteria. Loan decisions relating to companies which are assessed to have high environmental risks will be escalated to the banks' senior management. More recently, the ABS has also introduced specific guidelines for banks on dealing with haze-related risks, such as no open burning on plantations and building capacity on fire prevention with local communities.</p><p>24. Investment firms have also moved to anchor sustainability in their investment processes. Temasek recently established a new sustainability and stewardship group to lead the company's future initiatives around the themes of sustainability and stewardship. This is an important move that demonstrates the growing role that investment firms can play to drive sustainability, and bring about green transformation in the financial sector. I hope it will inspire and spur other financial institutions to do the same.</p><p>25. As the region develops, private sector financing will play an increasingly important role in infrastructure and project finance. If private capital can be directed to projects that take environmental factors into account, projects that engage in unsustainable business practices will be starved of credit. This will help to gradually shift the business landscape towards more sustainable practices. As a leading capital market in the Asia-Pacific, Singapore is well-poised to play an influential role in making this happen.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Each and every one of us has a part to play in realizing a sustainable agroforestry sector in the region. Governments need the political will to act quickly to curb forest and land fires, and will have to take on a larger custodial role in safeguarding the rainforest and high carbon-stock areas. Civil society will need to continue fostering the environmental consciousness of the people, while keeping businesses on their toes as it pushes for greater transparency. Major buyers should insist on purchasing from producers who subscribe to higher and more sustainable standards. Finally, enlightened buyers who make the right choice can help to create added incentives by encouraging producers to move towards sustainable practices. Let us have everyone on board this journey towards a more sustainable and responsible agroforestry sector as there is no other way.</p><p>27. Thank you, and I wish you a lively, constructive discussion ahead.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/indonesia-expands-protection-for-peatland\">http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/indonesia-expands-protection-for-peatland</url></p><p>[2] <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2016/08/23/single-largest-independent-smallholder-group-gets-rspo-certification/\">www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2016/08/23/single-largest-independent-smallholder-group-gets-rspo-certification/</url></p><p>Source: Ministry of the Environment &amp;

This is a relief from the prolonged bouts of haze and extensive fires in 2015, and the record-high 400PSI that hit Singapore in 2013.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Efforts by the <person><nameText>Joko Widodo </nameText></person>administration in Indonesia to tackle the fires at source are one reason for the improvement. Wetter weather conditions have also played a major part in the good results. But the weather is changing, and not all for the better.</p><p>This year, experts predict the conditions will be drier than normal and fear that the extreme dry weather phenomenon called El Nino will return as early as July. Concerns arise, therefore, that severe fires will break out across plantation and forestry concessions across Indonesia, causing a return of the haze. Efforts to prevent that are being made. On Dec 1, Mr Widodo signed into law a blanket ban on the cultivation of carbon-rich peatland across the country. </p><p>In anticipation of dry conditions this year, Indonesia's Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) is already doubling up efforts to support the prevention of fires at the local and provincial level.  BRG's priority areas lie in Riau, South Sumatra and Central Kalimantan, provinces which have experienced extensive drainage of peatlands, thereby increasing their susceptibility to fires. At the same time, the Singapore authorities continue to investigate a number of Indonesian-based companies for possible fires and haze in 2015. </p><p>Critically, the assistance from different levels of the Indonesian government will also be needed, particularly in cases where cooperation from companies is lacking.</p><p>More broadly, the need is to address the root of the problem by steering the value chain of agroforestry products towards greater sustainability. </p><p>It is not just dry weather that causes the haze. The haze is a terrible manifestation of various unsustainable practices that plague the plantation sectors across the region. </p><p>Small-scale growers are often reported to use fires for land clearance because they see little other choice. Many suffer low productivity and small margins, and also lack of access to the right machinery and financing.</p><p>Sustainability also goes beyond the environment - labour and social issues must be duly addressed. Recently, Singapore-listed company Wilmar International, which has committed to a ''No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation'' policy, was accused by Amnesty International of child labour and other labour abuses in Indonesia. </p><p>At around the same time, commodity trader Olam International came under fire for the alleged clearing of rainforests in Gabon. The pressure is growing for large agribusinesses to play an active role in addressing the environmental and social concerns on the ground or risk compromising their standing and profits.</p><p>The global value chain links back to the financial sector and the financiers behind some agroforestry companies have not been spared the spotlight.</p><p>Greenpeace has accused HSBC bank of financing companies that are allegedly responsible for forest destruction. In response, the bank in February issued a new ''No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation'' policy to re-emphasise the strict conditions attached to financing of palm oil companies. Among others, HSBC customers will now have to commit to protect natural forest and peat by the end of June this year, and show evidence that these commitments have been independently verified by December 2018.</p><p>In fact, a broader and more important shift is under way. Different actors in the value chains who were previously part of the problem are now becoming part of the solution. A central pillar of this will be information and transparency. Banks and investors are increasingly integrating environmental, social and governance considerations in their due diligence, making corporate disclosure on sustainability issues more critical than ever to build trust and confidence. </p><p>Frameworks to facilitate such information disclosure are emerging. Last year, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures outlined a set of recommendations for voluntary and consistent climate-related disclosures, thereby helping companies to better align with investors' expectations.</p><p>Similarly, a growing number of companies in the agroforestry sector are placing more emphasis on \"traceability\" so they can prove how they source their products to prefer the growers who adopt more sustainable practices. Technology is a key enabler for better information.</p><p>Increasingly, high-tech drones have been used to map and monitor land use and support the intensification of yields, especially in remote areas. </p><p>Mobile applications to collect farmer data are another innovation, allowing small-scale growers to make more informed decisions about their use of fertiliser and pesticide so that they too can move to both greater sustainability and productivity.</p><p>To help promote transparency and the adoption of best practices, non-governmental organisations (NGOs)and non-profit research institutions can play a critical role. </p><p>Dialogue across sectors is essential during this time of change in the policy and the priorities of the sector. Governments, large growers and their key customers and financiers need to be brought to the table together. </p><p>Equally important, gaps in the value chain need to be identified so that small-scale growers can participate and collaborate in the move towards sustainability, rather than oppose it.</p><p>Achieving sustainable value chains is clearly not the sole responsibility of any stakeholder and neither should it be. Instead, a concerted, collaborative effort founded on access to quality information is needed to prevent the haze and other crises from returning to the region.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHORS: Simon Tay and Chen Chen Lee are respectively, Chairman and Director (Policy Programs) at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA).

Last year, I spoke about the benefits that a sustainable agroforestry sector can bring to the region, and the roles that the government, civil society and the financial community play in encouraging the sustainable development of the sector. I am happy to see the progress made by the various stakeholders over the past year.</p><p>3. Sustainable development is often defined as development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Extreme advocates of sustainability may come across as arguing against all forms of development - for example that every inch of forest must be saved in the same state as today. This extreme position is difficult to defend because it ignores the real and legitimate needs of the present generation. The palm oil sector, for example, brings important economic benefits to the region. Palm oil contributes an estimated 2-2.5% to the Gross National Product in Indonesia, and is the fourth largest contributor to Gross National Income in Malaysia. It also supports the transition of many communities out of poverty and significantly improves the lives of smallholder farmers. With demand for palm oil projected to grow by another 50% by 2020, there is tremendous potential for growth.</p><p>4. And yet, we are all acutely aware of the social and environmental costs that an expanding agro-forestry sector has brought. Social conflict between indigenous communities and corporates is common, due to discrepancies in land allocation. New areas for cultivation of palm oil often come at the expense of the rainforest, and all the resources it contains.</p><p>5. It is therefore critical that we continue to strike the right balance by actively shaping the agro-forestry sector into a more sustainable one. Let me elaborate on how various stakeholders can collectively work together to achieve sustainable supply chains for the agroforestry sector.</p><p>6. First, a credible, strong and vibrant civil society serves as a catalyst for change, to broaden and deepen environmental consciousness among the population. There have been promising domestic developments and ground-up efforts by civil society over the past year. Let me name a few.</p><p>7. WWF Singapore and founding members Unilever, Danone, Ayam Brand, IKEA and Wildlife Reserves Singapore, have established the Singapore Alliance for Sustainable Palm Oil (SASPO) in June last year. The Alliance sends an unequivocal signal to consumers that many major businesses are committed to the production, usage and trade of certified sustainable palm oil. I hope their numbers will grow quickly. These companies and organisations lend credibility to the alliance for sustainability. This is both because they walk the talk, but more importantly, they have a deep knowledge of sustainability issues in the real world and how to steer and shape them. Since the establishment of the Alliance, more Singapore based companies have been engaged on their sourcing and policies on palm oil. I encourage companies to make the transition to sustainable palm oil by joining like-minded companies to source responsibly through SASPO.</p><p>8. The Singapore Environment Council (SEC) had in January this year announced a new and more holistic green label category for pulp and paper products which encompasses peatland management and fire prevention standards as part of its criteria. The new category maintains one of the most stringent environmental performance standards globally, and requires companies to have their entire supply chain audited against these criteria. The Government will support companies in this effort by only procuring printing paper with this label in future.</p><p>9. The SEC also launched a new certification category for palm oil-based products last year. When it has taken off, the new category for palm oil products under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) will lead to greater transparency in the palm oil supply chain and provide consumers greater assurance of sustainable sourcing.</p><p>10. Through its #GoHazeFree campaign, the People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM. Haze) has been encouraging households and industry to switch to haze-free palm oil as part of its outreach programme. PM.Haze has also produced a \"Haze-Free Cooking Oil\" Guide.</p><p>11. The government strongly supports these ground-up initiatives that will allow for more informed purchasing decisions and influence consumers towards more environmentally sustainable attitudes and behaviours.But I hope that our NGOs will also deepen their expertise in the area they are championing. This is the best way the government and the civil society can work together so that as the government legislates for sustainability, NGOs have the credibility to help shape our society that supports sustainability.</p><p>12. Second, sustainability should no longer be an afterthought for companies, as it can directly impact the bottom line. With increasing global awareness of the impact of unsustainable farming practices, a lack of oversight over supply chains can result in serious reputational and financial risks for companies.</p><p>13. Hence, forward-looking companies are already taking steps to realize sustainability targets in their supply chain. Unilever is one such example. In 2015, Unilever only had 19% of its palm oil physically certified, but it has committed to increasing this figure to 100% by 2019. Others such as Mars, Mondelez, Nestle, Cargill and Olam have also taken steps in the same directions. They are sending a strong and right signal to the industry.</p><p>14. However, having a strong public showing of a company's sustainable commitment is not sufficient. In a landscape where the traceability of agroforestry commodities is often elusive, this has to be matched by the concrete actions a company takes to scrutinize its upstream suppliers. Recently, a report by the Rainforest Action Network uncovered illegal clearing activities at a UNESCO world heritage rainforest site in Sumatra. This prompted Nestle to raise concerns over unsustainably-produced palm oil that it could have acquired from its upstream supplier. Nestle's upstream supplier subsequently responded by putting on hold purchases from the alleged producer of unsustainable palm oil.</p><p>15. This episode shows that companies cannot let their guard down when it comes to upholding sustainability standards. It is only with continued vigilance - constantly making suppliers accountable, weeding out bad players, and so on - that we can move towards a truly sustainable and reputable agroforestry sector.</p><p>16. Third, governments in the region have moved individually and collectively to act on forest and land fires.</p><p>17. Our region has set its sights on achieving a haze-free ASEAN by 2020. Last year, ASEAN Member States developed and adopted a Roadmap on ASEAN Cooperation towards Transboundary Haze Pollution Control.</p><p>18. Each ASEAN Member State is doing its part to turn this vision into reality. Indonesia has taken positive actions to contain the number of hotspots over the past year. In 2016, there were just over a hundred hotspots as compared to many thousands in 2015. After Riau and Jambi began experiencing land and forest fires from mid-Jan 2017 as a result of drier weather conditions, Indonesia acted expeditiously by declaring a state of emergency in Riau on 24 Jan 2017. This allowed for the timely deployment of resources and tighter coordination between the central and provincial authorities in containing the fires.</p><p>19. More importantly, there are longer-term measures being put in place to address forest and land fires at source. Just last year, the Indonesian Government announced a five-year moratorium on new licenses to establish palm oil concessions. The moratorium will halt the draining and clearing of new carbon-rich peatland. This decision extends to concession land previously licensed to plantation companies as well. The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme Mr Erik Solheim recently praised this move by President Jokowi, calling it a positive and historic decision, both for Indonesia and for global efforts to tackle climate change[1].</p><p>20. While the central government actively tackles the haze problem, provincial governments also play a critical role. Under the leadership of Governor Alex Noerdin, the South Sumatra province is taking on an exemplary role by embarking on a Green Growth Development plan. As you have heard, the plan adopts a multi-stakeholder approach towards the sustainable management of forested lands. In June last year, more than 2,700 independent smallholders covering 5,500 ha in South Sumatra received the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification. This is currently the world's largest individual group of independent smallholders to be RSPO-certified[2]. I was not in the room but was told that Governor Alex Noerdin made a pledge today that this year, there will be no haze coming from the South Sumatra region. Thank you Governor.</p><p>21. Since its establishment in 2016, Indonesia's Peatland Restoration Agency (BRG) has also gone from strength to strength in its peatland mapping exercise despite the challenges it had faced with plantation companies. It has also achieved successes in working together with NGOs and local communities on peatland restoration projects.For instance, BRG recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Alliance of the Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago to drive peatland restoration efforts and empower indigenous communities economically. BRG's efforts bode well for the sustainable growth and development of the agriforestry sector.</p><p>22. Fourth, nascent sustainable financing efforts are gradually gaining a foothold in our domestic financial sector.</p><p>23. Following the launch of the Association of Banks of Singapore's (ABS) Responsible Financing Guidelines in 2015, ABS member banks are now expected to factor into their lending and investment policies sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, resource efficiency, labour standards, and corporate integrity. The local banks have since established internal taskforces on environment, social and governance issues, to help integrate the ABS Guidelines into their lending and business practices. Banks have also implemented environmental risk weightings as part of their loan assessment criteria. Loan decisions relating to companies which are assessed to have high environmental risks will be escalated to the banks' senior management. More recently, the ABS has also introduced specific guidelines for banks on dealing with haze-related risks, such as no open burning on plantations and building capacity on fire prevention with local communities.</p><p>24. Investment firms have also moved to anchor sustainability in their investment processes. Temasek recently established a new sustainability and stewardship group to lead the company's future initiatives around the themes of sustainability and stewardship. This is an important move that demonstrates the growing role that investment firms can play to drive sustainability, and bring about green transformation in the financial sector. I hope it will inspire and spur other financial institutions to do the same.</p><p>25. As the region develops, private sector financing will play an increasingly important role in infrastructure and project finance. If private capital can be directed to projects that take environmental factors into account, projects that engage in unsustainable business practices will be starved of credit. This will help to gradually shift the business landscape towards more sustainable practices. As a leading capital market in the Asia-Pacific, Singapore is well-poised to play an influential role in making this happen.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Each and every one of us has a part to play in realizing a sustainable agroforestry sector in the region. Governments need the political will to act quickly to curb forest and land fires, and will have to take on a larger custodial role in safeguarding the rainforest and high carbon-stock areas. Civil society will need to continue fostering the environmental consciousness of the people, while keeping businesses on their toes as it pushes for greater transparency. Major buyers should insist on purchasing from producers who subscribe to higher and more sustainable standards. Finally, enlightened buyers who make the right choice can help to create added incentives by encouraging producers to move towards sustainable practices. Let us have everyone on board this journey towards a more sustainable and responsible agroforestry sector as there is no other way.</p><p>27. Thank you, and I wish you a lively, constructive discussion ahead.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/indonesia-expands-protection-for-peatland\">http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/indonesia-expands-protection-for-peatland</url></p><p>[2] <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2016/08/23/single-largest-independent-smallholder-group-gets-rspo-certification/\">www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2016/08/23/single-largest-independent-smallholder-group-gets-rspo-certification/</url></p><p>Source: Ministry of the Environment &amp;

The label shows the product can be traced to a sustainably managed forest.</p><p> The event, which will run from today until Sunday, has brought together 10 agroforestry companies, including Wilmar and paper firm Asia Pacific Resources International, and 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to address questions from the public.</p><p> Mr Kim Stengert, the director for communications at the World Wide Fund for NatureSingapore (WWF-Singapore), one of the participating NGOs, said: \"WWF wants to drive home the message to consumers to put pressure on companies to carry the FSC or Certified Sustainable Palm Oil eco-labels, to ensure their products that use paper, pulp or palm oil do not contribute to unsustainable forest practices.\" </p><p> The causes that have brought about the haze and the actions that can be taken to combat the perennial problem are being highlighted as well during the three-day event.</p><p> Visitors can check out text and multimedia displays, as well as the peat soil exhibit, which highlights the problem of peat fires. Such fires - which can burn for months or even years, and emit high levels of carbon dioxide - are largely behind the choking haze that is dogging the region.</p><p>National University of Singapore undergraduate Joys Tan says she knows about what causes haze but wants to know more about \"how the individual can help to reduce it\".</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:audreyt@sph.com.sg\">audreyt@sph.com.sg</email></p><p>SEE OPINION</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-3038533</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DJ1-VGC1-JCF2-84PV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 7, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001Z7M</classCode><className>ASIA PACIFIC RESOURCES INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009F91</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

This occurs every three to seven years, leading to shifts in global weather patterns.</p><p>While 2019 is forecast\u00a0to be an El Nino year, its effect is not expected to be as strong as in past years.</p><p>The study also noted that Indonesia has restored some 679,000 hectares of peatland - partially decayed plant matter - and the efforts appear to be effective in reducing the number of fires compared to 2015.</p><p>Degraded peatlands had been the primary sites of fires in 1997 and 2015.</p><p>The report also noted that since 2015, Indonesia's government agencies and agroforestry companies had intensified engagements with village communities, and strengthened fire prevention, detection and suppression capabilities.</p><p>Professor Tay said that SIIA plans to release the outlook on a yearly basis and will include more feedback from a variety of government agencies, companies, academic institutes and non-governmental organisations in future reports.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-4541821</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W19-VCH1-DXPH-P00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp;

Announced in Parliament on Monday after a month-long public consultation, the toughened Transboundary Haze Pollution Bill penalises companies up to S$2 million if they subject residents in Singapore to choking haze through their commercial activities. This is an almost seven-fold jump from the earlier proposed fine of S$300,000. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, it is unclear if the stiffer fine would be an effective deterrent. The maximum penalty of S$2 million - to be imposed on companies guilty of causing haze for a continuous period of 20 days or more - may seem punitive, but it is, in fact, a paltry sum to agroforestry firms, which make hundreds of millions, if not billions, in profits every year. If we take the net profit of seven key agroforestry companies last year, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that S$2 million represents less than 1 per cent of their average earnings. </p><p>Still, even if the fine is not sufficiently high to hurt the bottom lines of bigger players, a conviction should be a strong-enough damper as companies would not want to put their reputations at risk. Any conviction in a Singapore court will affect their financial standing and threaten their access to bank loans and government tax incentive programmes. </p><p>What else can Singapore do to strengthen the legislation and prevent a recurrence of the choking haze last year? </p><p>SHARPENING THE BILL </p><p>First, while the amended Bill makes it possible for individuals to file civil suits against errant firms, most members of the public are unlikely to be able to afford a legal fight. It would be good if an additional provision can be introduced to allow third-party groups, such as a public hospital or non-governmental organisation, to act on their behalf. </p><p>Overlapping land concessions in Indonesia are another nagging problem. In Indonesia, which is home to around 70 per cent of the peatlands in South-east Asia, it is not uncommon for the central government, state government agencies or even community leaders to issue permits for the same plot of land to different parties. Worse, such information is not always consolidated and updated at the national level. </p><p>While the amended Bill has cast the judicial net wider to make sure all parties involved can be hauled to court, the Government should explore whether to make it explicit that overlapping concessions cannot be accepted as a defence. If such a provision is included in the revised Bill, it would strengthen the deterrence against slash-and-burn or, at least, nudge companies operating on the ground to start working on fire management plans collectively. </p><p>Also, Singapore's collection of fines should not be seen as self-serving. If the court-imposed fines can be partially channelled to the ASEAN Transboundary Haze Pollution Control Fund to help finance haze-fighting efforts in neighbouring countries, it will help boost regional leaders' receptivity towards the Bill, since their citizens living closest to the hot spots are most likely to benefit from the fund.</p><p>REGIONAL COOPERATION IS KEY </p><p>Lastly, it is also imperative to secure the cooperation of all Association of South-east Asian Nations governments to operationalise the haze monitoring system (HMS). The system can then host information on hot spot locations and concession maps, so such data can be used as evidence in court. </p><p>Leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, in principle, endorsed the HMS last year, when all three countries experienced one of the worst episodes of haze in recent years, but concession maps have yet to be submitted. Without credible evidence on exactly who owns the land where the fires occurred, legal action specified in Singapore's Transboundary Haze Pollution Bill cannot be taken further. </p><p>It is a pity that Indonesia's outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono would probably be unable to see through the implementation of the HMS during the remaining months of his term. With the imminent swearing-in of a new administration, it is important for Singapore to start engaging the next batch of leaders and officials. </p><p>Although environmental concerns did not feature prominently in the just-concluded Indonesian presidential election, candidate Joko Widodo - a forestry graduate - had made clear his resolve to tackle overlapping land permits in his team's manifesto. Mr Prabowo Subianto, who had lived in Singapore when his economist father was forced into exile, also had frequent contact with leaders here during his days in the military. </p><p>Not a bad start, it seems, for our leaders and officials to register Singapore's concerns on Indonesia's agenda. </p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><p>Chua Chin Wei is deputy director and fellow for the environment and resources and Cheong Poh Kwan is a policy research analyst at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>It is unclear if the stiffer fine would be effective in deterring firms that contribute to haze.

When the peat is exposed to air, it becomes more flammable and also releases carbon into the atmosphere.</p><p>Indonesia has a new tool in its arsenal to fight haze. In October, it established the International Tropical Peatland Centre in Jakarta.</p><p> An initiative of Indonesia, Peru, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo, the research centre aims to develop scientific projects that will inform the conservation and sustainable management of tropical peatlands - large carbon sinks which can be found in all four countries.</p><p> \"There are similar problems with peatland management in all countries, such as the conversion of peatlands for agriculture and the draining of peatlands, and with the establishment of this centre, we can learn from each other,\" said Mr Foead.</p><p> For example, the mapping of peatlands can help planners determine which areas of a peat dome should be conserved, and which are more suitable for agroforestry, he added.</p><p> Ms Pey Peixun, outreach manager for the Singapore-based environmental group PM Haze (People's Movement to Stop Haze), said that the establishment of the centre was timely.</p><p> The group discovered over the course of its work on peatland restoration projects in Indonesia that a key barrier to peatland restoration is the lack of access to information such as peat maps, vegetation and water table data, she said.</p><p> \"Currently, there is no coordinated dissemination and research centre. Instead, the information and research needed is scattered among various local and international institutions. The presence of the centre as a coordinating body will hopefully speed up the global peatland restoration effort,\" Ms Pey said.</p><p>Audrey Tan</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Singapore skyline shrouded in haze in 2016.
