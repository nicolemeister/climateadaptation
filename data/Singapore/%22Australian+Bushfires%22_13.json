This refers to warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean. The phenomenon has induced weather extremes such as the 2019 Australian bushfires and African floods.</p><p> Climate change is a common denominator that will worsen warming globally.</p><p> The heatwave sweeping across Europe is largely due to the Azores High - a slow-moving, semi-permanent high-pressure cell - usually located off Spain, said Professor Matthias Roth from the Department of Geography at the National University of Singapore.</p><p> Temperatures have surged past 40 deg C in countries such as Britain and Spain due to the high-pressure system, which is extremely strong this year. More of such occurrences can be expected in the future.</p><p> The \"extremely large\" Azores High is becoming more frequent - from once every 10 years in the pre-industrial period to once every four years in the 21st century, said Prof Wang.</p><p> As greenhouse gases warm the climate, more anti-cyclones such as the Azores High are projected to reach farther north across temperate regions in Europe, Asia or North America, added Prof Koh.</p><p> In Singapore, a stronger El Nino caused by climate change can result in higher-than-normal temperatures.</p><p> Said Prof Koh: \"Under climate-change scenarios, more models show stronger El Ninos than not.</p><p> \"This spells drier and hotter weather in Singapore during El Nino years in future, sometimes intense enough to constitute heatwaves.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1069234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65YW-V6H1-JCF2-83N5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This increase was due to contributions from FLT's acquisitions in Europe and Australia, but was partially offset by divestment activities in Australia.</p><p>Distributable income rose 12.9 per cent year on year to A$41.4 million.</p><p>Robert Wallace, chief executive officer of the Reit manager, called it an \"exciting\" first quarter for FLT, and highlighted two milestones.</p><p>The first was the signing of a five-year lease to Amazon for FLT's one remaining vacancy at Perth Airport last October, which brought the Reit's portfolio occupancy to 100 per cent, up from 99.6 per cent as at last Sept 30.</p><p>The second milestone was the announcing of a proposed merger between FLT and its sister Reit, Frasers Commercial Trust.</p><p>The S$1.58 billion merger was announced last December, a move that would make the enlarged entity one of the 10 largest Singapore-listed Reits by market capitalisation. \"The merger would be a transformational development for the combined entities delivering DPU accretion and greater long-term growth prospects to unitholders,\" Mr Wallace said.</p><p>Looking ahead, FLT's manager said it continues to monitor key macro developments, including the ongoing global trade tensions, Brexit and the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus.</p><p>The Reit manager is also monitoring the Australian bushfires, which have impacted certain rural regions Down Under. FLT's properties are unaffected as they are not in the affected areas, the manager added.</p><p>Otherwise, in Australia, Melbourne remains the top performing industrial market in terms of leasing activity, supported by strong economic fundamentals and rental affordability.</p><p>Units of FLT closed 1.6 per cent or two cents higher at S$1.27 on Thursday before the results were released.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-281210</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y51-XVH1-DYX4-03TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>CC000CFHJ</classCode><className>FRASERS CENTREPOINT LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>SIC6512 OPERATORS OF NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>TQ5 (SGX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Estate Investment Trusts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0VBOTBEMUNGMjA5NEMxN0JBRTE1M0MxQzM4QzE1Nzc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA0QjAwN0E3NDgwNDhBRjgxMDIzRUFDQkNERDc0ODQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N525920EM</classCode><className>INVESTMENT TRUSTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001013</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DU8N</classCode><className>LOGISTICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A0EC</classCode><className>MERGERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000944</classCode><className>INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001076</classCode><className>MARKET CAPITALIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001015</classCode><className>LEASE AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000517</classCode><className>DIVESTITURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001943</classCode><className>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE &amp;

They are capable of generating their own weather systems, including lightning strikes.</p><p>The way that massive plumes of smoke are funnelled upwards to create pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which can generate their own weather. Illustration: bom.gov.au</p><p>Some of these firestorms are so strong that they can carry smoke 15km skywards and into the stratosphere, a section of the atmosphere where wind speeds can reach up to 220 km/h.</p><p>It is here that winds start to blow the smoke across oceans and continents.</p><p>Scientists are also concerned that the smoke and burning material could linger in the stratosphere and damage the ozone layer inside, affecting the Earth's climate. The ozone layer serves as an important filter blocking out hazardous ultraviolet radiation from the sun.</p><p>Dr David Peterson, a meteorologist at the US Naval Research Laboratory, told The New Scientist that the effect of the firestorms on the ozone layer could be similar to that of a \"moderate volcanic eruption\".</p><p>\"It is likely on a volcanic scale. The big thing here is really the impact that this is having on the stratosphere,\" he said.</p><p>CAN THE SMOKE REACH SINGAPORE?</p><p>For now, it is unlikely that any of the bushfire smoke will come to Singapore, said the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS).</p><p>\"Singapore and the surrounding region are currently in the Northeast Monsoon season, which is expected to last until March 2020,\" said an MSS spokesperson.</p><p>During this period, winds in the region will blow from the north to the south, likely sweeping the smoke away from Singapore when it reaches South-east Asia.</p><p>Singapore also does not receive any winds from Australia, even during the Southwest Monsoon season in June, which is when local southerly winds blow through the area, said the MSS.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-5903646</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1M-9H81-DXPH-P0MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Space Transportation</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTFGRUU1OTZENUQyNERFMkJGRTdGRTNEOTM4Nzc3QUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

Much work needs to be done in developing climate resiliency and CDP appreciates the involvement of business leaders such as CDL in our common goal towards a transformational change for a low carbon economy.\"</p><p>CDL group chief executive officer Sherman Kwek said in a news release on Monday that soaring record temperatures and high-impact weather continue to plague the living environment, citing the ongoing Australian bushfires as an example.</p><p>\"In the advent of a new decade, there is a greater need for businesses to actively reduce their carbon footprint and accelerate climate action.

In this instalment, artist Dorcas Tang talks about how she uses Instagram to spread awareness about issues ranging from climate change to racism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SINGAPORE - For emerging artist Dorcas Tang Wen Yu, her creativity is an important way to get people to think about issues that matter to her - such as the environment and mental wellbeing - in a non-confrontational manner.</p><p>She told TODAY that the fantasy-style artworks she creates get people to connect to the issues she cares about deeply \"without it being overly intimidating or aggressive, which people usually find talking about social issues to be\".</p><p>It's all about building what she calls her utopia - a world where human beings coexist peacefully and environmental needs are respected.</p><p>\"I am a very idealistic person, I always like to imagine the best possible outcome!\" she declared.</p><p>At the age of 20, Ms Tang is already making her mark by using her Instagram platform @earthtodorcas, which has over 3,400 followers, as a form of art advocacy to spread awareness of these social issues, which also include sustainability, mental health and racism.</p><p>Ms Tang's entry into the world of art was somewhat unplanned.</p><p>At 17, she started a watercolour art business by \"accident\". \"I was doing fundraising for a children's home and I did watercolour painting for them,\" she said.</p><p>\"Slowly, people were asking for classes and my business cards. So I thought, okay, maybe I will just try to make it into a real thing,\" she said.</p><p>From then on, Ms Tang was inspired to use watercolour art to raise money for different causes, such as wildlife injured in the Australian bushfires.</p><p>Now, she has transitioned to digital illustrations in efforts to be more environmentally sustainable.</p><p>Ms Tang developed an interest in issues such as sustainability when she was studying at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's School of Design and Environment, Sustainable Urban Design and Engineering (Architecture), which opened her eyes to the social implications of the building process.</p><p>She recalled that she was asked to design an eco-tourism hotel, which was to be built in a quarry, a project that would involve felling many trees.</p><p>\"After that project, I thought, 'Are we clearing land... that supports functional ecosystems, in order to build eco-friendly buildings?'\"</p><p>The project increased Ms Tang's passion for environmental issues and inspired her to research issues that could be translated into design.</p><p>Her biggest role model? Ms Mizah Rahman, who died in May this year. She was the co-founder of non-profit planning and educational outfit P!D (Participate in Design) and Ms Tang's lecturer in her first year.</p><p>\"Ms Mizah showed me good design doesn't come from... building something that is very impressive,\" she said.</p><p>\"Rather, it's about letting the community have a stake in what you are building, and letting the community have their voices heard.</p><p>\"It's not about what design is, but about what design can do for the larger community... It's really about designing with a heart.\"</p><p>While Covid-19 has upended Ms Tang's plans to explore physical community art installations, her passion for spreading social awareness has continued to burn bright.</p><p>Noting that the crisis has exacerbated many issues, she has utilised this pandemic-ridden time to make the most of opportunities to explore issues deeply \"since we are on Instagram so much\".</p><p>Looking ahead, Ms Tang wants to develop her personal artistic style and delve deeper into specific social issues.</p><p>But, for now, this changemaker is keeping busy.</p><p>She recently completed an internship with the Singapore Association of Mental Health (SAMH), and has her hands full running her art advocacy page and engaging in various ideas for side projects to make a social impact, the details of which she said she was unable to disclose yet.</p><p>Ms Tang said that the SAMH internship was \"right up (her) alley\" because it involved the use of art to allow people to focus on the way that they process their emotions.</p><p>That sums up the way she feels about the value of art.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, I want people to take away a sense of hope and wholesomeness, a sense of community (from my art),\" Ms Tang said. \"I want people to know that there is a brighter future ahead.\"</p><p>When asked why youths should get more involved in advocacy, Ms Tang said that while it is important for every voice to be heard, youths have a larger stake in making positive change for the future.</p><p>\"Advocacy is about having more than a desire for change, it is about acting on the change we want to see.</p><p>\"It doesn't have to be a grand gesture, it starts small and is a culmination of these actions across time and people that drives change,\" she said, adding that youths can start by speaking up on social media, or during conversations at home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-9469466</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6183-SBX1-JB7G-01WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>November 10, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

The latest World Economic Forum report ranks climate change as the biggest global threat to us for the next decade. Right now, are we ready for the next big typhoon or earthquake? Can we deal with the monsoon season at the same time as we're fighting Covid-19'</p><p>Climate change is complicating the global risk landscape. The effects of global warming are evident in many ways, and extreme weather more frequent and severe.</p><p>We've heard it before. Higher average temperatures, longer and more frequent heatwaves, rising sea levels, a major cause of extreme flooding, and more severe rainfall are wreaking havoc across the globe. Climate change is also influencing secondary perils so much so that they can scant be considered \"secondary\" any longer. Elsewhere, higher average temperatures and unprecedented dryness made this past Australian bushfire season the most extreme on record, according to Swiss Re Institute's sigma publication.</p><p>Our research tells us there were 317 disaster events in 2019. Of these, 107, or a third, happened in the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian bushfires, flash floods across South-east Asia, and Typhoon Lekima in China were front and centre in our living rooms and on our newsfeeds. Still, they didn't cause the most damage. When they made landfall in densely populated Japan, Typhoons Hagibis and Faxai left a destructive trail in their wake and resulted in at least US$15 billion in insured losses, according to Swiss Re figures.</p><p>Beginning in September 2019 and lasting half a year, the recent Australian bushfire season scorched 16 million hectares and resulted in US$1.5 billion insured losses so far. The images of scorched agricultural and pastoral land, dead and dying animals, and of angry and distraught landowners, will long live in memory.</p><p>What we need to avoid is to think that these were once-in-a-generation events; science tells us that they will happen again - and more frequently.</p><p>These are just the insured losses. For every insured dollar lost, there is at least another $2 that is not covered by insurance. Of the US$70 billion in economic losses last year, only US$20.8 billion was insured, meaning about US$50 billion that could have gone to improved infrastructure, and getting people and businesses back on their feet quickly was lost because governments or individuals willingly chose to bypass an insurance solution.</p><p>INSURING OUR FUTURE</p><p>Unless there is a significant change in how insurance is viewed as a risk transfer mechanism, the protection gap will continue to widen. Asia's growth, industrialisation and urban migration patterns will see to that.</p><p>To keep up with the dynamic climate risks, some of the things insurers can do are to continuously reassess our underwriting processes, incorporate latest scientific findings and strengthen our capacity to deal with natural catastrophes. Working with insurers, end-clients and third parties, we need to find ways to increase societies' resilience to natural catastrophes. This in turn increases the availability of insurance cover and helps to reduce the cost.</p><p>Bearing this mitigation in mind, to close the protection gap, we need to keep reminding everyone that insurance is really one of the most reliable, affordable and efficient ways to protect yourself against the risks of climate change.</p><p>But we also need to innovate. We need to make our products easier to understand and access. We know that a parametric solution - claims that are triggered on pre-agreed conditions - is one way to get more people insured against climate risk and natural catastrophes. Everyone needs a quick and painless solution to claim especially when getting back to normalcy quickly is so very important.</p><p>One example is Swiss Re's joint venture with Groupama AVIC, where we helped create a parametric product to protect citizens in China's Mao County against floods, earthquakes, landslides, heavy rainfall, among others. This product's rapid payout helps with fast relief and reconstruction efforts in one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world.</p><p>In Japan, Swiss Re also worked with Zurich Insurance to design a parametric solution that anyone can buy off the shelf via their credit card, bank, or even their utility company. In a country where earthquakes are detected every five minutes, easy access - and payouts - can benefit millions of people.</p><p>The longer we leave climate change unmitigated, natural catastrophes will reach an irreversible tipping point where insurance cover will become unaffordable to many, or even worse, no longer available. We can't allow that to happen.</p><p>To close the protection gap and build resilience at scale and speed, public-private partnerships have an important role to play. While convincing individuals to purchase protection remains challenging, public sectors don't have to shoulder the burden alone. Swiss Re supported the issuance of catastrophe-linked bonds in the Philippines, one of the world's most disaster-prone economies. A cat bond is triggered if certain conditions are met, and the principal is paid out very quickly in order for the government to ease the societal burden from a disaster event. In a country where a fifth of the population live below the poverty line, this is more of a necessity than a desire.</p><p>Covid-19 has made 2020 an even more challenging year - one that puts everyone's resilience under greater strain. According to the UN Trade and Development Agency, this outbreak could cost the global economy as much as US$2 trillion. What happens if there is a major earthquake, typhoon, flood or fire in your country at the same time while we're still dealing with Covid-19'</p><p>We knew even before 2020 began that we would have to contend with climate risk and its knock-on effect on natural disasters. To deal with two major unknowns like Covid-19 and natural catastrophes would be a very challenging situation for those impacted. Maybe this was the wake-up call we needed. Maybe seeing rivers run clear, animals coming into urban settings and smog-free skies will be something that inspires more of us. There is never a better time than the present to deal with it.</p><p> The writer is CEO, Reinsurance Asia and regional president of Swiss Re </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A bushfire burning near the town of Bumbalong, south of Canberra in February.

To avoid inflicting more damage to the environment in this increasingly dire situation, both the public and private sectors will have to make a sustained and concerted effort. Enacting measures consistent with this 1.5-deg C goal will require significant financing - according to UNEP, the necessary climate policies could cost up to US$3.6 trillion per year globally. The landmark Paris Agreement of 2015 was one of the first to acknowledge this need to spend on sustainability by calling for finance flows to be more consistent with the rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and \"climate-resilient\" development.</p><p>Against this backdrop, governments around the world - notably the US, France and China - have started to pave the way forward by issuing large amounts of green bonds. China in particular has taken bold steps - in 2018, China issued some US$42.8 billion in green bonds on the back of establishing the world's largest carbon trading exchange. By looking at China, we can identify ways in which green financing can flourish, as well as factors companies need to consider when expanding in the region.</p><p> Establish what truly meets your definition of 'sustainable' and stick to itWhile true all over the world, companies operating in Asia need to exercise due diligence on green investments due to differing standards and perspectives. This is no easy task, as currently there are no globally accepted environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting assurance standards. Exacerbating this issue is the fact that sustainability reports are still considered voluntary and typically not subject to scrutiny by external auditors.</p><p>As it stands, some analysts maintain that less than half of China's green investments would meet other countries' standards on green financing; a recent data review determined that Chinese financial institutions allocated roughly US$1 billion in \"green\" financing to coal-related projects in the first half of 2019. While some of these bonds were issued to better implement clean coal technology, to many investors, this fails to address that coal itself will never be a truly sustainable energy source.</p><p>Going forward, both firms and investors must be held accountable for any well-intentioned green finance effort. Eliminating greenwashing - the act of presenting misleading information about a company's or product's environmental friendliness - should be of the highest priority as the practice will derail any progress. With different acceptable definitions of what constitutes \"sustainable\", investors must take the initiative to evaluate and scrutinise whether a green finance project meets their standards. To aid this process, green bond issuers must disclose the necessary pertinent information regarding how investments are being used and their environmental impact.</p><p> Capitalise on the need to attract private investment in China's evolving frameworkIn its rise as a global leader in green finance, China's green finance landscape is being shaped by market mechanisms working with government policy and financing to promote green growth and better environmental protection. China has stimulated interest in sustainability investments through a variety of mechanisms - the aforementioned carbon trading exchange, a thriving green bond market, and plentiful green private equity funds.</p><p>With a clear regulatory, policy and financial framework, the Chinese government has successfully brought climate change into the spotlight. The private sector is responding and has actively invested in green technologies, spurring the rise of the ESG segment.</p><p>Not only does China welcome growing private sector investment, it is reliant on it to realise lofty sustainability goals. Different organisations including the Paulson Institute estimate that there will be US$1 trillion in environmental opportunities in China, while the World Economic Forum says China needs a staggering US$6.4 trillion to US$19.4 trillion to finance the transition to a greener economy. Only so much government financing can be allocated to meet these needs and so moving forward, China will continue to innovate vehicles, incentives, policy and regulations that attract private investment.</p><p> Constantly cater to an increasingly educated and sophisticated audienceDue to pollution concerns, cities all across China collect up-to-date air quality data and make it freely available to the public. Both locals and expats living in China actively follow the index, making sustainability a front-of-mind consideration each and every day.</p><p>This example is a microcosm of how sustainability activities and awareness in Asia has grown significantly in the past decade. The continued growth of China and Asian economies will enable companies to focus more on sustainability programmes that address environmental and social well-being in line with growing demands for better environmental practices.</p><p>As a result, related green technology industries will develop and flourish, driving more demand for green financing.</p><p>For companies expanding into China and Asia, they will be engaging with an increasingly receptive audience where climate change investing is undoubtedly seen as a positive - if not critical - practice. Investors will request and seek promising companies which understand the need for sustainability and are actively making a difference.</p><p>Negativity will also weigh heavily on ESG investment decisions. Now more than ever, poor corporate governance, environmental mismanagement or irresponsible social behaviour such as mishandling of personal data will diminish investor confidence and impact share prices.</p><p>As China assumes the mantle of green finance leadership, it will continue looking outwards to forge alliances with the West to drive CSR and environmental initiatives. For example, China has engaged in green economic and financial dialogue with both the UK and France; in 2018, the Bank of England was reported to be working with China to develop green finance instruments.</p><p>Western companies can leverage this desire for bilateral and multilateral cooperation to achieve expansion goals in China and drive further joint development.</p><p>The recent announcement that China will effectively ban single-use plastic across the country over the next five years is only the latest example in which the Chinese are taking the initiative to lead sustainability - this shows no signs of stopping any time soon. Despite transparency and accountability issues that should be addressed by all parties, the potential of Chinese green finance to support these leading initiatives and innovate new sustainability developments cannot be overstated.</p><p> The writer is an assistant professor at the Department of Accountancy and Law, School of Business, Hong Kong Baptist University, and author of Business Sustainability in Asia. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-282569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7C-KR91-DYX4-0328-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQ4RkY4MDdCOUQ4NEQ3QUFDQkQ0NEFDNDE0MjNDQ0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDAzNzc2QzlDN0ZENDAwNTg5MTkzNUJFMjc1QUEwQjg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRNL</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS - ENVIRONMENTAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

Significant fires have also hit Queensland and Victoria. Australia's largest cities, Sydney in NSW and Melbourne in Victoria, have also been affected by smoke haze from the fires.</p><p>Bushfires are\u00a0not new to Australia. The hot and dry weather, especially over the summer months from December to February, makes it easy for blazes to start and spread.</p><p>However, severe weather conditions have made firefighting conditions more difficult and have led to the fires spreading more rapidly - average temperatures across Australia have hit an all-time high of over 40\u00b0C and the country is facing one of its worst droughts in decades. The fires also started much earlier than usual, with significant blazes in September in NSW.</p><p>Many experts believe climate change has played a key role in bringing about the tinder-dry and hotter than average conditions, just as the climate emergency has led to more extreme weather conditions around the globe.</p><p>Australian officials have said the fires will continue to burn for months. On Tuesday (Jan 7), the NSW Rural Fire Service reported that 130 fires were still burning across the state alone.</p><p>TODAY takes a closer look at the fires, which have claimed dozens of lives and devastated wildlife in Australia.</p><p>HOW BAD IS IT?</p><p>Twenty-five people have died so far, with thousands of homes damaged, and in many cases destroyed. Australian officials have estimated that more than 67,000 people have left or been evacuated from fire-ravaged areas in Victoria, mainly in the east of the\u00a0state.</p><p>The bushfires have also taken a terrible toll on wildlife.</p><p>Wildlife experts estimate that about 480 million animals - mammals, birds and reptiles - have been killed by the fires so far.</p><p>This huge toll is expected to rise, Professor Chris Dickman -\u00a0a biodiversity expert at the University of Sydney -\u00a0told the BBC, as it is likely that some of the animals which survived the fires may die later due to the lack of food and shelter.</p><p>Ecologists are also concerned that the infernos could wipe out entire species, some of which are currently endangered.</p><p>For instance, the critically endangered Kangaroo Island dunnarts and glossy black cockatoos on Kangaroo Island -\u00a0a popular tourist destination in South Australia -\u00a0are under threat as the fires have burned extensive areas of critical habitat. Thousands of koalas on the island are also believed to have died.</p><p>Meanwhile,\u00a0up to 8,400 more koalas - 30 per cent of the population - in the NSW mid-north coast have also perished due to the crisis, Australia's Environment Minister Sussan Ley said.</p><p>UNHAPPINESS WITH THE AUSTRALIAN GOVT'S HANDLING OF THE CRISIS\u00a0</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been lambasted for his handling of the ongoing crisis. He was widely criticised for taking a holiday in Hawaii as the fire emergency unfolded.</p><p>Initially, Mr Morrison had resisted the idea of compensating the volunteer firefighters who were taking time out of their work to help with relief efforts.</p><p>However, he has since said that eligible volunteers would receive A$300 (S$279) a day, and up to A$6,000 if they helped for more than 10 days during this fire season.</p><p>About 3,000 firefighters are in the field battling the blazes, many from volunteer NSW Rural Fire Service brigades\u00a0and Victoria's volunteer Country Fire Authority.</p><p>On another front, Mr Morrison had also resisted calls for the federal government to play a major role in what is largely a state responsibility.</p><p>But on Saturday, he announced that the government would call up 3,000 army reservists over the coming weeks to assist with relief efforts. The navy has also been deployed to rescue residents stranded on beaches near fire-ravaged townships, whose road access has been cut off by the fires.</p><p>Mr Morrison's government has also received flak for downplaying the effects of climate change on the bushfires. It has insisted that there is no direct link between the current climate crisis and the unprecedented scale and ferocity of the the bushfires raging around the country.</p><p>Mr Morrison once carried a piece of coal into the national Parliament as a demonstration of his support for the coal industry, a major exporter.</p><p>Australia, with a population of about 25 million, contributes 1.3 per cent of the world's carbon emissions but is the second-largest emitter per capita behind the United States.</p><p>HOW CAN SINGAPOREANS HELP?</p><p>On Tuesday, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) deployed two Chinook helicopters to assist the Australian Defence Force with relief efforts, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in a Facebook post.</p><p>The SingaporeRed Cross has also pledged S$50,000 in humanitarian aid to support the affected communities while Singapore-based conglomerate ComfortDelGro - which has operations Down Under -\u00a0has established a fund with an initial sum of A$250,000 (S$232,181) to assist its employees and the Australians affected by the bushfires.</p><p>The SingaporeRed Cross said it has also set up a fund-raising page to allow Singaporeans to make donations. These donations would be sent on to their counterparts in the Red Cross in Australia. Alternatively, the public can also donate to support firefighting brigades, such as the NSW Rural Fire Service, in their work.</p><p>Singaporeans can also choose to adopt injured koalas from the Koala Hospital, based in the NSW regional town of Port Macquarie. The small fee will go towards care and rehabilitation for the sick koalas, some of which are burn victims.</p><p>IS IT STILL SAFE TO TRAVEL DOWN UNDER?</p><p>It has largely been business as usual for tour agencies in Singapore as tourists in Australian\u00a0cities such as Melbourne and Sydney have remained unaffected by the blazes apart from the impact of smoke haze, which has been quite severe on some days, especially in Sydney\u00a0and the Australia's capital, Canberra.</p><p>The agencies also told TODAY that while they have received calls from concerned customers, no one has cancelled their tour packages and,\u00a0for now, they do not expect their programmes to be affected by the fires.</p><p>Ms Alicia Seah, director of marketing and communications at Dynasty Travel, said most of their customers who booked tours during the December period last year have returned from their holidays.</p><p>\"Moving forward, the next departure period will be during Chinese New Year. We are monitoring the situation and will take the lead from the Australian authorities,\" said Ms Seah.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Rob Stables, Country Manager at STA Travel, said that most of their customers are students travelling or returning to Australia to commence their studies and would have accepted a place at university months ago.</p><p>\"We will be monitoring the level of inquiries we receive for Australia but given most people study in the cities, rather than rurally, we don't anticipate there being a huge impact on the number of students travelling to Australia,\" he said.

Driven by the logic of profit, they baulked at the extra cost of maintaining sustainable business practices. Nudged hard enough, many try to make do with token gestures, and \"thoughts and prayers\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Low demand for products, expensively-built adhering to environmental standards, resulted in poor returns. Unsurprisingly, early attempts at socially responsible investing was an uphill battle and inertia set in easily, write Tensie Whelan and Carly Fink of the New York University Stern Center for Sustainable Business in the Harvard Business Review.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the global Covid-19 pandemic has forced a reality check in the wake of a once-hypothetical catastrophe becoming a reality. Suddenly, the possibility of rising sea levels and extreme changes in weather patterns no longer seems so outrageous. Considering the damage that Covid-</p><p>19 has wrought upon the global economy, there is a compelling business case for assessing and arresting climate risks to the global economy. Urgent action is needed - the UN says that the international community only has 12 years to avert irreversible environmental damage.</p><p>Carrie Johnson, founder of Singapore-based climate risk consultancy PAIA Consulting, notes that even five years before Covid-19 struck, many Singapore firms had been increasingly knocking at her door for help in developing a climate sustainability strategy for their businesses. The Australian bushfires in 2019, in particular, had affected the supply chains of many Singapore firms, while record-high tides in Venice last year also worried many business leaders based in this tiny island state.</p><p>\"Many companies are now much more actively embracing sustainability and climate risk in light of Covid-19,\" says Johnson, who has been helping businesses manage climate risks for two decades. \"Covid-19 has been very much a test of a company's resilience and [firms are] building up climate resilience so they are better positioned for the future,\" she adds.</p><p>Talking heads at think tanks and research bodies from the World Economic Forum to the Asia Foundation are calling on the world to replicate its decisive response to Covid-19 in the context of fighting climate change - the true crisis of our times.</p><p>The sort of risks businesses face from climate change are diverse and high-stakes in nature. Extreme weather conditions like hurricanes and floods could damage business assets, while the increased prevalence of drought in other parts of the world could disrupt supply chains due to a lack of water for production. Geopolitical tensions could also potentially flare up, with China and Russia beginning to vie for influence in the Arctic as the melting of polar ice caps makes its waters a potentially lucrative, newer and shorter sea route for global trade.</p><p>\"By 2050, in an average year, between 8% and 13% of GDP could be at risk as a result of rising heat and humidity,\" warns an upcoming Mc-</p><p>Kinsey Global Institute (MGI) report. Already, rising ocean surface temperatures of 0.7\u00b0C globally have seen a 35% reduction in North Atlantic fish yields, affecting both the fishing industry and the world's food security. The problem won't be confined to the Atlantic. Come 2050, global fish catches will fall by about 8% and associated revenue by 10%, with 650 million to 800 million people who depend on the fishing industry to survive suddenly deprived of a livelihood.</p><p>There are also less tangible risks as well: firms are increasingly subject to regulatory risks as regulators begin introducing sustainability legislation to combat climate change. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example, is even looking to introduce environmental risk assessment guidelines on local financial institutions.</p><p>Additionally, with the court of public opinion increasingly moving in favour of sustainability - especially among young people - firms are increasingly under pressure to improve on what is by now a common acronym, ESG: environmental, social and governance standards. Stakeholders, including both consumers and shareholders, are keen to know if a company's operations are up to certain standards.</p><p>Indeed, investors have punished companies for not being up to mark in their ESG standards. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch looked at the performance of 24 S&amp;P 500 companies that had suffered from major ESG controversies of various kinds since 2014. It found that those controversies were accompanied by peak-to-trough market capitalisation losses of US$534 billion ($734.6 billion). This study was undertaken in the context of the S&amp;P 500 growing by 7% on average. With markets no longer as willing to tolerate non-performance on \"ESG\", firms must increasingly work sustainability into their business strategies to stay profitable.</p><p>\"As with the climate and biodiversity crises, recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity - particularly our global financial and economic systems, based on a limited paradigm that prizes economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones,\" urges a team of scientists from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, a UN scientific body dedicated to protecting biodiversity.</p><p>Green is the colour of money</p><p>But former US Vice-President turned environmentalist Al Gore does not see sustainability as yet another drain on profits. Rather, he smells ample business opportunities awaiting in the sustainability sector, as demand for such goods and services grows with firms slowly buying into the need to reduce carbon emissions and pollution in their operation. In fact, the growth of this sunrise industry could serve as a powerful engine of recovery from the Covid-19 recession.</p><p>\"The most cost-effective way to create the new jobs and economic progress we're going to need after this pandemic, is through a green stimulus programme,\" he argues at the DBS Asian Insights Conference.</p><p>Gore notes that the sustainability sector isn't just a destination for investment - it is a creator of jobs as well. Well before Covid-19, the fastest-growing job in the US was to be a solar panel installer, followed closely by similar roles like wind turbine technician. Job growth for the former is five times faster than average and is expected to grow 10 times faster over the next decade, he adds.</p><p>\"On average, 2.65 full-time-equivalent (FTE) jobs are created from US$1 million spending in fossil fuels, while that same amount of spending would create 7.49 or 7.72 FTE jobs in renewables or energy efficiency [respectively]. Thus each US$1 million shifted from brown to green energy will create a net increase of five jobs,\" notes economist Heidi Garrett-Peltier from the University of Massachusetts in a 2017 study. More workers with a stable income will fuel a rise in consumption, allowing for a quicker and stronger recovery from the Covid-19 recession.</p><p>In fact, Gore highlights a shift in energy investments away from conventional fossil fuels and towards renewables, with investments in renewables worldwide three times greater than in coal and gas combined. Electric vehicles are also becoming increasingly cost-competitive as prices begin to drop, potentially allowing automobile companies to develop sustainable vehicles for the mass market. US-based global financial services firm Morningstar found that sustainability funds have outperformed their peers over multiple time horizons, while US-based global investment management corporation BlackRock says that sustainable portfolios are more crisis-resilient.</p><p>\"Sustainable investing has moved out of the shadows and into the mainstream. Clients want to know where their money is invested and, increasingly, what the impact is,\" James Purcell, global head of sustainable and impact investing at UBS Wealth Management CIO, tells the Harvard Business Review. Markets are thus likely to increasingly price in ESG sustainability issues. Bloomberg has introduced ESG ratings in its terminals while some local brokerages, such as DBS Research Group and Maybank Kim Eng, are starting to perform ESG analysis as part of their research.</p><p>\"The sustainability revolution is ... the largest investment opportunity in all of history,\" proclaims Gore. The global shift towards more sustainable business practices, he declares, combines the magnitude of the industrial revolution with the speed of the digital revolution. According to the former US Vice-President, those who act quickly could reap the lion's share of the profits from a more productive and efficient society; latecomers may be left eating dust in the former's wake.</p><p>Johnson, the consultant from PAIA, adds that a strong sustainability focus is often an indicator of strong corporate governance. Taking the time to consider future climate risks implies that company leadership is proactive and meticulous about preparing their businesses for the future rather than concentrating on firefighting or short-term gains. \"Many environmental issues are really about good housekeeping and cost structures,\" she tells The Edge Singapore. Firms able to maintain a sustainable business are thus more likely to be in a robust financial position.</p><p>Swiss investment bank UBS has in fact named sustainable investments as the firm's preferred solution for private clients investing globally. The first major global financial institution to make this recommendation, UBS believes a 100% sustainable portfolio can deliver similar, or potentially higher, returns compared to traditional investment portfolios and offer strong diversification for global investors.</p><p>\"We believe sustainable investments will prove to be one of the most exciting and durable opportunities for private clients in the years and decades ahead,\" says Iqbal Khan, co-president of UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>August Hatecke, co-head of Wealth Management Asia Pacific at UBS Global Wealth Management, agrees. \"Our flagship 100% Sustainable Investment mandate [has] seen a 50% growth in invested assets. In its balanced strategy, it has rebounded 26% since the end of the market sell-off in March with positive performance for the year,\" he says.</p><p>In the long run, Johnson says, focusing on sustainability can help firms tap new business opportunities as organisations begin to innovate to reduce climate risks and carbon emissions. Singapore companies are working to develop new sustainability solutions such as urban farming, with some firms even installing solar panels on their rooftops to save energy costs. Local F&amp;B startup Crust Group, for example, is even using surplus bread from hotels and restaurants to make craft beers and other beverages to help reduce food waste.</p><p>Implementing such sustainable solutions is, moreover, no longer optional for businesses as consumers become more conscious of ESG issues, and that's a growing view. According to Sumit Agarwal, Low Tuck Kwong Professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, consumers and investors are now more conscious than ever about ESG when making consumption or investment decisions.</p><p>According to a July 2020 report by PwC, 43% of the consumers worldwide expect businesses to be accountable for their environmental impact. As such, Agarwal believes that it is ultimately consumer pressure that will push firms towards adopting a more sustainable way of doing business.</p><p>Early bird catches the worm</p><p>\"The benefits of integrating ESG criteria into investment decisions are obvious,\" says Marc Lansonneur, head of managed solutions, balance sheet products, and investment governance at DBS Wealth. With ESG, he points out, investors can achieve a \"win-win\" situation where they are benefitting financially while doing good for society. Fortunately, there is a growing range of quality assets available for investors such as thematic products and a range of ESG-integrated equity and fixed income funds that can suit an investor's personal needs.</p><p>Lansonneur advises investors to take a two-step approach to improve their long-term portfolio performance. Investors must first assess the ESG status and/or rating of their portfolio to help them decide on the subsequent steps to take to achieve investment goals. When assessing new investments, moreover, investors should go beyond their usual selection criteria and seek advice from an expert about a firm's ESG rating before making any decisions.</p><p>More financial institutions are taking a more active stance. For example, Maybank's equity research team has started analysing companies by putting them through a systematic ESG framework. In an Oct 8 report, analyst Lee Yen Ling kept her \"buy\" call and RM9.53 price target on Top Glove, in recognition of the glove maker's compliance with international ESG standards such as the Business Social Compliance Initiatives and Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audits. For one, since January 2019, the Malaysia-based company had, at the request of its customers, attended to more than 100 external independent ESG-related audits.</p><p>A leading ESG name on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) is City Developments (CDL), which topped Bloomberg's Sustainalytics Environmental Percentile Index ranking with a score of 98.7. The company was awarded \"Most Sustainable Company in the Real Estate Industry\" by World Finance magazine's Sustainability Awards for 2020. Under chief sustainability officer Esther An, CDL was the first real-estate company in Singapore to set a carbon emissions intensity reduction goal, verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, and the first Singapore company to issue a green bond.</p><p>CDL issued its first green bond in 2017, and from that initial $100 million, the company has continued tapping sustainable financing, including $500 million in two green loans in 2019. Via comprehensive energy efficiency efforts, CDL has saved $28 million in energy costs in eight managed buildings since 2012. \"Businesses that are committed to doing well and doing good are proven to be more sustainable and many perform better in the long run,\" says An in an earlier interview with The Edge Singapore.</p><p>While CDL's operations, especially its hotels, have been hit hard by Covid-19, the company's strong balance sheet leaves no question that it will emerge from the pandemic. With total cash and undrawn and committed credit facilities exceeding $5 billion, OCBC sees good value in acquiring an established property name with the deep reserves needed to weather out the storm. RHB's Vijay Natarajan agrees, noting that CDL outperformed peers with 40% and 49% increases in unit sales and sales value in 2019 within a tough property market.</p><p>Another interesting prospect is agri-food counter Olam International, which recorded a Sustainalytics environmental score of 92.5 for 2020. The firm aims to re-imagine global agriculture and food systems by putting more back into food and farming systems than is taken out, arguing that this improves the firm's resilience and opens up new business opportunities while sheltering it from climate and water risk. It has developed a comprehensive sustainability framework built around the UN Sustainable Development Goals to guide the firm's operations.</p><p>The focus on sustainability has not been a drag on Olam's earnings. For the six months to June 30, Olam reported earnings growth of 44.4% y-o-y to $332.7 million. Revenue in the same period increased by 7.1% y-o-y to $17.1 billion.</p><p>While an NUS Business School study of 100 leading brands found that sustainability reporting is positively linked to brand value, one-fifth of respondents do not engage in sustainability reporting.</p><p>ESG stocks have even performed better than blue chips on the SGX. \"The five strongest constituents of the iEdge SG ESG Leaders Index in the 2020 year through to 8 May averaged a 11.4% total return over the period, compared to the five strongest STI stocks that averaged a 1.3% total return,\" says an SGX report. Clearly, sustainability is no obstacle to profit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:613Y-9YC1-DYX1-T005-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2679\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Edge Publishing PTE.

The market conditions, technology and regulation are all converging to create opportunities for established banks and new players to serve customers entirely on their smartphones. I predict we will see a lot of clever authentication and identity proofing technologies deliver on the promise of being able to open an account and transact without walking into a bank, while satisfying rigorous anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One prediction I hope will not materialise is for bad AI to enter our lives. It is important that training, ethics and model testing remain high. Asian governments and companies are constrained by cost, time and talent and it is very easy for bias, either conscious or unconscious, to enter models and for unintended consequences to prevail. Only experienced practitioners will know how to closely examine each data class separately, with respect to the relationships in the data that drive outcomes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tony Lombardo<br/>Chief Executive Officer, Asia<br/>Chairman, Lendlease Global Commercial Trust Management Pte Ltd</p><p>As we enter the next decade, what we would hope for - first and foremost - is geopolitical stability. Over the last few years we have witnessed and experienced increasing tensions resulting from geopolitical power shifts that have threatened to upend the growth, progress and stability across many nations. Global leaders need to resume meaningful alliances, recalibrate international relations and seek to resolve differences through dialogue and consultation to restore global stability.</p><p>On the other hand, what we hope would not materialise would be further environmental degradation resulting from climate change. Global policymakers and business leaders need to take appropriate action to stop global warming and take solid steps towards environmental stewardship. Natural disasters are on the rise, and we need to ensure appropriate action is taken before it becomes too late.</p><p>Mario Singh<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Fullerton Markets</p><p>One prediction I hope to see happen in 2020 is the successful rollout of 5G technology all over the world. With speeds of over one gigabit per second, the usage of 5G could even eventually help cars drive themselves. In the US, telcos like AT&amp;T and Verizon have said they expect their 5G networks to be accessible nationwide this year. Not to be outdone, wireless chipmaker Qualcomm announced at the CES 2020 trade show in Las Vegas that it is providing the processor for the world's first 5G wireless-enabled personal computer, Lenovo's Yoga 5G.</p><p>Even multi-billion dollar tech firms like Microsoft and Apple might offer 5G as an option this year as well.<br/>One prediction I hope will not materialise is any ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East, especially between United States and Iran.</p><p>Svend Janssen<br/>Head of Asia<br/>Western Union Business Solutions</p><p>With the advent of the new decade comes a heightened optimism to finally see some of Singapore's industry ambitions come to fruition. One is that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will truly evolve from experimentation to adoption. What became the biggest technology story of the 2010s has seen an enthusiasm from the business world that has since reached fever pitch. Enough discussion around the technology's limitations has been had. Now, it's hoped more action will help AI actually become our day-to-day, rather than just a part of it.</p><p>On the other hand, what we don't want to see any more of are the trade wars that have dampened business and investor confidence in the region over the past year. Should economic tensions be kept at bay, 2020 could be a year of tremendous growth for Asia as the region is projected to produce over half of the world's GDP by 2030.</p><p>Axel Berkling<br/>Executive Vice President<br/>KONE Asia Pacific</p><p>In 2020, I wish for businesses to incorporate sustainability in every aspect of their business. We must consider the environmental impact when making decisions for a sustainable tomorrow. Beyond aspiring to be carbon neutral, a sustainable business has to conduct itself in a fair and transparent manner. Furthermore, we must ensure that discrimination in the workplace will become a thing of the past.</p><p>Moving forward, I am hoping that we will no longer neglect the community's needs at the expense of growth and profit. As Asia continues to see increasing urbanisation, building smart and sustainable cities is important to better the livelihood of communities.</p><p>Alain Deniau<br/>CEO &amp; Board Practice Leader in Singapore<br/>Heidrick &amp; Struggles</p><p>The global economic climate in 2020 is volatile, with cross-border tensions flaring and an economic slowdown looming on the horizon. This year, a prediction I hope to see fulfilled is the rise of diverse senior leadership teams that adapt to a world characterised by rapid change, enhancing and transforming their companies to become more resilient, with a stronger potential for long term value creation while contributing to environmental and social good.</p><p>At the same time, Singapore is well aware of the diversity on senior leadership teams issue. However, it has been somehow slow to respond to it and is not quite ambitious enough in its objectives; the 20 per cent by 20 &amp; 30 per cent by 30 initiative is a conservative attempt to reinforce diversity. I hope that there will be a renewed focus on diversity in the workplace, especially within board and leadership teams.</p><p>Munenori Ando<br/>Regional Managing Director<br/>Epson Singapore</p><p>In 2020, Epson Singapore hopes to witness the increased adoption of sustainable business practices to improve productivity, efficiencies and business outcomes for organisations of all sizes. It is crucial that organisations re-evaluate their business operations and culture to combat climate change by reducing their carbon footprint, minimise waste and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We hope to see businesses drive transformation in Singapore towards a circular economy through efficient use of resources and recycling practices. Sustainability is a long-term commitment for businesses that needs to go hand-in-hand with innovation to achieve success in this new age sustainable digital economy.</p><p>Dean Collins<br/>Managing Partner Singapore<br/>Dechert LLP</p><p>As we enter 2020, environmental concerns and political tensions dominate the headlines. Change is needed and financial institutions around the world have a huge part to play. We are already seeing increased institutional investment focused on alleviating the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change, food shortages and healthcare affordability. Private equity and venture capital \"impact\" investments are on the rise globally, and based on our clients' activities in the region, we believe 2020 will witness the true emergence of impact funds focused on Southeast Asia.</p><p>However, as political tensions heat up, a feared scenario markets and investors are watching is that of tensions reaching boiling point. Just several days ago, #worldwar3 was trending on Twitter. In a world of fake news and social media overload, the proper experts deem the risk to be exaggerated. But nonetheless, I expect a proxy war of words to rumble on in cyberspace!</p><p>Dileep Nair<br/>Independent Director<br/>Thakral Corporation Limited</p><p>Awareness of climate change was a defining development in the last decade. I hope this will now be translated into action by changing the way we produce and consume energy, as well as how we use our lands. In 2020, I look forward to countries committing to eliminate coal in power generation and increase the use of renewables; emphasising the use of public transport; and reducing deforestation. I do hope at the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), the world's biggest polluters (China, US, India) show leadership in moving the world towards a net zero-carbon future.</p><p>The last decade also saw worsening relations between the US and China. Unresolved, their trade dispute can lead to decoupling and disruption of world trade. There's every likelihood such superpower rivalry can spiral out of control, affecting stability and growth in the rest of the world. Let's pray this does not come to pass.</p><p>Matthew Bennett<br/>VP &amp; MD, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan<br/>VMware Carbon Black</p><p>This year, more businesses will need to digitally transform, and the core of this transformation will make cybersecurity intrinsic to the technology stack. I hope to see organisations building security into the fabric of their devices, cloud and workloads, and not bolting it on. 2020 provides a fresh opportunity for organisations to shift the balance of power back to defenders.</p><p>What I hope will not materialise is a real-world loss of life as a result of a cyberattack. Geopolitical tension today is very high and nation-state actors may respond to kinetic aggression with cyberattacks targeted at critical infrastructure, such as power grids. I hope we will not see an attack that puts human lives at risk in 2020.</p><p>Leon Perera<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Spire Research and Consulting</p><p>I hope 2020 will see a reversal of bearish sentiment and a return to decent levels of global economic growth. With some degree of resolution to the uncertainties of the US-China trade war and Brexit, and with the spectre of deflation easing, 2020 could be a year when global economic growth returns to something close to normalcy. The successful conclusion of the RCEP multilateral trade agreement would provide a nice fillip to global growth.</p><p>I fear that 2020 will see an escalation of geopolitical tensions as the US veers towards a harder stance against China, Iran and North Korea. In particular, there is a real risk of global trade and political fragmentation, with countries aligning themselves to either the US or Chinese spheres of influence. Hopefully, advocates of a rational, rules-based order will prevail.</p><p>Paolo Tavolato<br/>Head of Asia Pacific<br/>TMF Group</p><p>With multiple uncertainties in the current global economy, we hope to see greater technological adoption that could ease the rising strain on labour. Building deeper technological capabilities in organisations will not only ensure better business outcomes, but will also foster a reinvented and agile workforce that will sharpen an economy's competitive edge. It is also our hope that external pressures pertaining to trade tensions, Brexit, China's slowdown, and geopolitical hotspots (such as Hong Kong and the Middle East) do not exacerbate the weakening of business and consumer confidence, especially with economic headwinds expected to continue into 2020.</p><p>Peter Zaman<br/>Office Managing Partner<br/>Reed Smith</p><p>The 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) meeting in Madrid last December saw the countries involved in the Paris Agreement kick the agreement, on guidelines for operationalising carbon markets, down the line to Glasgow for COP26. My wish for 2020 is that the governments set aside their differences in the greater interest of avoiding a climate disaster and agree on the guidance so that it facilitates the leveraging of private sector capital towards climate solutions.</p><p>The economies of many countries are currently fragile. Geopolitically, recent retrenchment from globalisation is increasing the risk of actual conflict between countries, both direct and indirect (eg via proxy wars). My hope is therefore that no significant conflict breaks out in 2020 because that could very well tip already-fragile economic growth in those countries into recession. A chain reaction could easily ensue given the highly connected nature of global trade.</p><p>Andy Watson<br/>SVP and GM, Asia Pacific Japan and Greater China<br/>SAP Concur</p><p>As the economic uncertainty compels firms to do more with less, they must find ways to streamline operations and raise efficiency with minimal headcount growth.</p><p>I predict and hope that in 2020, business and finance leaders will start to adopt game-changing technologies like empathetic AI (where emotional intelligence is fused with AI to humanise user interactions) and pervasive machine learning (where user and customer needs can be accurately predicted across a vast spectrum of workflows and applications) to bring greater productivity and intelligence to their business.</p><p>Challenging market conditions may result in some companies weighing their options more carefully. However, I hope they won't lose the zeal to understand and serve their customer needs better in the experience economy.</p><p>Asheesh Mehra<br/>Co-Founder and Group CEO<br/>AntWorks</p><p>The successful application of Artificial Intelligence for good depends on trust, which can only be established with the highest adherence to ethical principles and practices. This calls for closer collaborations between government bodies and enterprises in 2020 to continue the advancements and innovations in AI.</p><p>The effect of climate change is obvious, and it cannot be ignored. AI can play a vital role in reducing the impact of climate change, from CO2 removal to creating more energy-efficient buildings and optimising energy production. We must tap these tools in the new year to address the issues of the future.</p><p>Mitch Young<br/>Senior Vice President, APJ<br/>ServiceNow</p><p>The relationship between people and tech at work will be one to watch in 2020. The last decade gave rise to the Digital Enterprise. This year we will see digital trends shaping how people work. Take AI-powered chatbots that can be used to relieve people from repetitive work and help to realise significant productivity gains. We're also starting to see employees help themselves, where technology, such as machine learning, offers the option to self-serve. Companies can harness new and emerging technologies to drive productivity and unlock valuable time for employees to focus on meaningful tasks and make work better.</p><p>The ever-evolving digital landscape has led to an increase in cybercrime. Amid the growing number of cyber-attacks, our recent study revealed 60 per cent of Singapore security professionals believe hackers are ahead of businesses in their use of technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Teams need to take action, understand the risks and vulnerabilities and how to use automation to reduce the time it takes to respond to these vulnerabilities.</p><p>Ong Boon Hwee<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Stewardship Asia Centre</p><p>2019 witnessed a positive trend towards better stewardship in the business landscape. From high-profile groups like the US CEOs Business Roundtable and the World Economic Forum, to various bodies on good governance like the UK Institute of Directors, there were calls for businesses, investors and boards to commit to a sense of purpose beyond profit, for the benefit of all stakeholders and the larger society. In 2020, we believe the focus should shift towards positive transformation, based on responsible and sustainable wealth creation. Such change can and should be achieved by businesses individually, collectively, and by involving all players along the stewardship value chain. We hope 2020 will be marked by businesses going from aspiration to action - with leaders and organisations leading the charge in looking for practical ways to act on stewardship.</p><p>Eddie Haddad<br/>Managing Director<br/>SWIFT Asia Pacific</p><p>Global banking is made up of a network of payment systems, where currencies are settled in different jurisdictions, each with their local regulations. In the year ahead, I look forward to increased adoption of ISO 20022, the open standard for payments messaging, by financial institutions worldwide. Supported by a mutually agreed market practice, the standard creates a common language and model for payments data around the world and will significantly improve the quality of data across the payments ecosystem. This is crucial as Singapore gears up for the entry of digital banks and innovative banking services. What we hope to avoid is increasing levels of fragmentation across the financial markets, which will undermine the progress made in rebuilding the global financial system post-crisis.</p><p>Bernadette Cho<br/>General Manager (Singapore)<br/>Entrepreneur First</p><p>The world will face novel challenges in the coming decade, but I look forward to seeing unintuitive breakthrough solutions to urgent problems. Increased connectivity has afforded us opportunities to leverage resources and knowledge in non-traditional ways - for example, leveraging architectural practices to combat loneliness in urban centres. At Entrepreneur First, we also advocate a multidisciplinary mindset, encouraging our founders to find new use-cases for existing technologies, or apply new technologies to expand the solution space.</p><p>On the flip side, I hope that leaders will not be paralysed by the magnitude of these challenges. It's important that they don't dismiss issues with cavalier denial and inaction, but instead channel their energy and influence towards disciplined and resourceful problem-solving.</p><p>Dhruv Arora<br/>Founder &amp; CEO<br/>Syfe</p><p>One prediction I hope to see realised this year is a mass shift away from industry's big players and towards startups, especially in areas like money management technology, where trust is key. We are already seeing early signs of this shift, and hopefully 2020 will be the year this change takes flight across the board. On the flip side, there is the possibility of lobbying by industry giants, which could squeeze out smaller players, and regulatory oversight could also play a role in quelling innovation.</p><p>Chia Ngiang Hong<br/>President<br/>Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS)</p><p>Singapore's real estate and built environment sector has been facing challenging times in recent years on the back of tough measures, global trade slowdown and the uncertain geo-political and economic environment. For 2020, we hope our property market will continue to be resilient and our economy will achieve better than the projected full-year GDP growth of 2.5 per cent. Any significant improvement in the global economy is contingent to a large extent on the bilateral relationship between the two superpowers, US and China, not worsening. There has been fear of a full-blown US-China trade war breaking out which could threaten to wipe out bilateral trade via prohibitive tariffs; this will certainly destabilise the multilateral trading system and push the world economy towards recession. We do not wish this to happen.</p><p>Donald Han<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Sabana REIT</p><p>For Sabana REIT, I wish for a more stable industrial market. Against a backdrop of strong supply and regulation, our sector is concurrently undergoing a fundamental transformation - tenants are taking up less space, focusing on efficiency and going high tech. I hope more can be done to research effective, real and net demand, so we can track if tenants are relocating to newer buildings without hollowing out older, seemingly less competitive ones, and respond to their needs accordingly.</p><p>The past year was characterised by continued macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. 2020 has started on the same foot, with US-Iran tensions brewing. With key global events like the US presidential elections and Brexit on the horizon, my wish is that 2020 will not end up as tumultuous.</p><p>Joon Aun Ooi<br/>President and Managing Director<br/>Wyndham Hotels and Resorts<br/>Southeast Asia and Pacific Rim</p><p>The past decade delivered immense advances in technology and we are now reaping the benefits. \"Continued Innovation\" will be crucial for businesses to meaningfully engage with today's consumers. Their constantly evolving needs, lifestyle habits and behaviours are influencing the creation of new products and services, and vice versa, changing the way businesses will be modelled and operated into the new decade. While simple in theory, the adoption of such new products or processes requires businesses to challenge themselves by thinking out of the box.</p><p>The ongoing global tensions in trade and politics pose a challenge not just to businesses but directly affects individuals and communities that businesses engage with. As a leader in global hospitality, we are keeping a close eye on the latest developments and its business implications within the region.</p><p>Charles Tidswell<br/>Vice President, JAPAC<br/>Socialbakers</p><p>Social media has many practical uses, and I would like to see businesses and individuals maximise the reach and creativity of social media platforms to drive awareness around the threat of climate change. Many influencers have become champions for social causes, but more can be done to engage with and educate audiences globally. Conversely, the rampant mis-usage of social media platforms will be a disheartening trend. While major platforms have been proactive in mitigating fake news, they alone can't solve the problem. Users will also need to be accountable for what they share.</p><p>Bindu Bhatia<br/>Managing Director, Asia Pacific<br/>CWT</p><p>The impact of travel - and flights in particular - on the environment is an issue that generated a great deal of conversation in 2019. It's undoubtedly a challenge the travel industry recognises it needs to address, and do so quickly. The first ever flight to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) took off in 2008, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects to hit one million SAF-powered flights this year. 2020 is also the year when the aviation industry aims to achieve carbon-neutral growth and to cut net carbon emissions by 50 per cent compared to 2005. This is a prediction I'd absolutely love to see come true.</p><p>On the other hand, some experts forecast that global geopolitical tensions will continue to escalate in 2020 - something I certainly hope will not materialise as it could dampen growth and threaten the safety and security of travellers.</p><p>Carmen Wee<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Investment Management Association of Singapore (IMAS)</p><p>The fifth annual IMAS Investment Managers' Outlook Survey indicates that 2020 could be the biggest year yet for ESG investing. More than half of respondents expect to develop business lines around sustainable finance or ESG. It will be exciting to see how ESG policies evolve as fund management companies in Singapore integrate ESG in their investment activities. Meanwhile, the same survey showed rising business and compliance costs as a key perceived threat in terms of business impact. The booming regtech scene is promising and can help ease this cost burden for the asset management industry. One of the problem statements posed in the IMAS Digital Accelerator Programme focuses on regulatory change management, so I look forward to seeing the innovative digital solutions from global tech firms in this area.</p><p>Wissam Khoury<br/>SVP and GM, APAC and MEA<br/>Finastra</p><p>The 2010s were dominated by the rise of the online marketplace, with the exponential growth of mobile technologies, social media and the platform economy putting new services at consumers' fingertips. In the 2020s it will be businesses' turn, with \"marketplaces of solutions\" bringing brands, innovators and startups together to seamlessly co-create solutions. This co-innovation is happening fastest in financial services, where the rise of fintech, cloud-based platforms and open APIs have allowed innovators to plug into banks' data to quickly develop and launch new applications to market. This is improving the customer experience and, ultimately, competition. However, we must also foster inclusiveness. There is a widening digital divide where those without the means to access these technologies and the skills to use them cannot benefit from the digital economy. We must combine the right regulation with actions to make sure these people are not left behind. This will boost society as a whole, as well as individuals.</p><p>Joanne Wong<br/>Senior Regional Director, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan<br/>LogRhythm</p><p>With the increased adoption of biometrics for identity authentication, for instance, at Singapore's immigration checkpoints, the need to consider regulations and laws to protect biometric data should become a priority. There's currently not enough transparency around the vulnerabilities in biometric systems and we'd hate to see the consequences given its rising popularity.</p><p>While we are certainly far off from advanced quantum computing changing the way we perform standard cryptography, many would agree that 2019 was a breakthrough year for quantum computing. This year, we hope to see an uptick in development, and adoption of quantum that could help speed up AI's data analysis and subsequent decision-making.</p><p>Denis Kalemberg<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Airome Technologies</p><p>This year will see financial services going more digital and it is important that their security posture does not become a victim of service owners' aspirations towards convenience and mobility. I would like to see more digital services that can find a balance between strengthening security and providing convenience.</p><p>Things that I hope will not materialise this year are mass cases of stealing money from financial services clients' accounts. I believe that it can be achieved, if the owners of such services invest in robust security systems and clients embrace better digital hygiene.</p><p>Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard<br/>Managing Director<br/>Robert Half Singapore</p><p>Corporate social responsibility should be a key focus for this year - not only is CSR important to be a good corporate citizen, it can boost a company's brand and bottomline. Now more than ever, organisations have the capacity to drive positive change in the communities they operate in by honing their CSR strategies to maximise their philanthropic endeavours. In 2020, diversity fatigue is a looming threat as companies struggle to achieve their best intentions for cultivating a diverse workforce. Companies need to look beyond simply increasing \"representation\" numbers to the holistic development of an inclusive culture across the organisation.</p><p>Abhishek Chatterjee<br/>CEO &amp; Co-founder<br/>Tookitaki</p><p>Artificial intelligence saw a staggering increase in funding and interest in 2019, particularly to drive safety and efficiency within the financial services sector. Moving forward, we envision more regulators and financial institutions embracing AI solutions for a greater push in tackling the increasingly worrisome issue of money laundering and eliminating possibilities around financial crimes.</p><p>The one thing we wish to not materialise would be for the tensions from various conflicts around the globe to accelerate levels of illicit cross-border financial transactions. At Tookitaki, we will continue to work with financial institutions to revolutionise regulatory compliance and support their anti-money laundering efforts.</p><p>Mark Micallef<br/>VP, Asia Pacific and Japan<br/>Cloudera</p><p>Although organisations are increasingly experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, such projects today usually exist in silos, putting quality, security, governance and compliance at risk. We hope to see more organisations build an AI factory this year to overcome that issue and effectively use AI to accelerate business outcomes. They can do so by adopting an enterprise data cloud, an open platform that unifies and powers all machine learning workflows across multiple clouds and on-premise environments.</p><p>An AI factory will enable the process of building, scaling, and deploying enterprise machine learning applications to be automated, repeatable, and predictable. This allows organisations to easily operationalise and scale machine learning capabilities across the enterprise, which ultimately empowers the entire company to make data-driven decisions.</p><p>Jean Thomas<br/>Chief Marketing Officer<br/>Pomelo Fashion</p><p>Online retail in Southeast Asia will continue to experience rapid growth and a fundamental shift towards digital. Through data-driven innovations, we hope that consumers will be able to gain greater access to diverse choices in fashion and expression. We can also expect brands to better leverage digitalisation to improve customer experiences, tapping an integrated omnichannel approach to strengthen their reach and provide greater value to consumers. Lastly, while global geopolitical volatility is expected to continue impacting economic growth in the region, we are hopeful for a reversal of trends, especially given the recent Phase One deal between the US and China, that will improve consumer confidence and spur technological innovation.</p><p>Charlie O'Flaherty<br/>Partner<br/>Crossbridge Capital Asia</p><p>If the initial formal trade agreement signed between United States and China leading to a ceasefire in weaponised tariff policies can be fully achieved in 2020, the resulting economic lift will benefit all of Asia. On the other hand, political showmanship and self-serving policies on both sides of the US Congress are pointing towards a nearly year-long impeachment, election and scandal circus leading up to the elections in November. I think we are all hoping that this will not materialise.</p><p>Veronica Shim<br/>Founder and CEO<br/>Envysion Wealth Management</p><p>With the ongoing geopolitical events, markets around the world could experience slower growth but we expect stronger equity markets. Given the reliance of our global economy on a few major economic players and a charged and volatile political climate, we need to revisit the promise of globalisation - does increased interdependence of markets actually lead to trickle-down growth'</p><p>In light of this, many trade barriers have been put in place and early efforts to reverse globalisation as a result of the trade war have already started. The implications of \"easy money\" - the easing of monetary policies and pumping billions of dollars into the economy - set the stage for a slippery slope to soaring inflation. Policy makers will be unwise if they ignore these signs.</p><p>Justin Chiah<br/>Senior Director, SE Asia, Taiwan and Hong Kong/Macau (SEATH), Product Category, Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ)<br/>Aruba, a Hewlett Packard Enterprise company</p><p>2020 marks an exciting year for businesses leveraging technology to deliver personalised experiences, improved business outcomes, and drive hyper-efficient operations at the network edge. In a digital world, wired and wireless network connectivity should never hinder the pursuit of digitalisation. For the smartphone industry, there will be new models that support Wi-Fi 6 capabilities which will propel organisations forward in their digitalisation efforts, especially in enabling digital workspaces. During this digital transformation journey, leaders will do well to not ignore that artificial intelligence-based insights will eventually become the natural next step of automation. Business leaders should embrace the explosive growth of IoT devices - the slew of new technological innovations this year will result in greater network insights that will not only improve business agility but also equip organisations with the necessary visibility to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.</p><p>George Lee<br/>Vice President, Asia Pacific &amp; Japan<br/>RSA</p><p>Towards the end of 2019, Singapore experienced a series of malware incidents that resulted in the exposure of end-users' data as well as the financial and reputational loss of businesses. This trend continues to persist into the new decade as malicious software remains a more popular choice of cyber attack. As systems become more hyper-connected, organisations with critical data, such as vendors of government military bodies, have also become a target for increasingly sophisticated hackers. Organisations must prioritise fixing vulnerabilities with a risk-based approach and invest in the right security controls to safeguard against unwanted digital risks. It is crucial to strengthen coordination between the public and private sector in intelligence and data sharing in order to provide greater visibility and context to stay ahead of threat actors. This will also enable nations to bolster their monitoring and defences before attacks on their critical infrastructure become commonplace.</p><p>Jin Choeh<br/>Co-Founder and CEO<br/>Swingvy</p><p>One thing I wish to see fulfilled this year would be for sentiment around employee experience to improve. I hope the idea that investing in employees and engaging with them truly adds value to the employee is something that resonates with businesses. Engaged employees will, in turn, contribute greatly to help companies flourish.</p><p>One prediction I hope will not come to pass would be the growing fear that automation and technology will displace jobs. Technology should be seen as an enabler, not something that replaces people and talent.</p><p>Erich Gerber<br/>SVP EMEA &amp; APJ<br/>TIBCO Software</p><p>The industry will continue to move swiftly to implement new technologies for dealing with data and analytics. Making better and faster decisions would be crucial for businesses in the region moving into the new decade. We would like to see more businesses seamlessly connect data sources, intelligently unify trust and control, and confidently predict real-time data as they continue to remain competitive and successful. Data is the new currency and making the right use as well as ensuring the data you have can be trusted to make informed decisions is something I would like to see businesses embarking on.</p><p>Bharath Vellore<br/>Managing Director, Asia Pacific<br/>Accuity</p><p>Sanctions can help governments advance respect for human rights, safeguard democratic institutions and prevent illicit activities, but their ever-changing nature is extremely complex for businesses to interpret and comply with.</p><p>The list of entities sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is especially active in global enforcement, has grown by almost 40 per cent since 2014. As shifts in foreign policy, such as with Iran and North Korea, remain top of the news, we expect this trend to persist. At the same time, almost US$1.3 billion in fines were issued for US sanctions breaches in 2019 - more than any previous year.</p><p>With AI-powered financial crime screening and sophisticated trade compliance technologies now accessible, in 2020 our wish is that organisations in Asia will be armed with the right knowledge and tools to prevent sanctioned targets from using the international financial and trade ecosystem, and that we will see far fewer breaches and fines materialise.</p><p>Tan Mui Huat<br/>President and CEO, Asia<br/>International SOS</p><p>In our Travel Risk Outlook for 2020, we predicted that geopolitical risks such as the tightening of borders, rising nationalist sentiments and religious tensions would present the most significant challenges to business mobility. These risks are likely to impact the safety of the travelling workforce, and threaten organisations and economies alike. While we hope these safety risks do not materialise, we also expect business travel to continue, and the workforce to become increasingly mobile. While this bodes well for businesses and economies to flourish, organisations must develop a greater awareness in their Duty of Care responsibilities, and safeguard their investment and their people with proper planning for these risks, and implement the proper tools and support. The International SOS Foundation, supported by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Singapore, launched a declaration in 2017 at the XXI World Congress on Safety and Health at Work, where 200 global organisations declared to support the principles of risk prevention in work-related travel safety, health and security for all employees. In 2020, we hope that more organisations can also demonstrate their commitment in this area.</p><p>Sandeep Bhargava<br/>MD of Asia Pacific/Japan<br/>Rackspace</p><p>As more organisations in Asia Pacific move towards adopting digital transformation, the need for professionally skilled IT talent to manage complex IT environments while faced with tight budgets, talent shortage and fast-changing market demands will continue to grow in 2020. Internal and external vendors will need to work together to manage a multitude of issues around cost, governance, security and tagging, to name a few. We are largely optimistic for 2020 and we anticipate an increase in the number of IoT and edge computing deployments in some parts of Asia Pacific in 2020, driven by the commercial availability of 5G and cloud adoption, especially in countries with smart city initiatives.</p><p>That said, the cloud environment also opens doors to security risks and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) will need to work across more departments to ensure that security is not overlooked when innovative solutions and processes are introduced.</p><p>Richard Low<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Cargill Tropical Palm</p><p>The fight against climate change remains a top priority for the coming year and, as one of the world's largest agricultural companies, we stand by our commitment to nourish the world in a safe, responsible and sustainable way.</p><p>In 2020, we hope that certified sustainable palm oil receives greater awareness and adoption, among both consumers and businesses, in meeting the food demands of the growing global population. At the same time, we also look forward to seeing more companies take a hands-on and long-term approach to environmental conservation to deliver lasting impact for rural communities and indigenous groups, such as the Nanga Lauk community in Kalimantan Indonesia, who depend heavily on natural resources for their livelihood.</p><p>Rufino Tiam-Lee<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Monde Nissin Singapore Pte Ltd</p><p>We are seeing the rise of increasingly socially-conscious consumers around the world, with people becoming more aware about how their consumption habits impact health and the environment. Consumers are beginning to take a stand by choosing brands that do good for the planet and we believe that the meat-free protein alternative sector will continue to scale globally. With rising sea levels, global warming and precious wildlife at stake, it is our hope that the efforts by these consumers and more committed brands will continue to grow in the new decade to slow down the rate at which climate change is happening.</p><p>Lars Voedisch<br/>Founder, MD and Principal Consultant<br/>PRecious Communications</p><p>I would really like to see the acceleration of Southeast Asia's integration through the Asean Economic Community (AEC) initiative. This will increase the cumulative GDP within the region and uplift the livelihoods of millions of people. At the same time this can help to establish Asean as a regional monolith that can compete with other blocs across the globe.</p><p>One prediction that I hope does not come true is the deterioration in world trade if the US-China trade relationship can't be resolved. While it has resulted in some foreign investment diverting from China to Southeast Asia, mainly into Vietnam, world trade will stay affected, with impact on Southeast Asia and especially hubs like Singapore.</p><p>Vincent Goh<br/>SVP, Asia Pacific and Japan<br/>CyberArk</p><p>As we head into a new decade, there's no doubt that attackers will try to take advantage of technical innovations to achieve their goals. With biometric authentication becoming increasingly popular, we'll need to guard against a level of unfounded complacency when it comes to security. While biometric authentication is a very good way to authenticate a user to a device, companies must be aware that every time that happens, the biometric data must be encrypted and the assets behind the authentication must be secure. We believe organisations will continue to invest in technology and develop security best practices to protect themselves in the digital era.</p><p>Election security is a hot topic for democracies in Asia, especially in Taiwan and Korea soon. While much of the discussion tends to focus on disinformation campaigns, including the use of deepfake technology to influence opinion, attacks will evolve to have a broader disruption theme that goes beyond media. A sequencing of these attacks that impact core infrastructure - halting transportation, shutting down the electrical grid or launching an attack on voter registration databases - can have a domino effect, not only impacting trust and reliability of the voting system itself but potentially affecting the ability of citizens to even cast their ballot.</p><p>Vincent Tang<br/>Regional Vice President of Asia<br/>Epicor</p><p>Companies will demonstrate greater interest in how hybrid cloud and on-premise approaches help shape the business and better meet its needs. They are also realising the tangible benefits from enhancing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and embracing innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. However, some of the main challenges businesses will face in this region will go beyond managing costs, to also competing with industry leaders who are bringing innovative products and solutions to the market.</p><p>Ling Fang<br/>SVP, Asia Pacific<br/>Alstom</p><p>As cities become more connected and urbanised, a sustainable and robust transport ecosystem will be a major priority. This, coupled with the industry becoming more aware of the environmental impact pollution and energy consumption have, energy efficiency is and will continue to be a major challenge for the transport operators. This will force them to increase their efforts to reduce the energy consumption by deploying the best available technologies to ensure a greener and sustainable transport eco-system. That is why Alstom is responding to the urgency of the climate situation, with a renewed commitment to innovation in smarter and greener mobility solutions.</p><p>Dylan Castagne<br/>Managing Director, Asia<br/>Retarus</p><p>Advanced threats are seen to surpass the capabilities of traditional security mechanisms as cybercriminals employ increasingly sophisticated network infiltration techniques in 2020. We expect the continued high growth of successful cyber-attacks and data breaches, with related regional and global losses increasing year-on-year once again.</p><p>Fortunately, we are seeing an uptake in the adoption of innovative security tools with sandboxing capabilities and which offer an additional layer of protection from spear-phishing and spoofing attacks in 2020. We hope more companies realise the importance of cybersecurity and invest in assigning and developing well-qualified staff into CSO/CISO functions and fortifying their defences in the year ahead.</p><p>Vera Saw<br/>Country Manager, Singapore<br/>Danone Specialised Nutrition</p><p>In a highly competitive labour market, employees these days are less motivated by the prestige of working for a big company, and more guided by their passion and personal values. As an example, Danone Specialised Nutrition, mother company of brands such as Dumex and Aptamil, is committed to furthering company-wide engagement and increasing the sense of ownership among Danoners at all levels of the organisation. What this actually means in practice is that through our \"One Voice One Share\" employee engagement programme, employees are able to set and co-own our business agenda through yearly consultations, as well as being offered a share in the company - strengthening the symbolic ownership mindset among them. For 2020, we hope that corporates will make substantial progress in deepening the relationship with their employees instead of sticking to the rhetoric of imposed optimism and hierarchy. Only by co-building shared values and objectives will we be able to achieve sustainable results that will benefit not only the company, but also its employees as well.</p><p>Callum Eade<br/>VP, Asia Pacific and Japan<br/>Commvault</p><p>As the impact of climate change intensifies, weather-related natural disasters will drive greater demand for business recovery readiness in 2020. Enterprises should be prepared to activate their disaster recovery plans and be ready for any catastrophe that comes their way. This means making swift and informed decisions to kickstart their disaster recovery plans at the right time and transfer backups of mission critical applications over to another cloud region when necessary. In an era where disasters are inevitable, it is crucial for businesses to protect one of their most critical resource - data.</p><p>Mark Billington<br/>Regional Director, Greater China<br/>and South-East Asia<br/>ICAEW</p><p>While there has been commendable progress in the past decade, ICAEW is hopeful that 2020 will see even more initiatives from governments and businesses to tackle growing inequality and disparity in society. We hope to see efforts to promote gender equality, social mobility, diversity, and pay transparency, as we work towards an inclusive environment in the workplace and beyond.</p><p>In addition, we are keeping a close watch on the rapid acceleration of climate change, which threatens the social wellbeing, economic development and financial stability of current and future generations. As we enter 2020, ICAEW will continue to take the lead on climate change, by enabling our members and the broader accountancy profession to respond to these challenges, advocating for sustainability reporting and championing issues in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Eric Hoh<br/>President of Asia Pacific<br/>FireEye</p><p>Companies face three key challenges this year. These include the cybersecurity skills shortage, rationalising security tool spend, and keeping pace with attackers. We expect to see this reality make 2020 the year of cybersecurity optimisation. As companies look to rationalise their security tool investments while improving the security posture of their hybrid and cloud ecosystems, they will take more of a proactive approach to understanding and mitigating their unique risks, inefficiencies and vulnerabilities. Further, without this context, it is quite difficult for companies to identify attackers and remediate the problem before it becomes one of serious consequence.</p><p>Clara Lim<br/>Managing Director, Asia Pacific<br/>commercetools</p><p>The recent success of Singles' Day proves that e-commerce will continue its exponential rise in 2020. In this year of growth, we hope that personalised experiences across all actual and future touchpoints become an industry-wide standard, and that customers should no longer have to deal with sub-par retail experiences.</p><p>While physical retail is expected to further decline, we hope that retailers will not deprioritise offline channels, but instead seek to better synergise brick-and-mortar fronts with digital platforms. A \"headless\" approach where the front and back-end processing is decoupled can enable such integration and allow for seamless, intuitive experiences ideally tailored to each customer, without disruption to daily operations.</p><p>Monica Acree<br/>Vice President, Sales<br/>Forter</p><p>As we move into 2020, online retailers are facing growing sophistication in fraud attacks. Forter's Seventh Edition Fraud Attack Index reported that the dollar amount in fraud has risen by 12 per cent over the last year, demonstrating an increase in the quality of attacks. In order to stay one step ahead of emerging fraud trends, businesses need a deeper understanding of how fraudsters commit online fraud.</p><p>At a time when an excellent customer experience is critical, businesses need to minimise fraud risks without compromising the user experience. Only by assessing trust at every stage of the customer lifecycle in real-time will organisations be able to deepen customer relationships, eliminate fraud, and ultimately enhance business revenue.</p><p>Leonard Cheong<br/>Managing Director<br/>AdNovum Singapore Pte Ltd</p><p>In 2020, tighter cross-border collaboration is especially key for South East Asia (SEA) to continue to thrive as one of the fastest growing regions globally, despite the global economic slowdown, US-China trade tensions and climate change challenges.</p><p>SEA must be innovative and digitally-ready as the world goes digital. Regulations in Asean have got to be in place to support more digital trade and growth opportunities.</p><p>Hopefully, the world economy will recover soon and is not headed for another global financial crisis - a \"second Great Depression\".</p><p>Frederic Ho<br/>VP of Asia-Pacific<br/>Jumio Corporation</p><p>The unprecedented wave of data breaches - many of which have harvested hundreds of millions of usernames and passwords and fuelled the growth of account takeover - have resulted in billion-dollar losses in fraud and damage to brand reputation. Consequently, we fully expect the steady adoption of alternative, password-less authentication methodologies in 2020. On the other hand, the proliferation of deepfakes and identity-spoofing technologies could challenge the effectiveness of biometrics-based verification. The maturation of deepfakes could significantly heighten the threat of identity fraud to financial and commercial organisations. However, multi-factor biometric authentication, coupled with strong liveness detection, could largely mitigate these risks.</p><p>Adrian Chng<br/>CEO<br/>GoBear</p><p>In 2020 I foresee a rise in exciting fintech partnerships that will further strengthen the financial ecosystem. We've already seen partnerships among several financial institutions for the digital bank licence applications. At GoBear we are also encouraged to see our own set of partnerships in the insurance and lending space.</p><p>This year also has the risk of an economic downturn, which I hope we avoid. A slowdown could potentially dampen consumer demand for new and emerging fintech products and services. This will also impact investor appetite for fund-raising from startups, slowing the ecosystem's continued development.</p><p>Leslie Choo<br/>Managing Director, Asia<br/>ACI Worldwide</p><p>Cyberthreats in the banking industry are constantly evolving, and one trend that I hope to see materialise in 2020 is the rise of a more \"democratised\" approach to machine learning (ML). This means tapping the expertise of fraud specialists to input what they know to be strong indicators of fraud into ML models, rather than starting from scratch.</p><p>On the other hand, I hope that banks will avoid siloed approaches to fraud prevention. It would be exciting to see the development of centralised payments intelligence hubs, where information around fraudulent activity can be shared between organisations, creating a win-win situation for both banks and their customers.</p><p>Sumir Bhatia<br/>President, Asia Pacific<br/>Data Center Group<br/>Lenovo</p><p>As we usher in the New Year and a new decade, my immediate thought goes to that of climate change. The devastating bushfires that continue to ravage the Australian landscape are yet another example of the pressing need for action. My hope is that 2020 won't be mired by more destructive natural disasters that inflict harm to humankind, wildlife and the economy.</p><p>That said, new frontier technologies, such as high-performance computing and machine learning, are enabling us to better understand and manage these challenges. We can now analyse and visualise billions of data points to generate comprehensive weather forecasts within a few kilometres, so that warnings are issued earlier and more accurately. I hope to see these technologies become more mainstream to cope with issues such as urban planning, and then perhaps we would have a real opportunity to turn the tide.</p><p>Mohan Veloo<br/>VP of Technology<br/>F5 Networks, APCJ</p><p>In 2020, the projected rise in cloud computing adoption as the model of choice for modernising IT portfolios will soon turn into a reality, with data from our 2019 State of App Services report indicating that almost nine in 10 organisations globally deployed multi-cloud strategies to facilitate their application delivery needs. With the right multi-cloud strategy in place, organisations are now able to deliver far richer user experiences that ultimately drive revenue growth.</p><p>However, cloud-first must always go with a security-first mindset. With cyber-attacks rising rapidly in frequency and scale, hackers have also become far more sophisticated in their attacks. To prevent hackers from dominating the technology landscape, businesses need to invest in a holistic cloud security strategy by opting for providers that understand the current threat landscape impacting applications. This can be achieved by providing detailed insights on a business' application infrastructure, as well as devoting significant tools to secure and maintain their security.</p><p>Malina Platon<br/>Managing Director, Asean<br/>UiPath</p><p>I predict that robotic process automation (RPA) will be the fastest growing software enterprise category for the second year in a row. Thanks to the technology's growing sophistication and use of AI, the RPA market size could increase by 15-30 per cent as companies start to realise the benefits of automation to their bottom lines and productivity. Linked to this, I hope to see automation become a strategic agenda item at the CEO and Board Level, and we may see more Chief Automation Officers emerge. Lastly, I predict that both companies and educational institutions will take reskilling more seriously and implement steps to prepare their workforce and students for an automated future.</p><p>I hope that employees and the business community do not see automation as a negative; rather, they should view automation technologies as positive and beneficial to their daily lives, helping them do more with less. This mindset should continue to extend to universities and other learning institutions as well as company HR departments who are in charge of upskilling their employees.</p><p>Andrew Wong<br/>VP, Airlines, Asia Pacific<br/>Honeywell Aerospace</p><p>While the value of data is growing in appreciation across industries, the sheer abundance of available data can be overwhelming for companies and difficult to apply in smart ways. What we hope will not materialise is a limiting mindset when it comes to the value of business data. While it's challenging to harness all this data, what we don't want to see are companies focusing solely on a select few areas that deliver short-term success.</p><p>Rather, we predict that businesses will feel more empowered than ever before and view 2020 as a breakthrough opportunity to use connectivity, data and analytics as tools for sweeping innovation and positive change. Particularly in the aviation industry, technology will serve as a conduit to bring different sources of data together agnostically and turn the analysed information into prescriptive action for aviation companies, leading to benefits like greater efficiency and safety in flight operations. The result will be unprecedented efficiencies and savings in the industry. We strongly believe data will lead to more action in 2020.</p><p>Sanjay K Deshmukh<br/>VP and MD, Southeast Asia and Korea<br/>VMware</p><p>As businesses continue to push forward in their digital transformation journeys in Singapore, we would like to see companies prioritise digital enablement of the workforce by empowering them with a \"Digital Workspace\". This will help companies transform the way their employees work and unleash employee productivity, ensuring sustained business and economic success.</p><p>2020 is also a watershed moment for the world as the Paris climate agreement comes into effect this year. It is my hope that with the help of technology, we will be able to make a breakthrough in mitigating our impact on the climate, just like how virtualisation technology delivered unprecedented energy and carbon emissions reduction when it was first introduced nearly three decades ago.</p><p>Lim Soon Hock<br/>Managing Director<br/>PLAN-B ICAG</p><p>I would like to see more concrete and substantial actions by nations to tackle climate change, dealing with greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance. We are already feeling the adverse and often disastrous impacts of climate change. Unless countries take steps to mitigate global warming, there will be more and larger calamities, likely to be on a global scale.</p><p>I hope the US-China trade war will not deteriorate and will be averted during President Donald Trump's tenure of office, to return the world to the normal of open trade and less (if not no) protectionism. The global economy will be further impacted if this trade dispute is not resolved.</p><p>As a small island nation, Singapore is vulnerable to the debilitating threats of climate change and the US-China trade war. My wish is that these challenges will be tackled with a levelheaded and objective approach by all concerned, to allow Singapore the needed space to continue to prosper in the years ahead.</p><p>Andrew Chan<br/>Founder and CEO<br/>ACI HR Solutions</p><p>2019 was a turbulent one with geopolitical issues dominating headlines and putting pressure on the economy and employment once again. I hope 2020 will bring stability with Brexit to finally conclude, the US-China trade war to cease and the tensions in Hong Kong to ease. The threat that I hope will not materialise is the escalation in tensions between the US and Iran, which potentially could bring about some catastrophic results.</p><p>Soong Chuan Sheng<br/>General Manager<br/>Klook Southeast Asia</p><p>The idea of solo travel is, to some, fairly daunting, and often reserved for seasoned executives, uninhibited backpackers and intrepid researchers. But our recent Solo Travel study revealed that 76 per cent of people globally (of all ages and nationality, and both male and female) have either travelled alone or are considering it. We expect this trend to continue to grow and evolve alongside its business opportunities.</p><p>On the other hand, overtourism continues to be a problem for many destinations, with different factors coming into play. Governments and local authorities have sought to control tourist numbers, closing off destinations to help rehabilitate the environment. Through technology, destinations are now empowered to combat this - by understanding travel patterns, leveraging data and promoting off-the-beaten path experiences.</p><p>Dora Hoan<br/>CEO<br/>Best World International Ltd</p><p>I predict that in 2020 and beyond, China's initiatives in leveraging advanced technologies such as 5G and AI, and as a leader embracing a completely cashless and autonomous retail world, will bring huge economic impacts to the East and South-East Asian economies. Singapore stands to gain if we manage to seize and maximise these opportunities.</p><p>However, as technology evolves, cyber-criminals will become more and more pervasive and sophisticated. Small to medium-sized organisations with \"weaker\" anti-risk solutions will become their new targets. Any economic losses and social panic would be undesirable. A strong risk mitigation strategy is vital to ensure secure growth.</p><p>Roshni Mahtani<br/>Founder &amp; Group CEO<br/>theAsianparent</p><p>With the dawn of a new decade, I hope to see more purpose-driven startups rising to tackle the challenges our world faces. At theAsianparent, we are determined to contribute to the community by tackling stillbirths in the region. The world needs more disruptive solutions that will positively change lives and alleviate the various crises that we face. More venture capital is required to push the boundaries of innovation. However, funding might not be as readily available going forward - an outcome that hopefully doesn't materialise, for progress and betterment of our world.</p><p>Henry Tan<br/>Group CEO<br/>Nexia TS</p><p>2020 is a year of challenges. I believe the economy will be in for a correction. This is because of the effects of economic slowdown in UK and Europe as a result of Brexit uncertainty; the trade war between US and China; and the inward-looking and protectionist stance of governments in major countries. This is not something I look forward to but it looks imminent. On the brighter side, I believe the digital economy will continue to grow and create new jobs and also bring out new entrants to the markets, fuelling more startups. In Singapore, we look forward to seeing the new technological changes and innovative product offerings with the issue of digital banking licences.</p><p>Amit Saberwal<br/>Founder and CEO<br/>RedDoorz</p><p>Technology has heavily influenced change in the travel and hospitality sector; so much so that expectations of modern travellers have evolved. In addition to making improvements to back-end and operational technology, new digital technologies such as IoT and AI will become ever more prevalent in order to deliver a more seamless guest experience during the search, booking and stay phase.</p><p>We hope brands don't back-peddle on green efforts in favour of reducing costs; we don't want to see continued wastage of resources without assessing the impact on our environment. With more focus on reducing wastage, and driving eco-friendly initiatives, 2020 should be the year when smaller brands make sustainability a key value.</p><p>Jacinta Quah<br/>Founder<br/>Jacinta Quah &amp; Co</p><p>I would like to see more Purposeful Powerful Leaders developing not just their employees but also taking time to evolve positively to lead their teams better.</p><p>Climate change is real as is the momentum to make real impact. We need concerted efforts to make sure that people who are going to lose their jobs in \"polluting\" industries are reskilled rather than displaced. Everyone has a right to make a living, but we need to place \"living\" well a priority.</p><p>Vijay Kumar<br/>CEO &amp; Founder<br/>ConnectUpz</p><p>For 2020, my prediction for the retail sector in Singapore is that more SMEs will adopt digitisation with the help of the newly-set up Heartland Enterprise Centre Singapore (HECS) and IMDA Start Digital Pack. Through the use of technology and data, the trend of retail closures seen in 2019 should see a drastic reduction. I hope the current economic slowdown experienced by developed countries such as Singapore, due to the trade war between the two economic super powers, does not further worsen and can eventually be resolved. Regardless, Singapore is poised to stay resilient though Industry 4.0.</p><p>G Rathakrishnan<br/>CEO<br/>London School of Business and Finance</p><p>It wasn't a good start to 2020, with the Australian bushfires, and yet another US-led situation in the Middle East. Singapore has been lucky economically in the last decade, and I hope the government does more on the pro-business policy front to uplift businesses, especially SMEs, for the difficult times ahead. I hope not to see another protracted war in the Middle East sparking humanitarian crises, especially affecting women and children.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-278952</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y16-FGF1-JCF2-800J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"10328\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002NTQ</classCode><className>FAIR ISAAC CORP (FICO)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;
