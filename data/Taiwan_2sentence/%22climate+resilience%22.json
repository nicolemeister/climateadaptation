At an event hosted by the Australia New Zealand Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan (ANZCham), the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade), and Australian energy company Akaysha Energy, Counselor to Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Wu Chih-wei said BESS provides overall stabilization and regulation of the power grid.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the grid-side, it strengthens grid resilience and flexibility, with a focus on frequency regulation and reserve capacity. On the generation-side, it enables integration with other renewable energy sources by providing supply for peak demand periods and regulates large-scale consumers by requiring them to install energy storage to meet their own use and prepare for contingency needs.</p><p>Taipower has been mandated to lead Taiwan's energy storage policies and promotion. With the goal of making Taiwan's grid safe and stable, Taipower established an energy trading platform in July 2021. The energy trading center responsible for operating the platform launched the Electricity Trading Platform (ETP), facilitating developers to invest in Energy Storage Systems (ESS) and to provide an ancillary market to allow privately distributed power resources to participate in bidding on the platform, and provide auxiliary services for the maintenance of a safe and stable power system.</p><p>As of May 2023, 50 qualified private traders (developers) with the total participating capacity of 441.3 MW have registered, and Taipower continues to work with those developers.</p><p>However, it is apparent there have been some ongoing issues with energy supply and demand, both domestically and commercially, continuing to rise, as will the recently announced costs to the consumers. Taipower has to do better.</p><p>Akaysha Energy is a large-scale utility battery energy storage developer, asset manager, and owner operator. In October 2022, Australia's New South Wales government awarded Akaysha by competitive tender the bid to construct, own, and operate the world's most powerful battery, the Waratah Super Battery (850 MW/1680 MWh).</p><p>Akaysha advocates a BESS PPA procurement model, where a PPA is simply a long-term electricity supply agreement between 2 parties, usually a power producer and an electricity consumer or trader. The BESS PPA procurement model is the preferred model in the Australian energy market and some later statistics provide a very interesting comparison between Australia and Taiwan's current journey in renewables.</p><p>Akaysha's representatives believe BESS PPAs are advantageous as the battery project risk is transferred to the private sector, and to specific project owners through the Build, Own, and Operate model. This spreads BESS cost outlays and associated risks out over the duration of the PPA concession, even more so with liquidated damage regimes in place to incentivize high contract performance.</p><p>Traditional public sector constraints are minimized under a BESS PPA by reducing budget, approvals and timing constraints normally experienced with capital-intensive projects. Further, BESS PPAs reduces balance sheet limitations, and makes more efficient use of capital and allows for greater diversification.</p><p>BESS PPAs also mean that governments are not required to find the specialised skills required to build, own, and operate BESS assets. Those requirements are fully addressed by companies such as Akaysha who develop and maintain the workforce, provide HR, training, performance, reporting requirements, construction expertise, project management, contract management, sub-contractor arrangements, safety, and reporting obligations.</p><p>Akaysha prefers to build its BESS on decommissioned sites. In the case of the Waratah project, Akaysha is utilizing a decommissioned coal fired power station site, thus minimizing the potential of local objections to the use of scarce land resources.</p><p>Taiwan has an urgent need for large scale storage and Taipower urgently requires large BESS. Similar to other power systems, the electricity network in Taiwan is facing real risks that can be mitigated with BESS technologies.</p><p>Taiwan's key grid risks include the following things.</p><p>Northeast network deficits - The rapidly changing energy mix in Taiwan with the planned thermal and nuclear decommissions have already resulted in energy shortfalls. The Northeast Network will have around a 5-6 GW shortfall for the next 5 years.</p><p>Blackouts and energy/ Climate resilience - There have been several widespread blackouts in Taiwan over recent years, and they are likely to increase in frequency and severity without increased grid resilience. Large volumes of strategically placed reserved capacity and additional storage operating in merchant markets can alleviate blackouts and significantly increase the grid resilience.</p><p>Traditional commercial models for large scale capacity using battery storage are evolving - Network Service Providers (NSPs) and governments in Australia, the U.S., and Europe are all moving away from the traditional balance sheet model and moving to more advanced, capital light and rapidly deployable PPA procurement models.</p><p>Ability to rapidly deploy storage - Not all NSPs, governments, and other participants can rapidly deliver large scale storage without the relevant technical understanding, commercial models, delivery capabilities and partnerships.</p><p>Despite Australia being some 214 times larger in land mass than Taiwan, there are interesting similarities and dissimilarities when reviewing the current state of renewable energy. Australia and Taiwan share approximately the same population. However, Taiwan's electricity consumption is higher than Australia's at 270 TWh (11.3 MWh/capita) versus 240 TWh (9.3 MWh/capita). Taiwan's peak demand also outstrips Australia with 40.7 GW (growth rate: 2.5%) against 33 GW (growth rate: 0%).</p><p>Australia is performing much better than Taiwan in renewable contributions, with the 2022 figures showing Australia at 40% and Taiwan at 8.3%. That is further amplified by Taiwan's 2030 renewable target of 27%-30%, whereas Australia expects to be at 80%. Furthermore, in terms of battery assets, Australia already has some 1 GWh operational and estimates this will grow to 14.5 GWh by 2025.

Since 2020, Acer has integrated the climate-related financial disclosure framework (TCFD) into its reporting to better manage climate-related risks and opportunities, strengthen the company's climate resilience, and through an internal carbon price mechanism, encourage various departments and global operations to actively take carbon reduction actions, develop energy-efficient products and services, and evaluate solutions such as introducing natural solutions and carbon negative technologies.</p><p>Low Eco-friendly Products that Respond to SDGs</p><p>The international trends in applying carbon taxes on trade, manufacturing emissions, and such, mean that products' carbon footprints may directly impact on their cost and competitiveness. Taking into consideration the concept of a circular economy, the life cycle of products, and innovations to reduce the environmental impacts, Acer seeks to strike a balance between product management and environmental performance.</p><p>In 2022, a carbon footprint tool was introduced to complete the carbon report of Acer's commercial business products and ChromeOS devices. A new Modern Standby power management mode was developed to reduce energy consumption of notebook computers by 39% and of desktop computers by 35%, compared with the base year of 2016. At the same time, Acer's eco-friendly Vero product line continued to increase the use of eco-friendly materials, such as post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic and ocean-bound plastic (OBP), extending this use across other product lines to reduce carbon footprint, implementing tangible actions toward the goal of a circular economy.</p><p>Acer's subsidiaries have also launched various innovative products that incorporate the concept of sustainability, including: integrated smart parking meter with electric vehicle charging station that respond to the global net-zero policy of transportation electrification; the eKinekt bike desk that converts pedaling power to electricity to create a sustainable and healthy lifestyle; electric vehicles with the Xplova e-scooter and \"ebii\" ebike; enabling zero-carbon emission to be practiced in daily life and responding to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including SDG 3 for good health and well-being, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 13 Climate Action.</p><p>Work with Supply Chain Partners to Speed Up the Net-zero Goal</p><p>As one of the world's top ICT companies, Acer seeks to amplify the positive impacts on the environment through united actions. Starting from its Project Humanity initiative in 2017, employees around the world were united to take eco-friendly actions, laying the foundation for the company to implement its net-zero carbon emission strategy. In 2021, Acer launched its Earthion program to extend the concept of carbon reduction to like-minded people and began working closely with suppliers and partners to take actions focusing on energy, product design, packaging design, production, logistics, and recycling to reduce the proportion of plastic materials used throughout the production process.</p><p>Acer aims to optimize communication with its supply chain partners through annual ESG communication meetings, ad hoc business meetings, CDP supplier training, and carbon management-related training courses. In addition, Acer's ESG scorecard management mechanism incorporates suppliers' greenhouse gas inventory, carbon management, carbon reduction actions, and renewable electricity usage into its procurement evaluation. This encourages suppliers to commit to net-zero carbon emissions, set reduction goals such as RE100 or SBT, and work toward the goal of net zero by 2050.</p><p>[1] Achieve scope 1 and 2 of carbon inventory</p><p>About Acer</p><p>Founded in 1976, Acer is one of the world's top ICT companies with a presence in more than 160 countries.
