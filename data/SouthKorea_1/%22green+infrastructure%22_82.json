At this time of the year, you sometimes just want to seat relaxed in the back of a car and admire the view outside. The days will soon come when you do just that alone, behind the wheel, without driving a car.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Korean government unveiled its plan to bring about this future sooner. Under its first national road plan, the government will extend the expressway network of Korea to 5,000 km by 2020 so that 96 percent of Koreans can get access to the expressway in just 30 minutes. A smart tolling system will be introduced across the nation to ensure a fast passage of cars without stopping at booths for tickets. Roads and bridges will be reinforced to be more resilient to earthquakes by 2018. The policy is designed in the long term to provide sound guidance to future roads by factoring in the upcoming changes in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence (AI), environment, energy and reunification in shaping the policy. Even though the policy was designed for future roads, some of the changes in the policy are already happening.</p><p>For instance, autonomous driving is no longer a staple of science fiction. The global market for autonomous vehicles (AV) is expected to grow to 220 trillion won by 2020 and to 1,340 trillion won by 2035. To secure Korea's place in the market, the government is building K-Cities to test AV technologies. Other measures are also being put into place to speed up the launch of Korea's AVs on the market. In July, the C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport System), an advanced, ICT-based traffic management system, was introduced as a pilot program on some roads between Sejong and Daejeon. With the C-ITS, cars equipped with simple on-board terminals can receive various safety services including warnings against a sudden stopping of the car in front, or an approaching pedestrian at an intersection. As AVs go mainstream, cities will soon have highly intelligent roads that accommodate fully self-driving cars and repair themselves.</p><p>Roads of the future will become greener as well. Under the national road plan, the government aims to increase the proportion of green cars to 20 percent by 2020 and is building green infrastructure for this. Green roads will generate electricity from renewable sources including wind, solar and piezoelectric, which will in turn power the electric vehicles running on the roads wirelessly. Repairs will be done either by robots or roads themselves with the advancement of conventional road materials like concrete or asphalt.</p><p>Roads will become lighter as personal transportation and green cars become popular. Roads will become more flexible with sections being assembled on demand like Lego. That will reshape the image of cities as being old and polluting as they produce less noise and dust. Cities with future roads will be more efficient and livable with some roads going underground and others above the ground, linking to high-rise buildings. Safety will be enhanced too thanks to the breakthrough in shock absorbing materials used for road facilities and road design. Last but not least, roads will become more transnational, expanding beyond the Korean peninsula to Eurasia under the Asian Highway project.</p><p>To realize this future, however, improvement in road transport alone will not be enough. It needs to converge with existing or emerging technologies like AVs, smart cities and geospatial information. Disruptive innovation and cooperation across industries will facilitate the process. Regulations need to be improved as well. Efforts on these multiple fronts will make Korea's roads safer, more convenient and driver-friendly and something completely different from the roads we see today.</p><p>A shift in paradigm is sorely needed for Korean roads. Roads have powered the Korean economy and contributed to the balanced development of the national territory and better living standards. However, a dramatic change is needed so as to open a new future for Korea as it did for its economy. Paths between towns and regions used to serve as links where new civilizations were born and expanded. The paths have evolved into roads and they are still evolving.</p><p>Kang Ho-in is Minister of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M2Y-5MW1-DYTP-W2KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>November 1, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008WSF</classCode><className>AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY &amp;

Joel Lee/The Kore</p><p>The multilateral institution aims to reduce global poverty and create opportunities for development through leveraged loans. It consists of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes.</p><p>The institution aims to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030 and boost shared prosperity by lifting the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of population.</p><p>Korea's experience in sustainable development and transition to a dynamic knowledge-based economy provide lessons that benefit many other developing countries, according to the WBG. In an effort to deepen engagement with Korea, the WBG opened a national office in Songdo, Incheon, in December 2013.</p><p>Currently, the group has a series of partnerships and joint projects with Korean partners designed to enhance financial sector management, promote investment in green infrastructure and energy, share knowledge in information and communications technology and assist fragile and conflict-ridden states.</p><p>To realize these objectives, the Korea Office shares global knowledge with Korean institutions such as the Korea Development Institute and the Korea Eximbank, collaborates with Korean companies and works to deepen engagement with the Korean government.</p><p>\"Our office looks for ways to help clients in Asia's developing countries, by assessing their risks and opportunities and leveraging our presence here through public-private partnerships,\" she said.</p><p>\"As an example, we try to look for successful cases of labor and regulatory reforms in Korea that can be used as advice. We also bring in information from other OECD countries.\"</p><p>Despite the world's intensifying geopolitical tensions and gloomy financial forecast, Msuya said there are still numerous opportunities to cooperate between the World Bank and Korea.</p><p>She cited the case of the new Expressway Development Support Project in Ethiopia, designed to help the country expand its road networks between the southern, central and northern regions, where the Korea Eximbank, the World Bank and the African Development Bank have worked together.</p><p>As another example, Msuya pointed to the \"Vietnam 2035 Report,\" where Korean policy experts and the World Bank team have informed the Vietnamese government on institutional capacity-building and bureaucratic governance reform.</p><p>\"As a global institution, we bring the international knowledge and perspective to support Korea achieve its ambitions,\" she highlighted.</p><p>\"Korea has a very good brand overall in the world. By becoming a foreign aid donor from a recipient, Korea can actually speak with credibility on the international stage.\"</p><p>Regarding the relationship with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which Korea is joining as a founding member, Msuya said the World Bank will closely cooperate with the institution once it starts operations.</p><p>\"One trillion dollars goes into infrastructure development each year, with most going into developed countries. This implies that in emerging, low-income markets, there is a huge infrastructure deficit,\" she stressed.</p><p>\"No single institution can meet these enormous demands. Our team will work very closely with the AIIB secretariat in Beijing, by including them as part of our consultation process and connecting with Korean stakeholders.\"</p><p>She added that the two organizations already share views, from safeguards on environmental standards to governance structure, using video conferencing.</p><p>By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.c</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H4H-W4K1-JCF4-M0MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 12, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0001QSP</classCode><className>EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF KOREA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0007LOR</classCode><className>AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>WORLD BANK GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION &amp;

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In OECD countries alone, institutional investors control an estimated $92 trillion in assets. Annual official development assistance by multilateral finance institutions (MFIs) and governments amounts to just 0.16 percent of that - about $145 billion.</p><p>But, as commercial actors, institutional investors' primary objective is to maximize financial returns. Even as some purge their portfolios of carbon-intensive companies, they generally consider investing in new clean-energy infrastructure projects to be too risky, particularly in emerging markets.To finance the SDGs, including clean-energy infrastructure, MFIs have committed to mobilizing capital from private investors. This mobilization takes place largely through so-called blended finance, whereby MFIs and other public finance institutions use their own capital to crowd in private financing. But institutional investors have been largely absent from multilateral blended-finance initiatives, which have, in turn, failed to achieve a scale relevant to climate change.So what will it take to mobilize the needed capital from institutional investors? A recent paper by researchers at Stanford and Maastricht universities suggests focusing on three recent developments in the global financial sector.First, a growing number of institutional investors are reducing their dependence on financial intermediaries. Institutional investors have traditionally outsourced their investments to investment management firms, whose performance is generally assessed on a quarterly basis. Yet the investment horizon for infrastructure, including clean-energy infrastructure, is often more than 20 years.From the perspective of blended finance, traditional financial intermediaries, with their short-term biases, constitute a bottleneck between institutional investors and MFIs. The elimination of such intermediaries could thus provide new opportunities for direct cooperation between institutional investors and MFIs, as it enables the former to focus more on investment in long-term assets.Second, many institutional investors are establishing collaborative platforms to enable cost-sharing on deal sourcing, due diligence, and other stages of the investment process. Each of these platforms represents a very large amount of long-term capital. But, with few exceptions, they do not include MFIs.Third, there are new types of local strategic investors that can be highly effective at mobilizing private capital, including from institutional backers. Over the last decade, at least 20 countries have established state-sponsored strategic investment funds to co-invest in infrastructure projects with private-sector partners. Other countries have established green banks, whose domestic focus reflects the fact that 90 percent of private climate-finance investments are made within the capital's country of origin.The strategic investment funds that have successfully mobilized private capital are structured much like private investment organizations. They emphasize the independence and integrity of the investment decision-making process; and their boards and board committees have a high share of independent directors selected for their financial and business expertise. Some funds, such as India's National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, are owned mainly by private and institutional investors, with the government in a minority position.Managed by finance professionals recruited from the private sector, these strategic funds invest primarily in equity, and take an active role in structuring and arranging new deals. Because they are linked to local government and business networks, they are in a strong position to mitigate local risk.MFIs, by contrast, tend to emphasize country representation on their boards, leaving these boards with less financial-sector expertise in the relevant sectors. At the management and staff level, the private-sector branches of MFIs frequently have expertise in a wide range of areas. Despite this, MFI boards - unlike their private counterparts - generally do not establish a broad investment policy or delegate decisions on individual infrastructure projects to an independent investment committee; instead, they themselves make the decisions on capital allocation.Given MFIs' bureaucratic structures and frequently cumbersome procedures, institutional investors tend to be skeptical about them. Institutional investors often consider the projects MFIs pitch to be too small, too risky, or not profitable enough, and they worry that, if something goes wrong, MFIs' bureaucracies will not permit them to address it swiftly.Whereas MFIs have expanded their offers of risk mitigation for investors, they overwhelmingly remain providers of debt. Crucially, they invest very little in infrastructure equity. This is a significant distinction, because whereas equity investors frequently take an active role in structuring and arranging new infrastructure projects, providers of debt and risk mitigation generally engage once a project is fully documented and confirmed as 'bankable.'To achieve their goal of mobilizing private-sector capital, MFIs need to engage on institutional investors' collaborative platforms, and address these investors' concerns. This means helping them to assess and mitigate risk in new regions and sectors where green infrastructure is needed, if appropriate in cooperation with local strategic investment funds and green banks.By developing the capacity to assess and bear risk on commercial terms, traditionally risk-averse MFIs could engage more productively with institutional investors. And by building up the capacity to undertake equity investment in clean-energy infrastructure, MFIs could increase their capacity to engage with institutional investors at relevant stages of the infrastructure-investment cycle.Simply put, in order to mobilize institutional capital effectively, MFIs will need to start functioning more like private investment organizations, even as they fulfill a policy-defined mandate. This is a tall order; the OECD has suggested that efficient private capital mobilization may require a culture change within MFIs. But, if we are to curb climate change and achieve the SDGs, it could be the only way for MFIs to mobilize institutional investor capital at any relevant scale.</p><p>Havard Halland is a visiting scholar at the Stanford Global Projects Center (GPC) at Stanford University.

This deficit is closely linked to a country's ecological footprint   the amount of productive land and sea needed to support a population's consumption and its spillover waste.</p><p>In the case of Korea, food, housing, mobility as well as goods and services make up around 70 percent of the country's ecological footprint, according to the GFN and WWF-Korea's joint report.</p><p>This indicates that Korea can vastly reduce its ecological footprint by encouraging individuals and families to change their daily consumption and lifestyle decisions in ways that support the environment, the GFN said.</p><p>The biggest contributor to Korea's ecological footprint by category is food (23 percent), according to the GFN. This is not unique to Korea, as some 30 percent of the world's food supply is wasted every year, according to a 2013 report by the UN-based Food and Agriculture Organization.</p><p>The easiest way for a country to reduce its food footprint is to eliminate food waste at every link of the human food chain, as emphasized by FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva in 2013.</p><p>Reducing food waste by 1 kilogram is said to be equivalent to planting 322 adult pine trees or reducing some 894 kilograms of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If Korea's entire population were to reduce food waste by 20 percent, it would be the same as planting some 360 million trees.</p><p>The Korean Ministry of Environment expects reducing food waste by 20 percent could lower related disposal costs by some 160 million won ($141 million) annually.</p><p>On an individual level, the GFN advised Koreans to consider cutting down on processed food, as heavily processed food tends to use up more resources in the production process. Individuals could cook more from scratch, support organic food and vegetables as well as avoid purchasing overly packaged items, it said.</p><p>Other major contributors to Korea's ecological footprint are transportation and the high usage of fossil fuels for power, factors which also expedite global climate change, according to the GFN.</p><p>Given this, \"transitioning to renewable energy is one of the most powerful ways for Korea to lower its Ecological Footprint,\" the GFN suggested.

This deficit is closely linked to a country's ecological footprint   the amount of productive land and sea needed to support a population's consumption and its spillover waste.</p><p>In the case of Korea, food, housing, mobility as well as goods and services make up around 70 percent of the country's ecological footprint, according to the GFN and WWF-Korea's joint report.</p><p>This indicates that Korea can vastly reduce its ecological footprint by encouraging individuals and families to change their daily consumption and lifestyle decisions in ways that support the environment, the GFN said.</p><p>The biggest contributor to Korea's ecological footprint by category is food (23 percent), according to the GFN. This is not unique to Korea, as some 30 percent of the world's food supply is wasted every year, according to a 2013 report by the UN-based Food and Agriculture Organization.</p><p>The easiest way for a country to reduce its food footprint is to eliminate food waste at every link of the human food chain, as emphasized by FAO Director-General Jose Graziano da Silva in 2013.</p><p>Reducing food waste by 1 kilogram is said to be equivalent to planting 322 adult pine trees or reducing some 894 kilograms of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If Korea's entire population were to reduce food waste by 20 percent, it would be the same as planting some 360 million trees.</p><p>The Korean Ministry of Environment expects reducing food waste by 20 percent could lower related disposal costs by some 160 million won ($141 million) annually.</p><p>On an individual level, the GFN advised Koreans to consider cutting down on processed food, as heavily processed food tends to use up more resources in the production process. Individuals could cook more from scratch, support organic food and vegetables as well as avoid purchasing overly packaged items, it said.</p><p>Other major contributors to Korea's ecological footprint are transportation and the high usage of fossil fuels for power, factors which also expedite global climate change, according to the GFN.</p><p>Given this, \"transitioning to renewable energy is one of the most powerful ways for Korea to lower its Ecological Footprint,\" the GFN suggested. And there is great room for improvement, as renewable energy takes up less than 1 percent of the Korea's total energy usage, a situation shared by other developed countries in the world, it said.</p><p>In 2014, coal supplied 39 percent of Korea's electricity power generation while nuclear powered accounted for 30 percent and liquid gas 21 percent, according to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Trade, industry and Energy.</p><p>The government and businesses can invest in walkable cities with green infrastructure and low carbon transportation, while citizens can be encouraged to use more public transportation and purchase electric cars when possible, the GFN said.</p><p>\"Given the fact that Korea imports 96 percent of its primary energy, according to the International Energy Agency (2012), investment in renewable energy will help reduce energy security risk and economic uncertainty,\" the environmental body said.</p><p>For individuals, traveling by public transportation instead of car can significantly reduce carbon emissions   bus by 85 percent and train by 90 percent, according to the Environment Ministry.</p><p>Choosing certified appliances with high energy efficiency, taking a short shower instead of a bath, saving paper and recycling are daily habits that citizens could adopt to conserve energy, the GFN said.</p><p>Looking ahead, the global environmentalist think tank expressed hopes that Korea could emerge as an international leader in driving forth new developments in the renewable energy sector.</p><p>\"Korean technology has had a dramatic impact on our lifestyles, which created a revolution in information and communications technology. This same innovative spirit now needs to be directed towards the huge challenge our country faces. Given the right incentives, Korea could lead the way in a sustainable energy revolution,\" the GFN said.</p><p>By Sohn Ji-young (</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M5Y-7T81-JCF4-M013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>October 24, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

The world needs a strong and forward-looking Germany in a dynamic European Union. The SPD's initial decision to go into opposition after its poor election result in September may have been sincere, and even strategically sound. But it is not timely. </p><p>Diplomacy almost everywhere is fractured. The United States is reckoning with a psychologically unstable president, a plutocratic cabinet, and a Republican congressional majority. Europe is in the throes of multiple economic, social, political, and institutional crises. China, by contrast, is dynamic and outward-looking - providing good reason for the EU to assume vigorous leadership and engage in constructive partnerships with China on key initiatives (such as sustainable infrastructure across Eurasia).In short, this is a critical time for Germany and Europe to provide vision, stability, and global leadership. And that imperative extends to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the SPD.But the CDU/CSU and the SPD need to do more than merely extend the previous government, which was too parochial in outlook and temperament. The world and Europe need an outward-looking Germany that offers more institutional and financial innovation.Economic growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable is a very European idea, one that has now been embraced globally in the United Nations\u00ef'2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, as well as in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Europe's experience with social democracy and Christian democracy made this global vision possible. But now that its agenda has been adopted worldwide, Europe's leadership in fulfilling it has become essential.A grand coalition government in Germany must help put Europe in a position to lead. French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>has offered some important ideas: a European finance minister; Eurobonds to finance a new European investment program; more emphasis on innovation; a financial transactions tax to fund increased aid to Africa; and tax harmonization more generally, before the US triggers a global race to the bottom on taxing corporations and the rich.Contrary to the Germans who oppose such ideas, a European finance minister and Eurobonds would not and should not lead to fiscal profligacy, but rather to a revival of investment-led green growth in Europe. China has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative to build green infrastructure linking Southeast Asia and Central Asia with Europe. This is the time for Europe to offer the same bold vision, creating a partnership with China to renovate Eurasia's infrastructure for a low-carbon future.If Europe plays its cards right, Europe's (and China's) scientific and technical excellence would flourish under such a vision. If not, we will all be driving Chinese electric vehicles charged by Chinese photovoltaic cells in the future, while Germany's automotive industry will become a historical footnote.A European finance minister would, moreover, finally end Europe's self-inflicted agony in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. As difficult as it is to believe, Greece's crisis continues to this day, at Great Depression scale, ten years after the onset of the crisis.This is because Europe has been unable, and Germany unwilling, to clean up the financial mess in a fair and forward-looking manner. If Germany won't help to lead on this issue, Europe will face a prolonged crisis with severe social, economic, and political repercussions. In three weeks, Macron will convene world leaders in Paris on the second anniversary of the climate accord. France should certainly take a bow here, but so should Germany. During Germany's G-20 Presidency, Merkel kept 19 of the 20 members of the G-20 firmly committed to the Paris agreement, despite US President Donald Trump's disgraceful attempt to wreck it.Yes, the corruption of US politics (especially campaign funding by the oil and gas industry) threatened the global consensus on climate change. But Germany stood firm. The new coalition should also ensure that the country's Energiewende ('energy transition') delivers on the 2020 targets set by previous governments. A CDU/CSU-SPD alliance, working with France and the rest of Europe, could and should do much more on climate change. Most important, Europe needs a comprehensive energy plan to decarbonize fully by 2050. This will require a zero-carbon smart power grid that extends across the continent and taps into the wind and solar power not only of southern Europe but also of North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. Once again, Eurobonds, a green partnership with China, and unity within Europe could make all the difference.Such an alliance would also enable a new foreign policy for Europe, one that promotes peace and sustainable development, underpinned by new security arrangements that do not depend so heavily on the US. The political terms of a new grand coalition government, it would seem, are clear. The SPD should hold out for ministerial leadership on economic and financial policy, while the CDU/CSU holds the chancellorship. That would be a true coalition, not one that could bury the SPD politically or deny it the means to push for a truly green, inclusive, EU-wide, sustainable development agenda.With Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz in the lead, the German government would be in excellent, responsible, and experienced hands. Germany's friends and admirers, and all supporters of global sustainable development, are hoping for this breakthrough. By Jeffrey D. Sachs Jeffrey D.

Instead of saying 'you first,' we should start by doing 'me first.'\" Lee said.</p><p>To mediate differences between developing and developed countries, he once again suggested the establishment of a registry of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions of developing countries at the United Nations.</p><p>The mechanism will internationally recognize voluntary targets set by developing countries and increase transparency and also provide assistance so that they can achieve these goals, he said.</p><p>\"This will be one way to encourage countries to act voluntarily,\" he added.</p><p>He stressed the importance of how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as by how much.</p><p>\"We must focus upon 'how' we are going to reduce our emissions. In particular, when we consider our need to continue economic development, coming up with a solution becomes very important,\" he said.</p><p>As an example, he cited Korea's \"low carbon, green growth\" vision in which the nation is investing 2 percent of its gross domestic product into research and development of new green technologies and green infrastructure.</p><p>\"We will do our best to reduce carbon emissions but also seek new engines of growth that will ensure sustainable development, more jobs and a greener future.

It will establish branches in about five counties until 2012.</p><p>Lee also announced Seoul's bid to host the 2012 global climate change conference which is scheduled to be held in Asia.</p><p>Korea is the world's ninth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases and registered the fastest emissions growth among OECD members from 1990-2005.</p><p>Last month, the government announced that it will aim at a 30 percent cut from its forecast greenhouse gas emissions in 2020, equivalent to a reduction of 4 percent of 2005 levels.</p><p>It is the highest level recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for developing and emerging countries. Korea is not bound by the Kyoto treaty, which requires industrialized nations to set emissions cut targets.</p><p>Through the voluntary commitment, Korea hopes to show its resolve to fight climate change and set an example for other countries to follow.</p><p>(<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jjhwang@heraldm.com\">jjhwang@heraldm.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7XBD-9YH0-Y9SF-617W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>December 18, 2009 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Business &amp;

Trump is making a mistake that will have grave repercussions for his own country, and for the world.Trump claims that he will try to renegotiate the deal reached in Paris, or craft a new one. But leaders from around the world have already hailed the agreement as a breakthrough for the fight against climate change, a victory for international cooperation and a boon to the global economy. That remains true today.Among the many challenges we face today, climate change is unique in its global scale. </p><p>It affects every element of life on this planet -- from ecosystems and food production to cities and industrial supply chains. Viewing climate change as strictly an ??environmental?? problem misses the point entirely.We might charitably assume that Trump simply does not understand the implications of his decision. And yet, regardless of what Trump thinks, we know that he is surrounded by advisers who know very well what is at stake.On the campaign trail, Trump promised to create jobs and protect American workers from the ravages of the world. And he signed off his tweet announcing that he had made a decision on the Paris accord with the words, ??MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!??But Trump??s decision undermines every one of these goals and it goes against the wishes of a vast majority of Americans, including many of his own supporters. By turning his back on the Paris agreement, he is increasing Americans?? exposure to the devastating effects of climate change -- many of which they are already experiencing. Moreover, he is undercutting jobs in the thriving renewable-energy and electric-vehicle sectors, which are increasingly employing the very workers he purports to represent.More broadly, Trump has diminished America itself and abdicated its global leadership role. When I was a member of the French government participating in a global tour to build consensus for climate action -- an effort that eventually culminated in the Paris agreement -- I experienced firsthand what American leadership can achieve. It is tragic to watch that force for good be subverted by denial and myopia.By burying their heads in the sand, Trump and his advisers must be hoping that reality will simply go away. They have somehow concluded that America will be spared from the droughts already destroying farms in California??s Central Valley, the rising sea levels already flooding coastal cities, the storms and wildfires routinely ravaging vast swathes of the American countryside, and the water- and food-supply disruptions that threaten us all.Other parties to the Paris agreement have responded to Trump??s decision with strength, therefore proving the resilience of the agreement itself. The rest of the world will be sad to see an America that has been left behind, owing to Trump??s decision. But we will not wait; in fact, we are already moving on.The world??s response will be clear at the G-20 meeting in Germany this July. Already, Europe, China, India, Canada, and Pacific Rim and South American countries have recommitted to the goals of the Paris agreement. These countries understand the dangers of climate change, as do Exxon Mobil??s global shareholders, who, just this week, rejected that company??s attempts to ignore the impact of climate change on its business.By placing America in the company of the only two countries that have not joined the Paris agreement -- Syria and Nicaragua -- Trump??s decision is completely at odds with the current global atmosphere of cooperation. The world??s major economies are reaching new agreements every day to collaborate on research and development, infrastructure investment and industrial strategy. They are working together to achieve a low-carbon economy, and to make 2020 the year that global greenhouse-gas emissions will have peaked.European leaders are already meeting with their Indian and Chinese counterparts to find areas where they can cooperate on developing clean energy and green infrastructure. Massive investments will be made in these areas, and the European Central Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and many other institutions are devising mechanisms to finance them. Likewise, sovereign wealth funds with immense clout in the global financial system are redirecting their investments toward the green economy.Even the most optimistic among us did not predict that the old fossil-fuel paradigm would change so quickly. But Europe is phasing out coal-fueled energy production. And India, China, and South Korea are rapidly shifting their investments away from coal and toward renewable-energy sources.Worldwide, the competition is about ??who can go green the fastest.?? New industries are springing up, at scale, in areas ranging from electrification and smart-grid design to electric vehicles, green construction and recycling technologies and organic chemicals. The renewable-energy revolution, now spreading at an unprecedented rate, is already transforming entire sectors, not least transportation. In all of these sectors around the world, the excitement and growth potential is palpable.It is a shame that Trump has decided to shirk America??s global responsibility and turn his back on these developments. His decision is a blow to so many people -- including a great many Americans -- who have worked hard to be a successful part of the new economy.Still, Trump cannot take all of America with him. State- and city-level climate action is sweeping across the US, increasing in scale and ambition. Trump??s historic mistake represents an obstacle to that collective action; but it can hardly stop it. Just as Chinese companies are now training US coal workers to build wind farms, the rest of the world will continue to work together, and build the markets and workforce of the future.By Laurence TubianaLaurence Tubiana, former French ambassador to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a professor at Sciences-Po, Paris. -- Ed.(Project Syndicate)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NPM-G9Y1-DYX6-B1R1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 2, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

As the deepest economic crisis of our lifetimes stretches into its seventh year, most OECD countries are continuing to underperform. This year, GDP growth in the world's advanced economies is expected to average 2 percent, compared to 3.2 percent worldwide. And 2016 is shaping up to be no better, with output in the OECD growing by 2.5 percent, while the rest of the world's GDP expands at a 3.8 percent rate ? close to the pre-crisis average.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the long-term economic prospects of the global economy as a whole look gloomy. As societies in many OECD countries age, and catch-up growth in large emerging economies begins to wind down, global GDP growth is expected to fall from its annual average of 3.6 percent in the 2010-2020 period to an estimated 2.4 percent in 2050-2060.</p><p>This slump may be inevitable, but it can be mitigated. Implementing policies to facilitate and reward long-term investments will be key to exiting the current crisis and boosting the world's growth potential.</p><p>Investments, both public and private, are needed to foster green growth, support innovation and entrepreneurship, contribute to closing the inequality gaps that have widened during the crisis, and help build the skills that are essential for more resilient economies and more inclusive societies. And, though meeting these needs will require transformational changes in the behavior of governments and investors, the payoff will be significant. In short, as we argued during the OECD Forum and annual Ministerial Council Meeting last week, this time we need to promote investments that focus on people and the planet.</p><p>The list of structural challenges facing countries around the globe is a long one. But efforts to overcome at least four ? high unemployment, an aging workforce, climate change, and infrastructure deficiencies ? would benefit significantly from policies promoting long-term investments.</p><p>Addressing the unemployment crisis, which has been particularly burdensome for the young, will require not only a strong recovery, but also a renewed focus on the development of skills. Investment in high-quality vocational education and training and work-based learning will be essential. These types of investments continue to be beneficial throughout a worker's life, as exposure to new skills and knowledge allows him or her to adapt to an evolving technological and business environment. Empowering today's workers will also help meet the challenges resulting from aging populations.</p><p>Moreover, an increased focus on long-term investment will help resolve the conflicts traditionally associated with addressing climate change and building infrastructure. One requires cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases; the other has tended to promote the combustion of fossil fuels for transport and energy. The solution is relatively simple, provided the presence of political will: By putting a price on carbon and repealing policies that incentivize fossil-fuel consumption, investments can be channeled into the creation of a low-carbon economy, including the necessary clean-energy infrastructure.</p><p>In order to encourage private investors to pursue long-term, responsible projects, governments need to promote consistent policies and frameworks. In addition to immediate uncertainties, investors are being held back by a shortage of incentives and a surplus of factors that reduce returns. These include restrictive regulations that reduce firms' ability to undertake new activities or enter new markets, especially across borders. The OECD's updated Policy Framework for Investment provides a blueprint for the promotion of investment and responsible business conduct.</p><p>Governments will also have to facilitate the participation of institutional investors. The challenge of long-term investment cannot be resolved without attracting more diverse and private sources of finance. In 2013, institutional investors in OECD countries alone held more than $57 trillion in assets, and pension funds collected around $1 trillion in new contributions.</p><p>Tools that could be used to leverage institutional investments include public-private partnerships to develop clear and transparent project pipelines for major green infrastructure projects, green banks and green bonds, and instruments that mitigate risk and enhance the availability of credit. Regulations for international accounting and funding will have to be examined to identify policies that inadvertently discourage institutional investors from putting their resources into longer-term, illiquid assets.</p><p>Finally, public equity markets will have to be strengthened. Savings must be channeled to firms that need capital for innovation and sustainable job creation. Today, however, the quality of corporate-governance frameworks worldwide is challenged by the growing complexity of investment chains and the dominance of passive and short-term investment strategies.</p><p>In a globally interdependent world, a better financial and investment system cannot be achieved on a country-by-country basis. There may be no one-size-fits-all model for economic development, but, without global standards and complementary regulations, the long-term outlook for the world economy will remain bleak.</p><p>Angel Gurria is secretary-general of the OECD.

A cumulative investment in infrastructure of $18.1 trillion will be needed by 2030, according to a recent analysis undertaken for the World Economic Forum's Infrastructure Initiative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Close to $1 trillion a year on average is a huge investment challenge to meet. In addition, a gathering body of analysis suggests that a business-as-usual approach to investment in traditional, emissions- and resource-intensive infrastructure will not result in the sustainable growth that many developing countries seek, and may even decrease economic resilience in some cases.</p><p>For example, by 2030 there could be a 40 percent gap between global water demand and supply, with the situation worse for those developing countries, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, that are already using freshwater supplies unsustainably.</p><p>In the agricultural sector, investment in traditional practices to meet the expected doubling of demand for production by 2030 could increase land under cultivation from 1.5 trillion hectares to 3.2 trillion hectares, leading to large-scale deforestation with negative land, water and climate change consequences.</p><p>Increase in energy demand</p><p>The energy sector also holds tremendous challenges. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 40 percent increase in energy demand by 2030, driven almost entirely by growth in developing and emerging countries.</p><p>Without action to decarbonize energy infrastructure, investments in the energy sector will continue to accentuate the world's reliance on emissions-intensive fossil fuels for close to 60 percent of total power generation for this period.</p><p>In addition to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, following such an approach will expose developing countries to increased volatility in fossil fuel prices, as imports of oil and coal rise.</p><p>The consequences are potentially dramatic. Given these scenarios, scientists and other observers warn that the world is heading for a global average increase in land temperature of between 4 and 6 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, when in fact the average global temperature increase should be maintained within 2 degrees to avoid the negative impacts of climate change.</p><p>The latest scientific analysis suggests the world has already experienced an average land mass warming of 1 degree since 1950; for every degree rise in average land temperature, scientists estimate an increase in the potential for more extreme weather events.</p><p>Rio+20 negotiations</p><p>Some commentators suggest that we are already seeing the early signs of things to come, with changing weather patterns (droughts and heavy rainfall) in many parts of the world, such as the recent floods in Thailand, the Philippines and Pakistan that have claimed many lives, left millions of people affected and created billions of dollars in economic damage.</p><p>Fortunately, some good news exists. The multitude of initiatives, policy and business-driven commitments that are being announced on the margins of the Rio+20 negotiations stand as proof of the potential for the public and private sectors to work together to achieve sustainable growth.</p><p>Supported by international agencies, an increasing number of governments in developing countries are changing their approach to infrastructure and industrial planning to make their economic growth more sustainable and resilient.</p><p>This is not just an abstract concept. China has devoted key parts of its last three five-year plans to developing a green growth strategy for energy, agriculture and infrastructure, investing over $51 billion in new renewable energy projects in 2010 alone, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</p><p>Recently, Mexico enacted a national law making the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030 a legal commitment. Other emerging economies such as Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Kenya, Vietnam, and increasingly India are promoting green growth policies to enhance the resilience of their economic development.</p><p>Many other developing countries are following suit. According to the Global Status Report of the Renewable Energy Network (REN21), by the end of 2010, 96 countries had enacted renewable energy targets, 60 had bio-energy mandates and at least 30 were developing some form of low-carbon growth path.</p><p>The goal of these national strategies, which includes policies on renewable energy, energy efficiency, transport and agriculture, as well as market-based carbon tax and trade mechanisms, is to direct significant investment flows into resource-efficient, job-creating growth.</p><p>The role that organizations such as the Global Green Growth Institute (headquartered in Seoul) are playing in helping developing countries design comprehensive green growth strategies is already showing initial successes in countries such as Ethiopia or Indonesia.</p><p>The move among many developing countries to make their infrastructure investment and their growth strategies green in general has important economic implications.</p><p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance shows that in 2011 global investment in new renewable power plants ? estimated at $187 billion ? surpassed that of power plants fuelled by natural gas, oil and coal ? of $157 billion ? for the first time.</p><p>2011 was also the first year when expenditure on renewable energy in developing countries, driven by China, exceeded that of the industrialized world.</p><p>These conditions present a window of attractiveness for investment into these growth markets. In the current economic circumstances, the fiscal outlook is more optimistic in developing countries, where debt to GDP ratios have been falling in recent years, as growth has been maintained and where as a consequence, risk premiums have continued to decrease.</p><p>The economic performance of emerging markets, including several in sub-Saharan Africa, has improved greatly in recent years, as is the case with emerging market countries such as India that can attract more investment and are in a better position to absorb capital flows aimed at an expansion in investment.</p><p>Sustainable world economy</p><p>To support the dramatic increase in private investment that is needed to transform towards a sustainable world economy, this past July 17 at the Mexican Business 20 (B20) Summit, the World Economic Forum launched a new public private partnership initiative entitled the Green Growth Action Alliance, with Mexican President Felipe Calderon taking the role of Honorary Chair.</p><p>The alliance aims to deploy public money to unlock and utilize private sector investment for clean energy, transport, agriculture and other green growth areas. It will feed results into key international processes such as for example the G20, the climate change international negotiations.</p><p>The alliance has defined five areas of action: it will work to promote free trade in green goods and services, to achieve robust carbon pricing across the world market, to end inefficient subsidies and other forms of fossil fuel support, to accelerate low-carbon innovation and to increase efforts to direct public funding towards the most effective mechanisms and instruments that can help leverage private investment.</p><p>Nearly fifty of the world's largest energy companies, international financial institutions, and development finance institutions have already joined the alliance.</p><p>This coalition will work closely with governments and non-governmental organizations efforts, including existing initiatives, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Energy for All initiative, the Green Climate Fund, the International Development Finance Club currently chaired by Germany's promotional bank KfW, and the San Giorgio Group ? a policy research collaborative initiative by the Climate Policy Initiative, the World Bank and the OECD. Its main objective will be to enable, support and scale up existing projects looking at achieving real impact.</p><p>Among others, the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with the members of the alliance will be supporting the piloting of new mechanisms for green infrastructure and adaptation investments in specific countries, building new innovative financing models for green infrastructure which leverage private sector finance, identified through work in Mexico, India, Kenya, and Vietnam, among others.</p><p>Unlocking private finance</p><p>Concretely, as an example, it will assist Mexico in unlocking private finance for investments in businesses and technologies that will help achieve its legal requirement to reduce green house gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020. In partnership with governments, the alliance will identify key green growth initiatives, design strategies to overcome these obstacles, and draw in private investment.</p><p>In Kenya, the forum has already been working with the national government, international and local businesses to help them understand what are the various bottlenecks to the deployment of private finance of clean energy at scale and work collaboratively to design and develop potential solutions.</p><p>The Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who is also chairing the G20 this year, said, 'The G20 Mexican Presidency welcomes this initiative and supports its efforts to define the practical steps business can take, in partnership with government, to deliver the green growth agenda. The Alliance will also play an important role in tracking our progress in leveraging private finance for green growth.'</p><p>Brindusa Fidanza is associate director and deputy head of Climate Change Initiatives at the World Economic Forum where she engages governments, the private sector and development institutions in collaborative approaches to designing public-private financing mechanisms that unlock low-carbon markets in developing countries. She is currently leading Green Investment initiative work in several African countries. She is also a contributor to the World Economic Forum's Sustainable Competitiveness Index and represents its low-carbon work in inter-governmental preparatory meetings such as for the Clean Energy Ministerial and the G20.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:560H-3YJ1-JCBN-5479-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 28, 2012 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

To go forward, Congress needs to confront the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America is mired in a tarpit of accumulated law. Reformers propose new laws to fix health care, schools and the regulatory system, but almost never suggest cleaning out the legal swamp these institutions operate in. These complex legal tangles not only set goals but allocate resources and dictate the minutest details of how to meet those goals. Most are obsolete in whole or part.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nothing important can get fixed without remaking a coherent legal framework.</p><p>The flaw is not one that can be solved by deregulation. Almost no one, for example, would disagree about the need to provide education for disabled children. But a special education law, enacted in 1975, was structured as an open-ended mandate, and soon spun out of control. Today, special ed consumes 20 percent of the total K-12 budget in America. Programs for gifted children get less than half of one percent, and pre-K education gets almost nothing. Is this a sensible allocation of education dollars? No one is even asking the question.</p><p>Congress treats most laws as if they were the Ten Commandments - except they're more like the 10 million commandments. Most legislative programs do not codify timeless principles of right and wrong. They are tools of social management. These laws allocate social resources - almost 70 percent of federal revenue in 2010 was consumed by three entitlement programs enacted a half century or more ago. Congress almost never goes back to rationalize these programs. Running government today is like trying to run a business using every idea every manager ever had.</p><p>There are four problems caused by the accumulation of old law:</p><p>Too much law causes paralysis. Over the past century laws have piled up, like sediment in the harbor, until it's almost impossible to do anything sensibly. Building a \"green infrastructure,\" for example, is stymied by environmental processes that sometimes consume upwards of a decade.</p><p>Laws have unintended consequences. Things never work out as planned. Sometimes a well-meaning idea, such as special education, ends up undermining other important goals.</p><p>Priorities change. The more specific a law, the faster it becomes obsolete. In the 1930s, when many farmers were struggling, Congress enacted farm subsidies. The crisis ended by 1941. Now, 70 years later, farm prices are at record highs, and much of farming is done by corporations. But the farm subsidies continue - $15 billion in 2010.</p><p>Fixing what ails America is impossible, indeed illegal, without a legal spring cleaning. The goal is not mainly to \"deregulate\" but to restate programs in light of current needs and priorities.</p><p>As a practical matter, this requires Congress to authorize special commissions to make proposals, area by area. Using the base closing commission model, these proposals would be submitted to Congress for an up or down vote.</p><p>Going forward, Congress should incorporate sunset provisions in all laws with budgetary impact. The goal is not to end good programs but to impose a discipline that is essential for a functioning democracy that must constantly make tough tradeoffs.</p><p>Accumulated law is not a problem our founders anticipated. They made it hard to enact new laws, thinking they would thereby protect the open field of freedom against too much legal interference. But 200 years later, the land of the free is a legal swamp. It's hard to dredge, because those same checks and balances apply to repealing a law - with one additional impediment. Once a law is enacted, it is immediately surrounded by an army of special interests. Not one word can be changed until a majority of Congress has run a gauntlet of special interests, flogging each member with campaign funding. That's why changing old law is so politically difficult as to be unthinkable.</p><p>\"The difficulty lies not in the new ideas,\" John Maynard Keynes observed, \"but in escaping from the old ones.\" American government is trapped in structures of its own making. The essential first step in rescuing America is a spring-cleaning. It's hard to fix things until we can make fresh choices.</p><p>Philip K.

But it turned out there was nothing much to treat because the water quality was really good.\"</p><p>Then he began delving into a technology called rainwater harvesting, where rain is collected from relatively clean surfaces such as rooftops, rocks or the ground and stored for later use.</p><p>In 2001, Han set up the Rainwater Research Center, a first of its kind here, at SNU where he teaches civil and environmental engineering. He has since then been advising central and local governments in Korea and proving free consultations for agencies and institutions in water-scarce developing countries to help them adopt the method.</p><p>According to the professor, rainwater harvesting is the \"most affordable yet far-reaching solution\" to many water-related problems compared with other alternatives like groundwater extraction and seawater desalination, especially in countries with seasonal thunderstorms and torrential downpours such as Korea.</p><p>\"Currently, when it rains all cities let it run off into the street. But when dry weather is prolonged they struggle with water shortages and pump billions of dollars into expensive systems that sometimes do harm to the environment,\" Han said.</p><p>\"We should change the urban planning system to save rainwater and reuse it later, which will help us cut costs and ensure water security while protecting the environment and improving landscapes.\"</p><p>Rain is a clean, salt-free source of water that contains a slew of ingredients crucial for life, including such minerals as sulfur and potash and other beneficial microorganisms.</p><p>Rainwater harvesting has been widely used over some 4,000 years, chiefly in arid regions such as the Middle East and Africa, providing water for drinking, farming, livestock, gardening, toilets, laundry and other uses.</p><p>The method has in recent years reemerged as a cheap, easy way of saving water in the face of global warming, relentless development and subsequent desertification.</p><p>Han is particularly setting his sights on rooftops as the prime catchment tool as they are less contaminated, easier to collect rainwater from and closer to people than other sources.</p><p>Once it rains, the water is then transferred through gutters, downspouts and pipes to a storage tank, either belowground or above, which is equipped with biofilms or another simple purification system.

The series will also introduce the increasing efforts of major advanced countries to promote a green economy. - Ed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global community is currently facing two of the greatest challenges in recent history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global financial crisis demands an immediate response from leaders around the world. At the same time, climate change has become one of the key elements on the international community's agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The financial crisis requires action that is both collective and immediate, but this shouldn't mean that the environment is sidelined by the economy. Instead of compartmentalizing the interests of big business and environmentalists, the economic crisis could offer an opportunity for nations to develop more environmentally friendly initiatives.</p><p>In October 2008, the United Nations Environment Program announced the Global Green New Deal, an economic initiative created as \"an antidote to current economic woes and as a springboard to a low-carbon, low-impact, high-job and better-managed global economy.\"</p><p>The Green New Deal proposal asks countries to seize the global financial crisis as an opportunity to redevelop their economies by encouraging environmentally-friendly investment. In this approach, the environment and the economy become mutually beneficial to a nation's prosperity.</p><p>Achim Steiner, U.N. Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director, said that transformative ideas and decisions such as the Green New Deal are needed before it is too late to act on climate change. \"The alternative is more boom and bust cycles, (and) a climate-stressed world,\" he said. </p><p>Responding to the financial crisis</p><p>Since the announcement of the Green New Deal, a number of countries have included green infrastructure investments in their stimulus package responses to the global financial crisis.</p><p>The United States, Korea, Japan and China have been at the forefront of countries investing in green jobs and green infrastructure. In the United States, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>plans to invest $150 billion in clean energy. In January, Japan also announced that it hopes to expand its green business market and create up to one million new jobs.</p><p>Strong political decisions like these are an indicator that the global community is ready to tackle the environment and the economy together.</p><p>\"Investments in clean-tech and renewable energy can not only counter recession and unemployment but can also set the stage for more sustainable economic recovery and growth in the 21st century,\" Steiner said.</p><p>One country that has not responded with the same fervor is Australia.</p><p>In 2007, Australia became one of the last countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At a domestic level, Australia is also one of the world's top greenhouse gas emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal for its electricity.</p><p>Although the government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has acknowledged the need to tackle climate change, this has not been reflected in Australia's own stimulus package response to the economic crisis.</p><p>Despite significant controversy from the major parties, the Rudd government's $42 billion stimulus package was approved by the Senate on Feb. 14, 2009. Since then the stimulus package has received mixed responses from the Australian Greens Party and other leading political and media commentators.</p><p>Part of the criticism is based on the package's limited attempt to use the opportunity to invest in environmentally-friendly projects, unlike other countries who have embraced the \"Green New Deal.\" Only $3.9 billion of the total stimulus package will be spent on the environment. This money will go towards the Energy Efficient Homes project, which aims to reduce energy consumption in 3 million Australian homes by providing rebates for ceiling insulation.</p><p>\"This scheme is part of the Rudd government's commitment to comprehensive action on energy efficiency - action to help tackle climate change and the economy and help create more green jobs,\" Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Arts Peter Garrett said.</p><p>However, what could have been an opportunity to create real change in Australia's environmental policy has evolved to little more than a short-sighted solution. Beyond the Energy Efficient Homes project, the stimulus package neglects to encourage environmentally-friendly investment. Instead, the central tenet of the Rudd government's stimulus package is that a total of $11 billion is being deposited into the pockets of Australians earning under $100, 000 per year, who are then expected to feed this back into the local economy.</p><p>But this is not necessarily helpful for the environment or the long-term outlook for the economy. ANZ Senior Economist Katie Dean told the Australian Broadcasting Commission, \"I think that this package will provide some offset, but I don't think it's going to completely avert a further slowdown in the Australian economy.\"</p><p>The Australian Greens Party, who have long been a force in pressing the government to act on climate change issues, argued that the time frame in which the package was considered was too short and should have allowed for greater scrutiny and public participation in the process. \"Overall, it is a missed opportunity to put in place the key investments for Australia to meet the urgent challenges of climate change,\" Greens Senator Bob Brown said. </p><p>Reducing carbon emissions</p><p>Despite this missed opportunity, the Australian government has had a policy on climate change for just over a year. This policy is based on a three-tiered approach of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to unavoidable climate change, and helping shape a global solution.</p><p>The policy approach has been shaped by advice from a range of scientific reviews and industry leaders. In particular, the Garnaut Climate Change Review has been an important source of input for the government's thinking.</p><p>However, since the announcement of Australia's key climate change initiatives, critics have charged decision-makers with not doing enough. In December 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd introduced his Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 60 percent of 2000 levels by 2050. This action directly addresses the first policy tier: reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>By placing a tangible cost on carbon pollution, the scheme aims to encourage major polluting businesses to curb their emissions. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper states that Australia's commitment of a 5-15 per cent reduction by 2020 is a realistically attainable and credible commitment to the global effort. The revenue generated from the carbon pollution tax will go toward creating jobs in solar energy, wind farms and geothermal energy.</p><p>As Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy, the government is hesitant to offer a more ambitious policy. The white paper states that Australia faces a relatively greater structural adjustment task to move toward a low-emission future than many other developed countries.</p><p>In light of this, Rudd argues that the targets are both appropriate and responsible. \"They strike the right balance between tackling climate change and supporting our economy and jobs during this global recession.\"</p><p>However, Rudd has been criticized for neglecting to take enough action to minimize Australia's dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, chief climate change advisor Professor Garnaut said that the Rudd government has aimed too low in its targets and should have offered a more ambitious policy. He argued that although Australia may find the transition to a more environmentally-friendly economy difficult, it needs to take immediate effective action.</p><p>The Greens Party also said that the government should follow the recommendations of Garnaut's Review, rather than avoiding action with more political rhetoric. \"It is essential that the government admits that it has got the scheme completely wrong, and immediately review its weak targets and its shocking bias and generosity to the big polluters,\" Greens Senator Christine Milne said.</p><p>Working with the global community</p><p>Although the Rudd government has established some targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, global standards and global agreements are also necessary to accelerate progress in addressing the threats of climate change.</p><p>The issue of climate change is not restricted by geographical borders and demands a new approach to international cooperation. The Rudd government has identified the importance of this in its third climate change policy tier - helping to shape a global solution.</p><p>The current international response to preventing climate change is framed by the Kyoto Protocol, which will expire in 2012.</p><p>The Kyoto Protocol aims to combat global warming and climate change by encouraging countries to agree to greenhouse gas emission reductions. In December this year, Australia will meet with other countries at the Copenhagen Climate Conference to develop a replacement protocol.</p><p>Australia demonstrated its commitment to working with the global community on addressing climate change when it finally ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2008. </p><p>Minister for Climate Change and Water Senator Penny Wong said that the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol enabled Australian businesses to access the multi-billion-dollar carbon trading market that exists internationally. \"Emissions trading gives us a much greater capacity to add momentum to the global carbon market,\" she said.</p><p>However, Australia's failure to make a concrete commitment to strong carbon reduction targets until 2008 could hinder its capacity to shape a global solution at Copenhagen this year.</p><p>If Australia hopes to play a pivotal role in defining the global response to climate change, it needs to offer more than just policy announcements and target reductions. The three tiers of Australia's climate change policy approach seem sound enough but stronger steps to enforce action, rather than more unnecessary rhetoric, are required if Australia wants to shape a global solution and take meaningful steps in tackling climate change.</p><p>The government's stimulus package was a good opportunity for Australia to take a more inclusive approach to the financial and environmental crises. However, the package has so far provided more political expediency than action.</p><p>The carbon reduction scheme is another example of the Australian government tiptoeing and back-pedaling around the climate change dilemma, despite advice from environmentalists that stronger action is needed.</p><p>In the future, the Australian government needs to show its voters and the global community that it is willing to address the issue of climate change with pragmatic actions and clearer policies. The government needs to begin by shifting from yesterday's economic dependence on fossil fuels to a nation based on renewable energy and a more sustainable approach to managing both the economy and environment.</p><p>By Jessica Carter and Kelly Royds</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VRP-TX80-Y9SF-60N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1846\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 22, 2009 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Business &amp;

King Mohammed VI of Morocco has dispatched several envoys here to discuss a partnership.</p><p>Paraguay's Tourism Minister, Liz Rosanna Cramer Campos, is visiting Seoul this week to look into the matter with Shim.</p><p>\"Water security emerged as a global issue because climate change has likely prompted extreme weather conditions that come with droughts, floods and water shortages even in rich countries,\" Shim said.</p><p>\"The project would help the countries raise a safeguard against recurrent floods and boost tourism revenue.\"</p><p>By Shin Hyon-hee (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:heeshin@heraldm.com\">heeshin@heraldm.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:540J-H251-DYX6-B0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>October 10, 2011 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRAQ</classCode><className>GREEN GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0TN</classCode><className>WATER CRISES &amp;

The movement has been listed in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and many developing countries have localized the movement for their own national campaigns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following the launch of the campaign in the 1970s, Korea's economy grew at a rapid pace. It is now ranked as the 14th largest in the world, and the country will host the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite all these achievements, Korea has faced a variety of growing global challenges caused by environmental changes, and so we must adopt green growth as a 'second' New Community Movement.</p><p>Today the world is faced with various environmental threats such as climate change, and the depletion of fossil fuels and natural resources, which undermines growth potential. Such global issues as energy problems and environmental issues are closely inter-linked, and the world has begun to put more weight on the latter. Taking a close look at the instability of the global financial market that triggered the global economic crisis, its fundamental cause can be found, in part, from the previous growth model which relied heavily on the consumption of carbon-based resources even in the face of economic slowdowns and environmental challenges.</p><p>Korea is not an exception. Environmental problems have a direct impact on the country \u00a1\u00a9 over the past century, the average temperature here has risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius, far higher than the world's average of 0.74 of a degree. In addition, Korea's economic structure is highly vulnerable to the ever-worsening energy-resources crisis; the country imports 97 percent of its total energy, among which 83 percent is fossil fuel. Korea, the 10th largest emitter of global warming gases in the world, also still depends on energy-intensive industries such as heavy chemical processing.</p><p>Furthermore, Korea's GDP growth has fallen from 7-9 percent to around 4 percent over the past two decades, showing that the energy-gulping industrial structure can no longer drive economic growth. Under these circumstances, Korea needs new growth engines along with a new vision and strategies for sustainable growth. The new growth engines are necessary to turn this environmental crisis into a new opportunity,</p><p>At a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of South Korea on Aug. 15, 2008, President Lee Myung-bak announced a new national vision of 'Low Carbon, Green Growth' that is seeking to transform the existing industrial structure to a low-carbon one and to establish a virtuous circle between economic development and environmental preservation. Since the announcement, the government has been making its utmost efforts to activate green growth. All Koreans are encouraged to join hands for the success of green growth as the second New Community Movement.</p><p>In July 2009, Korea charted the National Strategy and Five-Year Plan for Green Growth, which integrates and specifies green growth-related policy goals and tasks. The plan includes investing 2 percent of Korea's annual GDP or $83.6 billion from 2009 through 2013 in green infrastructure and R&amp;D for green technologies.</p><p>Also, the government set a mid-term target of reducing 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions on a BAU basis by 2020, evidencing its strong commitment toward a low-carbon society. Showing its \"Me First\" attitude to the world, Korea's voluntary action proved its genuine drive toward green growth at the 15th Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. It also provided a new momentum to break long-stalled global negotiations on GHG emission mitigation.</p><p>More notably, Korea enacted the Basic Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth based on the government's new philosophy.</p><p>The country was the first in the world to enact a law on green growth and intends to transform itself into a low-carbon society, promoting a green lifestyle and building public-private partnerships for such growth.</p><p>More specifically, the government will make its industrial structure greener through intensive nurturing of green projects, technologies and eco-companies.</p><p>Certified parties will benefit from various incentives such as tax benefits, financial support, and priority in R&amp;D investment. In addition, in accordance with the Basic Act, Korea will start a GHG mitigation target monitoring system and has recently established a Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center. It will also expand green buildings and promote green consumption and transportation for the purpose of encouraging an eco-friendly lifestyle among its citizens.</p><p>Climate change directly affects water, which is vital for national security since there are no alternatives, unlike other energy resources. If the 20th century was the era of \"black gold,' the 21st century will be the era of \"blue gold.'</p><p>Water resources are getting high prominence on the agenda of global society. Korea does not favorable conditions for water management - it is listed as a water-stressed nation and its climatic conditions put rather huge obstacles in the way.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the government initiated the Four-Major-River Restoration Project in 2009. The project is designed to secure abundant clean water resources and to tackle climate change. It is a representative 'Green Deal' project aimed at increasing water supply and at the same time restoring the vitality and productivity of the four major rivers.</p><p>First, the project will secure abundant water resources in the face of ever-worsening shortages. While Korea's annual precipitation of 1,245mm is higher than the world's average of 880mm, due to being a densely populated in a small country, its annual per capita rainfall is only one eighth of the world's average.</p><p>Moreover, 70 percent of Korea's rainfall - concentrated in June to September - quickly flows into the ocean because 65 percent of the land is made up of mountains. In order to respond to these climatic conditions, the project aims at securing 1.3 billion tons of additional water resources through the construction of 16 weirs and the dredging of rivers.</p><p>Second, abundant water resources will restore the vitality of the four major rivers. The Ministry of Environment has made great efforts to improve the water quality of rivers, but the nation still has a shortage of water.</p><p>The restoration project puts the first priority on increasing water supply - the government will invest 3.9 trillion won in environmental infrastructures and phosphorous treatment facilities. According to the National Institute of Environmental Research, when the project is completed, the share of 'good' water where children can swim will rise to 86 percent in 2012 from the current 76 percent.</p><p>Third, the project is a key component of Korea's efforts to adapt to climate change. Until today, Korea has suffered damage from frequent floods and droughts, which have caused 2.7 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in damages since 2000.</p><p>More specifically, the number of days with more than 100mm of heavy rainfall has increased 1.7-times in just two decades. The ongoing climate change will continue to cause water quality degradation, a lack of drinking water, property losses and disturbances to the aquatic ecosystem. The project will enhance Korea's capacity for the stable management of water resources, thereby helping it better cope with water-related national disasters.</p><p>Lastly, the project seeks to restore the vitality of the four rivers along with their surrounding environment. Under the project, valuable riparian wetlands will be protected and a total of 113 new wetlands will be created to enhance the ecological function of the rivers. Also, to restore the habitats of wild plants and animals, 929km of national streams will be transformed into ecological streams, and 120 local streams, 20 urban streams and brooks will undergo ecological restoration.</p><p>Today, Korea's green growth model is drawing attention from the global community as a workable solution for sustainable development. At the initiative of Korea, the Declaration on Green Growth was adopted at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in June 2009; and the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) published the Overview of the Republic of Korea's Green Growth Strategy in April, 2010, which highly assessed Korea as a country to lead green growth in the world.</p><p>Also, the report highlights that thanks to the government's systematic and bold investment in green infrastructure, Korea has become the only OECD country to record positive economic growth in the first quarter of 2009 on a quarter-on-quarter basis and recorded the highest economic growth of 2.3 percent in the second quarter of the same year.</p><p>More recently, at the World Economic Forum on East Asia held in June, 2010, Korea was recognized as a 'green tiger' leading global green growth. As such, the global community, including Asia, is acknowledging the country's green growth model as a way to turn this economic crisis into an opportunity for development.</p><p>The green wave, which stems from Korea, can spread across the world, but this cannot be achieved by the government alone as it requires the understanding and participation of the entire corporate sector and the general public.</p><p>Korea's vision of green growth needs to lead to a second Saemaeul Undong, which can lay the firm foundation to overcome challenges and social obstacles through the combined efforts of all the people who can ultimately turn them into an opportunity for a new takeoff.</p><p>The movement was aimed at bringing prosperity by sharing the burden of neighbors not only for today's generation but also for the next one. As the movement gained momentum and grew as a nationwide campaign involving every citizen, it contributed to upgrading Korea into the ranks of advanced nations.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Environment initiated the \"Green Start Campaign\" so that green growth can take root as the second Saemaeul Undong. Businesses, government agencies and academia have jointly established a nationwide network and disseminated specific guidelines for green lifestyles such as green driving.</p><p>A green lifestyle greatly contributes to curbing GHG emissions and also preventing climate change-driven environmental problems, which threaten the existence of human beings.</p><p>The Korean government initiated the Green Start Campaign consisting of two networks. One is the Green Start National Network, comprising 40 institutions that manage local networks and gather the opinions of the member organizations. The other is the Green Start Local Networks made up of 224 local governments among a total of 248. Local governments and 5,000 organizations including public agencies, businesses, schools and civic groups are joining the Green Start Campaign.</p><p>Currently, the campaign is promoting 10 guidelines that can easily be applied to our daily life. Among them, first, the campaign encourages households to maintain temperatures of 26\u00a1\u00c9 or above during summer and 20\u00a1\u00c9 or below during winter, to replace conventional light bulbs with energy-saving ones and to keep appliances unplugged when they are not in use.</p><p>Second, the campaign encourages office-workers to wear clothes appropriate for the seasons, turn off lights and air conditioners during lunchtime and to re-use scrap paper for printing and copying.</p><p>Third, the campaign encourages retail shops to keep energy-saving guidelines, use energy-saving lights and recommend customers to use eco-friendly goods.</p><p>Fourth, the campaign asks construction firms to reduce air pollution and noise during work and build temporary offices suitable for energy-saving.</p><p>Fifth, the campaign calls for a green campus where lights are turned off when lecture rooms are not used and students use mugs instead of disposable paper cups.</p><p>With the Green Start Campaign, Korea wants the green revolution to take root in daily life. Furthermore, Korea will contribute to making the world greener so that the mankind and our planet Earth can coexist in harmony.</p><p>Based on the foundation that Korea has laid for green growth so far, Korea will make a leap forward in green growth in 2010. Korea should implement green growth policies and plans in a consistent and effective manner, thereby benefiting from tangible outcomes.</p><p>The public sector alone cannot not carry out this significant task - like the Saemaeul Undong, the government should take the lead and, at the same time, work together with all citizens as well as the business community.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YV4-H8F1-2R6X-100M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2100\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>June 30, 2010 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

'I believe Songdo is the best location for the GCF because it represents Korea's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. You can see Korea's future in Songdo.'</p><p>The fund's 24-board member, equally split between developed and developing countries, will gather in Songdo, Thursday to pick the host of the GCF, envisioned to finance global efforts to cope with climate change. Songdo is competing with Bonn and Geneva, among others, to host the global fund.</p><p>Their selection will be endorsed at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference, which will take place in Doha, Qatar, from Nov. 26 to Dec. 7.</p><p>The GCF will play a central role in supporting projects, programs, policies and other activities in developing countries to fight global warming. Hosting the fund has a significant meaning for Korea, which has become a unique example for developing and underdeveloped nations in preparing for the era of 'green growth,' Song said.</p><p>'After rising from the ashes of the Korean War (1950-53), Korea showed its unstoppable determination for growth and development that culminated in the Miracle on the Han River,' the mayor said. 'Based on the experience, it is now creating a new success story on fighting climate change and energy depletion.'</p><p>Songdo represents Korea's vision of green growth and globalization. Its concept is a smart and green city, designed to provide the best environment for businesspeople from around the world as well as comfortable living conditions for them and their families.</p><p>Bridging role</p><p>Korea has made remarkable strides since declaring green growth as a national vision.</p><p>The country moved quickly under a comprehensive national plan to transform the nation into an economy powered by top-notch green technologies.</p><p>The development of green technologies and the establishment of a green infrastructure across a wide range of industries are creating a virtuous cycle in which both environmental protection and economic growth are pursued together.</p><p>Officials here hope the country's new vision will achieve harmony between the economy and the environment while tackling climate change and environmental challenges by enhancing resource efficiency and securing innovative new growth engines.</p><p>'It's time to support emerging and developing countries in their efforts to create and implement national and local-level strategies, policies and institutional mechanisms for green growth,' said Cho Myung-woo, Incheon's vice mayor for administrative affairs.</p><p>'The top priority should be on reducing poverty, creating job opportunities as well as achieving social development that are environmentally sustainable and secure.'</p><p>Cho said Korea should host the GCF because it has played a bridging role between developed and developing countries in narrowing differences in mapping out such roadmap.</p><p>In 2010, Korea opened the Global Green Growth Institute in Seoul to drive global green growth. By leading the international campaign for green growth, the country looks to bridge developed and developing countries in coping with climate change.</p><p>'Korea has increased its role in fighting climate change in line with the global paradigm shift toward \u00a1\u00aegreen economies' with its own multi-billion-dollar project to develop clean energy sources and eco-friendly technologies,' Cho said.</p><p>'On the global stage, it is playing a bridging role between developed and developing economies in preparing for the emerging economic trend. That makes Songdo the perfect location for the GCF, which will tackle challenges for both developed and developing countries,' he said.</p><p>Incheon expects green finance to be a core enabler of sustainability in the era of green growth. If companies want to be committed to sustainability or green growth, they should have the necessary expertise, practical tools and financial solution to achieve the strategies.</p><p>The transition to low-carbon growth will also bring many opportunities for businesses. An increasing number of companies are expected to place 'sustainable finance' at the core of their business strategies by managing sustainability risks while seeking new opportunities. In taking this path, they will seek opportunities to advance into the low carbon, energy financing markets, officials said.</p><p>'Economy-wide initiatives have been introduced to transform the country's system of securing resources, its practice of utilizing energy and power generation. Green initiatives are also at work in industries, agriculture, forestry, land use, buildings and transportation,' the vice mayor said.</p><p>'By hosting the GCF, Incheon will pursue a smooth transition to a greener and more energy-efficient economy making use of a greater share of renewable and clean energy with a lesser dependence on fossil fuels,' he added.</p><p>He said both developed and emerging economies should work under a shared goal to address global warming.</p><p>Smart, green city</p><p>Korea has already agreed with many African and Southeast Asian countries to promote exchanges of green growth technologies. They have agreed on the transfer of such technologies and launching joint eco-tourism and biomass energy projects in a bid to help resolve global environmental issues and contribute to the creation of green markets.</p><p>'Incheon wants to take fundamental measures with the rest of the world to prepare for a paradigm shift in the global economy,' Mayor Song said. 'We are ready to participate in global efforts to fight climate change and play a bridging role between advanced and emerging countries in preparing for the new trend.'</p><p>I-Tower, where the GCF office would be housed, is an eco-friendly building tailored for international organizations.</p><p>Incheon has set a voluntary target to reduce carbon emissions to 38 percent below projected levels by 2020. Under the initiative, the city plans to set up guidelines for construction and public transportation firms to drastically cut carbon emissions; provide administrative and financial support for firms to help develop renewable energy sources to decrease energy dependence on oil and enhance disaster control systems.</p><p>It has built a sewage recycling system and one of the largest pneumatic waste collection systems in the world to achieve the goals of reusing 40 percent of waste water and 76 percent of other wastes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56WN-R0M1-JCBN-52N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>October 16, 2012 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>UNITED NATIONS ECONOMIC &amp;

Korea is now rapidly emerging as a green growth power with comprehensive national and international initiatives.</p><p>Officials here hope the country's new vision will achieve harmony between the economy and the environment while tackling climate change and environmental challenges by enhancing resource efficiency and securing innovative new growth engines.</p><p>Economy-wide initiatives have been introduced to transform the country's system of securing resources, its practice of utilizing energy and power generation.

This series is part of special reports marking the 56th anniversary of The Korea Herald on Aug. 15. - Ed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Lee Sun-young</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Green finance has become the latest buzzword of major financial firms in Korea, after the government set out one year ago on an ambitious plan to build a low-carbon green economy.</p><p>Many institutions are rushing to introduce \"green financial products,\" and CEOs speak of their commitment to providing financial support to environment-friendly technologies and industries.</p><p>Yet, much of this is no more than hype, and green finance is still in its infancy in Korea, analysts said.</p><p>\"Green finance, or financial support for eco-friendly companies, has become a buzzword, but the reality is totally different,\" said Kim Pil-gyu, a research at Korea Capital Market Institute.</p><p>Financial firms talk about how they will lend to or invest in green companies, but there have been no substantial results so far, he said.</p><p>Funding green industries - be it from the private sector or the government - is hard the current environment, because projects in those areas have a lot of uncertainties and it generally takes a longer period of time to realize return on such investments, experts said.</p><p>Overwhelming emphasis</p><p>Great emphasis is placed on the role of finance as Korea rolls out a barrage of policies under the government's much-hyped \"Green New Deal.\" The measures are aimed at killing two birds with one stone - pulling the local economy out of the impact of a global recession and securing new engines for future economic growth at the same time.</p><p>The government plans to spend 12 trillion won ($9.8 billion) over the next three to four years to develop green technologies that officials hope will form the backbone of Korea's economy, creating half a million jobs.</p><p>It aims to build a regional hub of green finance in Korea, with the establishment of Asia's largest carbon emissions trading exchange in 2011.</p><p>\"In order to achieve green growth, we need to change the finance (industry) first,\" Jin Dong-soo, the chairman of the Financial Services Commission said.</p><p>Alternative energy industries, the carbon emissions trading market and other environmental-friendly businesses can grow only when financing is sufficient and secure, he said. </p><p>The \"Basic Act on Green Growth\" is currently pending at the National Assembly and has an article on the promotion of green finance.</p><p>It stipulates that the government should secure funding to foster green industries, support the development of green financial products and boost private investment for green infrastructure.</p><p>Under a roadmap released last month, the government plans to introduce a certification system to approve green technologies and projects, and verify companies involved in green growth-related projects as \"green enterprises\" if they qualify for government's requirements.</p><p>Small ventures and startups with promising green business outlook will access fiscal funds exclusive for them, which will be expanded from 60 billion won in 2009 to 1.1 trillion won in 2013.</p><p>Credit guarantees offered to \"green enterprises\" and green projects will also be increased almost three-fold from 2.8 trillion won in 2009 to 7 trillion won in 2013.</p><p>Also, a \"green fund\" worth 500 billion won will be formed by the state-run Korea Development Bank and National Pension Fund in the second half of this year, along with long-term deposit products and \"green bonds\" launched by banks to attract private investors. The government will grant tax incentives on capital gains: No tax on dividends up to 30 million won, among others, it said. </p><p>Private initiatives</p><p>In April, financial companies, academics and government officials launched the Green Finance Council, to seek ways to contribute to the development of prospective technologies and companies in alternative energy and environmentally-friendly sectors.</p><p>\"The council aims to play the role of a financial expert and partner for the government, helping it form a national strategy on green growth,\" said Korea Federation of Banks Chairman Shin Dong-gyu, who was tapped to head the new body as its first president.</p><p>The council will meet every quarter, setting agendas for green finance, and then its working body will undertake research and carry out various projects, involved officials said.</p><p>As its first undertaking, a group of experts will identify tasks on the side of finance in order to achieve green growth. It hopes to release a paper on the issue by September.</p><p>Commercial banks are most active in the green drive, introducing special loan deals and saving products.</p><p>Kookmin Bank, the largest commercial lender by asset, started selling \"green bike insurance\" in June in line with the government's plan to nurture the local bicycle industry. The product, developed by Samsung Fire and Marine Insurance Co., is designed to cover policyholders from any damage from accidents or theft.</p><p>The state-run Industrial Bank of Korea has made it a goal to lend 1 trillion won to growth-related enterprises. It has granted loans worth over 600 billion won as of the end of July. The lender also launched a green one-year deposit product that promises annual interest of up to 4 percent, while donating a portion of the deposit amount to green-growth related institutions. </p><p>Woori Bank has special loan programs for companies in the solar power and LED fields, which are both seen as promising businesses in the green economy.</p><p>(<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:milaya@heraldm.com\">milaya@heraldm.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WCB-80G0-Y9SF-600T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 13, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLON</classCode><className>CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Korea also has emphasized the development of such policies. Green growth is an economic paradigm that simultaneously pursues growth and environmental improvement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Basically, the policies pursue economic growth and job creation through R&amp;D investments in clean energy and green technology. The policies also encourage the conservation and efficient use of energy and resources, which mitigates climate change and environmental degradation. More specifically, the development of green technology leads to the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) which leads to energy efficiency, clean energy production and the recycling of resources.</p><p>Green finance supports green growth by supplying capital to companies and the development of green technology. Conceptually, green finance refers to financial activities that enhance the financial industry, improve the environment and promote economic growth.</p><p>Green finance provides funding to green enterprises and technologies, creates green financial products, attracts investors, and also reviews the environmental risks during the decision-making stages of providing money.</p><p>Active green finance is necessary to develop the financial industry. Green industries based on green technology are promising growth sectors, and the government will promote green finance.</p><p>The Korean government is trying to enact a new law titled \"Basic Act on Low Carbon Green Growth.\" Based on article 28 (Promotion of Green Finance) of the proposed law, the government will establish and secure funding to foster and support green growth and industries, develop new financial products to support low-carbon green growth, boost private investment to build green infrastructure, strengthen corporate disclosure of green management, expand financing for green management businesses and set up carbon markets to promote active trading.</p><p>The green financial industry in Korea is still in the early stages of development. However, domestic financial companies already realize the significance of green finance. Many financial institutions have already participated in international initiatives on green finance such as GRI Reporting, UNEP/FI, U.N.PRI, U.N. Global Compact and CDP.</p><p>Fund allocations for green finance have started, but there is a long way to go. For example, Korea Development Bank and Korea Eximbank announced plans to provide significant policy loans to green industries, but the actual lending thus far has been below the original expectations.</p><p>There are numerous plans, but the specific processing tools for providing money have not been fully established. Also, commercial banks like KB and Shinhan Bank have launched green financial products and allocated money for environmentally friendly companies. However, the criterion for \"environment-friendly\" is not yet clear.</p><p>The Samsung Economic Research Institute developed a national competitiveness index that measures the ability to reduce carbon emissions and to develop green industries. Korea's index is below the OECD average due to insufficient renewable energy, low energy efficiency, inconsistency and ineffectiveness of environmental policies, and the lack of innovative technologies.</p><p>To develop green finance in Korea, several challenging issues lie ahead of us. I want to propose several strategies for developing green finance in Korea.</p><p>Firstly, public consensus on the need for the development of green finance must be built up. Green finance must be recognized not as a matter of choice but a necessity.</p><p>Secondly, social infrastructure such as a regulatory, technical and human infrastructure must be set up. Concerning the regulatory infrastructure, it needs to reflect environmental concerns in the statutes for investment, lending, credit rating and accounting. Also, environmental information must be released and considered as a requirement for listing and disclosure. Additionally, certification of green technology, enterprises and industry must be introduced in order to guide investments and lending. The technical infrastructure such as \"Green Enterprise Index,\" \"Green (Carbon) Risk Index\" or \"Green Enterprising Rating Agency\" will be necessary, and human resources must be trained and educated to be knowledgeable about green finance</p><p>Thirdly, more green financial products must be created with support from the government. Financial institutions can develop new products that integrate environmental factors into existing products and develop combined green financial products.</p><p>The government can help to launch a fund or provide tax benefits to green investors in the early stages. Although the government can play a key role in the beginning, it is important to note that the end goal should be a green finance system that operates on market principles.</p><p>Lastly, an emission trading system must be established. The system must promote active trading and foster specialized financial institutions and products. Additionally, a long-term plan to become Asia's green financial hub that links carbon exchanges in key Asian countries needs to be developed.</p><p>Noh Hee-jin is a senior research fellow at the Korea Capital Market Institute (KCMI) and is currently heading the division of policies and regulations at the KCMI. Since 2006, he has also been in charge of the SRI Research Unit.</p><p>He has participated in various projects such as designing the Capital Market Integration Act and adopting International Financial Reporting Standards. In 2007, he headed the Korean finance ministry's task force on hedge funds.

This is very high compared to other mills even in advanced economies not to mention of those in developing countries,\" Lee said. \"We will continue to put forth further efforts in order to evolve the Dangjin mills to become green factories envied by other players.\" Experts point out that HyundaiSteel has taken the right direction - in a contributed article to The Korea Times, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said that the shift to the eco-friendliness is inevitable in the steel industry down the road. \"For many, managing for environmental sustainability is no longer merely an option but an imperative,\" BCG project leader Ko Young-suk said. \"Volatile - and, in the long-term, rising - prices for energy and resources, together with tightening environment regulations, will affect steel makers' competitive positions.\" HyundaiSteel thinks that the Dangjin plant, built on 7.4 square kilometers of reclaimed ground about 90 kilometers south of Seoul, will boost the company's future prospects. First of all, the steel maker claims that Dangjin is at the heart of South Korea where both the marine and land transportations are very convenient. \"Most domestic steel mills are located in remote areas at the corners of the nation, thus raising their logistics expenses. In comparison, Dangjin is at the center of the country to offer cost competitiveness,\" Lee said. \"Dangjin is the only place on the West Sea where large vessels of more than 200,000 tons can dock. See why other steel makers are selecting Dangjin where up to 200 start-ups sprout up every year.\" A few other local steel manufacturers such as Dongkuk Steel and Dongbu Steel also have their production lines there. HyundaiSteel expects that the new blast furnace with an annual capacity of 4 million tons will help jack up its annual turnover to 9.2 trillion won this year, up 15.3 percent from a year before. The upward trend is expected to gain a fresh momentum late this year when another blast furnace will start cranking out steel with the same capacity. Hyundai is thinking of adding a third one in 2015. Observers point out that the blast furnaces would bring economies of scope to the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, whose flagship affiliates of Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors combined to rise to the world's No. 6 last year. Economies of scope refer to efficiencies associated with different types of products that are related to one another. HyundaiSteel contends that economies of scope will be applied to the group thanks to its unique business portfolio. \"HyundaiSteel produces iron and steel, which will be finely cold-rolled by Hyundai Hysco so that Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors can produce vehicles with them. When the cars retire, they would create steel scrap, offering raw materials for HyundaiSteel's electric arc furnaces,\" Lee said. An electric arc furnace is a furnace that melts scrap metal with an electric arc to come up with second-tier steel products while a blast furnace is one that making first-rate steel products from iron ore. There is another benefit for the country's second-largest conglomerate to enjoy. Thus far, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors have depended on steel from POSCO, the world's fourth-largest player, to secure high-quality steel to build vehicles because HyundaiSteel could not produce it with its electric arc furnaces.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Korea Times correspondent</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANGJIN - The last industry that has anything to do with \"green\" would appear to be the steel businesses because they have been constantly accused of damaging the environment while cranking out irons or steel.</p><p>But this is not the case for HyundaiSteel, which has established an eco-friendly blast furnace in Dangjin, South Chungcheong Province, designed to substantially reduce any pollutants.</p><p>In particular, it sealed 35 kilometers of conveyor belts so that raw materials on the move from seaports to storage do not cause environmental problems - they are not airtight but strong enough to prevent any leaks.</p><p>\"Thus far, steel mills have been responsible for releasing various pollutants but there have been few solutions with existing facilities,\" HyundaiSteel spokesman Lee Seung-hee said.</p><p>\"Accordingly, we came up with the idea of sealing all the conveyor belts as well as storage facilities for the first time among major steel makers across the world at huge cost.\"</p><p>HyundaiSteel, a unit of the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, spent 400 billion won for the out-of-the-box idea of sealing the conveyor belts, a substantial part of its total 6.2 trillion won to build a blast furnace and related infrastructure in Dangjin.</p><p>However, the company believes that the large investment will eventually benefit the Incheon-based firm.</p><p>\"Some raw materials are lost in transit on open-air conveyors or while storing them at yards. Our facilities can help minimize the losses to increase our competitiveness in the long run,\" Lee said.</p><p>\"Plus, we can be free from environmental disputes. As many foreign businessmen have evaluated the facilities as impressive, we may be able to offer consulting services or export the platform.\"</p><p>Iron and steel manufacturers have come under fire for the emission of harmful nitrous oxide and arsenic acid dust generated mostly in the procedure of unloading, transferring and storing raw materials.</p><p>When iron ore and coking coal are kept in open-air storages, they end up causing pollution due to wind.</p><p>In addition, Hyundai Steel funneled 130 billion won more to build eco-friendly mills including self-sufficient generators, which produce 2.67 million megawatts of electricity a year.</p><p>The four turbine generators use gases such as coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and ladle gas over the steel-making process to provide about 80 percent of the power needed to run the Dangjin plant.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YDD-5W31-2R6X-101W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"403\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>May 6, 2010 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001WKB</classCode><className>HYUNDAI CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000A1WT</classCode><className>HYUNDAI KIA AUTOMOTIVE GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423830 INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY &amp;

SACHS] One year after the financial crisis </nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEW YORK - It is now almost a year since the world economy teetered on the edge of calamity. In the span of three days, Sept. 15-17, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, the mega-insurance company AIG was taken over by the U.S. government, and the failing Wall Street icon Merrill Lynch was absorbed by Bank of America in a deal brokered and financed by the U.S. government. Panic ensued and credit stopped circulating. Non-financial companies could not get working capital, much less funding for long-term investments. A depression seemed possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the storm has broken. Months of emergency action by the world's leading central banks prevented financial markets from crashing. When banks stopped providing short-term liquidity to other banks and industrial companies, central banks filled the gap. As a result, the major economies avoided a collapse of credit and production. The sense of panic has subsided. Banks are once again lending to each other.</p><p>Although the worst was avoided, much pain remains. The crisis culminated in a collapse of asset prices at the end of 2008. Middle-class and wealthy households around the world felt poorer and therefore cut their spending sharply. Sky-high oil and food prices added to the pain, and thus to the downturn. Enterprises could not sell their output, leading to production cuts and layoffs. Rising unemployment compounded the loss of household wealth, throwing families into deep economic peril and leading to further cutbacks in consumer spending.</p><p>The big problem now is that unemployment continues to rise in the U.S. and Europe, because growth is too slow to create enough new jobs. Dislocations are still being felt around the world.</p><p>A huge debate has ensued around the so-called \"stimulus spending\" in the U.S., Europe, and China. Stimulus spending aims to use higher government outlays or tax incentives to offset the decline in household consumption and business investment. In the U.S., for example, roughly one-third of the $800-billion two-year stimulus package comprises tax cuts (to stimulate consumer spending); one-third is public outlays on roads, schools, power, and other infrastructure; and one-third takes the forms of federal transfers to state and local governments for health care, unemployment insurance, school salaries, and the like.</p><p>Stimulus packages are controversial, because they increase budget deficits, and thus imply the need to cut spending or raise taxes sometime in the near future. The question is whether they successfully boost output and jobs in the short term, and, if so, whether they do enough to compensate for the inevitable budget problems down the road.</p><p>The true effectiveness of these packages is not clear. Suppose that the government gives a tax cut in order to increase consumers' take-home pay. If consumers expect that their taxes will rise in the future, they may decide to save the tax cut rather than boost consumption. In that case, the stimulus will have little positive effect on household spending, but will worsen the budget deficit.</p><p>An early assessment of the stimulus packages suggests that China's program has worked well. The sharp fall in China's exports to the U.S. has been compensated by a sharp rise in the Chinese government's spending on infrastructure - say, on subway construction in China's biggest cities.</p><p>In the U.S., the verdict is less clear. The tax cut has probably been saved rather than spent. The infrastructure component has not yet been spent because of long lags in turning the U.S. stimulus package into real construction projects. The third part - the transfer to state and local governments - almost surely has been successful in maintaining spending on schools, health, and the unemployed.</p><p>In short, the U.S. stimulus effects on spending have probably been positive but small, and without a decisive effect on the economy. Moreover, concerns about the enormous U.S. budget deficit, now running at $1.8 trillion (12 perent of GNP) per year, are bound to increase, not only creating enormous uncertainties in politics and financial markets, but also dimming consumer confidence as households focus their attention on potential future budget cuts and tax increases. The U.S. has reached the practical limits of reliance on short-term stimulus spending, and will need to start cutting the budget deficit and fostering alternative pathways to growth.</p><p>When the crisis deepened a year ago, Barrack Obama introduced into the presidential campaign the theme of a \"green recovery,\" based on a surge of investment in renewable energies, new electric vehicles, environmentally efficient \"green\" buildings, and ecologically sound agriculture. In the heat of the battle against financial panic, policy attention turned away from that green recovery. Now the U.S. needs to return to this important idea.</p><p>Debt-burdened consumers in the U.S. and Europe will limit their spending for years to come as they rebuild their wealth and pension assets. But the resulting economic slack gives us the historic opportunity - and need - to compensate for low consumer spending with increased investment spending on sustainable technologies.</p><p>Government policies in the U.S. and other rich countries should stimulate those investments through special incentives. These include a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions, subsidies for research and development on sustainable technologies, feed-in tariffs and regulatory incentives for renewable energy, consumer subsidies and other inducements for the uptake of new \"green\" technologies, and implementation of \"green\" infrastructure programs, such as mass transit.</p><p>The rich world should also provide the poorest countries with grants and low-interest loans to buy sustainable energy technologies, such as solar and geothermal power. Doing so would add to the global recovery, improve long-term environmental sustainability, and accelerate economic development.</p><p>The crisis can yet be an opportunity to turn from a path of financial bubbles and excessive consumption to a path of sustainable development. In fact, seizing this opportunity is the only recipe for genuine growth that we have left.</p><p>Jeffrey D.

Researchers from the Korea Research Institute for Human Settlements, a state-run institute committed to studying means of enhancing the use of national territory, will deal with about two dozen themes related to formulating the territorial development strategy. - Ed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Kim Dong-ju</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two megatrends are sweeping the world: globalization and action over climate change. As the spread of free trade agreements quickens trans-border economic openings all over the world, national economies are fast being integrated into one world economy. While the role of territorial nations is diminishing, regions are gaining ever-increasing importance. In the industrialization era, regional competitiveness rested on cities and industrial towns which were central bases of population and industry. Now, with the wave of economic liberalization, high-speed transportation and communications networks, and agglomeration of economic activity and living space, city-regions have emerged as the core geographic unit for regional development. Major countries are pushing forward policies centered on vast economic zones that link large cities and their surrounding suburbs - metropolitan areas in the United States, city-regions in the United Kingdom and metropolitan regions in Germany.</p><p>As climate change is becoming a worldwide phenomenon, sustainable economic growth with less emission of greenhouse gases has emerged as a major challenge. Countries are actively promoting green growth policies to revive their economies, protect the environment and improve living standards. While being key drivers of national prosperity, cities and their suburbs are also responsible for a considerable portion of energy consumption and heat-trapping gas emissions. Therefore, metropolises and city-regions are shaping up as crucial areas in green growth efforts.</p><p>These developments require a new paradigm for territorial and regional development, capable of turning the currents of economic liberalization and climate change into new opportunities for growth. To this end, Korea needs to nurture dynamic city-regions so that its policy of mega-regional economic zones can bear fruit. City-regions which shape around key metropolises will play the driving force of regional development by forming wide-area clusters massing together population, industries and economic activity. Metropolitan areas should also be turned into the forefronts of environmentally-friendly development so that they can play a key role in an emergent green growth economy.</p><p>Development of city-regions also requires policymakers to give up the conventional thinking framed in individual cities and regions. It demands a new perspective of a network economy and a new strategy for comprehensive development interconnecting economically and geographically close cities and regions. They should be recreated into international city-regions equipped with cutting-edge technology, vibrant green industries, flourishing culture and arts, and advanced living conditions. A broadly shared consensus on the need of city-regional development should be built. Policymakers must map out strategies for development tailored to characteristics of the broader mega-economic regions they belong to.</p><p>Development directions</p><p>Following are key policy directions for Korea's efforts to develop city-regions.</p><p>1) FTA-based global economic hub: As trans-border economic liberalization speeds up, inter-regional trade will be expanded, substituting trade flows among nations. As a result, city-regions will play an increasingly important role as the center of global trade networks involving business, production and consumption. With the advent of an era of inter-regional trade, city-regions must become free economic zones and be developed into a hub of capital, human resources and information.</p><p>2) Driver of mega-regional economic development: Specialized development of city-regions and the resulting simultaneous growth of core metropolises and their suburbs will advance the government's new initiative for the \"five-plus-two\" system of mega-regional economic zones and will contribute to strengthening the nation's territorial competitiveness.</p><p>3) Low-carbon, green growth hubs: Green growth management can be carried out more effectively when a multiple of adjacent local governments work together in operating, managing and monitoring transportation, the environment, water and energy resources than when individual cities separately conduct those tasks. Integration of diverse green assets at the city-regional level will maximize their utility for environmental protection and economic growth.</p><p>4) Center of \"soft network development.\" High-speed transport and information networks have enabled people to reach anywhere in the nation within a day and are activating direct exchanges with overseas markets. These will drive a major change in the nation's residential structure into one centered on city-regions equipped with global infrastructure and high standards of living. Policymakers should abandon the \"hard space\" framework of regional policies based on the existing administrative districts and should embrace a \"soft space\" perspective, which derives regional competitiveness from city-regions' diverse networking.</p><p>Development model</p><p>To fulfill their potential as globally competitive growth hubs, city-regions must build organic networks at intra-regional, inter-regional and global levels.</p><p>At the city-regional level, new growth centers including industrial complexes and FEZs as well as education, research and infrastructure should be developed in an integrative manner so that a city-region's overall capabilities can be maximized and its specialty be promoted.</p><p>In addition, industrial and infrastructural links within mega-regional economic zones and between city-regions should be enhanced so that city-regions could serve as growth centers of the mega economic regions that they belong to.</p><p>Globally, city-regions should boost their relations with Northeast Asia and other major economic blocs in industry, transport, logistics and tourism. They should either strengthen international infrastructure including airports and seaports, or improve their accessibility to those transport hubs.</p><p>Location</p><p>In general, the location and boundaries of city-regions is determined by consideration of population distribution, geographic proximity, commuting patterns, industrial structure, functional links, and historical and cultural aspects. In addition, city-regions aspiring to become global competition hubs must have accessibility to global transport networks and feature knowledge-based facilities, such as corporate headquarters and international financial institutions.</p><p>Taking these into account, metropolitan areas - interwoven metropolises and their hinterland cities and counties - as well as groups of smaller cities or new growth bases with great potential of integrated development - can be considered as city-regions. In designating city-regions, opinions of local communities should be sufficiently reflected and the overall process should be led by the regions involved.</p><p>Rather than starting with too many city-regions, the nation needs to focus on a small number of strategic places and increase the number over time, given that city-regions should drive mega-regional growth and enhance global competitiveness.</p><p>Development strategies</p><p>1) City-regions as free economic zones: With growth of inter-regional trade, city-regions should be the center of investment, trade and business. They should become FEZs with investment and living conditions that are attractive to multinational companies and their staff. The government needs to consider deregulations and advantages in land use and taxation that are more drastic and generous than those available in existing FEZs and corporate cities. Turning city-regions into FEZs will facilitate the spread of FEZs across the nation and lay the foundation for the nation's emergence in the future as a global growth hub.</p><p>2) City-regions as IBEC industrial valleys: City-regions should have industrial competitiveness based on highly converged IBEC technologies (information technology, biotechnology, energy and environmental technology, and cultural and content technology) in connection with leading growth engine projects of mega-regional economic zones. City-regions can also utilize IBEC technologies to upgrade existing industries, resulting in the enhancement of the city-regions' overall growth basis. To nurture new, innovative industry sectors, the three-way network of business, education and research should be enhanced, business clusters should be promoted and if necessary, industrial parks devoted to those sectors should be considered.</p><p>3) City-regions as global networks: City-regions should be linked to major global destinations through high-speed transport and logistics networks such as international airports and seaports. Also, effective transport networks should be built around city-regions to interconnect mega-regional economic zones. Wide-area transport networks that link major posts such as new growth bases of city-regions will boost the nation's overall transport efficiency. Improving management of wide-area transport needs at the city-regional level is also important. Intelligent transport networks like a smart highway based on IT-ET convergence as well as low-carbon, green transportation systems should be expanded. Comprehensive policy studies are needed for more effective connections of metropolitan and national transport networks.</p><p>4) City-regions as \"smart growth\" bases: City-regions' competitiveness greatly depends on capabilities of housing, education and medical welfare services. To attract high-quality businesses and talents from overseas and improve the living standards of residents, housing, education and medical services should be upgraded. Specialty high schools and foreign schools should be established so that distinguished personnel and their families would want to live there. Regional hospitals should grow globally competitive and more medical care facilities for foreigners should be established. City-regions should extend integrated educational, medical and cultural services to rural areas. Aging industrial complexes and hinterlands of KTX high-speed rail stations should be renovated as part of development of advanced creative city-regions. Old housing, industrial towns and ports should be refurbished with improvement in terms of economy, the environment, culture and landscape so that they can contribute to city-regions' image and economic vitality. Making the best use of KTX stations' role as centers of exchanges in and outside city-regions, multifunctional facilities for business and culture and mega-regional transit systems should be built around them.</p><p>5) City-regions linked to water space: We need a new paradigm of territorial and regional policies which looks at the synergy effect of linking water and spatial development. Almost all major cities in Korea have rivers and large streams running through them. More attention should be directed to water space-linked city-regional and mega-regional development. Both public-interest and economic functions of waterfront should be delivered by positioning public facilities, museums and galleries there. Historic and cultural belts can be formed utilizing regions' landmark facilities and historic and cultural sites. Facilities for leisure activities, sports and refreshment should be in place around the waterside to improve living conditions and promote regional development. Especially, rural towns close to rivers will be able to benefit from river tourism combining ecological villages, experience programs and accommodation facilities.</p><p>6) Resource-recycling green city-regions: Green growth policies should be implemented through city-regional cooperation. Based on a national strategy and five-year plans announced in July, detailed green growth plans at central and local levels are under consideration. At the metropolitan level, environmentally-friendly model sites are being established. Plans by sector - buildings, transport, water resources, urban development, etc. - are being prepared. Integrated green growth at regional and city-regional levels should be pursued through combination of strategies pertaining to cities and sectors. One example is the establishment of mega-regional transport networks that can save energy and cut carbon gas emissions. Facilities for solar and other renewable energy resources and resource-recycling systems for waste and water should be established and managed at city-regional and mega-regional levels. Diverse green assets dispersed in city-regions should be networked and integrated. Integrated city-regional planning and management of green infrastructure such as open space, rivers, streams and seashores will help improve resource efficiency and reduce energy consumption.</p><p>7) Global soft cooperation among city-regions: Networks for city-regional development should be expanded into partnerships with major city-regions around the world. Global city-regional cooperation can assume various forms depending on their economic, industrial and cultural characteristics. Such cooperation is exemplified by the relationship between Busan in the southern coastal region and Kyushu of Japan. Korea's western coastal city-regions are also establishing relations with their Chinese counterparts including Shanghai and Beijing- Tianjin city regions. City-regional cooperation with developing countries will focus on sharing knowledge and experience of Korea's industrialization. Policymakers need to consider setting up coordination channels and working group meetings to explore global city-regional partnerships. Such city-regional cooperation will catalyze trans-border common growth across the world.</p><p>Future practical tasks</p><p>With the global rise of city-regions, Korea should promptly establish city-regional development plans. The most urgent tasks are:</p><p>First, the government should establish basic guidelines for promotion of city-regions and push for city-regional development strategies corresponding to the characteristics of each mega-regional economic zone.</p><p>Second, those strategies should be tailored to city-regions' competitive capabilities in consideration of diverse factors including their scale and industrial characteristics.</p><p>Third, an effective cooperative system is needed between the central administration and local governments. The latter should take the lead and former should play a supportive role in the city-regional policy process.</p><p>Fourth, metropolitan and provincial governments and lower-level city and county governments should share the cost of developing city-regions, while the central government needs to consider providing support through the national balanced development budget and other related expenditures.</p><p>Lastly, an institutional foundation for the formation and development of city-regions should be promptly established through related law revisions.</p><p>City-regional strategies should shift Korea's regional development from a mosaic type characterized by spatial divisions to a network type defined by links and integration of regions and sectors. Moreover, it will enhance Korea's geographical competitiveness by breaking away from the hub-and-spoke territorial structure - based on a dual structure of the Capital Region and the rest of the nation - and reshaping it into a polycentric hub-and-hub structure.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7X9J-RWW1-2R9C-G4F0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>December 14, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Highspeed Rail</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk1MzI4MDYxOEUwNEU5REIwMEQ2QkY2RDM3NkU0NzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Hub Operations</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTZCNjIxOTY4NkFFNDA4RkEzMUMxRTA0NDhFMzFFN0U7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzdDOUIxNEQzQzA5NEM0Q0E5RjlERDVFNzIzNEQyQzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Some politicians, scholars and environmentalists, albeit a minority, began questioning if Korea should stay as dependent on nuclear energy as it is now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid severe shortages of electricity and doubts over nuclear power, the need for energy efficiency and renewable energy is likely to emerge as a subject of public interest once again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an international organization promoting sustainable economic development, held a summit in Songdo, Incheon, in early June. The summit focused on the practical side of green growth including policy, innovations and finance.</p><p>In many countries, renewable energy sources are cheaper solutions than fossil fuel options, but investment from both the public and private sectors is far from adequate.</p><p>The Korea Times' Business Focus interviewed the world's leading experts about the financial barriers facing green industries in an attempt to draw more investments, especially from the private sector. The interviewees are: Bloomberg New Energy Finance Chief Executive Officer Michael Liebreich; Dominic Waughray, head of environmental initiatives at World Economic Forum; Vikram Widge, head of climate finance and policy at International Finance Corporation and Mark Halle, vice president of the International Institute for Sustainable Development.</p><p>The experts suggested that public money should be used as leverage to make investments less risky for the private sector and attract more private money. Furthermore, subsidies for fossil fuel should be removed so that renewables can compete in the same market..</p><p>The interviews were conducted individually and compiled. The questions and answers were edited.</p><p>Q: How would you assess the current state of financing for green growth?</p><p>A Dominic Waughray: The current state of financing for green growth is actually reasonably vibrant over the last decade. Over $210 billion was invested into clean energy from private sources last year. Although this is 11 percent down from 2011, it's still a huge increase over the last decade.</p><p>Interestingly, if you look at the flow of financing from South to South in green investment, it increased quite dramatically ? it's up 47 percent every year over the last decade. Last year was the first time when more financing in green investment flew from South to South than from North to South. In the U.S., less investments may have to do with shale gas, while in Europe, the financial crisis led to removing subsidies for renewable energy. But in countries like China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico or many other emerging countries, there is a much more vibrant sector. This might be where the growth would be in the longer run.</p><p>Michael Liebreich: First of all, it's a difficult question because there is no accepted definition of green growth. We have very specific datasets we gather in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and there is no controversy. You also have to bear in mind that public transportation or high-rise buildings are also more efficient than private vehicles and lot of small buildings. Is that green growth?</p><p>But to answer your question, no, it's not sufficient. It is a dangerous time, in a sense, because investment flow into clean energy had been growing but dropped last year. The debate in many countries is quite controversial, particularly around climate change.</p><p>Vikram Widge: I think we are doing a lot, but it's not enough. Even our institution, which deals with investment in the private sector, has increased our climate-related financing by 25 percent from 2012 to this year. But we still have a long way to go. The world at large has a long way to go.</p><p>Q: Investment into clean energy has traditionally flown from developed countries to developing countries? Are developing countries doing enough?</p><p>A Liebreich: The North-to-South flow in clean energy we tracked last year and in 2011 has changed a little bit, but is broadly $10 billion a year. In China, $65 billion was invested in clean energy, and most of it was Chinese money. Out of $8 billion invested in South Africa, probably more than half of that was South African money.</p><p>In terms of mitigating emissions, big industrialized or industrializing countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran and Saudi Arabia have a huge population and are very dependent on petrochemical for everything, leaving huge footprints. They clearly need to do much more.</p><p>There is still the view that the developing world wants to do what the rich world has done. We will be in trouble if that's the direction of development. There is an opportunity to leapfrog to much better housing solutions, city design, use of public transport and energy technology. And that's green growth.</p><p>Mark Halle: There is an enormous investment in green growth projects in the developing world. Opportunities are there because they are not overly invested in the wrong kind of energy. They have opportunities to, in a sense, leapfrog from the situation where there isn't much energy available straight to clean energy, without passing through the phase of conventional energy. But to do that, they need to be assisted.</p><p>The real problem is within least developed countries. In those countries, we have to recognize the number one priority is providing energy access.</p><p>For any countries looking to provide its population with access to modern energy, you need to understand that the strategy should be a mix of renewable solutions and conventional ones. For example, an African country that produces oil could use the gas produced along with oil and together with renewable energy at an optimal ratio that gives the country energy access as quickly as possible.</p><p>Q: What do you think are the barriers for green growth financing, especially in the private sector?</p><p>A Widge: It's clear to me that clean energy is always cheaper than what you call dirty energy. People worry about the fact that you have to pay extra for clean energy. Fossil fuel subsidies are artificially lowering prices, but it has been accepted as normal over the decades.</p><p>I say this not as a representative of a multilateral institution but as a global citizen. We are looking at unprecedented changes in our climate if we stay at the emission rate we are at now. I think we have probably five years to take significant action if we are going to start to reverse this thing.</p><p>Halle: The principle barrier, if you want to sum it up in one word, is risk. Private investors put money into what they believe is going to yield good return in a short period of time. A lot of investment into the green growth area is still uncertain and it is still in competition with conventional investments, some of which have the government's support. Green growth would be less risky if the environmental policies surrounding it were stable.</p><p>Liebreich: There are a lot of situations where clean energy or energy efficiency would be a much better economic solution but many investors are not familiar with funding these approaches.</p><p>The issue in the financial sector is that the regulation of the banks and pension funds, the roles of rating agencies and so on don't push innovation. They are conservative and slow down change.</p><p>Plus, there are a lot of different things taking place around the world. In Korea the push is green growth. The big issue in Europe is the fiscal crises, which overwhelm any discussion. It reduced Europe's ability to act on green growth, clean energy or almost any other issues.</p><p>It's a granular picture.</p><p>Business Focus: Could you elaborate on the obstacles in the financial industry?</p><p>Liebreich: The easiest example is that the scientists have established how much carbon is emitted into the atmosphere, but if you look at the balance sheet of the 100 largest coal and oil companies, the carbon they have on their balance sheet is three times as much. These are financial assets that are valued on their balance sheets.</p><p>Actually, you cannot use all of them because if you burn them all, it will cause a very unstable climate environment. So there is a mismatch between the financial system, which says these are all good assets and the physical system of our planet that says you cannot burn that. Why is it an asset when you cannot use it?</p><p>Waughray: The first point is to realize the scale of the challenge for greening our infrastructure including transportation, energy and water system. The cost of just providing finance for all of the basic infrastructure, we estimate at the World Economic Forum, is about a trillion dollars a year through to 2020. To provide an extra incentive for green infrastructure will be another 0.7 trillion dollars. It's money that cannot be found from public sources alone, and one has to figure out how to attract private investors into this space.</p><p>Now the challenge is it fills a new class of asset. It doesn't feel like a traditional road or rail project, so it's difficult for investors to know if they'll get a return on their investment. They may feel that it is a passing phase and in 10 years nobody will be building solar panels.</p><p>The trick is to use the limited public money to bring down the risks. It might be a guarantee that the government will purchase energy from new clean energy power stations. It might be a political guarantee that the policies won't change over 20 years. It might be a new kind of mechanism that blends public money with private money, like offering a reimbursement for the first loss.</p><p>Our estimation is that if you blend public and private investments and brought down some of these risks, you could possibly attract four to five times as much private money as the public money invested.</p><p>In developing countries, in particular, private money coming into the country for infrastructure will be a positive addition on the GDP and create growth and jobs, unlike aid money, which is always off the balance sheet and doesn't have positive impact on the GDP.</p><p>And, of course, private capital is not sentimental. New green projects have to be really bankable and pass all the tests that all the normal projects would have to pass. It's not a subsidy. This has to be market-credible.</p><p>Q: What would be the ultimate cause for private companies to invest more into green growth?</p><p>A Waughray: The leadership, I would say. All of this is like psychology. When one thing happens, the ecosystem starts to change.</p><p>Imagine if the CEOs of 20 large institutional investors, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds demanded they put 20 percent of their assets into long-term green investment. That would really shift the market because asset managers would try to create suiting funds, developers will see lots of money in the projects and politicians would try to attract the money into their country or province.</p><p>Some of those asset owners might feel it actually depends on political leadership, so it should be a combination of leadership from both institutional investors and politicians.</p><p>It might not be that you need everybody, like the United Nations, to do this. If you had a coalition of committed members like G20, it could be quite powerful.</p><p>Halle: Getting coherence into the set of policy signals given to investors. We all believe we all need to move toward clean energy. At the same time, we are using government money to subsidize fossil fuels in many countries. We are actually paying people to use more fossil fuel, therefore, making it hard for renewables to compete on the same playing field. One of the things we need to do most urgently is to start getting rid of what we call perverse incentives.</p><p>Business Focus: In the U.S, leaders were denying climate change. At this moment, are world leaders agreeing that climate change is happening and the need to come up with measures?</p><p>Halle: I think many in leadership positions do and the question is, how you can make that a politically successful strategy? Most politicians that I know respond when there is a strong demand from electorates. If there are not, then they listen more carefully to organized interest groups. In the U.S., the fossil fuel industry is very well organized; they are successful in communicating with politicians. You have to counter that by gathering people with interest in the renewable industry.</p><p>You see it many times with consumer issues. There is no tolerance for unsafe products for heavy metal in food or for child labor. They to be very difficult to correct and all of a sudden they changed completely.</p><p>Liebriech: It's one of the responsibilities of the government to price externalities. The cheapest option may be building a coal-fired power plant outside Seoul, but we would use regulation or finance incentives to force cleaner or green growth solutions. Right now there are many things that make sense like geothermal energy, rooftop solar panels in any sunny country, good onshore wind farms and energy efficiency.</p><p>In Spain, Bulgaria and Greece, the regulators, which provide a source of funding so that investors commit capital, change the rules. One of the frustrations in this discussion is that these retroactive changes are entirely self-inflicted. These policy makers decided to encourage this development but they have not been able to make it stick politically or they make mistakes. It's simply political ineffectiveness, political inaptitude.</p><p>Business Focus: Under former President Lee Myung-bak, the economic policy focus was green growth. Under President Park Geun-hye, it is now a 'creative economy.'</p><p>Liebriech: There is a difference between shifting emphasis and retroactively changing terms of a particular project. Shifting emphasis is not great, to be honest, but it's not as bad as initially promising to pay 10 cents per kWh for wind power and now pay just 8 cents. That is really corrosive.</p><p>When I was here two years ago, it was impressive to see big Korean companies focusing and developing offshore wind technology and you've got some very substantial engineering companies. Let's hope that Korean companies remain focused. Hang on a second. Is this a creative economy because of Psy? Suddenly because Gangnam Style, you don't care about green growth? You can do green growth and Gangnam Style. There is enough capital to fund both.</p><p>Business Focus: In a creative economy, the government wants to merge information and communications technology and science to further develop value-added industries and create jobs.</p><p>Liebriech: You mean additive manufacturing. Then I am much more comfortable. If you combine material science, nanotechnology and bioscience, you have an opportunity to produce services and products with much less impact. With 3D printing, for example, you could potentially save an enormous amount of energy and footprint.</p><p>Q: What would be the most ideal form of green growth financing you envision at this moment?</p><p>A Widge: The perceived higher cost of green growth can be offset by the benefits you get both in terms of resilience and in terms of development impacts.</p><p>Let's take energy access as an example. There is a lot of cooking stove and water filtration projects in developing countries. In these cases, green substitutes are not only sustainable but also have improved health. As women have to collect less firewood, that improves the use of their time, which is a gender benefit. Furthermore, the cooking stove would emit less smoke and improve the health of women in the households who tend to inhale smoke.</p><p>If you start pricing these benefits correctly, you will find that the cost of the green substitutes isn't actually higher than that of the old ones. The problem is that we undervalue these benefits. There are both positive and negative externalities.</p><p>The government has to fix its policies. Gender and health benefits from the green stoves should be valued by the government, which should have the incentives for the private sector to deliver them. That's the public and private partnership.</p><p>Waughray: Right now we need to get more large-scale projects going, particularly in developing countries to show that there is a market and there is a return on the investment.</p><p>International Finance Corporation (IFC) has a model for what they call Climate Catalyst Fund, which blends government money and money in the form of equity from asset owners. You can pull this money together and chop it up into pieces and asset manager of that piece of equity to raise debt against, using the triple A rated balance sheet of IFC. Asset managers can likely get three to four times in debt compared to the equity slice they have. Then they have a fund that can deliver projects.</p><p>In addition to the combination of private and public expertise to manage this fund, you would link them to strengthen market trades between countries that benefit from the fund. That model is similar to how Marshall Plan that was constructed after World War II to rebuild Europe. It was not an aid transfer from the U.S. to Europe. It was a public-private construction of the infrastructure fund managed jointly by the public and private sectors.</p><p>Halle: The ideal form of financing is the market. We need to use every public policy instrument to make sure that the solution they choose for financial reasons is the same solution that's best for the future of our society. We need to ensure that green growth projects give investors the best rewards.</p><p>There are three specific suggestions to achieve this. The first one is to get rid of subsidies to fossil fuel because they are tilting the playing field. The second is to use the power of the government, particularly government procurement, to send the market signals to favor the green sector. The government should purchase 15 to 20 percent, sometimes more than that, of goods and services in the economy. If the government decides they will only purchase those products compatible with green growth, it will create the market, eliminating the tipping point and expanding market. The final thing is the government needs to look at the current distortion in the market. Many countries have monopolies in distribution of the energy. All of these things have falsified the market. It's not a question of allowing investors to make a maximum return on their money.

(Courtesy of Suncheon City Hall)    [Cheonji Ilbo, Suncheon=Reporter choi soo a] Amid the massive threat of regional extinction, one local city has managed to safeguard both urban competitiveness and quality of life. Suncheon, a city in South Jeolla Province, is now gaining national attention as a model of urban resilience through a three-pronged strategy: healing, livability, and industrial diversification.  In the 2025 \u201cRegional Resilience Index\u201d published by the Hankyoreh Economic and Social Research Institute, Suncheon ranked first in the \u201cSmall but Strong Cities\u201d category out of 120 local governments across the nation. The evaluation quantifies resilience through environmental, economic, and social indicators.  Suncheon's strong performance stems from more than just investment and development; it reflects an integrated approach that combines green spaces, healthcare, culture, improved residential conditions, and diversified industry-driven employment.  \u25c6Breaking Through Extinction with Industry and Regional Links  Suncheon has emerged as a model for small cities battling population decline. The city\u2019s key strategies lie in industrial diversification and regional integration.  Moving away from dependence on a single industry, Suncheon has nurtured a broad portfolio of future growth engines including cultural content, space and defense technologies, biotechnology, and the healing industry.  In just three years under the current administration, Suncheon attracted over KRW 1.5 trillion in investment and created more than 1,700 jobs. Major corporations such as Hanwha Aerospace, POSCO Lithium Solution, Hanwha Ocean Ecotech, and Seah Steel have played a pivotal role in this growth.  These developments have not only created jobs but also strengthened the foundation for youth settlement in the region.  Suncheon also pushed forward regional integration. While 20 out of 22 cities and counties in South Jeolla have been designated as \"at-risk of extinction,\" Suncheon joined neighboring cities Yeosu and Gwangyang to sign an Economic Cooperation Joint Declaration, laying the groundwork for a shared metropolitan living zone.  In an April meeting of the Yeosu-Suncheon-Gwangyang Administrative Council, the three cities discussed industrial cooperation, expansion of transportation networks, integration of local currencies and transit fares, and the creation of a high-tech industrial belt\u2014all initiatives positioning Suncheon as a central hub in the region.

(Courtesy of Suncheon City Hall)    \u25c6 A Livable City Built on Medicine, Greenery, and Culture  Suncheon\u2019s resilience strategy goes far beyond investment attraction. The city is reshaping daily life by enhancing healthcare, green infrastructure, and cultural facilities, making it a truly desirable place to live.  In the medical sector, over KRW 4 billion has been invested in building an emergency medical safety network and establishing a Local Essential Medical Foundation within the year.  In January, Suncheon secured one of just 10 Regional Cardiovascular Disease Centers nationwide, ensuring specialized care and critical response times. The Dalbit Children's Hospital, the first of its kind in Jeolla Province, now fills a critical gap in nighttime and weekend pediatric care.  To improve access for vulnerable populations, the city introduced vibration-free ambulances and AI-powered emergency vehicles.  Green infrastructure has also expanded. Following the 2023 Suncheon Bay Garden Expo, the city created Ocheon Green Square and Green Island, and opened the Pungdeok Riverside Park along a 770-meter stretch of Dongcheon River this April.  These developments form a new ecological axis connecting Suncheon Bay, the National Garden, and the old downtown, effectively transforming the entire city into a healing space.  Cultural infrastructure is growing too. After opening Shindae Library, the largest in South Jeolla, in 2023 and Eoullim Library, a cultural complex, in 2024, the city now plans to build a Comprehensive Sports Park, enhancing residents\u2019 access to leisure, wellness, and culture.  \u25c6A Survival Strategy That Turned Crisis into Opportunity  Suncheon\u2019s healing industry initiative is more than a wellness trend or city branding effort\u2014it\u2019s a comprehensive strategy for economic transformation.  The city is working to be officially designated Korea\u2019s first Healing Tourism Industrial Zone, positioning this industry as a new axis of local economic growth.  Scheduled to break ground in late 2026, the Tidal Flat Healing Platform near Suncheon Bay Wetland will serve as a hub combining nature, wellness, and tourism. A broader Healing Cluster is also being created by connecting scattered resources such as the National Garden, Suncheon Bay, Seonamsa Temple, and Yonggye Mountain Healing Forest.  Programs like \u201cShillang-gae\u201d, which focus on extended-stay healing experiences, are also helping to shift from short-term tourism to long-term residence.  The strategy draws inspiration from the German town Bad W\u00f6rishofen, which, despite having a population of just 18,000, attracts 900,000 healing tourists annually. Suncheon aims to go a step further by fostering permanent settlement through its healing city model.  At a July 1 press conference marking three years in office, Mayor Noh Kwan-gyu reaffirmed the vision:  \u201cWe will build a healing city based on gardens and our three economic pillars,\u201d he said.  \u201cOur goal is to create a local economic cycle through a converged ecosystem that brings together healing, cultural content, and biotechnology.\u201d  Suncheon\u2019s healing city strategy is now seen as a practical survival model responding to the dual crises of local extinction and economic stagnation.  As urban competitiveness weakens and population decline accelerates across the country, Suncheon is charting a future by maximizing the value of its natural and social assets.  Today, Suncheon is one of the fastest-moving local cities toward the future.  Its fusion of healing, industry, ecology, and technology provides a blueprint for the next chapter of regional revitalization.
