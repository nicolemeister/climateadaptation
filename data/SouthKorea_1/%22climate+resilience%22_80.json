Developing countries regard climate change as a crisis caused largely by the rich countries, which they also view as shirking their historical and ongoing responsibility for the crisis. Worried that they will be left paying the bills, many key developing countries, such as India, don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt much care to negotiate or strategize.They have a point -- indeed, several points. The shoddy behavior of the United States over three decades is not lost on them. </p><p>Despite the worthy pleas for action by President Joe Biden and Climate Envoy John Kerry, Biden has been unable to push the US Congress to adopt a clean-energy standard. Biden can complain all he wants about China, but after 29 years of congressional inaction since the Senate ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the rest of the world sees the truth: America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds broken and corrupt Congress remains in the pocket of Big Oil and Big Coal.Financing is at the heart of the geopolitical rupture on climate change. Developing countries are already reeling under countless pressures: the COVID-19 pandemic, weak domestic economies, increasingly frequent and severe climate-related disasters, the multiple disruptions of the digital age, US-China tensions and high borrowing costs on international loans. They watch the rich countries borrow trillions of dollars on capital markets at near-zero interest rates, while they must pay 5-10 percent, if they can borrow at all. In short, they see their societies falling even further behind a few high-income countries.Against this background of high economic anxiety, developing countries see the rich countries refusing to discuss forthrightly the financing crisis developing countries face when it comes to climate-change mitigation and adaptation or other urgent needs. They see rich countries spending an extra $20 trillion or so on their own economies in response to COVID-19, but then failing to honor their promise -- dating from COP15 in 2009 -- to mobilize a meager $100 billion per year for climate action in developing countries.Of course, Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds reticence on climate financing for developing countries is understandable. He would be lambasted in the nationalistic US media if he called for more US help for the developing countries, and would gain nothing for it in Congress. With US global influence waning, America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nationalists have turned even more aggressively against the rest of the world. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAmerica Firsters\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in Congress would block any new appropriations.Many governments in Europe are in roughly the same position, perched precariously between nationalist and internationalist parties. And with budget deficits in European countries generally high in the wake of COVID-19, many parliaments have little taste to do more -- especially given that the European Union already devotes a far higher share of gross national income (roughly 0.5 percent) to official development assistance than does the US (just 0.17 percent).That leaves us stuck between the reality of a devastating global climate crisis and rich countries\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd nationalist politics, with climate finance based on voluntary contributions by the rich. The result is the chronic deep underfinancing of global public goods such as a safe climate, the Sustainable Development Goals, and COVID-19 vaccines. Leaders like Biden may plead with their legislatures to be responsible, but the legislators find it more politically expedient to rail against \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdundeserving\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd foreigners.The financial failures at COP26 are both tragic and absurd, going beyond the overarching failure to mobilize the promised $100 billion per year. Consider that the much-vaunted Climate Adaptation Fund, established to help developing countries to meet their adaptation needs, collected all of $356 million in pledges at COP26, or roughly 5 cents per person in the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds developing countries. Financing for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlosses and damages,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that is, to recover and rebuild from climate disasters, fared even worse, with rich countries agreeing only to hold \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddialogue\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd on the issue.This financial voluntarism needs to end. We need a global formula that assigns responsibility to each rich country. At least in that case, the global community would have a benchmark to demand action from laggard countries like the US.Here is one straightforward and workable approach. To help fund the clean-energy transition (mitigation) and climate resilience (adaptation) in developing countries, each high-income country would be levied $5 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Upper-middle-income countries would be levied $2.50 per ton. These CO2 levies would start as soon as possible and rise gradually, doubling in five years.Countries could easily pay such modest sums from the proceeds of carbon taxes and auctions of emissions permits, both of which will have much a higher price per ton of CO2 than the levy.COP26 showed definitively that asking national politicians to vote for voluntary funds for global public goods is a dead end. The rich-country politicians had a dozen years to get the promised climate financing in place, but they failed. A rules-based system, with fair and transparent burden sharing, is the way to secure the financing we need for planetary safety and fairness.Jeffrey D. SachsJeffrey D.

After the first confirmed case was reported in January 2020, the country managed to contain several waves of infections without complete border closures or local lockdowns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This helped ensure the continuity of essential social and economic activities. The economy contracted 0.9 percent last year, which was one of the best performances among major economies worldwide.</p><p>The Korean economy is projected to grow 4 percent this year and 3.1 percent next year. Strong exports and investments have driven the recovery since the second half of 2020.</p><p>And expansionary macroeconomic policy bolstered consumer spending starting in early 2021. A new flare-up in infections led to tightening of social distancing measures and a sharp drop in domestic demand in the third quarter. However, the near-term outlook remains bright.</p><p>Global demand for Korea's major exports, including semiconductor chips, electronics, automobiles and ships, will likely benefit from the broadening global recovery. Rapid digitization is also a boon to the semiconductor and information and communication technology sectors, boosting exports and investments.</p><p>Despite a resurgence of infections, the government appears set to progressively ease social distancing measures as nearly 80 percent of the adult population is fully vaccinated. This also bodes well for consumption growth.</p><p>However, the country faces considerable cyclical headwinds as it navigates the path to an inclusive and sustainable recovery.</p><p>First, record-low interest rates in response to the pandemic have pushed household debt to over 100 percent of GDP. It is now the highest in Asia. Financial asset and housing prices also soared amid increased market liquidity and credit growth. Inflation has picked up significantly, with higher prices for food, energy and housing rentals. Debt-laden households are vulnerable to higher interest rates as the Bank of Korea (BOK) has begun lifting its policy rates. Should higher inflation force the BOK to raise interest rates faster, rising debt servicing burdens and potential asset price corrections could put households under financial strain, threatening the consumption recovery.</p><p>Second, inflation is a concern around the world and for Korea. The release of pent-up demand following lockdowns is raising prices particularly for services, while persistent supply chain bottlenecks and surging energy prices are pushing up manufacturing costs. High inflation could also force the U.S. Federal Reserve to accelerate its tapering of asset purchases and start interest rate hikes earlier and faster than expected. U.S. interest rate hikes and a tightening of global financial conditions have proved disruptive to emerging markets in the past, as global investors pulled funds from riskier emerging market assets. This scenario led to the so-called 'taper tantrum' in 2013.</p><p>Third, fiscal spending has pushed government debt in Korea to an estimated 51.3 percent of GDP this year, from 41.2 percent in 2019. Although the government's extraordinary fiscal measures were warranted during the pandemic, the debt should be aggressively managed in the medium to long term to ensure its sustainability. The need will continue for increased spending associated with an aging population and necessary structural adjustments to meet growing demand for welfare as well as disaster and climate resilience.</p><p>Structural challenges are bigger problem</p><p>An aging population, labor market rigidities and widening inequality are casting a shadow over the economy's long-term growth potential. Short-term macroeconomic stimuli seem to have cushioned the economy from the pandemic, but they are unlikely to reverse the long-term trend of declining potential growth.</p><p>A recent International Monetary Fund study estimated Korea's long-term growth potential will fall below 2 percent by 2030, mainly due to population aging.</p><p>Korea is among the world's fastest-aging economies. People aged 65 and older account for 16.5 percent of its population, and by 2030 the proportion is expected to reach 25 percent.</p><p>The fertility rate is 0.84 children per woman, the lowest in the world, while longevity is up thanks to a comprehensive and affordable national healthcare system. Combined with structural rigidity in the labor market that's lowering labor force participation and dampening investment, the aging population is crimping productivity and long-term growth potential.</p><p>Social inequality is also a concern, as more than 40 percent of citizens over 65 live in relative poverty (defined as earning 50 percent or less of median household income), according to a recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey. This is the highest level among the 39 OECD member countries.</p><p>Inequality, entrenched by economic and social stratification, can also lead to a loss of momentum and dynamism. Recent reforms have taken aggressive steps to address rising inequality, by driving up minimum wages, increasing property and wealth taxes, and strengthening health insurance and social safety nets.</p><p>Despite some potential long-term benefits of these reforms, there has been criticism that they add regulatory obstacles to already rigid markets and pose challenges to long-term debt sustainability.</p><p>As the pandemic recedes, government policy needs to transition from 'crisis response' to a new phase of 'economic recovery.' For example, it needs to reorient fiscal spending to promote long-term growth potential that also meets social and environmental objectives.</p><p>There is ample scope to raise productivity, especially in the services sector, where regulatory restrictions have limited entries and competition.</p><p>The country's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 can also create new opportunities in the clean energy, battery, and automobile industries. Post-pandemic reforms should clearly promote economic efficiency and productivity by addressing market rigidities, reducing red tape, improving the rule of law and enhancing transparency and predictability in policy making.</p><p>The writer is director of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Division in the Economics Research and Regional Cooperation Department of the Asian Development Bank.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/newsV2/images/202112/40ab31c96bd7436ebe60a09e9f94dd03.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Park Cyn-young / Courtesy of Asian Development Bank</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-319904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:647M-X751-DYTP-W0SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1053\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 6, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0005MM0</classCode><className>BANK OF KOREA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPX0</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION &amp;

The following is an edited transcript of The Korea Economic Daily's July 21 interview with Everett.\u00a0<br/><br/>\u25b2 What are the major long-term structural changes shaping real estate markets and how has the pandemic impacted these changes?<br/><br/>\u201cDemographics, infrastructure, globalization, innovation and technology, which Principal Real Estate refers to as DIGITAL themes, have become very important in driving the growth of formerly niche, or non-traditional, property types. As the pandemic transformed the outlook for occupiers, the capital markets are propelling these property types into the mainstream.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThese DIGITAL themes manifest themselves in both the traditional and non-traditional real estate property types. Increasingly, non-traditional properties have become the beneficiaries of these demand drivers. While these factors can impact every aspect of investing, they are particularly relevant to the real estate markets.\u201d<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220013.700x.0.jpg\">Todd Everett, executive director and CEO at Principal Real Estate Investors</url><br/>\u25b2 How do you see inflation and rising rates impacting real estate in the coming years?<br/><br/>\u201cInvestors need to be mindful that not all property sectors, or locations, will offer the same performance or the same inflation mitigation benefits. We recommend focusing on a mix of emerging growth and traditional property types in metro areas aligned with long-term structural drivers that include technology and strong demographic growth profiles.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOne area of opportunity is commercial real estate. Although commercial real estate is not inflation-proof, historically, it has a record of performing well during periods of higher-than-average inflation, owing to its ability to generate and increase income returns for investors given the nature of leases that are often tied to measures of inflation.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 What is your outlook on the real estate market? Which property types will benefit from strong demand tailwinds?<br/><br/>\u201cDemand fundamentals are reasonably balanced within commercial real estate although the impact of the pandemic is still seen in office sector occupancy levels. We believe that property types with resilient, embedded demand drivers \u2013 for example, data centers, medical offices, manufactured housing \u2013 may remain well supported by tenants and investors.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 In the expected stagflation market in the US going forward, what specific sectors would Principal recommend to its investors and why? <br/><br/>\u201cWe believe it is important to focus on resilient (DIGITAL) drivers of demand as well as specific strategies such as focused development to potentially generate risk-adjusted performance.\" <br/><br/>\"For example, the development offers outsized opportunities in the US housing market. Generational changes to the US population are intersecting with impacts from COVID-19, creating sustained demand in the residential sector that may have long-term tailwinds.\u201d<br/><br/>\"A substantial shortage of housing, coupled with rising affordability issues, is generating significant demand for rental real estate. The demand has expanded beyond traditional apartments to include single-family homes, manufactured housing, and built-to-rent units. <br/><br/>\"The demand for residential real estate has also shifted into high gear among investors who recognize the acute need for housing and the increasingly broad swathe of options the sector can offer renters.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWe believe that development strategies offer attractive risk-adjusted opportunities within the residential sector by generating return premiums over the core and stabilized assets. Further, a development-oriented approach offers the ability to tailor assets to meet shifting tenant profiles, including more ESG-related amenities, and potentially meet and exceed inflationary pressures by covering rising material and labor costs via increased stabilized asset values.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 Given that inflation is leading to higher construction costs, why has Principal stated a strong preference for development over buying existing properties today? Does this approach vary by property type or market?<br/><br/>\u201cAs investors search for higher-yielding investment solutions, many are turning to opportunities in the development space given that value-add returns have also seen significant erosion. The premium for investing in value-add has declined thereby rendering the risk and return relationship less attractive.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cWe believe development strategies continue to offer attractive absolute and relative returns. Core industrial and multifamily assets offer a relative value opportunity, given the range of their current cap rates.\" <br/><br/>\"While supply and labor shortages have extended development timelines and increased appropriate underwriting contingencies, stronger capital market demand has more than compensated experienced developers for these incremental risks. Low cap rates and powerful rental growth continue to offset cost and timing considerations.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDevelopment strategies offer the ability to tailor new build assets to evolving and growing ESG demands and standards from occupiers and buyers that have been catalyzed by COVID-19, climate change and expanding regulatory requirements.\u201d<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220015.700x.0.jpg\">Optima Kierland, a multifamily property in North Scottsdale, Arizona which Principal and Optima co-developed in 2020</url><br/><br/>\u25b2 Interest in ESG investing has grown exponentially over the last few years. Can you tell us about Principal Real Estate Investors\u2019 commitment to ESG? And what are the sustainability efforts from a real estate perspective? <br/><br/>\"We are keenly aware of the role the financial industry can play to support a more sustainable world and future. Principal Real Estate has had an overarching ESG framework, the Principles for Responsible Property Investing, since 2013. It guides our investment management practices, which is used by Principal and our property management and joint venture partners.\u201d\u00a0 <br/><br/>\u201cThe framework is based on our comprehensive policies, governance framework, reporting practices and research. Through our research, we have identified five primary areas of ESG focus which guide our decision making: Environmental Performance, Occupant Experience, Community Impact, Climate Resilience, and Managerial Excellence.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cFurther, this framework outlines our ESG expectations throughout the property lifecycle, starting with the analysis of key ESG factors during due diligence, an iterative performance improvement cycle during operations and disposition practices such as sharing key ESG data. As trends and best practices evolve, we continually look to refine the platform.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 What makes Principal Real Estate different from its peers when selecting and evaluating green properties? And how does Principal measure ESG factors differently from others? <br/><br/>\u201cWe thoroughly evaluate ESG issues from the earliest stages of our new property and existing asset acquisition pre-investment process. As part of the underwriting process, we consider ESG issues that are unique to each site and local market resilience, from both an economic and regulatory perspective.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cRelying on local market expertise provided by our property management and development partners, in addition to our regional asset management and engineering teams, allows greater insight and focus on key local market conditions.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOne area to highlight is how we assess physical and transition climate risk as part of our due diligence process for new developments and acquisitions. High risks identified are considered for each deal by the engineer, acquisitions and asset management teams and experts as needed such as the Property Condition Assessment (PCA) consultant to identify immediate design changes or capital expenditures.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cFrom a policy and legal perspective, an increasing number of jurisdictions and regional governments are adopting climate action plans, renewable energy portfolio standards, or other environmental regulations targeting greater energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions associated with commercial buildings.\" <br/><br/>\"The climate risk report includes a transition risk rating for each asset\u2019s estimated value at risk (VaR) as a result of anticipated regulations in the next 15 years. In addition, our analysis process helps identify properties exposed to specific energy disclosure or performance regulations.\u201d<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220017.700x.0.jpg\">\u00a0The office tower at 500 W. 2nd Street in Austin, Texas which Principal and Trammell Crow Company co-developed in 2016</url><br/>\u25b2 How do green certifications add value to yield?<br/><br/>\u201cBuilding owners seeking to benefit from green building investments often choose to obtain credible green building certifications. While there is a cost to such certifications \u2013 both the application fees and the cost of implementing the required measures to meet the standards \u2013 third-party certifications provide a consistent framework with independent verification of integration of environmental and social standards at the property.\u201d<br/><br/>\"Certification standards also provide guidelines to building owners that allow them to benefit from significant energy savings. For example, the US\u00a0Green Building Council (USGBC) finds that LEED-certified buildings consume 25% less energy than equivalent commercial buildings.\"<br/><br/>\"Sustainability research in 2021 found that buildings with green ratings benefitted from average rental premiums of 11% for LEED-certified buildings\u00a0and green buildings tend to attract more tenants and boost occupancy rates.\"<br/><br/>\u201cInvestors may benefit from higher rents and increased demand by incorporating green building elements into their developments, renovations and operating plans. So it is not surprising that green buildings with credible certifications such as LEED have been found to sell for 21% more per square foot than equivalent buildings over the last three years, depending on the market. Buyers value the energy-saving upgrades, on-site renewable energy installations, and healthier interior conditions.\u201d<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220020.600x.0.jpg\">Link to Image</url><br/><br/>Headquartered in Iowa, Principal Real Estate Investors is a real estate group within Principal Global Investors.

Many agreed that, like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change consequences are disproportionately affecting women and girls. Round table discussions continued from the session's opening day on 14 March on the same themes: climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes -- advancing gender equality through holistic and integrated actions from global to local; and on women's voice and agency -- good practices towards achieving women's full, equal and meaningful participation and decision-making in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes. (For details, see Press Release WOM/2213.)</p><p>During the general discussion in the afternoon, Rosy Akbar, Fiji's Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said climate finance often fails to take account of gender equality and women's empowerment. To remedy this, she called on the international community to increase gender-responsive climate, environmental and disaster risk finance. She also called for efforts to promote women's full participation and leadership in climate, environment, ocean, biodiversity and disaster-risk-reduction action, and to strengthen their capacities through accessible training and gender-responsive policies and programmes.</p><p>In the same vein, Vindhya Persaud, Guyana's Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co-operative Republic, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), reiterated disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met. Stressing that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States, she said its impact represents a \"code red for humanity\". Moving forward, a gender perspective must be part of building climate resilience and designing and implementing disaster-risk-reduction strategies and recovery plans. In addition, climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities must include measures that support women-owned enterprises in the green and blue economies, she said, also calling for investment in gathering gender specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate.</p><p>On behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Patricia Kaliati, Malawi's Minister for Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, agreed that the current situation calls for action, as women make up the poorest and most vulnerable groups in her region. Reasons stem from their general subordinate legal status and limited access to such critical resources as land, technology, credit, education and housing, she said, pointing to several ongoing efforts to help to address these challenges. For its part, SADC integrated gender and climate change into its Protocol on Gender and Development in 2016. This means State parties should, by 2030, develop policies, strategies, and programmes to address the gender issues in climate change, conduct research to assess the differential gendered impacts of climate change and adopt effective mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>Youth representative Antonette Ncube, from the European Union delegation, in its capacity as an observer, spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls when she presented several recommendations. Underscoring a need to improve data and strengthen capacity building, she encouraged stakeholders to pursue the ethical collection and dissemination of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and gender statistics on all dimensions of environmental, disaster risk reduction and climate change issues, and sexual and gender-based violence. She also recommended that stakeholders ensure the gender-responsive implementation of international commitments made in such instruments as the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Calling for concerted efforts to address gender-based violence and the disproportionate impact of climate crises and disasters on women and girls, she expected the Commission to adopt strong and action-oriented conclusions.</p><p>Some speakers shone a spotlight on the importance of remembering the most vulnerable groups of women when aiming at inclusive responses. The representative of Chile, speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Older Persons, said those often overlooked must urgently be considered. Older persons -- and even more so older women -- remain largely invisible and disregarded in the development of policies and programmes. To change this, he urged United Nations agencies, and particularly the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), to systematically collect and disaggregate data by age and gender, particularly of women beyond their reproductive years.</p><p>Marta Lucia Ramirez, Vice President of Colombia, declared that, when women arrive in positions of power, they must remember to open more spaces for others \"just as those who came before did for us\". Half the world's population has historically been excluded from power, but gender equality is essential for generating sustainable economic growth, she said, highlighting Colombia's five point national policy to support women's inclusion -- from the business sector to peace and security. Colombia also launched the world's first sovereign gender bond to help women-owned businesses recover from the widespread economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing attention to the situation of women in conflict affected zones in Afghanistan to Ukraine, she said the international community must always call for the dignity and rights of women and must remember that these and other conflicts are a result of wars \"always declared by men\".</p><p>lso delivering statements during the general discussion were Iran, Iceland, Uzbekistan, Serbia, Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, Republic of Korea, Austria, Sweden, Liechtenstein, Finland, New Zealand, France, Kazakhstan, Germany, Jordan, Ireland, Oman, Portugal, Israel, Trinidad and Tobago, and Luxembourg.</p><p>The representative of the Russian Federation spoke in exercise of the right of reply.</p><p>The Commission on the Status of Women will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 March, to continue its work.</p><p>Ministerial Round Table III</p><p>In the morning, the Commission held a ministerial round table discussion on the theme \"Climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes: advancing gender equality through holistic and integrated actions from global to local\".</p><p>Ministers and senior officials of Member States exchanged views on how Governments are working towards advancing gender perspectives into national policies and programmes. Discussing concerns about such pressing challenges as drought and gender inclusion in related mitigation efforts, delegates presented a broad range of national examples, from cash grants to training for women in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. They also highlighted gender-responsive policies and needs for improvement in such areas as financing.</p><p>HYE RYOUNG SONG (Republic of Korea), Vice-Chair designate (Asia and Pacific States Group), opened the round table, sharing some of her country's actions. Among them are targeted initiatives that led various ministries to draft recommendations related to the gender aspects of climate change. Emphasizing the importance for partners to respond to the climate crisis in a sustainable, inclusive manner, she encouraged delegates to have a fruitful round table.</p><p>VINDHYA PERSAUD, Minister for Human Services and Social Security of Guyana, cited several national achievements, including the Low Carbon Development Strategy. Launched in 2009, the Strategy seeks to transform the economy while combating climate change and promoting the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in key economic sectors through micro-, small enterprise and entrepreneurial projects and job opportunities. Women were awarded 62 per cent of low-carbon cash grants and were trained in climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forestry and business development. With the second highest percentage of forest cover in the world, Guyana secured climate financing for the Amerindian Development Fund, which benefitted 180 communities and strengthened village economies, providing hundreds of jobs for indigenous women. Climate financing is currently bridging the ICT divide for hinterland women and girls with the provision of laptops and the creation of hubs powered by solar-energy systems, transforming the way in which they access Government and social services. In addition, Guyanese women are leading in climate action and advocacy and have pioneered solutions to protect the country's valuable ecosystem.</p><p>ROSY AKBAR, Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation of Fiji, highlighted significant strides in developing coherent legislative and policy frameworks in the context of gender, environment and disaster risk reduction. The National Climate Change Policy (20182030) and the 2021 Climate Change Act endorse the principles of gender equality and women's empowerment while recognizing women as agents of change. Gender mainstreaming mandates extend to all programmes of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2020-2024) while the Green Growth Framework identifies gender equality as key indicators of social development. The National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy establishes \"human rights and gender-based approaches\" as one of its eight guiding principles, in line with Fiji's commitment to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the gender action plan of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Initiatives related to combating gender based violence in times of disaster responses are among other ongoing efforts to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable groups, including women and girls in all diversity, are met, she said.</p><p>NAREK MKRTCHYAN, Minister for Labour and Social Affairs of Armenia, presented several ongoing initiatives in line with his country's commitments to such global efforts as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Armenia's disaster management strategy outlines a series of sector-targeted actions for preparedness, response and risk reduction from national to local levels while also recognizing the need to increase women's representation in such activities. The Government prioritizes mainstreaming gender equality in all its projects dedicated to environmental sustainability, resilience-building, climate change adaptation and crisis mitigation. The Gender Policy Implementation Strategy sets the Government's priorities for women's equal participation in all spheres of public life, including: preventing the feminization of poverty in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; involving rural women in combating climate change problems; strengthening cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organizations in the field of environmental and disaster risk management; and reducing of the impact of pandemics, in particular COVID-19.</p><p>NDEYE SALY DIOP DIENG, Minister for Women, Family and Gender of Senegal, said climate change is the biggest challenge, leading to land degradation, drought and other major problems. Indeed, decreases in soil fertility and other side effects have a negative impact on women while also triggering an estimated economic loss of 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the agriculture sector. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that more than 3 million people live in areas that are extremely vulnerable to climate change, alongside expert projections that envision 1 billion people facing climate change threats by 2050. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects that Africa will lose two thirds of its arable land by 2025. These challenges have a human cost, she said, emphasizing that women in rural communities are being affected. Local production, from fishing to forestry, has also felt the impact. Senegal's analysis and assessments demonstrate the scope of these climate consequences, which could possibly limit women's access to arable land. Efforts include strengthening initiatives from the global to local levels, including promoting a green economy transition, which Senegal supports, she said, adding that funding must be increased for such endeavours.</p><p>MATEJA RIBIC, State Secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities of Slovenia, said her \"green\" country has a wealth of natural resources and rich biodiversity, yet recognizes the immediate need to address paramount climate change and sustainable development challenges. Slovenia's new climate change strategy aims at fostering a society adapted and resilient to climate change impacts and is characterized by a high quality of life and a high degree of safety. Fully aware of strong links among biodiversity, climate change, food security and water, she also noted the well-established interlinkages among human rights, environmental degradation and climate change, which affect millions of people, especially women and girls across the world. Welcoming the Human Rights Council's recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, she said Slovenia strongly supports women's empowerment in the context of foreign policy priorities, with gender equality and environmental protection being a cross-cutting issue for development cooperation and humanitarian aid, including ongoing support for projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls must be at the centre of building back a better, greener, more resilient and more equal world, she said, highlighting the need for strong commitments to achieving gender equality at the highest political level.</p><p>NALIZA REBUELTA-TEH, Under-Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, said her country -- located in the tropical cyclone belt -- ranks fourth among nations most affected by extreme weather events in the 2021 long-term Global Climate Risk Index. It experienced 317 exceptionally devastating events from 2000 to 2019. In December 2021, Super Typhoon Rai ravaged more than 2 million families and left $650 million in damages to housing, agriculture and infrastructure. Citing projections from the Philippine Climate Extremes 2020 Report, she said warming temperatures and decreasing rainfall are expected to threaten many communities. Coastlines and coastal resources are also highly vulnerable to climate change and disasters, with low-lying islands facing permanent inundation. The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change -- among other gender-responsive adaption and mitigation efforts -- addresses the different impacts that individual catastrophes and the slow-onset effects of climate change have across gender, age, socioeconomic class, indigenous status, migration status and disability. Women are ensured equal benefits and participation in Government programmes and policies, she said, adding that, in 2021, over $50 million was allocated to advance women's technical knowledge and overall capacity to implement mitigation measures in resource-based communities. The Government's gender mainstreaming efforts are institutionalized in focal point systems, annual appropriation for related budgets and a planning and reporting system monitored by the Philippine Commission on Women. Organized and systematic gender mainstreaming has produced national benefits for over two decades, she said, noting the Philippines' commitment to continue this holistic, integrated effort through sex aggregated data, social inclusion and measuring long-term strategic impacts.</p><p>HALA MAZYAD ALTUWAIGRI, Secretary-General of the Family Affairs Council of Saudi Arabia, said climate change impacts women and girls disproportionately and is an added stressor that will set back their advancement. Noting that 43 per cent of the global agricultural labour force is in developing countries, she said United Nations research shows that women make up 80 per cent of those displaced by climate change, which requires a serious effort from Governments and the active participation of all community members. Citing several national achievements, she pointed to the launch of a set of environmental protection policies and initiatives that address local to global climate change effects and also consider women's inclusion in decision-making and policymaking. The national environment strategy includes 64 initiatives aimed at restructuring the sector alongside such emission reduction programmes and policies as the adoption of an e Government project and renewable energy efforts. Contributions were allocated to the non-profit sector for providing solutions and innovation through advanced programmes and mechanisms, with women supervising the implementation of most of these efforts. The launch in 2021 of the Saudi Green Initiative aims to reduce the impact of climate change, achieve sustainability and create job opportunities for women and youth.</p><p>MOHAMMED SAHIB MARZOOQ, Head of Human Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iraq, delivering a statement on behalf of Yossra Mohsen, Director General and Head of Women's Empowerment in his country, said climate change consequences -- from the reduction of arable land to the loss of waterways -- has led to displacement and a loss of revenue, disproportionately affecting women and girls. As such, a historic role must be played to mitigate climate change effects. This shared responsibility should be based on circumstances and national capabilities, as solidarity and international cooperation have proven to be the only way forward. Highlighting several key achievements, he said Iraq has developed a series of projects and action programmes to tackle these and related challenges and has adopted laws and policies aimed at protecting women and increasing their participation at various levels. Noting that 95 women were elected in recent elections, he pointed to other gains, including the Government's launch of its second National Plan for Women's Economic Empowerment (2021-2022). Efforts included opening centres to protect women from domestic violence, creating a high-level committee to assist rural women, and a Ministry of Agriculture initiative to implement several targeted projects. In addition, 1 million trees have been planted as part of a mitigation project. Going forward, Iraq is working on revising its laws related to women's rights and on implementing a national strategy for Iraqi women that also focuses on climate change.</p><p>In closing remarks, MAMI MIZUTORI, Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, said that, while disasters affect everyone, they disproportionately affect women and girls. Summarizing several threads of the discussion, she said structural inequality is a driver of risk, noting also that women must be involved in efforts to address this. Policies must also be embedded with gender perspectives. At the same time, investing in all these policies and efforts is also critical, she said. Highlighting several other issues, she said more science and knowledge must be shared with women and girls. Attention must also be paid to the issue of increased violence against women amid disasters and the vulnerable situation of women in rural areas, she said, commending the participants for sharing their encouraging efforts at national to local levels.</p><p>lso participating were ministers and other high-level representatives from Kenya, France, Indonesia, United Republic of Tanzania, Saint Lucia, Spain, Bangladesh, Angola, United Kingdom, Maldives, El Salvador, Azerbaijan and Chad.</p><p>Ministerial Round Table IV</p><p>The Commission then held a ministerial roundtable discussion on the theme \"Women's voice and agency: good practices towards achieving women's full, equal and meaningful participation and decision-making in the context of climate-change, environmental and disaster-risk-reduction policies and programmes\".</p><p>Ministers and senior officials of Member States detailed national strategies to increase women's participation in decision-making and address the disproportionate effects of climate change and natural disaster on women and girls. Stressing that such effects, along with widening inequality, necessitates including these individuals in policymaking, they also pointed out that women and girls possess unique knowledge and experience that can be harnessed to inform risk-reduction and resilience strategies. Further, they pointed to the link between climate change and gender-based violence, stressing the need to mainstream gender perspectives in national policy to ensure that women and girls have both voice and agency in addressing a phenomenon that affects them in specific ways.</p><p>ELIZABETH GOMEZ ALCORTA, Minister for Women, Genders and Diversity of Argentina, chairing the round table, said that women and girls -- who hold deep knowledge of the needs and priorities of their communities -- are key to combating climate change and environmental degradation. However, women are far from achieving full gender parity and lack the critical mass necessary to influence policy, decisions and strategies. Further, women's civil society organizations face barriers to participation and leadership due to diminishing funds and threats to physical security. Pointing out that, while climate change is a global challenge, not all countries share the same responsibility, she said that the richest countries produce the most greenhouse gases while those with the fewest emissions are most exposed to the negative effects of the same. This reflects the hegemonic model of development, which is harmful to the environment and increases inequality. For its part, she said that Argentina works towards gender mainstreaming by training public officials and providing more resources to community organizations, especially those affected by climate change.</p><p>SILVERIA ELFRIEDA JACOBS, Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, speaking on behalf of the Netherlands and its constituent countries of Sint Maarten, Curacao and Aruba, said that the latter three small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The climate crisis magnifies inequalities and vulnerabilities -- especially for women and girls -- which are further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, in the global discussion regarding climate action, the voices of women and girls are underrepresented, and the international community cannot expect to solve this crisis by leaving these individuals behind. Member States must work towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality by ensuring women's full access to equal opportunities, knowledge and pay. Emphasizing that \"women must be part of the solution\", she said that, by working together to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 5, the world can progress towards achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>RIUNZAYA AYUSH, Minister for Labour and Social Protection of Mongolia, noted that her country has ratified 12 United Nations conventions relating to climate change, and to ensure implementation of these international treaties at the national level, has adopted several laws and policies to protect the environment. Further, the Government has implemented a number of projects to combat desertification and reduce air pollution, as the negative effects of climate change continue to pose a risk to both women and the national economy. Air pollution -- caused by densely populated urban areas -- has particularly negative effects on the health of the population. She emphasized that this problem especially affects infants and pregnant women, and has also led to respiratory diseases, premature birth and developmental disorders.</p><p>YANNA WEBSTER-ROY, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, outlined Government efforts to ensure that women have voice and agency by incorporating gender considerations in strategies and projects to enhance environmental and climate resilience. Socially constructed roles and inequality disproportionately affect women -- especially in rural areas  and she highlighted the need to incorporate the United Nations principle of \"leaving no one behind\" in developing disaster-risk-reduction policies and programmes. Gender issues and priorities specific to women must be integrated into the same, and the Government has worked to include women in stakeholder groups such as environmentally focused cabinets. She went on to stress the need to ensure that no barriers prevent the participation of women and girls in efforts to address climate change.</p><p>NASSENEBA TOURE, Minister for Women, Family and Children of Ca'te d'Ivoire, pointed out that women comprise 70 per cent of agricultural workers in her country, producing 90 per cent of foodstuffs. As such, they suffer disproportionately from the consequences of drought, high precipitation and natural disaster. Against that backdrop, the Government has implemented a national programme to fight climate change by empowering women and girls. Institutional and legislative support measures have been passed, multiple support funds for women working in agriculture have been established and women's participation in elected assemblies has increased. She also said that the Government is committed to implementing three projects for producing solar energy in the country's north -- 12 solar plants and 1 biomass project using residue from cotton and cocoa will create thousands of jobs for women and girls.</p><p>HELENA DALLI, European Commissioner for Equality of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed the need to address the lack of women's participation in decision-making as \"no crisis is gender-neutral\". Climate change and environmental degradation take a disproportionate toll on women due to such individuals' reduced access to resources, and therefore, the European Union's climate-adaptation strategy aims to increase women's leadership and gender balance. Further, the bloc supports programmes worldwide that promote women's participation in climate governance -- once such instance is its partnership with Bhutan to help local governments include women in the process to improve disaster resilience. Spotlighting the link between climate change and gender-based violence, she said that the European Union works to prevent such violence through targeted action, such as strengthening institutional capacities to address violence against women and girls following natural disaster.</p><p>NINO TANDILASHVILI, Deputy Minister for Environmental Protection and Agricultural Affairs of Georgia, joined other speakers in expressing solidarity with Ukraine and its people, condemning the Russian Federation's invasion and use of force against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in contravention of international law. Turning to climate change, she said the phenomenon has had -- and will continue to have -- severe, lasting impact on the environment and social development. The resilience and adaptive capacity of women and girls must be supported, and for its part, the Government is working to mainstream gender perspectives in its environmental and climate change policy. These efforts include enhancing women's role as agents of change and reducing the impact of natural disaster on population and infrastructure by providing early warning systems and locally informed risk management. \"Without gender equality today, a sustainable, equitable future remains beyond our reach,\" she added.</p><p>NNA MARIA MOKGETHI, Minister for Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs of Botswana, highlighted the lessons learned from the COVID-19, HIV/AIDS and Ebola pandemics, in which women were not only affected, but also at the forefront of the response. As countries hold national and international dialogues on climate-change mitigation, women and girls must be at the negotiating table to ensure their voices are heard. Noting that women and girls in her country are negatively affected by aridity, persistent drought and erratic rainfall, she said that the Government pursues inclusive development policies that focus on the particular needs of women and children. Further, it engages women and girls in rural areas in the management of rural community resources, as their wealth of indigenous knowledge is essential for resilience. She went on to stress that these indigenous practices must be preserved, and that the women employing them must be empowered to fully participate in the supply chain.</p><p>In closing remarks, PREETI SINHA, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Capital Development Fund, highlighted the link between women's economic empowerment and the climate agenda. Offering an example of the Fund's work in Uganda, she said that the informal settlements of Mbali suffer from frequent water-supply outages, flooding and contamination. As such, only 20 per cent of households have access to clean, piped water, and this lack of access forces women and youth to travel long distances to collect water, which renders them susceptible to gender-based violence. The Fund is working to improve this water access situation, and this scenario demonstrates the effects that climate adaptation measures can have on women's security. The relationship between climate finance and women's economic empowerment has the potential to be one of the most powerful, virtuous cycles in development finance for least developed countries and beyond. \"Let us unite to have capital serve humanity, and not the other way around,\" she added.</p><p>lso participating were ministers and other high-level representatives from Estonia, Sierra Leone, Liechtenstein, Denmark, Gambia, Portugal, Ethiopia, Croatia, Greece, Mexico, Paraguay, Romania, Czech Republic, Cuba, Switzerland and Mali.</p><p>eneral Discussion</p><p>MILENKO ESTEBAN SKOKNIC TAPIA (Chile), speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Older Persons, said that it is undeniable that all older women make a significant contribution, as agents of change, to the social, economic and sustainable development of societies. Not only do women account for the majority of older persons, but the proportion of older women in the global female population will also increase in the coming years. Therefore, policies and programmes must address women's needs throughout their lives, particularly when they are older. Calling for a change in the way of thinking about ageing, he said there is a need to challenge narratives regarding the role older women can play in the economy, society and households.</p><p>It is hard to conceive that considering that older populations will outgrow younger populations by 2020, older persons -- and even more so older women -- remain largely invisible and disregarded in the development of policies and programmes. Such invisibility is evident in this year's Secretary-General's report on the priority theme, which hardly addressed the complex realities of older women facing climate change and natural disasters, despite the compounded vulnerabilities they are more likely to experience. Such lack of visibility can and must be addressed urgently. The Group therefore urges the United Nations agencies, and particularly United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to systematically collect and disaggregate data by age and gender, particularly of women beyond their reproductive years.</p><p>Ms. AKBAR, Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation of Fiji, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said that the science is non-negotiable and urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical. Equal and full participation of all women and girls must be central to global action. The recent volcanic eruption in Tonga caused tephra ash to fall, a tsunami and severe damage to submarine telecommunications cables. Pacific women and girls, in all their diversity, continue to play a critical role in building resilient communities. Recognizing women's and girls' knowledge, capabilities and skills, and empowering them, is vital to the safety and security of all Pacific families. The Pacific has one of the highest rates of violence globally; on average, two out of every three women experience some form of violence throughout their lifetime. Global evidence indicates a link between disasters, climate change and gender-based violence, she said, noting that in the Pacific, reports of domestic violence cases have increased. During disasters, women are subject to increased workloads and care responsibilities and must travel further to look for water and food. This is exacerbated by the increasing levels of non-communicable diseases in rural and remote areas.</p><p> lack of adequate sexual reproductive health and outreach services are worsened by climate change and related disasters, she said. Climate finance also often fails to take account of gender equality and women's empowerment. She called on the international community to increase gender-responsive climate, environmental and disaster risk finance, promote women's full participation and leadership in climate, environment, ocean, biodiversity and disaster risk reduction action, and strengthen the capacities of women through accessible training and gender-responsive policies and programmes. It is also vital to ensure women have access to essential services during crisis situations. She also called for increased investment in national gender statistics which ensures gender-disability-geographical disaggregated data in the gender-environment nexus. \"COVID-19 recovery and recovery from recurring natural disasters is an opportunity to reset our global development agenda to one that is climate-resilient, gender-inclusive and leaves no one behind,\" she said.</p><p>VINDHYA PERSAUD, Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co operative Republic of Guyana, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), noted that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States and that its impacts represent a \"code red for humanity\". Reiterating disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met, he noted that women and girls are often disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. There must be a gender perspective when building climate resilience, as well as in the design and implementation of disaster-risk-reduction strategies and recovery plans, he said, calling also for investment to enable the production of gender-specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate. Poverty eradication is central to reducing women's vulnerability to climate change, he added, stressing that climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities should include measures supporting women owned micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the green and blue economies.</p><p>Turning to action to address sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence, he noted that CARICOM nations are encouraging the equal sharing of responsibilities in parenting and household work; engaging community leaders to address discriminatory social norms and gender stereotypes; and adopting robust legislative regimes. Women in the region are also leaders advocating for protection of the environment and implementing home-grown solutions. Highlighting progress in Guyana, he pointed to its low-carbon development strategy, noting that 62 per cent of the jobs it has created are held by women. While women and girls are disproportionately impacted by climate events, they have also been creating innovative solutions to protect the country's valuable ecosystem, including by using drones to monitor environmental activities to ascertain what threats have emerged to the mangroves ecosystem and how responses should be tailored. To promote women's economic empowerment, free, non-traditional technical vocational programmes, with no pre-admission requirements, have been created to provide the necessary training and skills for thousands of women across Guyana.</p><p>PATRICIA KALIATI, Minister for Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare of Malawi, speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), said that at a meeting in February, African Union ministers responsible for gender and promotion of women resolved that the current situation -- marked by a regression of the gains made to advance women's rights and gender equality due to the devastating effects of climate change and environmental disasters coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic -- necessitates taking action. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of all SADC member States. Environmental degradation threatens economic development and directly affects peoples' livelihoods. SADC has established three main environmental policy goals: protect and improve the health, environment and livelihoods of the people of Southern Africa with priority for poor; preserve the region's natural heritage, biodiversity and life supporting ecosystems; and support regional economic development on an equitable, sustainable basis for the benefit of present and future generations.</p><p>When unexpectedly heavy floods displaced more than a million people in Southern Africa in 2007, SADC began to meet annually to prepare for future occurrences, she said. It established a Disaster Risk Reduction Unit responsible for coordinating regional preparedness and response programmes for trans-boundary hazards and disaster. The SADC Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction was inaugurated in 2011. The newly developed SADC Regional Resilience Framework 2020 2030 will guide SADC member States and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of a broad range of resilience programmes. Women in the region account for most of the poorest and most vulnerable due to their general subordinate legal status; limited access to productive resources such as land, technology, credit, education and training, formal employment; as well as their susceptibility to HIV and AIDS. The SADC Protocol on Gender and Development was revised in 2016 to include gender and climate change. She stressed that State parties should, by 2030, develop policies, strategies and programmes to address the gender aspects of climate change, conduct research to assess its differential gendered impacts and put in place effective mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>NTONETTE NCUBE, a youth representative from the European Union delegation, in its capacity as an observer, also spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls. Stressing that climate change, disasters, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss disproportionately affect women and girls, and that crises and disasters exacerbate pre-existing gender inequalities and discrimination, she said women and girls frequently face increased sexual and gender-based violence. They are subjected to harmful practices such as early and forced marriage due to the impact of climate change, disproportionate burden of care work, and restricted access to essential health services. The Group calls for concerted efforts to address these issues and expects the Commission to adopt strong and action-oriented conclusions.</p><p>More specifically, she said, the Group recommends that all stakeholders ensure the gender-responsive implementation of international obligations and commitments, including the Paris Agreement, Lima Work Programme on Gender, Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In that regard, the Group stresses the importance of enhancing women's full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and leadership, she said, underscoring a concrete need to improve data and resources and strengthen coordination and capacity-building. The Group encourages all stakeholders to use comprehensive indicators and pursue the ethical collection and dissemination of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and gender statistics on all dimensions of environmental, disaster risk reduction and climate change issues and sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>MARTA LUCa\\x8DA RAMa\\x8DREZ, Vice President of Colombia, spotlighting the threats to global peace and stability seen over the last two weeks, said that the future will depend on including women's voices. Fifty per cent of the world's population has historically been excluded from power, but gender equality is essential for generating sustainable economic growth. For its part, Colombia has implemented a national policy with five objectives: to provide economic empowerment for women entrepreneurs; to include more women in politics; to involve women in peace and security; to ensure that women can live free from violence; and to establish more gender-based institutions. Noting her status as her country's first female Vice President, she stressed that, when women arrive in positions of power, they must remember to open more spaces for other women \"just as those who came before did for us\".</p><p>She went on to detail Colombia's establishment of a sovereign gender bond to help women-owned businesses recover from COVID-19 -- the first of its type in the world -- and stressed that economic autonomy is essential for women to decide their own futures and live free from violence. The international community must also remember the situation of women living in Ukraine, Afghanistan and other conflict zones as a result of wars \"always declared by men\". It must recall the voices of Afghan women, \"no longer heard in the halls of the United Nations\", which reflects the current multilateral system. And it must always call for the dignity and rights of all women, she urged, highlighting the legal and moral obligation to allow women around the world to rise up with all their creative and transformative might.</p><p>ENSIEH KHAZALI, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs of Iran, said that, during the pandemic, some 12,000 women-headed households have been trained and introduced to the traditional and cybermarkets. Also, more than 1 million women-headed households are covered by the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee. They have benefited from special social protection services including funding and insurance services. Ten million rials in cash subsidies were allocated to 17 million households to reduce economic constraints on families. Supported by the Vice-Presidency for Women and Family Affairs, the women-headed households were prioritized for receiving aid packages, and with the approval of the Cabinet, the amount of loans granted to those households were doubled. Also to protect the environment, 6,000 rural and nomadic women have become members of 2,000 rural and nomadic cooperatives, some of whom have been granted plots of land over the past five years. Iranian women are fighting the effects of unilateral coercive measures, she said, adding that their heroic achievements in various areas have proven that they can withstand various unjust and unilateral sanctions.</p><p>KATRIN JAKOBSDa\\x93TTIR, Prime Minister of Iceland, said that climate change has not spared her island country, with sea levels rising and glaciers melting. \"No country is an island when it comes to climate change,\" she said, stressing that similarly gender inequality plagues all parts of the world. Climate change causes poverty, disproportionally affecting women economically and socially. Climate change also causes instability and creates conditions for gender-based violence. Citing the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, she expressed concern that the conflict will produce mass displacement, which, in turn, creates more cases of gender-based violence. This \"shadow pandemic\" had occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak, she said, calling for attention to gender-based violence caused by the Russian Federation's aggression. There is a need to include young people in social justice and health, as they are the best advocate for their own future. There are many remarkable women activists and human rights defenders in the forefront. \"The world will be a better place with women in the lead,\" she said.</p><p>TANZILA NARBAEVA, Chairperson and Speaker of the Senate of Parliament of Uzbekistan, said the Commission is a catalyst for incorporating gender into all aspects of United Nations work. Expanding the rights of women and girls is a key priority of Uzbekistan State policy, she noted, with a new development plan for 2022-2026 and a national programme to bolster the role of women and girls in the country's future. Addressing climate change, she noted Uzbekistan is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, including the drying of the Aral Sea, which threatens the sustainable development of Central Asia. Reports have further suggested that, between 2030 and 2050, the average air temperature in the region may increase by 1.5C to 3C. Uzbekistan has adopted the broad use of renewable energy, and is working to develop the Aral Sea region, including through women-focused training courses to manage resources and regenerate salinated areas. During the third Central Asian Summit, Uzbekistan advanced the regional programme \"Green Agenda for Central Asia\", and is planting 200 million saplings.</p><p>ZORANA MIHAJLOVIC, Deputy Prime Minister and the President of the Coordination Body of the Government of the Republic of Serbia for Gender Equality of Serbia, said that UN-Women has been a partner of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality for years. They have worked together on gender mainstreaming of climate policies and practices in Serbia, and on ensuring that the normative framework related to energy is gender-sensitive and that climate change finance always includes women's perspective. A new national energy strategy, as well as the National Energy and Climate Action Plan are under way, both of which will be gender-sensitive, because without gender mainstreaming of public policies, the existing gender gap cannot be closed. The Government established the National Coalition on Energy Poverty whose goal is to underline gender gaps in energy poverty. \"The gender-just transition is our chance not only to change our energy sources and to have a cleaner environment, but also to change the perception of the energy sector as a men-dominated sector,\" she said.</p><p>EVELYN WEVER-CROES, Prime Minister of Aruba, speaking on behalf of the Netherlands and its constituent countries of Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten, said that these four countries have been battling the elements for centuries -- \"from North Sea floods to Caribbean hurricanes\" -- and are united in tackling the climate crisis, which is \"the greatest challenge of our time\". The world is unequal, and this crisis is amplifying that inequality. In the Caribbean, the greatest burden of care falls on women and girls when communities are in crisis; however, these individuals remain underrepresented in decision-making at all levels, including at the United Nations. Against that backdrop, she urged full, equal, meaningful and effective participation and leadership for women in adaptation and mitigation processes, along with granting the same equal access to the knowledge and resources necessary to respond to climate change.</p><p>ROBBERT DIJKGRAAF, Minister for Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands, underscored the importance of knowledge in combating climate change, as it is \"the only resource that grows as you use it\". However, the voices, knowledge and experience of women and girls are unheard, as these individuals are underrepresented at all levels, including technical areas crucial to making the necessary energy transition. The world needs the contribution of women and girls, in all their diversity, to ensure a liveable future for humanity. Noting that today's meeting occurs in extraordinary times, he expressed full solidarity with all women and girls living in conflict -- including those in Ukraine -- and condemned the Russian Federation's illegal invasion of that country.</p><p>DERYA YANIK, Minister for Family and Social Services of Turkey, said that a civilization teaches: \"Plant a tree, even if it is your last deed.\" Her country puts great emphasis on environmental protection. Since 2002, it has witnessed remarkable progress as a result. Thanks to the \"Zero Waste\" project, a new era has begun in terms of environmental protection. Women play a major role in the success of this project. In adapting to the Paris Agreement on climate change, Turkey has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2053. An effective fight against climate change requires a political and social atmosphere in which women are resilient, empowered and their rights are ensured. Her country has made significant progress in eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women, adopted priority goals to increase the education level of women and girls, and taken crucial steps in terms of empowering and increasing the participation of women in the labour market. With the \"Gender-Responsive Planning and Budgeting in Turkey\" project, the Government is determined to ensure that women are not ignored and their needs and problems are always visible in budget programmes.</p><p>MAYA MORSY, Minister for Women and President of the National Council for Women of Egypt, said that her country is among those most affected by climate change, despite its very limited contribution to the phenomenon's existence, as Egypt accounts for only 0.6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In light of the impact of climate change on women -- particularly on their health, food security and living standards -- the Government works to implement a sustainable development model and has adopted many initiatives, programmes and projects to promote adaptation and mitigate the effects of climate change, while also promoting women's empowerment. These efforts include: raising women's awareness of rural initiatives and eco-friendly agricultural methods; organizing environmental camps to train women in eco-friendly industries; and raising awareness of sustainable flood-management. She also detailed Egypt's perspective for women, the environment and climate change, affirming the Government's commitment to address climate change and empower Egyptian women in various fields.</p><p>AWATIF HAYAR, Minister for Solidarity, Social Integration and Family of Morocco, outlining her country's efforts on the priority theme, said that national priority focuses on integrating women into environmental policy. This session coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a huge impact on women. Her country is including women in all areas of policy implementation. The 2011 Constitution bases itself on the principle of equality of men and women. Morocco is also working to implement all its international commitments in eliminating discrimination, advancing gender equality and addressing climate change. It has established the 2020-2030 Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation, with a view to archiving gender equality. The Government is undertaking projects with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in the field of green technology. The Government has set a goal of increasing women's economic activity by 2026, she said, also noting that more women candidates won during the 2021 elections than in past elections.</p><p>CHUNG YOUNG-AI, Minister for Gender Equality and Family of the Republic of Korea, voiced concern about the impact of violence on women and girls, many of whom have been displaced or forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. She affirmed that only when the perspectives of women -- who account for half the world's population -- are incorporated into policies and programmes will the world be able to prudently respond to the crisis facing the international community. Her Government formulates a Basic Plan for Gender Equality Policies every five years, and has enforced gender-responsive budgeting since fiscal year 2010. It is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, a designated officer system has been established to support women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The country is also responding to deepening gender inequality in the labour market brought on by the pandemic with a COVID-19 Women's Job Recovery Plan launched in 2021, expanding jobs for women in the public and private sectors. With the help of her ministry, UN-Women has established the United Nations Women Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality in Seoul.</p><p>SUSANNE RAAB, Federal Minister for Women, Family, Integration and Media in the Federal Chancellery of Austria, aligning herself with the European Union, noted that women and men are affected differently by climate and environmental crises and States have to think differently and come up with new solutions. Highlighting measures taken by her country in that regard, she stressed a special focus on the empowerment of women and girls in technology and innovation, to ensure that they equally benefit from job opportunities and increase diversity in those sectors, including through \"Lets Empower Austria\", an initiative which aims to increase the participation of women and girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Turning to the Russian's Federation's invasion of Ukraine, she noted that war leads to an unbelievable suffering for civilians, in particular women and girls. In that regard, she expressed her country's full solidarity with women and girls in Ukraine and those who fled.</p><p>EVA NORDMARK, Minister for Gender Equality, Ministry of Employment of Sweden, associating herself with the European Union, expressed solidarity with those living in conflict situations and other emergencies, including Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia and Ukraine. The unprovoked, illegal and indefensible Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine is having an immense impact on the civilian population there, with a huge number of people, including women and children, forced to flee their homes. \"We all have an obligation to strongly condemn this invasion,\" she said. As a member of the Swedish feminist Government, she noted women's economic empowerment is key to achieving gender equality. \"When you make your own money, you can choose your own life,\" she said, citing political reforms such as parental leave for both mothers and fathers, affordable childcare and individual taxation to help close the gender pay gap. Addressing the urgency of stopping fossil fuel emissions to accelerate a just climate transition, she noted Sweden is producing batteries and the world's first fossil-free steel, creating thousands of new green jobs. As the COVID-19 pandemic has globally increased the risk of women being subjected to men's violence, prostitution and trafficking, the Government has adopted a 99-point Action Programme for preventing and combating violence against women. The blame must be put where it belongs: on the perpetrators. Stressing the importance of sexual and reproductive rights, she said: \"We must continue promoting access to safe and legal abortions, contraceptives and comprehensive sexuality education.\"</p><p>DOMINIQUE HASLER, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein, noted the meeting unfortunately falls under the shadow of a terrible war, condemning the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine. She stressed that all armed conflicts have devastating consequences for civilians, and are a setback for the rights of women and girls, who disproportionately suffer violence, marginalization and exclusion, but show amazing resilience. Their role is key in supporting the international rules-based order; it is not a question of political correctness but a prerequisite for successful and peaceful political processes. Climate change also disproportionately burdens women and girls, and generations to come will note the action -- or inaction -- of the international community on the issue. Addressing the interlinkage between climate change and rights, she noted women lack access to land ownership. Modern slavery and human trafficking increase during and after natural disasters, she stressed, pointing to a blueprint the Government has developed for financial institutions to prevent such crimes through financial inclusion. Liechtenstein has also partnered with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Climate and Environment Transition Fund. Quoting the Secretary-General, she noted that humanitarian emergencies move the clock backwards on women's rights.</p><p>THOMAS BLOMQVIST, Minister for Nordic Cooperation and Equality of Finland, aligning himself with the European Union, condemned Moscow's aggression against Ukraine in the strongest terms, stressing that the war is also a violation of women's rights. \"We must hear the voices of Ukrainian women. As in every conflict, women are critical to achieving sustainable peace,\" he said. Noting the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls, he stressed that climate change is also a gender issue, calling for increased efforts to ensure a gender perspective in all climate, environment and disaster management policies. Highlighting the intersection between climate issues and sexual and reproductive health and rights, he spotlighted the essential importance of universal access to quality comprehensive sexuality education, bodily autonomy, access to clean water and sanitation, and women's economic empowerment, in order to achieve gender equality. To that end, his Government has introduced family leave reform and is also introducing national legislation on pay transparency, he noted. Expressing concern about the increasing sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and hate speech, both offline and online, he emphasized the need to bridge the gender digital divide and eliminate harmful gender stereotypes, including gender bias in artificial intelligence.</p><p>HO JAN TINETTI, Minister for Women of New Zealand, emphasized that women who experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including indigenous women, are among those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and disasters, but also powerful agents of action, change and resilience. As such, the Government of New Zealand is increasingly applying gender and intersectional analysis to all its actions and decision-making, including by promoting the use of an online tool, she said. Noting the data-collection gaps and shortcomings exposed in that process, she stressed the vital importance of gender-disaggregated data to ensuring visibility for the gendered impacts of climate change and natural hazards, and of tailoring responses accordingly. She went on to state that New Zealand is also focusing on enabling an equitable climate transition to a low carbon economy, which entails consideration of the outcomes for different groups in the way climate change policies and programmes are funded and financed.</p><p>LISABETH MORENO, Minister Delegate for Gender Equality, Diversity and Equal Opportunities of France, expressed concern over the fate of women and girls in Ukraine following the Russian Federation's military aggression and underscored the need to preserve the rights and dignity of Ukrainians. Turning to climate change, she pointed out that women are the primary victims of it, and quite often, they are not heard despite \"having something to say\". Gender equality is at the forefront of France's efforts in the European Union, and the Government also works to combat sexual and gender-based violence. National legislation addresses domestic abuse, street harassment and new forms of violence on the Internet, and an ombudsman for public enterprises was established to combat harassment in the workplace. She also emphasized the importance of women's economic independence, noting that the pandemic has revealed the inequality women face in the public and professional spaces. Despite women playing a key role, their contributions are often not seen or valued, and she expressed hope that, post-pandemic, \"parity will be the rule, not the exception\".</p><p>LYAZZAT RAMAZANOVA, Minister for the National Commission for Women, Family and Demographic Policy under the President of Kazakhstan, said her country is committed to all issues on gender equality as women are the main beneficiaries of a clean environment. Kazakhstan is addressing climate change challenges head-on. A transition to the green economy requires significant investment in line with commitments made under the Paris Agreement and the subsequent agreement in Glasgow. Kazakhstan seeks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The Government does not represent the whole picture in this effort, she said, stressing that civil society and businesses are doing their parts. Noting that her landlocked country is far from the ocean and two thirds of its land is desert, she said Central Asian economies like hers must adapt to climate change. Kazakhstan will plant 2 billion trees, with civil society participating in that endeavour. About 80 per cent of civil-society organizations are headed by women. She noted the establishment of a green technology centre in Kazakhstan.</p><p>NNALENA BAERBOCK, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, said an estimated 800,000 women will give birth in Ukraine in the next few months, many without shelter or access to proper care. \"This illustrates clearly that conflicts and crises are not gender-blind,\" she said, stressing that conflicts disproportionately impact women from Afghanistan to the Sahel. The same is true for the climate crisis, she said, urging the Commission to compel States to put women's rights at the heart of climate action. She noted that, during droughts, it is girls who are sent to school less frequently because gender norms dictate that fetching water falls to them. For such reasons, Germany supported the Human Rights Council in recognizing a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right, and it supports efforts to give women and other marginalized groups an equal say in decision-making processes.</p><p>MUSA MAAYTAH, Minister for Political and Parliamentary Affairs and Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for the Empowerment of Women, and Minister of Political and Parliamentary Affairs of Jordan, said the international community must take into account the most vulnerable people to ensure civil society features the participation of women in decision-making processes. Jordan has pioneered mainstreaming gender into State policy on climate change, stressing the importance of measures addressing the root causes of inequality and discrimination and acknowledging the different circumstances of men and women. He also affirmed the Government will work to provide better services to women in humanitarian crises, either through prevention or recovery, and is further taking into account lessons learned from the pandemic, involving women in decision-making related to economic empowerment. He noted that the labour law was amended to provide nursery care for female staff, equal pay and paternity leave, as well as equal pay for equal work.</p><p>RODERIC O'GORMAN, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of Ireland, aligning himself with the European Union, expressed solidarity with women and girls in situations of conflict or other emergencies and pointed out that these individuals are particularly impacted by the same, including in Ukraine. Ireland prioritizes women's empowerment, demonstrated by its international development programming that focuses on social protection, food systems, climate action and the women, peace and security agenda. Spotlighting the link between climate and security, he said that instability and fragility have a disproportionate impact on women. Women's role in addressing the climate crisis is too often overlooked and undervalued, and States must ensure that women's voices are heard at all levels. He went on to say that Ireland, for its part, has pioneered citizens' assemblies as exercises in participatory democracy, and the assembly for gender equality recently submitted its report containing 45 recommendations in this area to the Government for implementation.</p><p>LAILA AL NAJAR, Minister for Social Development of Oman, emphasized the importance of a prominent role for women in national development, noting that they instil the value of tolerance. Noting that his country's Constitution guarantees the rights of women, he said their economic participation is an important goal for Oman. A high percentage of women are now joining the labour market, he added. Pointing out that more women occupy leadership positions in political and public life, he said they are holding decision-making positions in private companies, as well. Oman provides assistance to women entrepreneurs and small business owners engaged in e-commerce, he said, adding that the Government also supports victims of domestic violence. Women volunteer to help those affected in crisis situations, he noted, stressing that their participation is crucial both during normal times and in emergencies.</p><p>MARIANA VIEIRA DA SILVA, Minister of State for the Presidency of Portugal, said that it is fundamental to invest in the production of data disaggregated by sex, on the impacts of phenomena and policies. Environment and energy, agriculture, mobility or urban planning are important sectors in this approach. Since 2021, Portugal has monitored gender equality indicators in its State budget report, including in the field of climate change, with all data produced by the Central Administration to be disaggregated by sex. In the labour market, the Government is integrating more women in key areas of climate transition, whether through training activities in maritime economy, in the management of rural fires, or through the training of women working in the agricultural sector. In the fight against energy poverty, it is reducing the costs of energy and other consumptions, supporting the more vulnerable households, namely single parent families. Legislative measures set minimum thresholds for participation in decision-making positions. Since 2017, the average proportion of women on the boards of publicly listed companies increased from 12 to 29 per cent. In public administration, since 2015, the rate of women senior managers jumped from 32 to 43 per cent. In the Portuguese Parliament, women account for more than a third of representation.</p><p>MEIRAV COHEN, Minister for Social Equality of Israel, spotlighted all the young girls, mothers, sick or wounded women, pregnant women and senior citizens in Ukraine who thought they would never have to experience war atrocities again. Those women must be kept in mind when discussing policy. The gap between the privilege of discussing gender issues and the need to stay alive and protect one's children must be pondered by all. On a national level, she pointed to the presence of many different communities, which presents challenges to promoting women's rights in a \"complex sphere\" where every group lives according to its traditions and customs. Nearly 56 per cent of Israeli women are employed, most of them working mothers. Together with a high birth rate in Israel, Israeli women are burdened by their households much more than their Western counterparts. As a result, her Government's attempt to reduce environmental hazards by restricting the use of disposable housewares was met with strong opposition from Orthodox communities that consist of multi-child families. An attempt to limit disposables with extensive taxing was considered an attack on women in the more traditional household. The women, as sole housekeepers, had to choose between spending more money or having to do more housework. To that end, her country has the complex task of finding the right balances between promoting women's rights while preserving the environment and addressing climate change.</p><p>YANNA WEBSTER-ROY, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister responsible for Gender and Child Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, said the country's National Vision 2030 Development Plan and the National Policy on Gender and Development recognize the importance of holistic, interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches to conserving, developing and safeguarding natural resources. The Policy aims to encourage women and men to play diverse and complementary roles in approaches to climate change and environmental protection. She noted that Trinidad and Tobago ratified the Paris Agreement, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent in the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors by 2030 -- a 103 million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. On gender, she cited the Ministry of Planning and Development, the political head of which is a woman, and the Multilateral Environmental Agreements Network, with women accounting for 58 per cent of the groups and playing a lead role in decision making. The country's Comprehensive Disaster Management Policy further recognizes that disasters and hazards affect women, girls, men and boys differently. Because of their reproductive responsibilities, women are particularly valuable \"change agents\" in the transition to a sustainable economy, and should be trained and supported in adopting new environmentally friendly practices and technologies.</p><p>TAINA BOFFERDING, Minister for Equality between Women and Men of Luxembourg, said that crises -- whatever their nature -- affect each individual differently. In the conflict situation in Ukraine, women and girls must demonstrate resilience and courage while facing unprovoked Russian aggression. In a three-week period, millions have been forced to flee their homes, the majority of whom are women and girls. Also expressing shock over reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by Russian armed forces, she demanded that the Russian Federation \"cease this stupid war\". Turning to women and climate change, she stressed the need to improve the collection of reliable, disaggregated gender data; to place gender equality at the centre of resilience policies and disaster-risk-reduction programmes; and to increase the number of women in decision-making and leadership roles. She added that, for its part, the Government has adopted a feminist foreign policy and its development-cooperation efforts -- to which 1 per cent of Luxembourg's GDP is allocated -- are focusing on new gender strategies, such as increasing financing for projects bolstering women's empowerment throughout the world.</p><p>Right of Reply</p><p>Speaking in the exercise of the right of reply, the representative of the Russian Federation said that many delegates made baseless allegations against his country in their statements today. They ignore the fact that the Ukrainian army has stricken the heart of Donetsk, killing civilians. Since the coup d'etat in 2014, the Ukrainian regime has taken a decision to destroy the Russian-speaking populations in the country's east, where they are being shelled and killed. He wondered why Western countries ignore this situation created by the criminal regime in Kyiv, and instead provide lethal weapons to Kyiv. He reminded the Commission that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) used inhumane weapons in the former Yugoslavia, killing civilians, including women and children, also citing similar actions by the so-called \"peacekeeping\" forces in Afghanistan and Libya.</p><p>Source: United Nations</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG16032022012886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6515-RVB1-JCH9-G4WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 16, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Business &amp;

Korea Times fileBy Jung Da-min, Park Si-soo Nearly 43 percent of North Korean people (11 million) are suffering a chronic food shortage and ensuing malnutrition, a report by five U.N. agencies showed on Tuesday.It was a 2.6 million increase from 10 years ago, the report said, reflecting the North's continuing food insecurity. A major culprit behind these calamities is raging climate extremes in recent years, coupled with natural disasters that wreaked havoc on the North's grain fields. International sanctions were considered another factor.The report is titled 'The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World: Building Climate Resilience for Food Security and Nutrition.' The U.N. agencies involved are the World Health Organization, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund and the Food and Agriculture Organization. 'Analysis in the report shows that the prevalence and number of undernourished people tend to be higher in countries highly exposed to climate extremes,' the agencies said.'Undernourishment is higher again when exposure to climate extremes is compounded by a high proportion of the population depending on agricultural systems that are highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature variability.'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T80-2921-DYTP-W4BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"226\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 12, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X9J</classCode><className>FOOD CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0FD</classCode><className>FOOD SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002088</classCode><className>MALNUTRITION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEFJ</classCode><className>FOOD CRISES &amp;

'This will be a major achievement for multilateralism.'</p><p>At the meeting, 31 additional countries deposited their instruments of ratification for the Agreement, bringing the total to 60 countries that together represent more than 47.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Adopted in Paris by the 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at a conference known as COP21 this past December, the Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future, and to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change. Specifically, it seeks to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, and to strive for 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>The pact - which was signed in New York on 22 April by 175 countries at the largest, single-day signing ceremony in history - will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification. Following today's meeting, formal approval from countries representing 7.5 per cent in global emissions is still needed.</p><p>In early September, the world's two largest emitters, China and the United States, joined the Agreement.</p><p>Noting that he is heartened by the 'tremendous support' for bringing the Agreement into force in 2016, the Secretary-General said that a 'diverse group' of world leaders have committed to ratify and deposit their legal instruments this year. That group includes Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the European Union, France, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Poland and the Republic of Korea.</p><p>'Now, this means we will cross the final barrier for entry into force of the Paris Agreement,' Mr. Ban stressed, appealing to all leaders to accelerate their domestic procedures to join the Agreement this year.</p><p>'When this year ends, I hope we can all look back with pride, knowing that, together, we seized the opportunity to act for the common good, for a sustainable future and the protection of our common home,' he added.</p><p>Nine months since the Paris climate conference</p><p>At the start of today's meeting, the Secretary-General also praised the 29 countries - accounting for 40 per cent of global emissions - that had previously formally joined the Agreement since the signing ceremony, congratulating them for their continued efforts to push forward the pact's entry into force.</p><p>Today will take us one step closer to bringing the Paris Agreement into force this year</p><p>'There is no time to waste. Today will take us one step closer to bringing the Paris Agreement into force this year,' the UN chief stressed.</p><p>Hailing the unprecedented and continued global momentum behind the Agreement, Mr. Ban called on world leaders to capitalize on that momentum to ensure the pact's entry into force and limit climate risks for a healthy planet.</p><p>'The remarkable support for this Agreement reflects the urgency and magnitude of the challenge. Emissions continue to rise. So does the global thermostat - and the risks,' the UN chief said.</p><p>Paris Agreement on climate change</p><p>'Climate impacts are increasing. No nation or community is immune, but the vulnerable are feeling the effects first and worst,' he added.</p><p>He also thanked the countries that deposited their instruments of ratification today, as well as those world leaders who have submitted recorded video messages committing to join the Agreement before the end of the year.</p><p>'I commend this collective display of leadership. Only through such solidarity can we limit climate risks and build a world of peace, dignity and prosperity for all on a healthy planet,' Mr. Ban said.</p><p>In remarks to the media following the high-level meeting this morning, the UN chief highlighted that just nine months have passed since the Paris climate conference.</p><p>'This is testament to the urgency of the crisis we have,' Mr. Ban reiterated, adding that, with the Paris Agreement, 'we have a real chance to reduce global emissions and build climate resilience.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG2109201600017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KSM-24P1-JCH9-G2TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 21, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Undoubtedly, however, the negative effects of climate change are most evident in the area of water.</p><p>Water-related disasters, such as flood and drought, are increasing in numbers and intensity. The annual social cost from flood has increased 15 times since the 1970s.</p><p>The government spends an average of 5.3 trillion won per year on flood-related costs, of which 79 percent is on restoration. Water scarcity is also becoming an alarming issue. It is expected that Korea will be short of 0.8 billion cubic meters in 2011, and 1 billion cubic meters by 2016.</p><p>Building climate resilience, improving water quality and access to water, while at the same time creating jobs in times of economic depression, will definitely be in line with the paradigm of green growth set as the national vision of Korea on Aug. 15, 2008.</p><p>As described in the United Nations report \"Global Green New Deal,\" freshwater infrastructure is one highly recommended project for the global community in the age of climate and economic crises.</p><p>The water crisis is not just a domestic problem, but also a global issue. In particular, countries in Asia top the list of countries that are most vulnerable to water-related damage.</p><p>The melting of the Himalayan glacier, which feeds into many of the rivers in Asia, will most likely have a long-lasting effect on the geo-political structure of the region. Some regions have had a long history of water-related conflicts. Such conflicts will likely be more intensified due to global climate change.</p><p>To many countries in Asia, the key issue on climate change is not about reduction of greenhouse gases, but adapting to the changing climate. Scientists tell us that even if the global community stopped emitting greenhouse gases altogether, we would continue to experience climate change in the future.</p><p>In this regard, it is very timely that the \"East Asia Climate Forum\" is being held in Seoul to discuss how to achieve green growth in this troubling time. It is our hope that this forum will play an important role in sharing knowledge and finding solutions to the water crisis in Asia.</p><p>Just as the remarkable economic growth of Korea in last few decades was a valuable lesson for many developing countries, the revitalization of the four major rivers project and the paradigm of \"Low Carbon Green Growth\" can also be a valuable solution for many countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VT7-74F1-2R6X-1186-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"495\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 28, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001501</classCode><className>RIVERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRAQ</classCode><className>GREEN GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0TN</classCode><className>WATER CRISES &amp;

Yet science and smart policy have the potential in today's world to transform an ordinary household object into a revolutionary innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, I visited an ambitious project to promote energy-saving lighting in China. By phasing out old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs and introducing a new generation of lighting, China expects to cut national energy consumption by 8 percent.</p><p>This can have a profound global impact. Consider this: lighting accounts for 19 percent of world energy consumption. Scientists say we can reduce that by a third or more merely by changing light bulbs.</p><p>A breakthrough like this highlights one of the many ways in which ordinary people and businesses can reduce energy use and cut greenhouse gases. It underscores the essential role that governments can - and must - play in promoting the green economy. And it highlights the special responsibility of the government of China to lead in the global fight against climate change.</p><p>China is one of the world's fast-growing economies. Last year it also became the leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It is clearly important for the world that China pursues sustainable economic and energy policies - those that reduce both emissions and poverty.</p><p>The key is giving a priority to clean energy, which can create new jobs, spur innovation, and usher in a new era of global prosperity.</p><p>Those who embark on this path early will reap rewards. They will be winners in the global marketplace. And assuming that prosperity is shared equitably, they will also strengthen stability at home.</p><p>There can be no argument that China today is a global power. And with global power comes global responsibilities. Without China, there can be no success this year on a new global climate framework. But with China, there is an enormous potential for the world to seal a deal in Copenhagen.</p><p>On September 22, I will convene a summit of world leaders to look at the challenges - and the opportunities - we face in the run-up to Copenhagen.</p><p>At the G8 summit in Italy this summer, it was agreed to reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. I applauded this. But I also said that was not enough. To be credible, we need to match ambitious long-term goals with ambitious mid-term targets, with clear baselines. I will repeat this call in September.</p><p>I will also emphasize that major developing economies have a critical role in the negotiations: Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and, perhaps most important of all, China.</p><p>Already China has devoted a sizable portion of its national stimulus spending to renewable energy and green economic growth. It has become a world leader in wind and solar technology. China's dynamic renewable energy sector is worth nearly $17 billion and employs close to 1 million workers.</p><p>This is impressive, but it is just a beginning. China, for example, has enough wind resources to generate more electricity than it currently uses.</p><p>Imagine the potential. Imagine if, thanks to wind and solar, China could wean itself from coal, which accounts for 85 percent of its carbon emissions. And if China were to do it, so could much of the rest of the world. In so doing, China can serve as a model not only for developing nations, but for the whole world.</p><p>We must also adapt to those climate impacts that are already wreaking havoc on communities, particularly in the least developed countries. Adaptation programs help strengthen climate resilience. Going forward, they should be part of how we do development differently. Mitigation and adaptation are equal partners: one without the other makes no sense. They must be priorities for every government.</p><p>If we have learned anything from the crises of the past year, it is that our fates are interrelated. As Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier this year, \"Issues such as climate change bear on the very survival of mankind. No country can be insulated from these challenges or meet them on its own. The international community should intensify cooperation and respond together.\"</p><p>As we move toward Copenhagen, I urge China to exercise still further the global responsibilities that come with global power. I ask China to act in the global public interest, as well as its national interest. For at the end of the day, as Premier Wen aptly put it, they are one and the same.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W8G-BKY1-2R6X-10NG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"734\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>July 29, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FYE</classCode><className>SCIENCE POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XVJ</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

Many used the occasion to urge that the Forum's independence be maintained, especially in the absence of a global forest convention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'As you know, this issue is evolving swiftly' in the context of growing responsibilities, said Senegal's delegate on behalf of the African Group. The secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests must be considerably bolstered with ambitious supplementary goals. Its independence as a subsidiary of the Economic and Social Council also must be preserved. 'If this is not done, we risk devaluing the efforts of Member States and other organizations that have worked tirelessly in the 27 years since the Rio Declaration [Principles]' on environment and development, he asserted.</p><p>Such calls were echoed by the European Union delegate, who said it is of utmost importance to ensure that the Department's reform not impinge on the Forum's ability to fulfil all its functions as outlined in Economic and Social Council resolution 2015/33. Member States must understand how proposals for the Forum fit into the full picture of the Department's reform. 'We expect more details and a comprehensive picture of the measures envisaged,' she insisted.</p><p>The representative of Australia likewise called for an informed approach, requesting that delegates' views be fully captured in the Chair's summary, which should also be sent to those involved in decision-making on the Forum's future. Unless the Forum is recognized as the competent body for forests, the United Nations risks reverting to a fragmented system unable to realize forest goals. She called for maintaining the secretariat's structure and resources and filling the director position as a matter of urgency.</p><p>On that point, several delegates raised concerns over a proposal to downgrade the Forum's leadership from an executive director to a director position, with Canada's delegate stressing that any such demotion would be a mistake. She urged those making decisions to reconsider such a move.</p><p>Fielding those and other queries raised since the start of the session, Zhu Juwang, Officer-in Charge of the Forum's secretariat, read out the answers provided by Department officials who are in Geneva for the Chief Executives Board meeting. The Department will continue to provide the highest-level support to the Forum and its secretariat in fulfilling its mandates outlined in resolution 2015/33 and the United Nations strategic plan for forests.</p><p>Noting that the Forum's secretariat will continue to report to the Under Secretary General for delivery of the work programme, under the subprogramme on sustainable forest management, he said the director post in the secretariat remains vacant and its functions are being reviewed. Member States will be requested to examine these functions in context of the Department's 2020 budget proposal.</p><p>In an afternoon discussion on the resources available to finance the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network, Peter Gondo of the Forum's secretariat said that, since the sixth session of the Global Environment Facility, $825 million is now expected to leverage $8.4 billion in co-financing. Stressing that 'we still need more resources' to achieve the targets laid out in the global forest goals, he said the secretariat works with 25 countries, with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa, North Macedonia and several others recently added to the list.</p><p>The European Union's delegate raised questions about whether China would cover the full cost of the Beijing office or the differential cost, with the secretariat continuing to cover other costs. As the secretariat is small, he was interested in how the Department would ensure that the two locations do not lead to a loss in efficiency and cooperation, and how any changes in the Forum's leadership in terms of post level would affect the office's management.</p><p>'I'm very puzzled,' said Switzerland's delegate. 'We asked last year for information, but only have an oral report.' Stressing that the China office is not a United Nations office, she called for clarity on what its role would be, as there is no work plan or budget. 'There is a total lack of transparency and this is quite shocking,' she said. 'We require all possible documents, as required.'</p><p>The United States delegate said such an office must carry out its work in a neutral and multilateral manner. The secretariat must provide regular updates on it and invite input from Forum members. Its relationship with the Network must be made clear and its functions carefully chosen. Moreover, Forum Member States should be able to comment on the memorandum of understanding for such an office.</p><p>Australia's delegate meanwhile asked how the potential of the project office can be determined, given the ongoing reforms in the Department, while Ecuador's delegate said middle-income countries face unique financing difficulties and stressed the importance of capacity-building.</p><p>The day also featured two panel discussions, the first on the theme 'Monitoring, assessment and reporting', and the second on 'Means of implementation for sustainable forest management'.</p><p>The Forum on Forests will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 9 May, to continue its fourteenth session.</p><p>Information on Department of Economic and Social Affairs Reform</p><p>The representative of the European Union, reiterated questions posed to the Forum on Forests a day earlier, among them: the options being considered in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs regarding the Forum; the implications of each option on budget, resources and reporting lines; the potential implications on the Forum's representation in various meetings; the Forum's capacity to fulfil its functions will not be weakened regardless of the Department's reform; and plans for fulfilling the director position.</p><p>The representative of Canada said her delegation seeks information on the status of the Department's reform regarding Forum matters. Recalling that her delegation had requested the Department's staff to attend today's session, she said there are questions around whether the subprogramme on forests remain intact as part of the organ; actions and options being undertaken in the context of Department reform; results of the cost-benefit analysis of each option; if there is a merger, how the Department person leading Forum matters would ensure budget and human resources; and if the subprogramme merged into another division, what are the lines of reporting.</p><p>ZHU JUWANG, Officer-in-Charge, Forum secretariat, read out the answers to the questions from senior Department officials who are in Geneva for the Chief Executive Board meeting. The General Assembly will consider the following reform measures, as proposed by the Secretary-General on 28 December 2018, among them: strengthening leadership to respond to the new demands of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; improving data, statistics and analysis to inform decision-making and enhance accountability for results; enhancing capacities for leveraging financing for the Sustainable Development Goals; and strengthening the Department's strategies and mechanisms to enhance external communications and partnerships, including with the private sector and academia. Those measures are being considered to better align Department's expertise with the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>He said the Department will continue to provide the highest level of support to the Forum and its secretariat in fulfilling its mandates outlined in resolution 2015/33 and the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030. The Forum's secretariat will continue to be responsible to the Under-Secretary-General for delivery of the work programme, under the subprogramme on sustainable forest management. The post of director in the Forum's secretariat remains vacant. The functions of the post are being reviewed. Member States will be requested to examine these functions in context of the Department's 2020 budget proposal. The Under-Secretary-General, as Department head, has been delegated to manage resources. The director for the Forum secretariat will be responsible to the Under-Secretary-General for Management of regular and extra-budgetary resources, and its work programme. The allocation of the Forum's resources will continue to be presented to Member States separately in the Department's annual budget.</p><p>The representative of Algeria asked that the secretariat distribute the questions posed to Member States</p><p>The representative of New Zealand highlighted the importance of maintaining the Forum's ability to best promote the strategic plan on forests and the strategic forest goals. He supported its emphasis in the quadrennial work programme, stressing that the Forum occupies a unique space for addressing forest policy and management, given that there is no forest convention.</p><p>The representative of Senegal, speaking on behalf of African States, recalled that the Economic and Social Council created the Forum as a subsidiary body for the conservation and sustainable development of all kinds of forests. The Department must take note of arrangements for the Forum. Its 'striking areas' included the creation of a global financing network for forests, and in 2017, the first United Nations strategic plan on forests. The Department must recognize the Forum as a world-level intergovernmental body which independently deals with various dangers to forests. 'As you know, this issue is evolving swiftly' in the context of climate change, he said, stressing that the secretariat must be considerably bolstered with ambitious and supplementary goals. He requested that the reform process preserve the Forum's independence as a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council and consider the growing responsibilities for its secretariat to strengthen its effectiveness. 'If this is not done, we risk devaluing the efforts of Member States and other organizations that have worked tirelessly in the 27 years since the Rio Declaration [Principles]', he insisted.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the Forum is the only policy forum with universal membership. Citing resolution 2015/33, she said the Forum administers the trust fund, fosters inter-agency collaboration, liaises with countries and stakeholders and works within the United Nations to promote forest conservation. It is of utmost importance to ensure that the Department's reform not impinge the Forum's ability to fulfil all its functions as outlined in resolution 2015/33. Member States must understand how proposals for the Forum fit into the full picture of the Department's reform. 'We expect more details and a comprehensive picture of the measures envisaged,' she insisted, calling for enhanced transparency.</p><p>The representative of Australia called for an informed approach to the Department's reform. Requesting that her views and those of others be fully captured in the Chair's summary, which should also be sent to bodies involved in future decision-making processes that will determine the Forum's future, she welcomed reforms that will bolster the Forum's operations and voiced concern over those not allowing the body to fulfil its mandates. While underscoring the body's unique and special place within the United Nations system, she said there has never been a greater need for a fully functional Forum secretariat.</p><p>At the time it was created, the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017 2030 noted that it came at an unprecedented opportunity to safeguard forests, she continued. 'We have less than 12 years to deliver on the ambitious forest goals,' she said, underscoring that a fully functional secretariat is crucial to the successful implementation of the strategic plan. Emphasizing the breadth of work undertaken by the Forum secretariat, she said it has a valuable role in the collaborative partnership on forests and in work on such high-profile events as the International Day on Forests. 'It is the voice on forests,' she said. The secretariat must be recognized as the competent body for forests, without which the United Nations risks reverting to a fragmented system that is unable to realize forest goals. 'Forests matter', she insisted, and if the secretariat scales down, it risks an erosion of capacity. In such circumstances, the shared vision of a world in which all forests are sustainably managed and provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations will be unachievable. She called for maintaining the secretariat's structure and resources and filling the director position as a matter of urgency. Decisions on the Department's reform must be taken in a fully informed manner with complete transparency to Member States.</p><p>The representative of Nigeria, associating himself with the African Group, recalled the expectations placed on the Forum to deliver on its mandates, stressing that reforms should only strengthen its ability to address future challenges. While noting the responses by the Officer-in-Charge, he said that, of the Department divisions, only those addressing population and development matters were organized along sectoral areas; the others are multisectoral. Greater consultation with Member States would be helpful and he urged the Department to address the recommendations offered by Australia's delegate.</p><p>The representative of China expressed hope that Department reforms will consider the important role played by the Forum and its secretariat in implementing the strategic plan, and both the global goals on forests and the Sustainable Development Goals. Its independent status should be maintained. He expressed hope that the budgetary arrangement will not affect its work and only enhance its ability to fulfil its responsibilities.</p><p>The representative of the United States voiced full support for the Department's reform, pointing to the Forum's work to develop global forest indicators, and a new format and cycle for voluntary reporting. The global forest financing facilitation network meanwhile is supporting the effective use of domestic and international funding, while the collaborative partnership on forests has developed work plans that are aligned with country and donor interests. That not only benefits Member States, but aligns with the United Nations goal to enhance its capacity to leverage financing, and develop external communications and partnerships. The Forum secretariat should continue to be cost-effective, and both equipped and resourced to carry out priority actions. Reaffirming the need to maintain the Forum's ability to fulfil its mandate and role, she reiterated the importance of fulfilling the director position to ensure there is consistent leadership, representation and communication. She expressed support for the positions of New Zealand and the European Union on that matter, adding that such points should be included in the Chair's summary.</p><p>The representative of the Russian Federation emphasized the importance of a fully functional Forum secretariat able to deliver on its role and mandates. 'We have many tasks at hand,' he stressed, citing the elaboration of the work programme and resolution of matters relating to voluntary national contributions and reports. He asked that questions posed be transmitted by the secretariat to Member States.</p><p>The representative of Niger, associating himself with the African Group, pointed to the secretariat's need for resources necessary to fulfil its mandate, stressing that reforms should not impact its ability in that regard. The secretariat cannot be effective and efficient if it is not supported, he said, underscoring Niger's commitment to achieve the goals outlined in the strategic plan.</p><p>The representative of Japan expressed support for the aims of the Department's reforms, which impact the Forum's structure. Yet, Member States were unable to attain full transparency over the administration of the budget, due to a lack of clarity around the director position. That lack of clarity can impact the scope of the Forum's activities and its visibility at various forums. For such reasons, she expressed hope that the issue would be clarified soon and asked that the questions and responses be circulated to Member States for review, adding that it is not clear which options were considered in the cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said forests add major contributions to achieving the 2030 Agenda, and the Forum's work goes much beyond such commitments. It is the only policy forum on forests, and its ability to deliver on its goals must be assured. Its subprogramme is of utmost importance, she said, adding that the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network stands among its most essential services to help countries in transition access sustainable financing. Given that the 2019 climate summit in September will address nature-based solutions, strengthening the Forum's secretariat is essential. All the Forum's sessions have taken care to integrate all the Sustainable Development Goals into its discussions, she said, requesting that the director post be fulfilled.</p><p>The representative of Canada asked the Office-in-Charge to clarify that the director would maintain a direct reporting relationship to the Under-Secretary-General. She also requested that respect be shown to Member States by answering questions throughout the year, reiterating that the decision of director versus executive director is a crucial one. The strategic plan on forests must be transmitted to the world. 'Any downgrading of executive director is a mistake,' she clarified, urging those making decisions to reconsider such a move.</p><p>The representative of Algeria clarified that the Department should provide written responses to the questions raised and include them in the Chair's summary.</p><p>The representative of the major group for children and youth, on behalf of all major groups, expressed strong support for the positions of New Zealand, African States, European Union and others to ensure that the Forum's secretariat remain fully operational. He voiced concern over the steps being taken to diminish its ability to represent the role of forests in global processes. There is a clear need for a functional secretariat to foster communication, which would be a signal for youth, women and civil society as a whole that the international community is taking action to combat current and future problems. He recalled that this is a process in the hands of Member States.</p><p>The representative of the scientific and technological community major group, associating himself with the African Group, European Union, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, voiced concern over the implication of reforms on the secretariat's independence, operational budget and on the morale of its staff, given the decision to downgrade the executive director position. However, he was encouraged by the by the Officer-in-Charge's statement this morning and looked forward to a strengthened Forum.</p><p>The representative of Norway voiced support for the Department's reform, as well as the need for a transparent reform process and a fully functional Forum secretariat. He voiced concern however over the downgrading of the director position, expressing hope that such concerns will be outlined in the Chair's summary.</p><p>Forum Chair BORIS GREGU\u0160KA (Slovakia) said that the secretariat will circulate the package of questions posed by Member States by the end of the morning session.</p><p>The representative of Australia, reflecting on the Officer-in-Charge's response to Canada's question on the reporting function to the Under-Secretary-General, said the director participates in a range of meetings, as well as in both inter- and intra-United Nations processes. If it is not filled at the D 2 level, she asked whether that representation will be undertaken by the Under-Secretary-General.</p><p>Mr. ZHU replied that the director will indeed report to the Under-Secretary-General. Representation at various events would depend on the prioritization of the events.</p><p>The representative of Germany voiced concern that the Forum's secretariat cannot be represented in ordinary meetings abroad, such as the collaborative partnership on forests. The question was not whether the Under-Secretary-General would be represented at certain meetings. Rather, he voiced concern that the Forum secretariat cannot even be appropriately represented at international meetings where directors are present, including in meetings with Governments, where there is a difference between a D 2 and a D 1 post.</p><p>Mr. ZHU said the representatives of Australia and Germany have made important points that will be shared with the Department's management.</p><p>The representative of Argentina asked about the Department reform process, as any reduction in the executive director position would be detrimental to the Forum.</p><p>Introduction of Secretariat Note</p><p>AFSA KEMITALE-ROTHSCHILD of the Forum secretariat then introduced that body's note (document E/CN.18/2019/3), on the agenda item titled 'Monitoring, assessment and reporting on progress towards implementing the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030, including the United Nations forest instrument and voluntary national contributions'. Noting that the document provides an overview of intersessional activities on monitoring and reporting, as well as items for discussion by the Forum, she said its drafters proposed the development of several core definitions, including of the terms 'forest-dependent people', while considering national contexts. Additionally, they requested the development of a platform for the dissemination of information on forest-related issues and greater coordination with national actors. Countries were encouraged to submit their voluntary national contributions to the Forum's upcoming sessions and share best practices, including in the context of the Forum's mandated flagship publication, she said.</p><p>Panel I</p><p>The Forum then convened its first panel of the day, on the theme 'Monitoring, assessment and reporting'. Moderated by Roman Michalak, Programme Manager of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forestry and Timber Section, it featured four panellists: Peter Csoka, Senior Forestry Officer at FAO; Kofi Affum-Baffoe, Production Manager at the Forestry Commission of Ghana; Patrick Kariuki, Deputy Conservation of Forest and United Nations Forum on Forests Alternate Focal Point at the Forest Service of Kenya; and Davia Carty, Strategic Planner and Analyst at the Forestry Department of Jamaica.</p><p>Mr. MICHALAK, citing a challenging global environment for monitoring and reporting on forest-related issues, said many of the indicators being studied are complex and lie 'outside the comfort zone' of many States and sectors. Emphasizing that the main indicators being considered today - namely, the number of forest-dependent people living in extreme poverty and the contribution of forests to food security - are huge topics with broad implications, he said today's panel is an opportunity to learn from delegations about their work and future expectations on those issues.</p><p>Mr. CSOKA, recalling that there is nothing new in the 'global core set of indicators' now being examined, said the data being collected can be used in monitoring multiple processes at the same time - including towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and others. Noting that both the methodology of data collection and the availability of data continues to pose a challenge, he said the Collaborative Partnership on Forests has been working with all Member States to provide support. Participants at the Forum's thirteenth session welcomed progress made on the core set of indicators, while also requesting the development of remaining indicators, as well as more reporting. Providing an overview of efforts to more clearly define the terms 'area of degraded forests' and 'forest-dependent people in extreme poverty', he said the greatest challenges include agreeing on the definition of 'dependence' and 'food security'. Additional considerations include whether national targets should be set for sustainable forest management, similar to the Sustainable Development Goals target allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance (ODA).</p><p>Ms. CARTY, sharing Jamaica's experience with monitoring, assessment and reporting, said it is one of six pilot countries using the Forum's reporting template - aimed at helping countries review and develop national forest policies and tools, generate information for national reports on forest conditions and management and communicate effectively with society and stakeholders. Recalling that Jamaica submitted its voluntary national contribution to the Forum's thirteenth session, she reviewed progress made since 2017 - namely, an expansion of the nation's boundary verification programme; the assessment and mapping of 2,000 hectares of mangrove and swamp forests to transfer for protection; the reforestation and restoration of 1,800 hectares of denuded/degraded forest lands; and the maintenance of 5,600 hectares of forest plantations. A $2 million grant now supports a forest-related alternative livelihoods programme, which encourages agroforestry, bamboo utilization, apiculture, smart agriculture, water harvesting, yam stick production and the production of medicinal and nutraceutical products. While Jamaica amended its national forest policy, she said gaps remain in measuring the socioeconomic impact of forests and their correlation to poverty levels.</p><p>Mr. AFFUM-BAFFOE focused his presentation on Ghana's experience in studying forests' contribution to poverty reduction and food security. Spotlighting a partnership between the Forestry Commission and farmers supporting the planting of trees on the fringes of degraded forest areas, he said its benefits include a 40 per cent share for farmers in the 'standing tree value' and a 5 per cent share for the community. However, not all stakeholders adhere to those terms and there is an absence of a formal mechanism to monitor the programme's contribution to poverty reduction. Also describing the benefits of Ghana's 'Timber Utilization Contracts' for offloading unused trees and logs, he said the programme provides small-scale millers and local carpenters access to timber and generates employment for the rural poor. However, there is a lack of coordination of domestic players in the small-scale value chain and the revenue generated is difficult to quantify. Against that backdrop, he listed several recommendations to enhance the visibility of forest goods and services and their contribution to poverty reduction.</p><p>Mr. KARIUKI, recalling that Kenya submitted its voluntary national contribution to the Forum in 2017, said that report was mainly qualitative as its work is still in the pilot phase. More recently, an analytical study was conducted, leading to proposals for several national indicators. Those relate to: improving livelihoods for forest-dependent people; the contribution of forests and trees to food security; mobilizing significant resources from all sources of sustainable forest management; and increasing forest-related financing from all sources, including the public sector, education, research, multilateral and other external sources. Turning to potential sources of data, he said such existing indicators as the national poverty headcount, per capita income, gender equality index and child poverty can provide insight. In line with the work of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, forest-related data will be collected from across the country's various wards and administrative units, as well as from selected forests. However, he also cited several challenges, including the small, scattered nature of Kenya's forests, limited institutional capacity and the high cost of forest data collection.</p><p>In the ensuing discussion, many speakers agreed that a strong relationship exists between forests, their goods and services and efforts to reduce poverty around the globe. However, in the context of monitoring and reporting, several speakers warned against saddling States with undue or overly complex reporting burdens and called for efforts to avoid duplication and overlap with other reporting processes.</p><p>The representative of the European Union, expressing support for the core set of indicators, said the contributions of forests to poverty reduction and food security should form the basis of an appropriate national census question.</p><p>The representative of Fiji, noting that its national development plan seeks to manage forests in a balanced manner and in line with their natural potential, described specific efforts to study the important impacts of water cachement systems. He also requested support from the Forum in ongoing monitoring and reporting efforts, including to identify data gaps.</p><p>The representative of Argentina, welcoming the development of guides for national reporting, expressed support for the development of a template for national reports which would help countries provide information in a unified format.</p><p>Striking a similar tone, the representative of the Russian Federation called for more clarity on reporting accountability. Noting that voluntary national contributions exist to reflect the participation of the Forum's Member States in achieving the global forest goals, he advocated for the development of a clear, concise and simple template for voluntary contributions, which he said will help avoid misreadings and 'double meanings' while allowing for more accurate comparisons.</p><p>Also speaking were representatives of Ukraine, Republic of Korea and the United States.</p><p>Means of Implementation</p><p>PETER GONDO of the secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests introduced that body's note on 'Means of implementation' (document E/CN.18/2019/4), which covers major developments since the Forum's thirteenth session. Pointing out that, since the sixth session of the Global Environment Facility, some $825 million are now expected to leverage about $8.4 billion in co-financing, he added that a liaison officer was also appointed. Support has been provided to land use projects with a forestry component and four projects were approved under the dedicated grant mechanism for indigenous peoples and local communities. Stressing that 'we still need more resources' to achieve the targets laid out in the global forest goals, he said the secretariat currently works with a total of 25 countries, with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa, North Macedonia and several others recently added to the list. Recalling that an expert group meeting was held in January on the issue of a clearing house mechanism, he said work has begun on a generic modular guide for developing national forest financing strategies and is slated to be finalized in June.</p><p>THOMAS BALDAUF, Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture of Germany, updated the Forum on the expert group meeting of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network clearing house, stressing that its priorities included promoting and assisting members in designing sustainable forest management strategies, and serving as a clearing house and database for existing, new and emerging financing opportunities, and as a tool for sharing lessons learned and best practices from successful projects, building on the Collaborative Partnership on Forests online sourcebook for forest financing. Another priority not covered during the meeting is to contribute to achievement of the global forest goals.</p><p>He said the expert group meeting, held from 9 to 11 January, was attended by 60 experts from Member States, organizations, non-governmental organizations and academia. The objective was to discuss and identify the requirements and elements of information for the development of a comprehensive database on forest financing opportunities. Experts discussed aspects of the clearing house, including existing clearing house databases and sources of data; identification of key users and information providers; modalities of partnerships; and the need for interactive platforms on lessons learned and best practices. The outcome, a chair's summary, included six items, notably on the creation of a database and components to be included in its first phase.</p><p>HOSSEIN MOEINI-MEYBODI, Forum on Forests secretariat, updated on the establishment of its project office for the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network in Beijing. As the secretariat was appointed manager of the Network and the strategic plan, it adopted the four priorities for the Network. At the Forum's thirteenth session, China announced its willingness to host the project office in Beijing. Since then, the Permanent Mission of China transmitted a note verbale to the Department in September 2018, confirming the willingness of the nation to host the office and requesting the Department to prepare relevant drafts and organize initial consultations. A draft memorandum of understanding was prepared, in coordination with the Office of Legal Affairs, and since its November 2018 transmission to China, two consultation rounds had been held, in January and April 2019.</p><p>He said several forestry, foreign affairs, finance and customs administration officials from China participated in those meetings, as had United Nations officials from the Office of Legal Affairs, the Department and the Forum secretariat. Substantive progress has been made on the draft memorandum of understanding, which is expected to be finalized by year-end. The office will aim to enhance the secretariat's work in scaling up the Network's capacity-building ability. The secretariat is the manager of the Network, with the Beijing office as a project office, and will continue to advance the priorities of the Network. The Beijing office has no normative mandate or policy setting role. It will report on its operations and programme activities to the Forum secretariat, which itself will serve as an interface for Member States requesting Network support. The work programme will complement that of the secretariat in relation to the Network, and the office will operate under the supervision of the secretariat director. All programmatic and administrative costs will be covered by the extrabudgetary contribution provided by China - meaning that the office's establishment and operation will have no programme budget implications for the United Nations.</p><p>Statements</p><p>GUO YUFU (China) said the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network is critical to help developing countries mobilize funding and share best practices. That instrument has provided much support in that regard with good results, he said. However, as the Facility faces resource constraints, China decided to support the provision of such assistance by offering to host an office for the Facility in Beijing.</p><p>WINSTON LACKIN (Suriname), pointing out that his is the most forested country in the world, recalled its pledge to cap its forest cover at 93 per cent. Suriname has also called on the international community to provide the required science and technology, expertise, technical and financial support for those efforts. Noting that other developing countries are in the same position, he said 24 per cent of the world's forests - close to a billion hectares - are in high forest low deforestation countries. 'Under a business-as-usual scenario, many of these countries will see their deforestation rates increase sharply as a result of pressures associated with economic development,' he stressed, noting that high forest low deforestation countries have received under $2 billion in climate financing, less than 14 per cent of all funds committed. Calling for more efforts to assist those countries - which absorb more than 25 per cent of the world's human-generated carbon emission and sequester more carbon than logged, degraded and planted forests - he stressed that high forest low deforestation countries should sit squarely at the heart of the Forum's discourse.</p><p>Mr. DAS (India), noting that his delegation has no technical objection with the establishment of a Beijing office, nevertheless asked for more clarity on which challenges with the present system necessitated the office's establishment.</p><p>Ms. POLIAKOVA (Ukraine), pointing out that her country has utilized the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network, welcomed that instrument's efficiency. Asking for more information about eligibility for funding under that instrument, she said the clearing house mechanism should make information on eligibility more widely available.</p><p>Mr. JOHNSON (United States), noting that the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network has provided assistance to 29 countries and five subregional organizations to date, called for additional efforts to study and quantify the results of such financing. Regarding the possible establishment of a Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network office in Beijing, he stressed that such an office must carry out its work in a neutral and multilateral manner. The secretariat must provide regular updates on it and invite input from Forum members. In addition, he said, the relationship between that office and the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network must be made clear, and its functions should be carefully chosen. Forum Member States should be able to comment on the memorandum of understanding for such an office and the latter must fall squarely under all United Nations rules and guidelines. Requesting information about the proposal to use extrabudgetary funds for the Beijing office, he asked whether other locations have also been considered and asked the Secretariat to provide Forum members with a cost-benefit analysis in that regard. In addition, he stressed that maintaining and updating the clearing house mechanism should not include any new reporting requirements.</p><p>Mr. YIMAM (Ethiopia), calling for action to advance both the Sustainable Development Goals and the global forest goals, said such action must be tantamount to the scale of the challenges. Ethiopia is aligning its national efforts with the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030, while also ensuring its continued economic growth. Among those efforts, he said, the Government is providing more space for the private sector to engage in sustainable forest management, including through commercial planting. Ethiopia requires sustainable, predictable support from the international community in that regard, he said, spotlighting the disproportionate impacts of climate change on developing countries.</p><p>Mr. GRLAS of the European Union said the global forest goals will only be achieved through good governance, the active involvement of all stakeholders and the enhanced mobilization of and access to financing. Spotlighting the need for a Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network that is effective and transparent, he described that instrument as a 'success story' that has not overlapped with or duplicated the efforts of other mechanisms. In that context, he called for a strong, collaborative partnership on forests to support the Network - as well as efforts to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency - and expressed support for the development of the clearing house mechanism. Among other things, he also echoed calls for a cost-benefit analysis of the establishment of a new office in Beijing and requested more clarity regarding the funding of such an office.</p><p>Ms. VERMONT (Switzerland) echoed calls for more information about the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network's support, as well as on the establishment of the proposed Beijing office. 'We don't quite understand what the role of that office will be,' she said, citing a 'shocking' lack of transparency on the matter and recalling that relevant information was previously requested by the Forum.</p><p>The representative of Costa Rica, echoing the statement delivered by the representative of Suriname regarding the special needs of high forest, low deforestation countries, said those nations require greater support. The question of funding should lie at the heart of the Forum's discussions, he said.</p><p>Mr. KABENGELE (Democratic Republic of the Congo), associating himself with Suriname and Costa Rica, agreed that the contribution of high forest low deforestation countries to achieve an appropriate climate balance has not been recognized by the international community. Their needs should be a higher priority for the Forum, he stressed.</p><p>Mr. REMAOUN (Algeria) recalled that the decision to establish a new Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network project office lies with the Secretary General and thanked China for its offer to host such an office.</p><p>Ms. MANTHE-TSUANENG (Botswana) expressed gratitude for the support provided by the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network to her country's sustainable forest management efforts.</p><p>ALISON SOLANGE GRA\u00d1A CORONEL (Ecuador), associating herself with the representatives of Suriname, Costa Rica and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, described her country's 'zero net deforestation' policy and its commitment to the United Nations strategic plan for forests. However, she agreed with other speakers that developing countries require support in accessing financing for such work.</p><p>Ms. MOTOYAMA (Japan), echoing many of the concerns raised by the United States representative regarding the establishment of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network office in Beijing, asked the Secretariat whether it has examined similar case studies in which main offices are separated from Headquarters - many of which have resulted in significant extra costs and duplication. She also expressed support for proposals to conduct cost-benefit analyses of various options for such work.</p><p>Mr. MAHMOUD (Malaysia) said his country continues to face challenges in accessing the necessary resources for sustainable forest management. The Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network should negotiate with the Green Climate Fund on terms and conditions, he said, adding that the former should continue to assist developing countries in accessing funds from all sources.</p><p>Mr. DRANIBAKA (Fiji) described the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network as a 'great tool for making things happen' in the implementation of sustainable forest management initiatives. He also associated himself with the statement delivered by the representative of Suriname.</p><p>Mr. MAHONEY (Australia) said the possible establishment of a new office in Beijing is a novel initiative and posed questions about its relationship with the reform of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.</p><p>Mr. MOEINI-MEYBODI of the Forum secretariat, speaking on the idea to assess progress achieved by the Network in mobilizing funding for forests, said his office has discussed it but has not yet acted on the idea. Noting that it has collected data on the projects undertaken by the Network - which is different than funding - he said it takes time for a project to be reviewed by multilateral funding institutions, which have their own procedures. While the secretariat is doing its utmost to involve the implementing or accredited agency in the process from the start, in some cases, such efforts were not successful. Even when such agencies were involved from the start, they had different priorities which created problems, as they need time and resources to review a project concept note and understand whether it aligns with its own priorities. The secretariat is working with members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests to more easily transmit funding documents to financing institutions while respecting the priorities of the Governments involved.</p><p>Regarding the Network clearing house, he pointed to the expert groups meetings and various side events focused on that issue. The secretariat is aware of the huge mandate given to it by the Forum and acknowledges that its capacity is 'not sufficient at all' to fulfil its mandate. Thus, it is working closely with all Collaborative Partnership on Forests member organizations and data providers, including International Aid Transparency Initiative, FAO, Global Environmental Facility and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 'Definitely our work is not going to duplicate their work,' he said. Rather, it will use existing capacity, where it exists, and not reproduce data. 'This is a collaborative exercise.'</p><p>On the proposed project office, he said the first consultation in January was held at a time when the secretariat note was being finalized. Noting that the United Nations set the deadline for document submission, he said the process started late, with the draft memorandum of understanding submitted only one month before the end of 2018. The second consultation was held only three weeks ago. He took note of the request to share information and would consult with the Office of Legal Affairs on that process and precedent.</p><p>Explaining that the Beijing project office would support the capacity development activities of the Network, he said the secretariat is accountable to the Forum on the Network's performance and would report to it on the project office, should it be established. The Beijing office would be considered a United Nations office, meaning that all requisite standards for recruitment, salaries, immunities, privileges and access would be applied. It would operate under the supervision of the secretariat director, and regardless of any changes that might emerge from the Department's reform. Its budget and staffing table are still being discussed, and China would cover the entire cost of the office. The Department's capacity-building office would be in charge of its administration and related matters, including authorizing the allocation of resources and activities.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said she is still puzzled about share of work between two locations. Switzerland is big contributor to the Network and until matters concerning the office are clear, it will not be able to make any contributions to the trust fund. To encourage donors, all the information must be clear, open and transparent. There can be no expectation of contributions to the Network's fund without having precise lines of communication and understanding of 'who is doing what'. The situation must be sorted very quickly.</p><p>Mr. MOEINI-MEYBODI replied that the secretariat has taken note of the requests to share information on the memorandum of understanding and must seek guidance from the Office of Legal Affairs. 'We'll come back to you hopefully before the end of this session,' he said. 'We are in your hands. Whatever you decide, we will follow,' as there is nothing the secretariat can do without Member State support.</p><p>Mr. RATNAYAKE (Sri Lanka) said one of the biggest challenges facing developing countries is a lack of data. Specific indicators are needed for which data can be collected by forest officers or generated by citizens, he said.</p><p>Ms. WHELAN (Canada) expressed support for the development of the core set of indicators, as well as the relevant explanatory notes. Regarding the flagship publication, she cited several timing challenges and proposed that the latter be launched to coincide with the World Forestry Congress in 2021.</p><p>Mr. VAN OPZEELAND (New Zealand), noting the importance of the expert meeting, said the ability to report accurately and widely on forests is crucial to achieving the sustainable development targets. He voiced support for the development of an iterative set of core indicators, wherein refinements can be added. On the flagship report, he joined Canada's representative in voicing concern about the timing of its release and echoed support for the proposal to launch it at the World Forestry Congress in 2021.</p><p>LEI JINGPIN (China) echoed expressions of support for the development of a core set of indicators. Highlighting some related technical issues, she said 'different indicators have different definitions' which could affect their interpretation and evaluation. The accuracy and availability of data is critical, she said, adding that data can be divided into two categories - namely, quantitative or descriptive. Also underlining the importance of operability, she called for the provision of transparent, scientific means to carry out sustainable forest management.</p><p>Mr. SOUST (Uruguay) said his country is actively preparing its forest mapping, data collection and inventory. It formulated national policies aimed at protecting the nation's forests, which have resulted in positive results. Uruguay is committed to continue such efforts, he said, urging stakeholders to ensure that the relevant data collection tools continue to improve.</p><p>Mr. MAHONEY (Australia), welcoming efforts to support Member States in delivering their national voluntary contributions, asked for Mr. Csoka's input on how the core set of indicators can help define the operational processes related to Tier 3 indicators. Among other things, he agreed with the proposal to launch the flagship publication at the World Forestry Congress and requested more information about efforts to convene an advisory committee on that publication.</p><p>Mr. OGAWA (Japan) said each Member State should be able to share the data in its voluntary national contribution as it chooses, as the purpose of reporting is not to compare the efforts of countries. National reporting should seek to explore progress made, the process should seek to avoid duplication and the reporting burden of countries should be reduced, he said.</p><p>Ms. CORONEL (Ecuador), describing her country's data collection and reporting efforts, underlined the importance of having clear, available data in land use, land planning and other spheres. 'We need an alliance that will enhance cooperation,' she stressed, as well as efforts to democratize new technologies for developing and middle-income countries.</p><p>ERICA DI GIROLAMI of the children and youth major group said voluntary national contributions should include the contributions of young people. Proposing more collaborations with universities, she spotlighted many potential benefits of such partnerships and called for more attention to new technologies and design.</p><p>LISA JANISHEVSKI of the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat underlined the importance of aligning sustainable forest management efforts with efforts to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Also spotlighting ongoing preparations for the post 2020 biodiversity framework, she said all relevant reporting should make use of data on gross deforestation and other critical issues.</p><p>Panel II</p><p>The Forum then convened the second panel discussion of the day on the theme 'Means of implementation for sustainable forest management'. Moderated by Sibylle Vermont, Senior Scientific Officer at the Federal Office for the Environment of Switzerland, it featured two panelists: Marilyn Headley, Chief Executive officer and Conservator of Forests at the Forestry Department of Jamaica; and Avhashoni Renny Madula, Director of Forestry Regulation and Oversight at the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of South Africa.</p><p>Ms. HEADLEY recounted Jamaica's experience with the Network, explaining that the country completed its national action plan, which dovetails with its climate resilience forest sector plan. The process involved all forest sector stakeholders. The Government also looked at devising a strategic forest financing plan. At the time, the Network had come into play, so Jamaica applied for assistance in devising and implementing its national strategy. The Network approved its request and Jamaica now works with a consultant. It is preparing a concept note that will lead to a project identification form to manage mangroves. By July, it should have its financial strategy in place to implement its national action plan.</p><p>Mr. MADULA said South Africa's situation is strikingly different from that of Jamaica in the sense it only now has started to engage with the Network. It held a stakeholder engagement capacity-building workshop to prepare proposals that it then submitted to multilateral funding agencies. That process had brought together various stakeholders, including a national focal point. While South Africa has resources to ensure implementation of the forest instrument and the United Nations strategic plan on forests, in started a process over the last year to help it improve its data, which involved a review of national forest resource assessment. Two pilot projects were carried out in two districts. 'Sustainable forest management is quite an expensive exercise,' he said, especially in an underperforming economy and budget cuts across the board. It approached the Network for funding that would allow it to scale up those projects.</p><p>When the floor was opened for delegates to share experiences in approaching the Network for funding, the representative of the Philippines said that, for nearly 10 years, sustainable forest management initiatives have been locally funded, often with ODA and funding from the Global Environmental Facility, focused on the provision of technical assistance. It also introduced into its environmental impact assessment system a condition for linking projected carbon generation to offset activities.</p><p>The speaker from the scientific and technological community major group said the Network is restrictive in that it does not extend support to non-State actors, a major stumbling block for major groups. He pressed the secretariat to set up a fund for carrying out such activities and invited donor countries to support the interventions outlined in a work plan produced at a recent expert meeting in Nairobi.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG0905201900003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W30-P3V1-F00C-641R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Forest Lands</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTkzOTc4NEQ2MTQwNDg0Q0E0NDNFRkRDRDU1QUE0OEU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Forum Selection</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzU3NTA0MDAwRTQwNDJENEFDMEFENTI0ODZEMUEwMkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzY4MUJFQkI2ODRDNDYzOTlDMUMzNTAwOTcyNEI4NzY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

From the melting of polar ice caps to the meltdown of financial markets, numerous challenges compete for our attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With every challenge that arises, however, new opportunities open. What is needed is to expand our field of vision and to act boldly to seize the moment. Now more than ever, we need to come together as a global community and expand our horizons to embrace common solutions to common problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year we have an unprecedented opportunity to address two of the most vexing challenges of our time - climate change and sustainable economic growth. The good news is we can tackle both at once, as solutions to the climate crisis can catalyze the green growth that is the foundation of long-term economic prosperity. Through global green stimulus packages, coupled with a new global climate change agreement to be negotiated in Copenhagen this December, the world has its best chance in decades to make serious progress on both the climate and economic fronts.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Climate change: the defining challenge &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>I have called 2009 \"the year of climate change.\" No issue better demonstrates the need for global solidarity than climate change, the defining challenge of our generation. No issue is more essential to our future survival as a species. And no issue is more fundamental to long-term national security and sustainable prosperity.</p><p>Climate change is now accelerating at a pace and scale that requires urgent attention from the highest levels of government.</p><p>Scientists say the pace of global warming is accelerating. According to evidence presented in March at a major international scientific congress, the window for action on climate change is closing perhaps even faster than had been supposed only two years ago.</p><p>According to these scientists, continued high rates of greenhouse gas emissions are now leading to trajectories at the high end of case scenarios outlined by the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which remains the scientific standard for climate science. Evidence presented at the congress on ice melt in Greenland, changing dynamics in the polar ice sheets, and increasing warming and acidification of the oceans is deeply disturbing. It heightens the already stark conclusions of the report by the Nobel-prize winning IPCC.</p><p>Unfortunately, time is not on our side. The clock is ticking and cannot be turned back. Carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere today will remain resident for decades, if not centuries. Today's energy investment decisions will lock in the world's emissions profile for years to come. That is why it is crucial we act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Nobel-prize winning IPCC has warned that global emissions need to peak by 2015 and decline thereafter if we hope to keep the global average temperature increase within 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say is the tipping point to avoid catastrophic damage from climate change.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Impacts and adaptation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>Climate change affects us all, but it does not affect us all equally. Indeed it is the poorest and most vulnerable members of society - those who have done least to contribute to global warming - who are bearing the brunt of the impact today. For example, between 2000 and 2004, an average of one in 19 people each year living in the developing world was affected by a climate disaster. The comparable figure for OECD countries was one in 1,500 people.</p><p>Climate change is not some distant, futuristic scenario. The number of recorded disasters - where the impact of a natural hazard event overwhelmed coping capacity - has doubled from approximately 200 to over 400 per year over the past two decades. Nine out of every ten disasters recorded are now climate related. Even if no single weather event can be definitively attributed to global warming, the trends cited by the IPCC are clear.</p><p>Millions of people are already suffering from the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, more frequent and prolonged floods, droughts, more intensive storms, and sea level rises. Hundreds of millions people could be seriously affected if we do not act immediately to reduce emissions and strengthen our resilience to climate change.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of cities with populations greater than five million are in low-lying flood-prone areas. Three-quarters of these are located in flood-prone, densely populated river deltas in Asia or in low-lying small island states. Nearly 634 million people - one tenth of the global population - live in at-risk coastal areas just a few meters above existing sea levels.</p><p>Developing nations will need increased financial support to protect the poorest and most vulnerable from these and numerous other climate-related impacts. But emerging economies and industrialized nations will also have to adapt to climate change. No nation will be immune. Adaptation cannot be seen as an additional expense.</p><p>Indeed, it is an essential investment in our collective future. While we cannot turn back the clock on GHG emissions already in our atmosphere, we can take simple measures today that will reduce their adverse impacts, strengthen community resilience, save lives, and prevent the pauperization of millions.</p><p>We must act quickly given the demands of science and the escalating cost of climate change - in both lives and livelihoods - as already evidenced today. Doing so will not be easy. It will test our maturity as nations and as a global community.</p><p>Leadership at the highest level is now needed to protect the planet, save lives, and build a more sustainable global economy for all. Climate change is much more than environmental issue. It is an energy, finance and security issue. Indeed, it is a Head of State issue.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Sealing a deal in Copenhagen &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>To that end, I urge world leaders to do all they can to see that climate negotiations are pushed forward and accorded top political priority so that we reach agreement on a new climate framework in Copenhagen this December.</p><p>In Copenhagen, the world's governments will meet to seal the deal on a climate change agreement that must be ambitious, fair and effective in reducing emissions while assisting countries as they adapt to the inevitable effects of climate change.</p><p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen will be a watershed moment in history. It is the moment where we must transform crisis into opportunity, and set the world on a safer, more prosperous path to green growth.</p><p>Two years ago in Bali, the 192 Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change committed themselves to launching negotiations on strengthened action against climate change. This process is to culminate in an ambitious negotiated outcome at the end of 2009, which needs to enter into force before January 2013.</p><p>This leaves just nine months to conclude one of the most complicated international negotiating processes ever. In order to get all parties to seal a deal, five key political issues must be resolved. First, there must be ambitious, mid-term emission-reduction targets for industrialized countries. Without such targets, developing countries will not have confidence that industrialized countries are willing to take the lead on solving a problem that they did most to cause.</p><p>Second, major developing countries will need to define the extent of mitigation actions they are willing to undertake beyond what they are already doing. Third, coming to resolution on the question of finance is crucial. We need clarity on how the significant financial resources will be generated to help developing countries both limit the growth of their emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. A variety of tools can be used, including emissions trading and market-based mechanisms as well as inter-governmental assistance. Fourth, there needs to be an efficient institutional mechanism for disbursing these funds and an equitable, accountable governance structure.</p><p>And lastly, an ambitious adaptation framework must be established that will bolster the climate resilience of vulnerable countries and protect lives and livelihoods.</p><p>The benefits of sealing a deal in Copenhagen will last for generations. With an agreement in hand, governments and businesses will have the signals needed to unleash investments in green technologies and clean energy. By sealing a deal, we can power green growth today and protect our planet for our children and their children to come.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; National stimulus packages: Catalyzing green growth &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>Of course, the climate crisis is not the only challenge confronting us. The economic crisis has sapped our confidence and caused millions to fear for their jobs, their homes, and even their next meal. The global recession unfortunately has caused some to cast doubt on the wisdom of tackling climate change with the urgency and resources required.</p><p>I take precisely the opposite view. Today's financial crisis is not an excuse for inaction on climate change. To the contrary, it represents an unprecedented opportunity to redirect government stimulus packages into green energy options and to fundamentally retool our global economy so that long-term, sustainable growth is accessible for all.</p><p>In my travels, I am heartened to see that the path to a greener, lower-carbon future already is being forged in dozens of countries, including the Republic of Korea. From investments in renewable energy and flex fuel vehicles to reforestation, countries everywhere are realizing that green is not an option, but an imperative for recharging their economies and creating millions of jobs.</p><p>Fiscal stimulus packages now being proposed to jumpstart economic recovery are a critically important tool for greening the global economy. </p><p>No nation has shown more commitment to pursuing this low-carbon path via national stimulus packages than the Republic of Korea. Some 80 percent of its $38 billion fiscal stimulus package is dedicated to green measures, the highest percentage in the world. Under full implementation, this represents an investment equal to some 3 percent of gross domestic product. The Republic's commitment to greening its economy represents nothing less than a fundamental shift in its approach to building the nation's prosperity.</p><p>In total, nearly one million green jobs will be created over the next four years, including:</p><p>n A $7 billion investment in mass transit and railways is expected to generate 138,000 jobs. </p><p>n The $5.8 billion in energy conservation in villages and schools - 170,000 jobs</p><p>n More than $1.7 billion in forest restoration stimulus - over 130,000 jobs</p><p>n $690 million in water resource management stimulus - over 16,000 jobs</p><p>n $10 billion investment in river restoration will generate nearly 200,000 jobs</p><p>The world is also looking to the Republic of Korea to demonstrate leadership in another key area of climate action: emission reductions. As a powerful emerging economy, the Republic of Korea can serve as bridge between industrialized and developing countries by setting ambitious emission reductions goals for itself.</p><p>In this way, the Republic of Korea will again serve as an influential model for other emerging economies and help pave the path toward an agreement in Copenhagen.</p><p>Of course, the Republic of Korea is not the only nation to jumpstart green growth through its national stimulus packages. China, Japan, the United States, Brazil and others have launched similar efforts.</p><p>China is expected to spend $586 billion on a fiscal stimulus package, of which an estimated $140 billion is earmarked for green investments. Its green investment package is likely to boost further its $17 billion renewable energy sector, which already employs some one million people.</p><p>Of the more than $800 billion in stimulus spending in the United States, some $100 billion is directed toward greening the economy, including investments in public transport and energy efficiency, nearly $20 billion for renewable energy and $11 billion to modernize the electrical grid. An estimated 2.5 million green jobs will be generated.</p><p>All this and more is needed. These stimulus investments represent a once in a generation opportunity to power green growth today and to move toward a lower-carbon, resource efficient society tomorrow.</p><p>While the amounts invested may seem large, when set against the $300 billion a year the world currently spends on energy subsidies - the vast majority for fossil fuel sources - it is clear we have a long way to go. By far the largest amount is spent by developing economies with subsidies in 20 non-OECD countries totaling $220 billion.</p><p>Cancelling these subsidies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by as much as 6 percent and add 0.1 percent to global GDP, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The financial savings could also be redirected to investments in clean energy R&amp;D, renewable energy development and energy conservation, further boosting economies and employment.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Power green growth, protect the planet &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>We can transform the climate crisis into a catalyst for launching the green economy of the 21st century. Given the quickening pace of global warming, we may not have another chance.</p><p>The recent economic crisis has shown we need a new path - a more sustainable, energy efficient, and lower-carbon path. The United Nations will do its utmost to help Member States along this path, and is fully committed to supporting countries as they implement both existing and future climate agreements. We must work together to seal a deal in Copenhagen and catalyze the green economy of the future. The science demands it, the world economy needs it, and the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people depend on it. Together, we can power green growth and protect the planet.</p><p>By Ban Ki-moon/United Nations Secretary-General</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VF8-NSV0-Y9SF-60C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 13, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Business &amp;

On the same day, some 1,700 miles due north, I gathered with global leaders and climate experts at the third One Planet Summit (OPS) in Nairobi, Kenya. The two scenes could not have been more different - or more closely linked.The humanitarian emergency triggered by Idai continues to unfold. Beira, Mozambique, with its 500,000-plus residents, bore the brunt of the cyclone's impact. But the consequences extend much further, not least because Beira is home to the main port for some of its regional neighbors, including landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe. An inland lake the size of Luxembourg is now displacing hundreds of thousands of people across all three countries.At a time when climate change is making catastrophic weather events more common, Idai amounts to a stark reminder of our collective responsibility to boost resilience, especially in the most vulnerable areas. After all, as Beira's severely strained budget makes clear, the costs of waiting for disaster to strike are much higher. According to Lloyd's City Risk Index, even in a conservative scenario, climate-related risks could cost cities $123 billion annually, on average, in lost GDP.The challenge will be compounded as the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture and other rural livelihoods accelerate already-rapid urbanization. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of urban dwellers, already in excess of 470 million, is set to double over the next 25 years. By 2050, the region is expected to account for 20 percent of the world's urban residents.But rapid urbanization can also serve as an opportunity to build climate-resilient cities. To make the most of it will require mobilizing large amounts of investment in areas like climate-smart water management, clean transport, and green buildings.Mobilization of climate finance was a central theme at this year's OPS, with Africa being the main region of focus. The participants, who included some of my World Bank Group colleagues, as well as heads of state, civil-society organizations, and private-sector actors, proposed the Africa Pledge, which contains a set of commitments aimed at accelerating climate action that serves the continent's people.As part of the Africa Pledge, the World Bank announced that it will deliver $22.5 billion in new climate financing to Africa from 2021-2025. This financing, combined with the World Bank Group's Action Plan on Adaptation and Resilience, better positions African countries to unlock investment opportunities and manage the risks of a changing climate.Even with such financing from international institutions, however, the costs of building climate resilience will far exceed public budgets. Mobilizing private capital will be crucial to close the financing gap, and here the role of the International Finance Corporation - the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries - is essential. In particular, the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has been developing and implementing innovative financing products, such as green bonds and carbon credits, to enable private-sector actors to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation efforts.The green-bond market alone, after a decade of rapid growth, is poised to exceed $180 billion this year, and the IFC is eager to help the world seize the unrivaled opportunity in climate finance that this market represents. In 2016, the IFC created the Forests Bond, a first-of-its-kind instrument that gives investors the option of being repaid in cash or carbon credits that can be used to support forest conservation. And last year the IFC launched the world's largest green-bond fund dedicated to emerging markets, the Amundi Planet Emerging Green One fund, committing $256 million to increase the capacity of emerging-market banks to fund climate-smart investments. Such efforts earned the IFC the title of Green Bond Development Bank of 2018 at this year's Green Bond Pioneer Awards.But even with the most innovative instruments, sufficient private investment will not be forthcoming if governments do not create the right conditions. To attract private investment to climate-smart projects and generate a viable project pipeline, African cities and countries must improve their creditworthiness and boost project bankability.The rewards of such efforts would be enormous. A recent IFC study, Climate Investment Opportunities in Cities, estimates that emerging-market cities could attract more than $29.4 trillion in cumulative climate-related investments by 2030 in six key sectors: green buildings, public transportation, electric vehicles, renewable energy, climate-smart water systems, and waste infrastructure and management. Of that, $1.5 trillion would go to Sub-Saharan Africa.Of course, the specific composition of investment opportunities depends on local contexts. For example, this year's OPS host, Nairobi, has investment potential of $8.5 billion, including $5 billion in electric vehicles.Some governments might be tempted to channel investments toward other development objectives that promise tangible short-term benefits, such as poverty eradication and education. But, if these gains are to last, they must be secured alongside progress on building climate resilience. Otherwise, disasters like cyclone Idai will continue to wash away people's lives, livelihoods, and futures.</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alzbeta Klein is director and global head of climate business at the International Finance Corporation.

Metech Holdings CEO Chanmok Park (right) and Lee Hang-rim, owner of Lee Hyun Farm in Haenam / Courtesy of Metech Holdings  In a transformative step for sustainable agriculture, Korea\u2019s National Assembly has passed the \u201cAct on Transition and Support for Carbon Neutrality in the Korean Native Beef Industry\u201d (commonly known as the Hanwoo Act) on July 3. This pivotal legislation underscores the government\u2019s commitment to reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and opens new opportunities for innovation in climate technology.  Metech Holdings, a leading climate-tech startup specializing in livestock methane reduction, stands at the forefront of this shift. The company\u2019s groundbreaking research in ruminant methane mitigation\u2014including the world\u2019s first ingestible \u201cMethane Capsule\u201d for real-time monitoring\u2014positions it as a key player in the implementation of the Hanwoo Act.  \u201cThis legislation marks a new era for the Korean beef industry and a turning point for climate resilience,\u201d said Chanmok Park, CEO of Metech Holdings. \u201cWe are proud to contribute to the nation\u2019s carbon neutrality goals by providing practical, science-based solutions that benefit both the environment and the agricultural economy.\u201d  The Methane Capsule developed by Metech enables real-time tracking of methane emissions in cattle, allowing for targeted interventions and improved environmental outcomes. With the passage of the Hanwoo Act, such technologies are expected to gain broader adoption across the livestock sector.  The legislation includes provisions for transitional support and incentives aimed at helping farmers reduce carbon footprints while maintaining productivity. As a recognized innovator in the field, Metech Holdings is expected to play a significant role in deploying scalable solutions that align with these national goals.  This development is also anticipated to attract increased attention from investors and international partners interested in sustainable food systems and next-generation agri-tech.  \uc800\uc791\uad8c\uc790 \u00a9 Korea IT Times \ubb34\ub2e8\uc804\uc7ac \ubc0f \uc7ac\ubc30\ud3ec \uae08\uc9c0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNKOR-57162640740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNKOR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G70-1SJ3-S30N-N28B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"398\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Korea IT Times</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Korean</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 8, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>KOREAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>KOREAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Korea</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>Business &amp;

Under this agreement, Bureau Veritas will serve as a verification partner for BRI across key emerging markets in Latin America, Africa, and East Asia and the Pacific.  An innovation of IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, BRI is a web-based framework designed to help developers, investors, and policymakers identify risks to buildings posed by natural hazards and assess, improve, and disclose their resilience. Through this partnership with Bureau Veritas, BRI users will gain greater access to high-quality, third-party verification of climate-resilient construction practices, expanding trust and adoption of the tool in vulnerable regions where business continuity is increasingly threatened by extreme weather and related hazards.  \u201cWe are delighted to become a Global Verifier of the Building Resilience Index. As climate phenomena intensify, it has become essential to integrate climate change adaptation into assets strategy. The signing of our global agreement with the International Finance Corporation marks a crucial step,\u201d said Marc Roussel, Executive Vice President, Urbanization and Assurance at Bureau Veritas. \u201cBureau Veritas has a long history as an independent third party mitigating natural and climate risks. Our network of experts will add a layer of trust so that stakeholders can rely on Building Resilience Index to evaluate vulnerability and effectiveness of adaptation strategies, worldwide.\u201d  In recent years, physical risks such as floods, cyclones, heatwaves, fires, earthquakes and landslides have posed major threats to business operations, disrupting supply chains, displacing workers and jobs, hurting productivity, and impacting insurance and financing terms. The BRI-Bureau Veritas partnership responds to a growing demand from businesses and governments for reliable tools that support risk mitigation, asset protection, and long-term economic stability.  \u201cAs businesses face increased risks to assets and infrastructure from natural disasters, the ability to assess and verify resilience is becoming a crucial element of operational and investment strategy,\u201d said Diep Nguyen-van Houtte, Senior Manager of Climate Business at IFC. \u201cThis partnership with Bureau Veritas strengthens the Building Resilience Index by ensuring that more clients\u2014particularly in high-risk geographies\u2014can benefit from credible, independently-verified insights into the resilience of their properties, adding a new tool to their climate adaptation arsenal.\u201d  By offering third-party verification through Bureau Veritas, the Building Resilience Index helps stakeholders:  \u00b7 Protect operational continuity by identifying risks early and designing for resilience  \u00b7 Safeguard jobs and livelihoods by minimizing disruption in vulnerable communities  \u00b7 Enhance access to capital through better risk ratings and insurance alignment  \u00b7 Improve public trust and accountability through independent performance validation  This partnership builds on IFC\u2019s broader commitment to integrating adaptation into private sector development and enabling practical, market-driven solutions for climate resilience.  BRI is funded by the Australian Government and was developed and piloted with seed funding from the Government of the Netherlands and the Rockefeller Foundation, in cooperation with leading organizations including the ARISE Private Sector Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies, Build Change, FM Global, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, Miyamoto International, and Resilience Action Fund.

This paper is a highly analytical piece into the efforts by BRICS to reinvent governance of the world and seek alternatives to the supremacy of U.S. dollar and fashion a new world order based on a wide repertoire of global expert opinion, real-time-data, geopolitical perspectives and institutional reports or studies.   BRICS bloc, founded up to 20 years ago as a vaguely defined economic grouping, has over time turned into the powerful indicator of multipolarity. BRICS began as an acronym used in 2001 by a British economist Jim O Neill to refer to high-growth emerging economies, over the years, it has turned into a vehicle of political convergence and economic cooperation in an effort to transform global governance. The late growth and increased efforts towards the bloc explains why the bloc wants to break the status quo of the west led institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the financial system pegged by the US dollars.  Geopolitical Realignment Strategic Influence   BRICS takes a crucial part in the new international geopolitical world. The increasing convergence among the members can be partly explained by their frustration with the current global governance structure which is viewed by most participant countries as being biased towards the West. BRICS countries have used yearly summits, common statement and multilateral efforts to voice demands of reforms in the United Nations Security Council, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and international financial institutions.  BRICS has grown outspoken against what it considers to be an imbalance in the global governance structures. In a report conducted by Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the BRICS members had more than 40 percent of the global defense expenditure in 2023. The threat of Russian military strength, the increased presence of China in the Indo-Pacific or even strategic neutrality on the part of India reflects a certain drive towards shifting the geopolitical balance of power beyond the United States and NATO.  At the 2024 BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, \"The unipolar world order has collapsed. It is now time to develop an international system of multiple poles and fairness.\" This is also echoed by the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, in his opening address who said, \"BRICS, as a new form of multilateralism must serve as the cause of new multilateralism built on equality and mutual respect.\"  According to a report released by the Council on Geostrategy (2024), BRICS tries to dominate the efforts of UN Security Council reformations and the rearrangement of the WTO, by creating alternative diplomatic alliances. Nevertheless, there are warnings by experts such as Fiona Hill, who is a senior fellow at Brookings Institution that one should \"not overlook that BRICS is a heterogenous bloc with diverging security interests, which may reduce its capacity to act as a geopolitical bloc.\" The platform is especially used by China and Russia both of which enhance their strategic interests as well as counter the influence of the West. As an example, the shift to BRICS on the part of Russia has stiffened further after the country was isolated by the West because of the war in Ukraine. With its economic weight, China deploys BRICS to support in advancing its Belt and Road Initiative, as well as perceiving itself as a leader of the Global South.   Economical Collaboration Done By Upcoming Markets  The sum of BRICS in the world GDP is currently estimated at around 32 percent as compared to the G7 when GDP is measured in purchasing power parity (PPP). Nevertheless, BRICS inter-country trade amounted to only 16 per cent of overall external trade hence its possible potential, but not present synergy.   The Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB) was formed in 2015 and has thus far financed infrastructure and sustainability projects to at least $32 billion. In 2023, it granted a 1.5 billion dollars renewable energy project in Brazil clean energy initiative and a 2 billion dollar water resource management projects in South Africa. Even the President of NDB Dilma Rousseff stated in Bloomberg interview that the organisation was creating a bridge that enabled the Global South to develop according to its own terms and not being limited by the previous Bretton Woods structures.   However, the evidence of Center for Global Development shows that the lending capability of NDB is still modest as the World Bank lended more than $100 billion in 2023 alone. Statesmen have criticized that BRICS would do very little to spur global development finance until it has a substantive capital base and risk mitigation policies.   On its part, BRICS swallows up to 40 percent of global population and almost a quarter of the world GDP. The bloc through institutions like New Development Bank (NDB) will seek to fund infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member countries and other developing countries. The NBD has already started financing projects with billions of dollars since its inauguration in 2015, to serve as a viable alternative to the World Bank.  The growth in intra-BRICS trade and investments has also been witnessed through initiatives to cut the use of US dollar. Some of the efforts are the creation of local currency settlement mechanisms, including the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) that should supply liquidity when necessary. But economic structures, currencies and other political priorities which vary across members tend to challenge deeper integration. \uc67c\ucabd\ubd80\ud130 \ub8e8\uc774\uc2a4 \uc774\ub098\uc2dc\uc624 \ub8f0\ub77c \ub2e4 \uc2e4\ubc14 \ube0c\ub77c\uc9c8 \ub300\ud1b5\ub839\uacfc \uc2dc\uc9c4\ud551 \uc911\uad6d \uad6d\uac00\uc8fc\uc11d, \uc2dc\ub9b4 \ub77c\ub9c8\ud3ec\uc0ac \ub0a8\uc544\ud504\ub9ac\uce74\uacf5\ud654\uad6d \ub300\ud1b5\ub839, \ub098\ub80c\ub4dc\ub77c \ubaa8\ub514 \uc778\ub3c4 \ucd1d\ub9ac, \uc138\ub974\uac8c\uc774 \ub77c\ube0c\ub85c\ud504 \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \uc678\ubb34\uc7a5\uad00\uc774 2023\ub144 \ub0a8\uc544\uacf5 \uc694\ud558\ub124\uc2a4\ubc84\uadf8\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4\ub9ac\ub294 \ube0c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uc815\uc0c1\ud68c\ub2f4\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc11d\ud55c \ubaa8\uc2b5. (\ucd9c\ucc98: \ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4)     De-Dollarization Debate   De-dollarization is switching to reality. The bank of international settlements (2024) reports that since 2010, the pattern of the global trade being settled in U.S. dollars has reduced from 88 percent to 79 percent in the year 2023. This particularly is so because of bilateral arrangements among BRICS members.   More than 70 percent of their bilateral trade has been carried out in yuan and rubles by China and Russia. The idea of a common currency to BRICS is still in exploratory phase with analysts referring to it as the BRICoin. One South African Reserve Bank(2024) working paper determined that, the creation of a BRICS currency was likely to lower transaction costs and reliance upon the SWIFT systems that are located in the West but that the precondition was that the political and macroeconomic alignment must come first.   In a March 2024 hearing before Congress, Janet Yellen, the U.S. Treasury Secretary said, \"Although theoretical scenarios present risks, the U.S. dollar has no second and it is deeply to the US. dollar due to its institutional depth, liquidity and trust.\" This conforms to the general opinion which is held by Western financial powers who view the monetary ambitions of BRICS as too toppish but should be kept an eye on.   BRICS have come out as a prime actor of de-dollarization resonance in terms of its discourse in economics particularly in the face of increased US sanctions and other global de-trust of dollar overreliance. Various BRICS countries such as China and Russia have recorded substantial decrease in their dollar holdings and have expanded bilateral trade using local currencies. Having a BRICS-based payment system launched has been debated on several occasions with a view of developing a digital currency that is supported by a basket of the currencies of those that will be using it.  Irrespective of these attempts, US dollar reigns supreme in world trading and banks. Analysts note that although de-dollarization is on the rise, its effects are looked at so far as marginal because of the institutionalized dollar as the currency in the global financial sector and lack of a new currency to act effectively. Economist Eswar Prasad quotes the monopoly of the dollar as supported by the maturity and liquidity in the U.S. financial markets and BRICS countries do not have the institutional strength to meet the challenge.   Inclusivity and Expansion: is that Strength or Enthusiastic?   By incorporating Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt, BRICS has moved into territories which are stuff of sensitive strategic interests and resources. According to a report of the Chatham House, this diversity strengthens the geopolitical position of BRICS and creates ideological divisions, as well.   Another strength and a possible weakness of BRICS is its growth. Through the process of inviting new members, the bloc increases its geopolitical and economical span, particularly in the Global South. But on the other hand a less homogenous membership brings with it more complexity in decision making or coordination.   By 2024, BRICS has invitationed new members such as Argentina, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. This growth symbolizes its increasing influence and popularity to those nations that want alternatives to the Bretton Woods system. Nonetheless, the real effects on the bloc are debatable, even though the ambition of the bloc is high among scholars, policymakers, and financial experts.   As an example, Saudi Arabia and Iran, the historical competitors can experience problems in synchronization with oil policy, in spite of the fact that they are interested in decreasing the use of dollars. Cohesion is also a problem because of the border tensions between India and China. A consensus that once seemed elusive is becoming even more inaccessible, says Dr. C. Raja Mohan of the Institute of South Asian Studies, and unless the institution is improved, BRICS can turn into photo-ops only.  However, the Global South countries are more turning towards a possible alternative to the G7 - BRICS. A Pew Global Attitudes survey conducted in 2023 in Africa and Latin America placed confidence in BRICS to be a source of equitable economic opportunities at 62 percent of respondents but only 48 percent support the G7.   Areas of strategic focus Key Areas of Strategic Focus  Energy Security Proven oil and gas reserves in the world are almost 45 % in BRICS countries. At its 2024 BRICS Energy Forum, planned joint investments were stipulated to be made in cross-border pipelines and nuclear energy along with renewable energy grids. The Russian state-run Gazprom and Saudi Aramco have unveiled plans of jointly investing $10 billion in the research of hydrogen energy.   At the World Economic Forum 2025, energy economist Dr. Daniel Yergin said that with energy cooperation among BRICS states, world energy routes could be reorganized by circumventing chokepoints and traditional Western naval positions in the Strait of Hormuz   Energy partnership has been a priority on the agenda of BRICS in light of the world energy markets becoming more and more unpredictable these days. Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran combine both oil/gas resources in the equation as well as China and India are consumers of a considerable level. The block aims at developing sustainable energy routes and break the reliance on the west controlled supply chains.   Digital Infrastructure The BRICS is quickly investing in options to the Western online monopolies. China In 2023, Huawei and Infosys of India introduced a BRICS Digital Cloud development project. An estimate by McKinsey puts it at unlocking intra-bloc e-commerce that could transact a value of up to 300 billion by 2030.   There has also been a close interaction in cyber security. Recently, in one of the cyber war exercises organized by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, BRICS had shown its ability to stand against digital sabotage in key infrastructure, exceeding other parameters NATO.  Digital connectivity, with all its areas, such as fintech, e-commerce, and cybersecurity, has received significant investments made by BRICS countries. The group has suggested collective digital platform to achieve international payments and information sovereignty. The technological advantage that China has in the fields of 5G and AI offers it the bargaining chip over western hegemony. \uc911\uad6d\uacfc \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc758 \ube0c\ub9ad\uc2a4\uc640 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uc0ac\uc6b0\uc2a4\uac00 \uc810\uc810 \ubc00\ucc29\ud558\uba70 \uad8c\ub825\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc591\uc0c1\uc774\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc9c4\uc740 \uc2dc\uc9c4\ud551 \uc911\uad6d \uad6d\uac00\uc8fc\uc11d(\uc55e)\uacfc \ube14\ub77c\ub514\ubbf8\ub974 \ud478\ud2f4 \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \ub300\ud1b5\ub839\uc774 \uc9c0\ub09c\ub2ec 24\uc77c(\ud604\uc9c0\uc2dc\uac04) \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \uce74\uc794\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f4\ub9b0 \ube0c\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uc815\uc0c1\ud68c\ub2f4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc5b8\uc744 \ub4e3\ub294 \ubaa8\uc2b5. (\ucd9c\ucc98: \ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4)    Sustainable Development   The 2024 Green Bonds of New Development Bank are designed to fund the clean energy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to the amount of 4 billion U.S. dollars. Nevertheless, the Climate Action Tracker observes that BRICS states (including India and China) are in the group of the highest emitters worldwide.   UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen opined, BRICS have the potential of becoming a sustainability leader only when their green commitments are translated into binding targets and verifiable metrics.   The bloc focuses on climate resilience, food security and green finance. NDB has funded many climate-related works, whilst BRICS agreed to align its development agenda to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, opponents say that application is unstable and unclear.   Remarks by International leaders and scholars speaking at the 2024 BRICS Summit, UN Secretary-General Antivo Guterres revealed, \"This is a paradigm shift, no longer do emerging powers need the permission of the west to design their own futures.\" Antonio Guterres the Secretary-General of the United Nations has welcomed the advent of the BRICS as a force of multilateralism saying that there has to be a world that is more inclusive unlike the current realities. In the meantime, analysts like Ian Bremmer warn not to place too much cohesion on the use of the BRICS term by pointing out that it is still a coalition of convenience and not a perfectly aligned group.   In contrast, Zbigniew Brzezinski has a rather large geopolitical legacy left with most Western observers citing his Grand Chessboard theory to argue that BRICS is on its way to becoming a similar strategic bloc to the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War.  In case of BRICS, the threat of its fragmentation cannot be underestimated, Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the IMF, warned. Lacking internal coherence, the bloc may end up failing on the drive of its own aims.\" The emergence of BRICS is considered with a strong cautious eye by the West. According to a recent report released by Council on foreign relations, it is indicated that the expansion of BRICS had the capability to undermine US influence on global forums but internal contradictions might be their limits.   The challenge of the Global Command: Symbolism vs. Substance   BRICS is not anymore a purely symbolic entity. Its growth in membership, economic presence and institutional activities is an outright challenge to the established order of the world. However, the role of power in the 21 st century lies not only in the number of people or a rhetoric; it relies upon coherence, resilience, and the trust in institutions.   Provided that BRICS will be able to transcend its internal differences and achieve some tangible output in the fields of finance, security, technology and sustainability, the group can easily prove to be the architect of a post-Western world order. Nevertheless, it will have an influence only as long as it sets itself as an inculcated policy-making entity, at least, as far as being of an ideal influence.   Without any doubts, BRICS is an indication of the rise of voices of new powers in a multipolar world. Its de-dollarization initiatives, institutional reformations, and cooperation of the world have represented a change of global thought. But there is a lot to be done in translating symbolic ambition into substantive power such as resolving rifts at a very internal level and as well developing a capacity of the institutions that is able to rival the West.   BRICS is in a crossroad because more and more countries are waiting in line to join the bloc. Will it continue being a political statement or develop to become the force of change towards global administration? The solution is in its capacity to provide consistent, effective, and integrative solutions in an ever-complex world.  BRICS is at a cross-roads as others look forward to joining the bloc. Will it be just a remark of the political sphere or it will become a game changer in global governance? The solution is that it can provide consistent, successful and integrative solutions to a complex world.   With the international distribution of power tilting even further, there is one certainty emerging nowadays, and that is that BRICS are no more a mute puppet but a serious challenger in terms of an emerging geopolitical discourse. Its membership has broadened, its economic programs have taken off and its strategic partnerships that are emerging are transforming international expectations and a plausible alternative to Western dominated institutions. However, the future role of the BRICS will be based on whether it will manage to dissolve internal contradictions and institutional weaknesses.   To realize the dreams of BRICS, it has to focus on achieving institutional coherence, enhancement of transparency, and embrace a single foreign policy system that endears credibility as well as synchronization of its diverse members. It will lack the structural fundament to provide a real alternative to western establishments until then.   Meanwhile, the Western states have to reconnect to the Global South, as their fairer appeals and criticisms are what led many of the countries towards BRICS. Such reengagement however has to be more than rhetorical, as it should have to do with substantive changes of multilateral institutions such as IMF, World Bank and United Nations to make them more reflective of the current geopolitical and economic realities and thus prevent further strategic alienation. The development of the BRICS is a threat and an opportunity to the investors around the world. The convergence of the policy in the bloc and economic integration may set early warning signs of emerging market blocs and financial realignments. With BRICS, just de-dollarizing, digital infrastructure, and sustainable development financing, investors could discover new sources of rapid growth, although they will also be wary of the bloc as volatile politics and unequal regulatory frameworks.  The bottom line is that BRICS success or failure will be determined by its performance level owing to its promises. Yet its presence and direction in the world are there to be reckoned with indeed-in a world that is multipolarizing everywhere at a pace that must be considered (by all parts of the international system) to be alarming.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNKOR-57370033095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNKOR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GDN-KVG3-S08X-Y3PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Newscj.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Korean</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 3, 2025 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>KOREAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>KOREAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>A-1 Ltd</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>South Korea</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Eastern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>542012</className><className>BOM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: INE911Z01017</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;
