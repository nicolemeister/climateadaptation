Traditionally, practices like controlled muirburn kept heather and undergrowth in check. Now that those aren-t happening as much, the undergrowth is getting out of control.</p><p>-The fuel load has reached levels where the slightest spark can set things off - as we-ve unfortunately seen in recent weeks.- He added: -It-s also partly due to the lack of labour on estates these days. There just aren-t as many people working the land, so we need mechanised equipment to help tackle fires quickly, much quicker than we managed this year.-</p><p>Mr MacDonald said concern around wildfire was growing year-on-year, and pointed to the visual evidence around Dava as an example.</p><p>-It-s quite remarkable when you go out to places like Dava. You can see a clear difference between areas that are still grazed and those under rewilding schemes.</p><p>-Drive from one end to the other - on one side, you-ve got sheep grazing, and the fire hasn-t touched it. At the far end, where there-s no stock and it-s been rewilded, it-s all burnt and black.-</p><p>He added that community spirit remained strong in the area, particularly among traditional estates.</p><p>-I think it-s fair to say that traditional estates find it a lot easier to rally help,- he said. -Some estates that have gone down the rewilding route have let go of their gamekeepers and farm staff. That makes it harder to respond quickly when things go wrong.-</p><p>-In contrast, estates that still operate traditionally tend to have people around and can band together more easily when there-s an emergency like a wildfire.-</p><p>Asked whether this year-s funding total was enough, Mr MacDonald suggested money alone wasn-t the full answer.</p><p>-I think more consideration needs to be given to the wildfire risks that come with these changes in land use,- he said. -If the government is supporting rewilding and reforestation schemes, then fire safety must be a core part of that.</p><p>-Plans for these projects should have to include proper fire-breaks and access roads, so staff or volunteers can actually reach the source of a fire quickly.-</p><p>-It should be a condition of approval, not something that-s thought about after the fact.

These communities have learnt to adapt, to build sustainable futures in places where permanence is an illusion and where the ebb and flow of water is not a threat to be conquered, but a force to live with. The book is a guide for navigating a world in flux \u2014 taught by those who have always known that solid ground is not always solid.</p><p>Why farmers are beginning to take their government to court over climate change</p><p>Take the people living on the floodplains of northern Bihar, India. Accustomed to frequent flooding, they build circular embankments around their homes. The shapes of these embankments work with the flow of the water, encouraging it to go around them, rather than create sharp barriers that oppose the water. By contrast, the straight embankments introduced during British colonial rule in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \u2014 and later replicated by democratically elected Indian governments \u2014 seek to confine and control the river. Such rigid structures often backfired: by presenting an unyielding barrier, they increase water pressure during floods, leading to dangerous breaches and widespread inundation.</p><p>The settings of the book\u2019s essays \u2014 the floodplains in central India, the Fogliano wetlands in Italy, Jordan\u2019s Dead Sea coastline, the Soomaa bogs in Estonia, the river valleys in the western United States, France\u2019s alpine wetlands, the Colombian marshes, the tidal plains in the Bahamas and the Salton Sea in California \u2014 are wet environments that have been inhabited for centuries. These are places where wetness is an essential condition of life, and where human living is a process of \u201cadaptation and respectful adjustment\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Land and water</emphasis></p><p>On the basis of insights from field studies and conversations with local inhabitants, 12 leading specialists in sociology, ecology and anthropology explore how governance, management and infrastructure decisions often fall short when guided by rigid binaries \u2014 such as wet and dry, alive and dead, beneficial and nuisance or natural and unnatural. These categories fail to capture the complexity of amphibious environments.</p><p>This is the case with the Salton Sea, California\u2019s largest lake. Formed in the 1900s by flooding from the Colorado River, the lake has since been sustained by agricultural run-off from nearby farms irrigated by the river. But in the past few decades, water-transfer agreements to supply urban California have caused the lake to shrink year by year.</p><p>Wind blows toxic dust from the exposed lake bed towards the surrounding neighbourhoods, where asthma and other respiratory issues are prevalent at alarming rates. The shores are now strewn with the remains of dead birds and fish. This May, water finally began flowing into ponds in the southern region of the lake, part of the long-delayed Species Conservation Habitat Project, a ten-year effort to restore the habitat and improve its air quality. Although the project was announced in 2017, it stalled for years amid debates between local, state and federal officials over who should manage and restore the Salton Sea \u2014 and how.</p><p>A spring flood in Soomaa National Park in Estonia.</p><p>Spring flood in Soomaa National Park.</p><p>Credit: Focus/Toomas Tuul/UIG/ Getty </p><p>Historically, the lake has dried and filled up again over centuries. For some, this history means that the lake should be allowed to die because it is an artificial system. Others rightly point out the detrimental effects of such a move on the people, fish and migratory birds whose lives are enmeshed with the lake\u2019s ecosystem.</p><p>\u201cOver time, different understandings and interpretations of the Salton Sea\u2019s identity \u2014 as wet or dry, natural or artificial, dead or alive \u2014 have played into the difficult management challenges that the lake faces,\u201d writes political ecologist Alida Cantor in the opening essay of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amphibious Anthropologies</emphasis>. Focusing on what the lake does, not what it is, she says, can help to reframe debates about the lake\u2019s management.</p><p>The book argues that we should look at the relationships that inhabitants have to a damp place to fully understand amphibious environments. Without this perspective, governments risk excluding the very communities they aim to support, argues anthropologist Sarah Wise in an essay set in Andros Island in the Bahamas.</p><p>To spur climate action, educators must get personal</p><p>The shoreline of Andros shifts with the tides. It is neither dry land or fluid sea. In 2002, the Bahamas government designated five protected areas on these tidal lands, which it saw as empty and unused mudflats. But islanders have long treated the area as a communal resource, relying on it for fishing, gathering medicinal plants and recreation. Children swim among mangroves at low tide, whereas high tide pushes people ashore and fishers to the sea. The 2002 restrictions threaten to cut off access, endangering both livelihoods and community ties.</p><p>\u201cThe model of enclosure conservation forces a rigid template for resource management and conservation: one that stands in stark contrast to the aquatic logic of between spaces in the Bahamas,\u201d explains Wise. Instead, an effective form of governance needs to find a way to include \u201ca multiplicity of voices, uses, perceptions, and claims to that space\u201d.</p><p>For the most part, the book is easy to read, although some essays can be dense. It offers important insights for people involved in governance, policy or advocacy, particularly when dealing with ecosystems and communities that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change.</p><p>The essays help readers to move past imagining wet places as empty, difficult and harsh, or even romanticizing them as untouched wild lands, to seeing them as places where life struggles, adapts and is lived. The book presents insightful observations, conversations and case studies, showing the variety of forms that wet environments, and the life there, can take. It encourages readers to reject extreme binaries and imagine new ways of understanding the vibrant life in amphibious worlds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related Content</emphasis></p><p>Why farmers are beginning to take their government to court over climate change</p><p>To spur climate action, educators must get personal</p><p>Climate change will send home insurance spiralling.

It is essential to limit warming as much as possible, but also to adapt to changes already underway.<br/>This is the current challenge for companies: to deploy a realistic and clear adaptation strategy based on trajectories while being ambitious on the mitigation strategy. To do everything they can to avoid the unmanageable and, at the same time, manage the inevitable.</p><p><br/>Global warming impacts every aspect of a company<br/>Under current climatic conditions, the increase in temperatures by 2100 is expected to reach between 2.2 and 3.4 degrees, well above the 2015 Paris Agreement temperature goal (between 1.5 and 2 degrees). Companies will be on the front line, as extreme weather events directly impact every link in a company's value chain, from physical infrastructure to business continuity to financial performance and even human resources. All sectors (tourism, energy, finance, etc.) are potentially affected, even those perceived as being exempt from material impacts, such as IT services.<br/>However, companies sometimes find it difficult to define their adaptation strategy, given the variety and complexity of the variables that need to be taken into account.<br/>The AXA Climate white paper enables companies to understand risk as a geographical concept, and to identify all the places in which they will have to implement their adaptation strategy. They must establish strong adaptation governance at every level, encouraging dialogue across departments and between different sites.<br/>Risk assessments must follow a clear methodology; listing past events, their intensity, duration, and impact; relying on long-term climate projections - because the lifespan of a business activity can easily extend beyond 30 years, meaning today's forecasts may fall short; and finally, they must categorise the risks based on their level of priority for the organisation.<br/>For each risk, businesses need to identify realistic measures to take - while making sure they involve the people directly affected. It's also essential to assess not just the economic feasibility, but also the organisational, technical, and regulatory aspects of each measure, to avoid the risk of maladaptation.<br/>In taking these steps, an organisation can build an effective adaptation plan - one that implements progressive measures to remain agile in the face of unpredictable climate events.<br/>Diagnosing the climate risks of their sites and infrastructures and then implementing operational solutions has already been put in place by large companies such as Michelin and Suez.<br/>In addition, \"nature-based\" solutions, i.e. actions that aim to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems - while benefiting both human well-being and biodiversity, will pave the way for a good adaptation strategy: for example, the planting of rain gardens to promote soil permeability and fight against flooding, or planting vegetation in infrastructure to avoid heat exposure.<br/>Concrete examples of good adaptation measures<br/>What are example impacts by sector? Which professions are most exposed to which risks? How to carry out your diagnosis? What is the timescale? How can we take advantage of climate projections?

We need planning that embeds nature recovery, green infrastructure, and long-term resilience at its heart. Weakening protections and sidelining ecological expertise will only leave communities more exposed to extreme weather, food insecurity, and ecosystem collapse. Extreme weather will also cause more nature damage from drought and wildfires.\"<br/>Tom Lancaster, head of land, food and farming at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU):<br/>\"Climate change is having a devastating and multifaceted impact on UK farming and our collective food security.<br/>\"The response to this scale of risk is clearly not aligned to the jeopardy it poses, and yet, we have solutions available now, including . Investing in these schemes at the spending review in June will be needed to build the resilience of UK food production, and will be a key test of whether the Government has taken the criticisms in this report on board.\"<br/>Roger Mortlock, chief executive of CPRE:<br/>\"This report is a clarion call to think differently about land. It supports CPRE's evidence that most productive agricultural land is at high risk of flooding and research from this year that shows that farms around our towns and cities are vanishing at an alarming rate. We need to safeguard our remaining farmland to boost biodiversity and ensure the UK's food security.<br/>\"Making the best use of our finite supply of land means taking a smarter approach to renewables, infrastructure and housing. If agricultural land is as precious as this report demonstrates, we can't afford to keep wasting these opportunities to put solar on roofs, not prime farmland.<br/>\"Likewise, the default for building new homes is too often a needless take of agricultural land, while opportunities to develop 1.2 million homes on brownfield sites are ignored. This report urges a rethink on how the Government delivers its targets and a recognition that land might be our most precious resource in adapting to climate change.\"<br/>The Soil Association's policy director Brendan Costelloe:<br/>The Government needs to take urgent action if it is going to rescue our climate, nature and future food resilience.<br/>\"We know that intensive farming, which depends on fossil-fuel-based fertilisers, is causing climate change whilst also being more vulnerable to its effects, which threatens our environment and our food security. We therefore need to see a rapid, system-wide transition to agroecological farming practices, such as organic, which reduce the environmental impact and not only secure our food system for the future but also secure the natural world too.<br/>\"We have more farmers than ever wanting to transition to organic, so it's vital that the Government restores support that was frozen recently alongside other SFI payments, so farmers can begin that journey immediately.<br/>\"More broadly, the Government needs to reinstate all the SFI schemes that have been correctly targeted at improving soil quality, like cover crops and herbal leys. Improving soil quality is probably the most important thing farmers can do to protect themselves from floods and droughts, and deliver a climate-resilient food system.\"<br/>Published 30th April 2025<br/></p>", "publisher": "Edie.net", "instances": ["Here, edie rounds up the reaction.

The 2024 winter alone led to the death of 7 million animals, representing 13 per cent of animals in the country, and pushed herders' families to migrate to cities. In Mongolia, livestock outnumbers people by around 20 to 1, and about one third of the population are pastoral herders.<br/><br/>Through the IFAD project, herder families benefited from veterinarian services and learned to better manage pastures. This led to pasture preservation, higher animal productivity and better animal health and survival during the winter.

Sandwiched between two economic giants of the region, Nigeria and Ghana, this country of 13.7 million inhabitants has long served as a vital commercial corridor to neighboring landlocked countries. Benin is transforming, evolving from a simple passage to a preferred destination.<br/><br/>With a gross domestic product (GDP) of 7.5% in 2024, compared to 6.4% in 2023, Benin ranks among the three fastest-growing African economies. Inflation stood at 1.2% despite global pressures. The budget deficit is at 3% of GDP in 2024. Benin aligns with the convergence criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) for the first time in five years.<br/><br/>The Agricultural Revolution<br/><br/>Benin's success begins in an unexpected place: cotton fields whose production is now processed locally into clothing, generating substantial export revenues for the country.<br/><br/>Agricultural yields have increased thanks to producers' access to inputs. The country has almost doubled its rice production, which rose from 406,000 tons in 2020 to 712,000 tons in 2023, exceeding ambitious initial targets. Corn production climbed to 1.7 million tons. Cashew processing more than doubled, rising from 19% to 40.26% of national production, boosted by the Glo-Djigbe Special Economic Zone, located in the commune of Abomey-Calavi.<br/><br/>Multinational Nerica Rice_Image of a researcher examining rice grains produced under Multinational Nerica Rice.<br/><br/>The agricultural infrastructure projects implemented have helped stimulate farmers. The Oueme Valley Agricultural Infrastructure Support Project, financed for 63.63 million euros by the African Development Bank, supported 21,000 farmers in 14 localities, which increased food crop production from 70,100 tons to 90,300 tons upon project completion.<br/><br/>Infrastructure That Pays for Itself<br/><br/>Benin's strategic position has made infrastructure development both necessary and profitable. The Glo-Djigbe Special Economic Zone, which today hosts 31 industries, is expected to attract up to $ 1.4 billion in investment in its first phase. It has already created 6,714 jobs and has begun exporting its first 'Made in Benin' garments for international brands like U.S. Polo Assn.<br/><br/>The approach is strategic rather than scattered. Road projects connect rural areas - production zones - to markets and allow farmers to sell their products at better prices. The modernization of the Port of Cotonou facilitates regional trade. Energy infrastructure development has improved electricity access from 36.5% in 2020 to nearly 40% in 2023, supporting both household and business needs.<br/><br/>These projects work because they are designed to generate economic returns, not just provide services. When infrastructure pays for itself through increased economic activity, it becomes sustainable rather than a burden.<br/><br/>Green Growth and Climate Adaptation<br/><br/>Sustainable bond issuances have expanded the school feeding program to 1.2 million children.

Targeted projects have provided drought-resistant seeds and improved irrigation systems, resulting in better crop resilience and preservation of arable land. These initiatives demonstrate how countries can address climate change while building economic growth.<br/><br/>Innovative Financing and Strategic Partnerships<br/><br/>The African Development Bank's $ 1.3 billion portfolio supports seventeen operations across Benin. The Bank provided catalytic financing in the form of a $ 200 million partial credit guarantee, which unlocked 350 million euros (approximately $ 406 million) in private financing allocated to projects related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This financial sophistication matters. When countries can leverage development financing to access broader funding sources, they multiply their investment capacity while strengthening national financial sector capacity.<br/><br/>Benin Project to support the management of communal forests in Benin (Phase 2)<br/><br/>This strategic approach works because it is comprehensive without being scattered. Agricultural modernization, supported by the transformation of raw materials into finished products, accelerates value-added creation while protecting long-term assets. Infrastructure investment attracts private capital.<br/><br/>A Gateway Model<br/><br/>Benin's trajectory offers perspectives to other African countries. The approach succeeds because it builds on comparative advantages while creating new sources of competitiveness. Agricultural modernization leverages natural resources. Infrastructure investment capitalizes on geographical position. Industrial development adds value to existing production.<br/><br/>As Benin continues to work toward achieving the objectives of the African Union's Agenda 2063, its experience demonstrates how countries can leverage geographical advantages while creating new sources of competitive advantages.<br/><br/>This analysis is based on the findings of the African Development Bank's 2025 Country Report titled: Benin, highlighting the country's achievements in leveraging human, natural, and financial capital for transformational development.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p>", "publisher": "ENP Newswire", "instances": ["These projects work because they are designed to generate economic returns, not just provide services.

Sandwiched between two economic giants of the region, Nigeria and Ghana, this country of 13.7 million inhabitants has long served as a vital commercial corridor to neighboring landlocked countries. Benin is transforming, evolving from a simple passage to a preferred destination.<br/><br/>With a gross domestic product (GDP) of 7.5% in 2024, compared to 6.4% in 2023, Benin ranks among the three fastest-growing African economies. Inflation stood at 1.2% despite global pressures. The budget deficit is at 3% of GDP in 2024. Benin aligns with the convergence criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) for the first time in five years.<br/><br/>The Agricultural Revolution<br/><br/>Benin's success begins in an unexpected place: cotton fields whose production is now processed locally into clothing, generating substantial export revenues for the country.<br/><br/>Agricultural yields have increased thanks to producers' access to inputs. The country has almost doubled its rice production, which rose from 406,000 tons in 2020 to 712,000 tons in 2023, exceeding ambitious initial targets. Corn production climbed to 1.7 million tons. Cashew processing more than doubled, rising from 19% to 40.26% of national production, boosted by the Glo-Djigbe Special Economic Zone, located in the commune of Abomey-Calavi.<br/><br/>Multinational Nerica Rice_Image of a researcher examining rice grains produced under Multinational Nerica Rice.<br/><br/>The agricultural infrastructure projects implemented have helped stimulate farmers. The Oueme Valley Agricultural Infrastructure Support Project, financed for 63.63 million euros by the African Development Bank, supported 21,000 farmers in 14 localities, which increased food crop production from 70,100 tons to 90,300 tons upon project completion.<br/><br/>Infrastructure That Pays for Itself<br/><br/>Benin's strategic position has made infrastructure development both necessary and profitable. The Glo-Djigbe Special Economic Zone, which today hosts 31 industries, is expected to attract up to $ 1.4 billion in investment in its first phase. It has already created 6,714 jobs and has begun exporting its first 'Made in Benin' garments for international brands like U.S. Polo Assn.<br/><br/>The approach is strategic rather than scattered. Road projects connect rural areas - production zones - to markets and allow farmers to sell their products at better prices. The modernization of the Port of Cotonou facilitates regional trade. Energy infrastructure development has improved electricity access from 36.5% in 2020 to nearly 40% in 2023, supporting both household and business needs.<br/><br/>These projects work because they are designed to generate economic returns, not just provide services. When infrastructure pays for itself through increased economic activity, it becomes sustainable rather than a burden.<br/><br/>Green Growth and Climate Adaptation<br/><br/>Sustainable bond issuances have expanded the school feeding program to 1.2 million children. They have enabled the dredging and maintenance of 2.55 million kilometers of primary and secondary sanitation infrastructure, and have provided drinking water to 43,356 people, while climate-smart agriculture programs help farmers adapt to changing conditions.<br/><br/>Beneficiary of the project to reduce water losses and improve the sustainability of drinking water supply systems in the cities of Cotonou, Porto-Novo and their surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Climate adaptation has practical benefits for farmers. Targeted projects have provided drought-resistant seeds and improved irrigation systems, resulting in better crop resilience and preservation of arable land. These initiatives demonstrate how countries can address climate change while building economic growth.<br/><br/>Innovative Financing and Strategic Partnerships<br/><br/>The African Development Bank's $ 1.3 billion portfolio supports seventeen operations across Benin. The Bank provided catalytic financing in the form of a $ 200 million partial credit guarantee, which unlocked 350 million euros (approximately $ 406 million) in private financing allocated to projects related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This financial sophistication matters. When countries can leverage development financing to access broader funding sources, they multiply their investment capacity while strengthening national financial sector capacity.<br/><br/>Benin Project to support the management of communal forests in Benin (Phase 2)<br/><br/>This strategic approach works because it is comprehensive without being scattered. Agricultural modernization, supported by the transformation of raw materials into finished products, accelerates value-added creation while protecting long-term assets. Infrastructure investment attracts private capital.<br/><br/>A Gateway Model<br/><br/>Benin's trajectory offers perspectives to other African countries. The approach succeeds because it builds on comparative advantages while creating new sources of competitiveness. Agricultural modernization leverages natural resources. Infrastructure investment capitalizes on geographical position. Industrial development adds value to existing production.<br/><br/>As Benin continues to work toward achieving the objectives of the African Union's Agenda 2063, its experience demonstrates how countries can leverage geographical advantages while creating new sources of competitive advantages.<br/><br/>This analysis is based on the findings of the African Development Bank's 2025 Country Report titled: Benin, highlighting the country's achievements in leveraging human, natural, and financial capital for transformational development.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]     </p>", "publisher": "M2 PressWIRE", "instances": ["These projects work because they are designed to generate economic returns, not just provide services.

King travelled to Mongolia with the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to cook and film with Mongolian herders, as part of a new episode of its Recipes for Change series, released today.</p><p><br/><br/>\"I am admirative of the willingness and courage of Mongolian herders to learn how to adapt to fast changing and extreme weather conditions and find new ways to preserve their future and their unique culture,\" said Si King. \"Adapting to climate change is essential and urgent to preserve food production, which are ancestral ways of life of Mongolian herders. It can be achieved with simple technics, such as a water well, a storage to keep fodder during harsh winters, or better pasture management technics.\"<br/><br/>Last April, Si King travelled to the remote rural areas of Mongolia to see how IFAD and the Government of Mongolia jointly invest to support herders to adapt to extreme weather conditions. He visited the project for Market and Pasture Management Development and cooked with a Mongolian herders' family. The family received training in pasture management, animal breeding, and fodder preparation, and helped them survive the long and harsh winters.<br/><br/>PR-41-2025<br/><br/>\u00a9IFAD/Gilles Sabri\u00e9/Panos. Download photo and caption here<br/><br/>Reflecting on his visit, Si Kin flagged the urgency to invest in climate action and adaptation. \"I want my grandchildren to inherit a world that works, that is fair and is safe. Climate change it's a global phenomenon; there is no Planet B. The investment you make now is what you will be bequeathing the next generation and your children and grandchildren.\"<br/><br/>Mongolia's rural populations are very vulnerable to extreme weather events, in particular freezing temperatures up to -40\u00b0C, strong winds and heavy snows and ice, but also hot summers and degraded pastureland. The 2024 winter alone led to the death of 7 million animals, representing 13 per cent of animals in the country, and pushed herders' families to migrate to cities. In Mongolia, livestock outnumbers people by around 20 to 1, and about one third of the population are pastoral herders.<br/><br/>Through the IFAD project, herder families benefited from veterinarian services and learned to better manage pastures. This led to pasture preservation, higher animal productivity and better animal health and survival during the winter. The construction and rehabilitation of fodder and hay storage enabled farmers to better feed their herd during the winter months. An early warning system was established to alert farmers of the arrival of bad weather and so that they could shelter their cattle in time.<br/><br/>Many agricultural techniques exist for small-scale farmers and herders to build their resilience and adapt to climate shocks. But investments are often lacking to answer their needs.<br/><br/>According to IFAD estimates, small-scale farmers in developing countries need an additional US$ 75 billion annually in investments to adapt to a changing climate. Small-scale farmers, cultivating less than two hectares, produce 35% of the world's food and a significant part of the food in low- and middle-income countries. Yet, they receive less than one per cent of global climate finance.<br/><br/>In late May, the World Meteorological Organization forecasted that global average temperatures could rise to almost 2C above pre-industrial levels in the next five years for the first time. It is predicted that crop yields could decrease by a quarter by the end of the century, threatening rural populations' capacity to feed the world.<br/><br/>Note to editors<br/><br/>Download the Video News Release and pictures of Si Ki visits to Mongolia.<br/><br/>The Recipe for Change video Living in -40\u00b0C can be viewed on IFAD's You Tube channel<br/><br/>To find out more about our Recipes for Change series<br/><br/>To find out more about the Mongolian recipes<br/><br/>Find out more about IFAD's work in Mongolia<br/><br/>Media contact:<br/><br/>Michelle Porter, video lead | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:m.porter@ifad.org\">m.porter@ifad.org</email> | +44 7836 343670<br/><br/>Caroline Chaumont, media outreach | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:c.chaumont@ifad.org\">c.chaumont@ifad.org</email> | +39 3496620155<br/><br/>Follow IFAD on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, X, YouTube<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>No.: IFAD/41/2025<br/><br/>IFAD is an international financial institution, and a United Nations specialized agency.

July 2024 saw the world break the record for the\u00a0.</p><p><br/>Heatwaves are no longer rare events; they're becoming the norm. Cities, with their often dense infrastructure and limited green cover, are particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures, flooding, and pollution. To adapt and thrive in this changing climate, urban resilience must evolve, and that evolution must be green.<br/>Traditionally, city adaptation strategies have focused on 'grey' infrastructure like stormwater drains and reinforced buildings. But as these systems reach their limits, with London alone said to have '' according to the Mayor, \u00a0the case for nature-based solutions has never been stronger.<br/>Green spaces, when designed with purpose, can offer extraordinary value. They can cool urban areas, absorb excess rainwater, trap air pollutants, support biodiversity, and enhance human well-being.<br/>Beyond aesthetics<br/>The key lies in how these spaces are created. Too many of our parks and gardens were designed with beauty and recreation as their sole purpose. Manicured lawns and ornamental flowerbeds might look pleasing and certainly have their place, but they often underperform when it comes to ecological function. As a result, we're missing crucial opportunities to make these green spaces work harder for us, and for our cities to be more climate-resilient, better support nature and more beautiful.<br/>We need a shift in mindset. Urban green spaces shouldn't be ornamental; they should be designed to multitask with climate resilience and civic enjoyment combined. Imagine tree-lined corridors that lower street temperatures, wetlands that manage flood risk, wildflower meadows buzzing with pollinators and plants that actively capture carbon. These are not futuristic concepts; they are practical, proven interventions that can transform how cities cope with a warming world.<br/>This is the approach we are taking at Grosvenor Square.<br/>As London's second-largest garden square, Grosvenor Square has long been a green oasis. But like many historic spaces, it was not designed with climate adaptation in mind.

The data revealed that despite rising climate anxiety, the majority of young people in the UK (75%) and the rest of the world (72%) remain hopeful that there is still time to address climate change. However, the findings also make it clear that ensuring young people are both equipped for and able to access sustainability-adjacent jobs is key to tackling this enormous challenge.</p><p><br/>The economic opportunity<br/>According to recent , the net-zero sector is growing three times faster than the overall UK economy. Yet estimates suggest that there is a shortage of around skilled workers, which is half of the number of green jobs (defined as 'jobs that help the environment') required to help drive the green economy.<br/>Our data shows that in the UK, 66% of young people believe they already have the green skills necessary to succeed in today's workforce, a figure that is notably higher than the global average of 44%. At the same time, only 45% feel that these skills will present new career opportunities, which is the lowest proportion among all high-income countries in our research.<br/>While nearly two-thirds of UK youth are interested in working in green jobs, there remains uncertainty about whether their skills will be recognised and rewarded by employers. This demonstrates that despite increasing confidence among youth that they possess green skills, the route from green skills to meaningful employment is not yet clear or accessible enough. Addressing this challenge will be key to closing the green skills gap.<br/>A shared challenge across the global North and South<br/>While the physical impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events and resource scarcity, are often more severe in the Global South, our research shows that climate anxiety is widespread. Over two-thirds of 16-24 year olds globally say they are worried about how climate change could affect their future. In response to these anxieties, young people in both the Global North and Global South are eager to contribute, advocate, and act on climate issues. 71% percent of global youth and 62% in the UK believe they should influence environmental policy. However, less than half feel their perspectives are genuinely considered by government decision-makers. This gap between motivation and influence highlights the need for greater collaboration between youth, employers, and policymakers to ensure youth voices are heard and amplified in the climate transition.<br/>Grassroots social action: a pilot that shows promise for inclusive climate action<br/>Encouraging grassroots social action can play a key role in giving young people a stronger voice on climate change and ensuring that no-one is left behind as new technologies and industries emerge. In the UK, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are already to be not in education, employment or training than their better-off peers, where they would gain crucial employment experience. With green skills becoming increasingly important in the modern workplace, this could further exacerbate social inequalities and digital exclusion.<br/>Recognising that the transition to a green economy must be inclusive, we worked with the (DOT) UK on the Climate Champion Initiative, a pilot programme in the North East of England aimed at young people facing social and economic barriers.<br/>Through co-design workshops and hands-on learning, ten young people with experience of marginalisation helped shape the programme and its curriculum. Over three structured sessions, participants focused on co-designing the programme itself, exploring local climate challenges and building digital and employability skills. The impact was clear: 77% of participants reported greater awareness of digital tools for community engagement and 100% reported improved confidence in co-design and collaboration. This pilot phase has laid a strong foundation for the next stage, where more young people will be engaged in creating practical, community-driven climate solutions.<br/>Empowering young people to help tackle climate change<br/>This initiative offers important insights into how to empower young people to be active participants in tackling climate change. Genuine engagement begins by meeting young people where they are and recognising the value of their experience. Integrating digital and green skills not only improves employability but also gives young people the tools and confidence to drive meaningful change in their own communities. The combination of co-design and hands-on learning helps to build confidence and ownership, making programmes like this both more impactful and easier to scale.<br/>This approach underscores the value of inclusive, place-based models for equipping the next generation with the skills and agency to shape the green transition and foster resilient communities.<br/>Bringing global lessons to the UK context<br/>The DOT programme builds on experience from successful climate and skills initiatives in Africa and the MENA region, where community-based, hands-on learning has been effective in empowering young people as climate leaders. In these regions, youth are often at the forefront of climate adaptation and mitigation efforts, responding directly to immediate and tangible climate risks.<br/>Innovative educational approaches and the capacity for climate adaptation demonstrated in the Global South offer important lessons for the UK. The journey towards an inclusive green economy is not straightforward, and ongoing learning, experimentation, and adjustment are essential to address evolving climate challenges. Cross-regional exchange enables the sharing of effective solutions, challenges assumptions, and ensures climate education remains relevant and responsive in different local contexts.<br/>Looking ahead: digital inclusion as a foundation for employability in the green sector<br/>It is also important to address the clear link between digital inclusion and green skills, both of which are central to employability in the green economy. Many of the UK's most vulnerable young people risk exclusion from new opportunities without access to digital skills and tools. The integration of digital and green education, as seen in the DOT pilot, is not just about preparing for green jobs, but about ensuring all young people can participate in and shape the green transition.<br/>Bridging the gap between youth ambition and employment in the green economy requires more than just equipping young people with skills; it begins with building a strong base of green knowledge. As the UK explores innovative pathways for climate action and prepares young people for the future, learning from both local pilots and global best practice will help ensure no one is left behind, and that youth optimism, energy, and ideas are truly harnessed for a sustainable future.<br/>Sally Caughey is UK Head of Digital Inclusion for Capgemini<br/>Published 5th August 2025<br/></p>", "publisher": "Edie.net", "instances": ["This approach underscores the value of inclusive, place-based models for equipping the next generation with the skills and agency to shape the green transition and foster resilient communities.

Nestled in the heart of the Fens, our district has long depended on a finely balanced system of dykes, drains and pumping stations to manage the delicate relationship between land and water.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But with the climate changing rapidly, that balance is under threat.</p><p>Sea levels are rising. Rainfall is becoming more intense and unpredictable. Droughts are lasting longer. The very drainage systems that have supported our agricultural landscape for generations are now under growing pressure.</p><p>That's why East Cambridgeshire District Council is leading the way with a bold, practical proposal: a network of locally-built and managed agricultural reservoirs to increase water security and climate resilience across our district.</p><p>This initiative is not about growth for growth's sake. It's about protecting what we already have - our farmland, our communities, and our local environment.</p><p>The idea is simple: capture and store excess water during the wet winter months, when it's often pumped away to sea, and hold it in mid-sized reservoirs that can be used when water is most needed - especially in the dry summers. This stored water could be used for farming, biodiversity enhancement, and even public supply in the future through the trading of water.</p><p>East Cambridgeshire already has a strong foundation to build from.</p><p>More than 80 agricultural reservoirs are already in place across the district and our planning team is well used to supporting applications for reservoirs through the planning process. Many of the existing reservoirs are fully licensed and well integrated into our local drainage network.</p><p>With additional support, several could be adapted or expanded to play a broader role in our water system - helping us prepare for drought, reduce the risk of flooding, and increase the reliability of local supply.</p><p>The benefits of this approach are clear.</p><p>A local reservoir network is faster and cheaper to deliver than large-scale national infrastructure. While major projects like the proposed Chatteris reservoir may take more than a decade, a network of mid-sized reservoirs could be up and running in just a few years. At an estimated cost of \u00a32-3million per reservoir, it's also far more affordable, with significant returns in terms of water resilience, climate adaptation, and environmental benefit.</p><p>What's more, this system makes smart use of the existing drainage infrastructure managed by our Internal Drainage Boards. By storing water at key points in the catchment, we can reduce pressure during floods, ease the burden on pumping stations, and support a healthier hydrological cycle across the Fens. It also offers opportunities to enhance wetland habitats and restore lost biodiversity - all while improving our carbon footprint.</p><p>But none of this can happen without a shift in how we think about water. Currently, the national regulatory system does not make it easy for local solutions to thrive. Local authorities like ours are largely excluded from key decisions around water infrastructure and investment. We're calling for a new model - one that gives councils and communities a stronger voice in shaping the systems that directly affect them.</p><p>East Cambridgeshire is ready to be a national pilot for change.

Officials have recommended that residents within the 17-foot lake level inundation zone leave the area until the water recedes and an 'All Clear' message is sent via the wireless emergency alert system. In a Facebook post, officials said a glacial outburst has occurred at Suicide Basin, which is dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier that has experienced accelerated melting and retreat, primarily due to climate change .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'The basin is releasing, and flooding is expected along Mendenhall Lake and River late Tuesday through Wednesday,' they added.

A large glacial outburst can release as much as 15 billion gallons of water, the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. Nicole Ferrin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service (NWS), said: 'This will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have.'</p><p>At 3:30am Wednesday, Mendenhall Lake's stage was 15.3 feet and rising, already within major flood stage, which begins at nine feet. Forecasts predict a record crest between 16.25 and 16.75 feet is expected between 8am and 12pm, with increasing confidence that the river will peak near 16.75 feet around 8am. Water levels are expected to drop below the major flood stage by Wednesday night. </p><p>The NWS said that as water levels rise, flooding will progressively impact homes, roads and riverbanks along View Drive, Meander Way, River Road, and surrounding areas. Low-lying yards and backyards will begin to flood at around 11 feet, with roads becoming impassable and bank erosion increasing as levels climb. By 15 to 16 feet, multiple homes, intersections, and parts of Riverside Drive will experience major flooding, and by 17 feet, entire neighborhoods, including homes on Meadow Lane, businesses near Vintage Park Boulevard, and all of View Drive, could be inundated, with streets submerged and riverbanks overtopped.</p><p>Homes on the city's outskirts are within miles of Mendenhall Lake, which sits below the glacier, and many front the Mendenhall River. Flooding from the basin has been an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years, it has swept away houses and inundated hundreds of homes. This year, government agencies installed temporary barriers in an effort to protect several hundred homes in the inundation zone from widespread damage. The flooding occurs because a smaller glacier near the Mendenhall Glacier has retreated, a consequence of warming temperatures, leaving a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer.</p><p>When the water builds enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam formed by the Mendenhall Glacier, spilling into Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday. Before the basin reached its capacity and began overtopping, water levels were rising rapidly, up to four feet per day on especially sunny or rainy days, according to the NWS. Juneau experienced consecutive years of record flooding in 2023 (pictured) and 2024.

Despite their key role as planetary circulatory systems for carbon and nutrients, mycorrhizal fungi have been overlooked in climate change strategies, conservation agendas, and restoration efforts - only 9.5% of these fungal biodiversity hotspots fall within existing protected areas, underscoring a major gap in current conservation frameworks.<br/><br/>Using more than 2.8 billion fungal DNA sequences from 25,000 soil samples collected in 130 countries, the study uses machine learning to model global patterns of mycorrhizal fungal diversity at an unprecedented 1 km-2 resolution. The researchers use the maps to identify underground 'hotspots' - areas of exceptional mycorrhizal diversity and rarity - that are vital to soil health, carbon sequestration, and plant productivity.<br/><br/>'For centuries, we've mapped mountains, forests, and oceans. But these fungi have remained in the dark, despite the extraordinary ways they sustain life on land', says Toby Kiers, Executive Director of the The Society for the Protection of Underground Networks (SPUN). 'They cycle nutrients, store carbon, support plant health, and make soil. When we disrupt these critical ecosystem engineers, forest regeneration slows, crops fail, and biodiversity aboveground begins to unravel. This is the first time we're able to visualize these biodiversity patterns - and it's clear we are failing to protect underground ecosystems.'<br/><br/>The co-authors of the study, Leho Tedersoo, Professor of Mycorrhizal Studies at the University of Tartu's Centre for Mycology and Microbiology, and Vladimir Mikryukov, Research Fellow in Soil Microbiome, supported the completion of the study by providing a large amount of data, identifying fungi and constructing maps. The research is the most data-intensive follow-up to publications led by Estonian scientists in the field of global fungal biodiversity and endangerment.<br/><br/>This research represents a major advance in global underground biodiversity mapping and demonstrates how machine learning can integrate vast ecological datasets to uncover hidden patterns in Earth's living systems.<br/><br/>'These maps are more than scientific tools-they can help guide the future of conservation,' said Michael Van Nuland, SPUN's Lead Data Scientist.

To do so, we need a more pragmatic and realistic approach, one that acknowledges both the limitations of current modelling and the real-world backdrop against which climate change is playing out.</p><p>Let's start with the fundamentals. While TCFD has helped normalise the idea of scenario analysis, the frameworks that underpin it are fundamentally flawed. The climate scenarios used in most reports assume a neat, linear transition to a low-carbon economy, but the real world is proving to be anything but linear.</p><p>Despite huge strides in technology and growing investment in renewables, global emissions continue to rise, energy demand is outpacing our ability to decarbonise. Meanwhile, climate tipping points are looming closer, with significant implications for the global economy and the long-term value of pension assets.</p><p>TCFD reports often rely on consultancy-led scenario analysis that omits feedback loops and systemic risks creating a false sense of security with trustees left believing that even the most severe climate scenarios will have only a modest impact on their portfolios. In reality, the risks are likely to be more acute and less predictable.</p><p>When TCFD guidance was first published, it made sense to focus heavily on transition risk, the financial implications of decarbonisation policies and the shift to a greener economy.</p><p>But that world has changed. Transition risk has not played out as swiftly or as universally as anticipated, around the world, political pushback on ESG is growing. Legal and reputational risk have made asset managers more cautious about engaging on climate issues, in short, the global transition is faltering; and TCFD has not kept up.</p><p>In the meantime, physical climate risks are accelerating, yet they continue to receive limited attention in trustee discussions and remain a secondary focus in reporting frameworks. As a result, adaptation, the practical steps needed to protect member outcomes in a warming, more volatile climate, is often overlooked. This reflects how the current framework directs attention away from the risks that are most urgent and least understood.</p><p>It's important to be clear: we still believe trustees should be considering and reporting on climate-related risks, climate change remains one of the most serious long-term threats to the security of retirement income, but the process must evolve to be useful.</p><p>We believe the DWP has an opportunity to re-shape the framework in a way that delivers more value for members and more clarity for boards. That should begin with a simplification of the framework. Reporting has become overly technical, resource-intensive, and opaque. We should enable trustees to focus more on decisions and less on disclosure for its own sake.</p><p>The emphasis also needs to shift from reporting to action, boards should be supported and encouraged to take concrete steps on climate adaptation, not just mitigation. That includes revisiting investment beliefs, strengthening stewardship, and re-assessing exposure to physical risks.</p><p>Greater transparency is also needed so members have a clearer view of how their savings are being managed in light of climate risks and what trade-offs are being made. That transparency can help rebuild trust and reduce any greenwashing that may have crept in.</p><p>The TCFD framework set the stage for progress, but in practice, it stopped short of driving the kind of challenge to the status quo that was needed. But like everything, it must now evolve. We live in a more complex and more politicised climate environment than when these requirements were first introduced.  Pension schemes, and the boards who govern them need tools that reflect that reality.</p><p>We urge the DWP to be bold in this review and to work with the industry to develop a framework that supports practical, member-focused decision-making.

As a result, the country's food security, water resources and overall economic stability are threatened.</p><p>Ranked among the top 20 countries most affected by extreme weather between 2000 and 2019 by the Global Climate Risk Index, Zimbabwe is experiencing an increasingly warming trend, with more frequent and intense heatwaves, and longer, more severe droughts. The country's mean annual temperature rose by about 0.03\u00b0C per year from 1970 to 2016 and is expected to rise by 1- 1.5\u00b0C by 2040, potentially exceeding 3\u00b0C by 2050, a United Nations Environment Programme report showed.</p><p>With 80 per cent of the country's agriculture reliant on rain, increasingly frequent and longer droughts, shorter rainy seasons and hotter temperatures, cyclones and floods have turned this landlocked African country that was once considered the continent's bread basket into one that increasingly relies on food imports and donations.</p><p>Experts also trace the increase in pests and diseases affecting crop yields to the warmer conditions related to climate change.</p><p>Irrigation for 350,000 hectares</p><p>The government has started promoting irrigation, conservation farming and water-harvesting to ensure the survival of the agriculture sector, on which 70 per cent of the population depends for employment and sustenance.</p><p>'A comprehensive irrigation development strategy is being implemented,' Professor Obert Jiri, permanent secretary, ministry of lands and agriculture, told DTE.</p><p>The strategy targets irrigation development using idle waterbodies (existing dams) and dams under construction, he shared. 'Zimbabwe is currently the most dammed country in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 10,700 dams already storing water, most of which is underutilised.'</p><p>A total of 221,000 hectares is currently under irrigation, the minister shared. 'But this includes about 100,000 hectares under plantation crops, leaving about 120,000 hectares for cereal production.'</p><p>Jiri said for the country to return to its former glory of being the bread basket of the region, some 350,000 hectares of farmland has to be put under irrigation, and this is what the government is working towards.</p><p>Zimbabwe is not the only country that was late to adopt irrigation to climate-proof farming - the problem is felt across the continent. Only six per cent of Africa's cultivated land is under irrigation, which poorly compares with other regions such as Latin America (14 per cent) and Asia (37 per cent), according to a 2018 report Water-wise: Smart Irrigation Strategies for Africa by the Malabo Montpellier Panel of agricultural experts.</p><p>The government is also establishing 900 pilot and learning sites to promote integrated rainwater harvesting. This follows a study by a local university that proved the technique to be an effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy, especially for smallholder farmers who constitute the bulk of the farmers in Zimbabwe.</p><p>Because of colonial land distribution patterns, most of the country's 1.5 million small-holder farmers - those with less than 10 hectares of land - are largely found in arid and semi-arid parts of the country.</p><p>For over a decade, George Nyamadzawo, professor of soil and environmental science at Bindura University of Science Education in Zimbabwe, worked with smallholder farmer communities in the Marange area, an arid area on the eastern part of the country, to study water harvesting techniques.</p><p>From their research, Nyamadzawo and his team established that contour ridges and infiltration pits can reduce soil and water loss from runoff by more than 50 per cent and 75 per cent respectively, while increasing crop yields by up to seven times from 0.4 tonnes / hectare to 3 t / ha.</p><p>We were promoting tied contours, infiltration pits and other water harvesting technology as methods that can be used by farmers in dry regions such as these,' Nyamadzawo explained.</p><p>'After integrating tight contours and infiltration pits, we managed to increase crop yields to at least three tonnes per hectare.'</p><p>He added that some of the farmers realised maize yields of 4-6 t / ha, while vegetable production increased 10 times.</p><p>This water-harvesting strategy is being implemented together with a conservation farming method that is called pfumvudza, a concept that emphasises efficient use of resources on small plots, aiming for optimal management and increased productivity.</p><p>Climate change expert Peter Makwanya told Down To Earth (DTE) that as water becomes increasingly scarce due to climate change, the future of farming is in irrigation, conversation farming and improved disease and pest management. 'This makes water harvesting and conservation fundamental.'</p><p>Health impacts</p><p>Climate change is also having an effect on the country's health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations. Vector-borne diseases like malaria are becoming more prevalent due to shifting climate patterns, while others like cholera, typhoid and dysentery easily flourish in conditions of limited water supplies.</p><p>'Harare (City Council) is producing around 320 megalitres of water per day and demand on a daily basis is 1,200 megalitres, leaving most residents without water, resulting in a situation where some of them resort to unsafe water sources,' Community Water Alliance (CWA) coordinator Hardlife Mudzingwa told DTE.</p><p>To improve the water supply situation, the government is currently undertaking an ambitious programme to drill 35,000 solar-powered boreholes in both urban and rural areas. 'The boreholes are helping improve access to water for many people,' Mudzingwa said.</p><p>Other climate vulnerabilities</p><p>In addition to agriculture, water and health, other sectors such as electricity, forestry and biodiversity, as well as infrastructure and human settlements are also highly exposed to the depredations of climate change.</p><p>It is also causing grazing and water shortages as well as the heat stress that threaten the survival of the country's wildlife species, especially those sensitive to heat, such as elephants, of which the country already has an oversized population.</p><p>A 2020 study in Hwange National Park projected a reduction of 40 per cent of elephant habitat by 2050 and a change in elephant population distribution because of climate change.</p><p>The Hwange National Park, home to the bulk of Zimbabwe's 100,000-plus elephants, is now increasingly relying on boreholes for water, and some of the boreholes have to be deepened regularly as the water table drops further.</p><p>Final summary: Zimbabwe, once a thriving agricultural exporter, now struggles with food insecurity due to climate change. Rising temperatures, droughts and erratic rainfall have devastated rainfed farming. The government is promoting irrigation, water harvesting, and conservation methods to adapt. Climate change also threatens public health, wildlife, and water access, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable, climate-resilient strategies across sectors.</p>", "publisher": "The Zimbabwean (United Kingdom)", "instances": ["Climate change-related conditions such as heatwaves, droughts  and  floods are leading to reduced crop yields, sanitation problems, disrupted power generation and wildlife crisis.

It would also open part of the historically private land to public access for the first time.<br/>This expansion should meet multiple commercial objectives and enhance event accessibility for both players and spectators. The AELTC's sustainability manager Hattie Park also believes it could enhance - rather than detract from - plans to deliver long-term public benefits and environmental improvements, despite some local opposition.<br/>Park says: \"The Wimbledon Park project is a really brilliant project for the community and for nature.\"<br/>According to Park, the development has been structured to deliver measurable ecological gains.<br/>\"We will deliver at least 10% biodiversity net gain (BNG). About a third of the parkland will be publicly accessible park. There's an enormous amount of ecological due diligence that's gone into ensuring that we protect the ecology and improve it as much as possible.\"<br/>Public opposition and legal challenges<br/>The Greater London Authority (GLA) granted planning permission for the project in 2023. While most of the site lies within the Borough of Merton, a portion falls under the Borough of Wandsworth, which objected to the application.<br/>The disagreement between boroughs meant the decision was referred to London's Deputy Mayor for Planning, Jules Pipe, who approved the proposal in September 2023. In its decision, the GLA acknowledged that the scheme would result in the loss of Metropolitan Open Land, but concluded that projected economic benefits estimated at \u00a3350m to \u00a3450m annually outweighed the impact.<br/>This approval was challenged by the Save Wimbledon Park campaign group, which argued that the planning decision failed to take into account restrictive covenants attached to the land when the AELTC acquired it. The group also raised concerns about the principle of development on Metropolitan Open Land, which is intended to carry protections equivalent to green belt designation.<br/>The High Court dismissed the group's claims in a ruling this week, asserting that the GLA's planning permission was lawful.<br/>A separate legal matter concerning the land's designation and any remaining development restrictions is due to be heard in 2026. The campaign group has stated it intends to appeal, arguing the case could influence how future development on protected green space is handled across London and beyond.<br/>Planning for climate impacts and extreme weather<br/>Wimbledon hasn't only been in the headlines this summer for its expansion plans. Heatwaves disrupted play several times.<br/>During the men's semi-final, play was twice interrupted after several spectators required medical attention as temperatures on Centre Court reached 32C. While the retractable roofs on Centre Court and Court One are typically closed during rain or low light, it is not currently used in response to extreme heat.<br/>Park says the AELTC has already factored climate adaptation into its future planning. \u00a0She explains: \"We've had two years of rather unusual conditions for Wimbledon. Last year, it was ridiculously wet. This year, it was incredibly hot.<br/>\"We're having conversations internally about our future strategy. Adaptation and resilience are hugely important parts of it.\"<br/>She points to the integration of green and blue infrastructure across the Wimbledon Park site.<br/>\"That provides this 'tennis in a parkland setting' with all of those adaptive benefits as well,\" she adds.<br/>Specific interventions to reduce heat risk, manage rainfall, or improve shade and shelter for spectators have not yet been detailed publicly, but Park says these are under review as the project evolves.<br/>Wimbledon's net-zero commitments<br/>As well as climate adaptation, mitigation is an important priority for Park and her team.<br/>Since then, it has reduced gas consumption by 32%, electricity use by 16% and emissions from fuel by around 80%.<br/>Park highlights several key projects for reducing fuel consumption, such as replacing petrol and diesel in road transport with HVO and electric vehicles. The Club has also stopped the use of generators on-site, instead connecting all areas to mains electricity.<br/>The club uses Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGO)-backed renewable electricity and has installed some solar generation, although Park notes this is not sufficient to meet on-site demand.<br/>Last year,<br/>Decarbonising heat remains one of the more difficult areas, Park explains. She says: \"We use heat for heating, hot water and cooking. The site hosts 42 kitchens, 30 of which are now electric, so there has been progress.\"<br/>She highlights the Orangery Practice Pavilion as the club's first fossil-fuel-free building, equipped with electric boilers and solar thermal tubes to preheat water.<br/>The Club has committed to the UN Sport for Climate Action Framework, setting a target to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2040.<br/>Technically, under this framework, Wimbledon can claim net-zero status without reducing emissions from spectator travel, as these are excluded from the formal net-zero targets. This highlights a potential gap in accountability for a significant source of emissions associated with sport events.<br/>However, Park emphasises that addressing these emissions remains important as a collective responsibility. She also notes that international travel emissions form a large part of Wimbledon's footprint and expresses hope that the aviation sector will accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, which would benefit all large sporting events with international presence.<br/>Engaging players and looking ahead<br/>Looking beyond infrastructure and operations, Park emphasises that the AELTC is exploring how athletes can create ripple effects.<br/>She says: \"We want to provide players with a positive environmental experience so they can become advocates.<br/>\"Sport is being affected - whether it's elite athletes competing in extreme heat or grassroots football dealing with flooded pitches. It's essential that sports organisations mitigate impacts, adapt, and bring athletes along to amplify our collective impact.\"<br/>The next stages of the Championships' expansion plan will depend on the outcome of the 2026 legal hearing on land status, as well as continued compliance with planning and environmental reporting obligations.<br/>Published 24th July 2025<br/></p>", "publisher": "Edie.net", "instances": ["During the men's semi-final, play was twice interrupted after several spectators required medical attention as temperatures on Centre Court reached 32C.

Storms, floods, droughts and heat waves claim human lives, cause damage to ecosystems and lead to economic disadvantages. The frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events will continue to increase. Climate change impacts are having far-reaching effects, also in Europe and the territory of the European Union (EU). Water shortages in the EU have affected economic activities in the fields of agriculture, aquaculture, tourism, power plant cooling, and inland navigation. Additionally, the health and well-being of Europeans is affected, who increasingly suffer from heat waves. Halting all greenhouse gas emissions would still not prevent the climate change impacts that are already occurring. These consequences will continue for decades, even if global and European efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions prove effective. In addition to taking climate protection measures, it is therefore also necessary to adapt to the unavoidable consequences of climate change.</p><p>In accordance with the Paris Agreement (PA) and the European Climate Law (CL), climate adaptation measures are activities which enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. Climate and thus climate change affects many environmental compartments and sectors. This results in a particular complexity of both the possible impacts and the measures and instruments for adaptation, which extend to very different areas of policy fields. In some cases, for instance, the focus is on technological solutions (e.g. the construction of dikes and dams for protection against floods), while other approaches pursue nature-based solutions (e.g. renaturation measures) to strengthen ecosystem functions which naturally increase resilience to the impacts of climate change. Moreover, the design of adaptation instruments depends not only on the specifics of individual sectors, but also on concrete regional or local circumstances, which is why planning instruments are of particular importance for spatial climate adaptation measures.</p><p>The described diversity and contextuality of adaptation needs and adaptation instruments and the need for further dynamic development due to the fact that there are still many uncertainties regarding the climate change, gives climate adaptation law its own character. There are no measurable targets such as the\u00a0\u201d2 degree or 1.5 degree target\u201c or budgeting of greenhouse gas emissions as there are in climate change mitigation. Rather, specific requirements are placed on climate adaptation law, such as the promotion of raising awareness, knowledge generation, uncertainty assessment and flexibility. In addition to overarching climate adaptation regulations in special climate laws, climate adaptation regulations have found their way into the laws of the affected policy fields (so-called\u00a0\u201dmainstreaming\u201d). Since climate change is a global problem, adaptation law exists at all levels of the multi-level system. The scope and degree of the concretisation of adaptation law approaches vary. They are condensed from international law to European law to national law.</p><p>The aim of this article is to trace climate adaptation law at the above-mentioned levels from a European perspective. In addition to climate adaptation law at the international level (2.) and EU level (3.), the legal situation at the national level is presented, using Germany as an example (4.). The article concludes with an outlook for the forthcoming adoption of a Federal Climate Adaptation Law in Germany and its added value.</p><p>International law</p><p>Climate adaptation is a subject of international law and since the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) it has gained significantly in importance to date.</p><p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</p><p>Adaptation is receiving legal attention for the first time in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992). The UNFCCC is a framework convention that sets out the general objectives and principles, leaving agreements on details and specifics at the second stage to subsequent agreements. Even though climate adaptation is hardly mentioned in the Convention\u2019s target setting, which focuses instead on stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (cf. Art. 2), climate adaptation is mentioned in the subsequent articles. According to Art. 3 para. 3, the Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. This so-called adaptation principle is further specified in Art. 4, which regulates that all contracting Parties are required to develop, implement, publish and regularly update national programmes which are provided for measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change, Art. 4 para. 1 lit. b. Furthermore, the Parties commit to cooperate in their adaptation efforts (Art. 4 para. 1 lit. e, agree to take adaptation into account in their social, economic and environmental policies and actions as far as possible (Art. 4 para. 1 lit. f), and also agree to carry out relevant impact assessments (Art. 4 para. 1 lit. f). The developed countries further committed to contributing financially to adaptation in developing countries (Art. 4 para. 4).</p><p>Cancun Adaptation Framework</p><p>The Kyoto Protocol (1997) has made little progress in terms of concretising the very general adaptation obligations of the UNFCCC. However, a step forward was made by the 2007 Bali Action Plan providing \u201cenhanced action on adaptation \u201c and especially by the Cancun Adaptation Framework, which was established at the COP 16 in 2010. The Cancun Adaptation Framework aims to strengthen action on adaptation in developing countries through international cooperation and invites all parties to the UNFCCC not only to undertake but also to increase their financial and technical support as well as strengthening and/or establishing regional centres and networks in order to promote better planning and implementation of adaptation measures. The framework also aims to boost research, assessments and technology cooperation on adaptation, as well as strengthening education and public awareness. The conference established a process for the least developed countries and other interested developing countries to formulate and implement national adaptation plans. The advances which were made during this period and which led to the Cancun Adaptation Framework are considered to be\u201dof great significance and far-reaching,\u201d allowing the establishment of different lines of work that evolved in the following years as well as incorporating new elements and allowing adaptation to achieve greater prominence on the international agenda.</p><p>Paris Agreement</p><p>The Paris Agreement adopted at COP 21 in 2015, superseding the Kyoto Protocol, mentions the goal of climate adaptation in a central position (Art. 2 para. 1 b) PA). It thus adds it to the climate protection goal of Art. 2 para. 1 a) PA, which is to limit global warming to 2 degrees, or preferably 1.5 degrees, compared to pre-industrial times. Art. 7 para. 1 PA substantiates the global adaptation targets, namely enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. Climate adaptation is regarded as a \u201cglobal challenge faced by all, with local, subnational, national, regional and international dimensions\u201d, which makes a contribution to the long-term global response to climate change to protect people, livelihoods and ecosystems (Art. 7 para. 2 PA). The provision also takes developing countries into account due to their particular vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change. Art. 7 para. 4 PA states the significance of the current need for adaptation and that greater levels of mitigation can reduce the need for additional adaptation efforts, and that failure to implement mitigation measures can lead to greater adaptation needs and hence greater adaptation costs. This emphasises the interrelatedness between mitigation and adaptation. Moreover, the PA calls for commitments to mutual support and strengthening international cooperation, making explicit reference to the Cancun Adaptation Framework (Para. 6, 7). Each Party shall engage in adaptation planning processes and the implementation of actions (Para. 9), which may also include the assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability, monitoring and evaluation. The Parties should also submit and update periodically an adaptation communication (Para. 10). However, the planning and communication obligations only apply\u00a0\u201das appropriate\u201c. International support shall be provided to developing countries to fulfil the above-mentioned obligations (Para. 13). In general, financial support is to be provided to developing countries to assist them with respect to both mitigation and adaptation (Art. 9 PA).</p><p>Glasgow climate pact</p><p>The\u00a0\u201dGlasgow Climate Pact\u201c adopted at the COP 26 in November 2021 pays special attention to climate adaptation. It emphasises the urgency of scaling up action and support in the field of climate adaptation through financing, capacity building and technology transfer. To strengthen the financing of adaptation measures, this decision provides the Adaptation Fund and the Least Developed Countries Fund.  Both funds are mandated to deal with concrete finance adaptation projects in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Furthermore, it was decided to establish and launch a comprehensive two-year Glasgow\u2013Sharm el-Sheikh work programme to work towards defining what a global goal regarding adaptation would look like.</p><p>Despite the UNFCCC regime\u2019s increasing emphasis on climate adaptation, the broad formulation of Art. 7 PA in connection with the extensive use of the verbs \u201crecognize\u201d and \u201crecommend\u201d is criticised as a\u00a0\u201ddeclaratory, superficial and general approach to adaptation\u201d. Most treaty provisions or decisions of the conference of the parties (COP) on climate adaptation are relatively vague and do not have a high degree of binding force. However, as mentioned above, the states are also required to adopt measures and report on their implementation. In general, international law can only be responsible for distributing cost burdens, setting guidelines for bilateral or multinational interaction (especially for rendering support to developing countries) and providing an impetus to take adaptation measures. The choice of adaptation-relevant means and methods is left to the individual states. Nevertheless, a further concretisation of the adaptation goals seems possible and necessary, as the establishment of the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme shows.</p><p>European law</p><p>The special focus of this contribution is on the European level, which is decisively shaped by the law of the European Union (EU). In this respect, it should be noted first that the EU creates a legal intermediate level for its Member States, such as France or Germany, which other states\u2014for example, those on the Asian or American continent\u2014do not have regarding the realisation of their international adaptation obligations. Not only does the EU play a decisive role as a negotiating and contracting partner at the international level in terms of shaping the international climate agreements, but it also plays a leading role in its internal relations with its Member States when it comes to transposing the international regulations into national law. The EU acquires its creative power through its special powers of action, in particular its legislative powers. In this way, it can translate the requirements of international law in the area of environmental law into directive provisions and anchor them quickly in the national legal systems through the Member States' obligation to implement them. When legislative acts are issued as regulations (cf. Art. 288 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union\u2014TFEU), then they actually are directly applicable. Against this backdrop, the EU is also referred to as an \u201cimplementation catalyst\u201d for international law. It has already made considerable use of its legislative powers in the area of climate adaptation, be it through the adoption of the overarching Climate Law (3.1), or through mainstreaming in various sectoral policy fields (3.2).</p><p>European Climate Law</p><p>The most important law at the European Level in the field of climate adaptation is the European Climate Law\u2014CL which was adopted in 2021. It contains ambitious regulations on climate protection (e.g. raising the EU's greenhouse gas reduction target from 40 to 55% by 2030) as well as on climate adaptation. The objectives of climate adaptation are set out in Art. 5 para. 1 CL. In accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the Member States shall ensure continuous progress in enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. To achieve these objectives, the law formulates a series of mandates for action to the European Commission as well as the EU Member States. This includes the adoption of adaptation strategies, the evaluation of the progress of climate adaptation at national and EU level, broad public participation and the introduction of a scientific advisory body at European level.</p><p>Adoption of adaptation strategies</p><p>As an instrument for achieving the adaptation targets, Art. 5 para. 2 obliges the EU Commission to adopt an EU strategy on adaptation to climate change in line with the PA and shall review it every 5 years (first time in 2023). This thus consolidates the already existing obligation of the EU as a member of the Paris Agreement. In February 2021 the European Commission adopted an EU strategy for adaptation to climate change, which builds on the first EU adaptation strategy from 2013. While the 2013 strategy focused strongly on knowledge creation in order to be able to proceed in a fact-based manner, the 2021 strategy focuses on the development of solutions from planning to implementation of adaptation measures.</p><p>Overarching goal of the new climate adaptation strategy is to achieve a climate-resilient society in Europe by 2050. To achieve this goal the strategy includes four principal objectives: 1. smarter adaptation (more and better data on climate-related risks and losses), 2. faster adaptation (solutions to help reduce climate-related risk, increase climate protection and safeguard the availability of fresh water) and 3. more systemic adaptation (integrating adaptation into macro-fiscal policy, nature-based solutions for adaptation, local adaptation action). The fourth objective concerns the intensification of international measures for adaptation to climate change through the provision of resources, by prioritising action and increasing effectiveness, through the scaling up of international finance and through stronger global engagement.</p><p>Not only the European Commission but also the Member States are obliged to adopt and implement adaptation strategies and plans, taking into consideration the EU climate adaptation strategy (Art. 5 Abs. 4 CL). The national adaptation strategies shall be based on robust climate change and vulnerability assessment, progress assessments and indicators and guided by the best available and most recent scientific evidence. They shall take into account the particular vulnerability of the relevant sectors (inter alia, agriculture, and of water and food systems, as well as food security) and promote nature-based solutions as well as ecosystem-based adaptation. The strategies are to be updated regularly and the updated information must be included in the reports which have to be submitted under Art.\u00a019 para. 1 of the Governance Regulation.</p><p>Assessment of union measures and national measures</p><p>Furthermore, the Climate Law requires monitoring the success of climate adaptation, whereby a distinction is made between the assessment of Union progress and measures and of national progress and measures:</p><p>The assessment of Union progress and measures is regulated in Art. 6 CL und includes the assessment of the collective progress on adaptation made by all Member States (para. 1) and the review of the consistency of Union measures with ensuring progress on adaptation (para. 2). Both assessments shall be conducted by the European Commission until 2023, and every 5 years thereafter. The conclusions of the assessments under para. 1 shall be submitted by the Commission to the Parliament and Council (Art. 6 para 1 sent. 2 CL). In the case of inconsistency of the measures or if the results of the assessments under para. 1 or 2 show, that the progress is insufficient, the Commission shall take the necessary measures in accordance with the primary law (\u201cTreaties\u201d) (Art. 6 para. 3 CL).</p><p>A special and innovative instrument to assess Union measures with regard to climate adaptation is the implementation of a climate target compatibility check for EU legal acts and measures under Art. 6 para. 4 CL: Accordingly, the Commission shall assess the consistency of any draft measure or legislative proposal (including budgetary proposals) with ensuring progress on adaptation. It shall endeavour to align the measures or proposals with the adaptation progress. In any case of non-alignment, the Commission shall provide the reasons for the non-alignment. This is a procedural instrument which is similar to an environmental or sustainability impact assessment. The aim is to ensure that EU law conforms to the objectives of climate adaptation as closely as possible.</p><p>Additionally, the Art. 7 CL stipulates the assessment of national measures by the European Commission. Subject of the assessment is the consistency of relevant national measures by ensuring progress on adaptation and taking into account the national adaptation strategies. The Commission shall submit the conclusions of that assessment to the European Parliament and to the Council (ibid., para. 1). In the event of any inconsistency, the Commission may issue recommendations to the Member State (ibid., para. 2) which must, within six months, notify the Commission of how it intends to take due account of the recommendations. Furthermore, the Member State is to report how it has taken due account of the recommendations. If the Member State fails to address the issue, that Member State is required to Member State provide its reasoning (ibid., para. 3).</p><p>Public participation</p><p>As known from other EU environmental legislations, the Commission should involve the public in the implementation of the EU Climate Law (Art. 9 CL). This obligation also relates to the implementation of climate adaptation goals. The Commission shall engage with all parts of society to enable and empower them to take action towards a just and socially fair transition to a climate-resilient society. It shall facilitate an inclusive and accessible process at all levels, including at national, regional and local level and with social partners, academia, the business community, citizens and civil society, for the exchange of best practices and to identify actions to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CL (ibid., para. 1).</p><p>The Commission shall use all appropriate instruments, to engage citizens, social partners and stakeholders, and foster dialogue and the diffusion of science-based information about climate change and its social and gender equality aspects (ibid., para. 2). The European Climate Pact, which is an EU initiative involving interest groups from civil society in the design of measures at European level, should also be used by the Commission for public participation, without, however, formalising the European Climate Pact in law, as proposed by the Parliament.</p><p>Advisory board on climate change</p><p>Art. 3 CL introduces a new scientific advisory body at EU level, the\u201dEuropean Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change \u201c. It shall serve as a point of reference for the Union on scientific knowledge relating to climate change by virtue of its independence and scientific and technical expertise (ibid., para 1). The Advisory board shall consist of 15 scientific experts and shall cover a broad range of relevant disciplines. The members are independent of Member States and Union institutions in their positions and work programme.</p><p>The tasks of the advisory board are listed in Art. 3 para. 2 and include among others the provision of scientific advice and the issuing of reports on existing and proposed Union measures, the exchange of independent scientific knowledge, the identification of actions and opportunities needed to successfully achieve the Union climate targets and the raising of awareness on climate change and its impacts. These tasks are to be interpreted not only in terms of climate protection, but also climate adaptation. The Advisory Board shall be guided in its work by the best available and most recent scientific evidence, including the latest reports of the IPCC, IPBES and other international bodies (Art. 3 para. 2). It should complement the work of the European Environment Agency (EEA) while acting independently in discharging its tasks.</p><p>With the establishment of the Scientific Advisory Board, the EU is following the example of Member State climate advisory bodies, although the Member State bodies differ in their tasks. The proposal of the European Parliament to push for the introduction of climate advisory bodies in all EU Member States, however, did not find its way into the Climate Change Act. Instead, Art. 3 para. 4 CL states that each Member State\u00a0\u201dis invited\u201c to establish a national climate advisory body. When a Member State decides to establish such an advisory body, it shall inform the European Environment Agency (EEA) thereof.</p><p>Despite its legal nature as a regulation, the EU Climate Change Act is characterised by a framework character as it sets adaptation targets and provides a procedural framework (i.e. strategies for achieving the targets, monitoring and public participation) while the substantiation of the measures is reserved for further legal acts. This regulatory approach is also referred to as policy planning law. Such a regulated and controlled policy planning appears to be necessary to properly steer the complex transformation towards a climate-adapted environment, economy and society and to achieve a strong political and legal commitment to the goals of climate adaptation. Due to the high degree of abstraction of the regulations of the Climate Law, it should be clarified that this kind of regulated policy planning is not a guarantee, but an important support for achieving climate adaptation in the EU and in the Member States.</p><p>Climate adaptation in the legal acts of sectoral policy fields</p><p>Beyond the overarching EU Climate Law, the EU has also mainstreamed climate adaptation through various directives and regulations concerning sectoral policies.</p><p>EIA Directive</p><p>An important example is the EIA Amendment Directive 2014/52/EU, which explicitly requires the consideration of climate change and climate adaptation in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Climate adaptation is mentioned in recital 13 as one of the reasons for the adoption of the EIA Amendment Directive as it will cause further negative environmental impacts and endanger economic development. In this respect, it is not only appropriate to assess the impact of projects on the climate (e.g. through greenhouse gas emissions), but also \u201ctheir vulnerability to climate change\u201d. According to Art. 3\u00a0para. 2 of the Directive, the effects of the project on the protected items of the EIA include such effects as are to be expected due to vulnerability to major accidents and/or disasters (which may also include, for example, flooding or rising sea level). A description of the \u201cvulnerability of the project to climate change\u201d is a mandatory part of the EIA report and must therefore be taken into account in the consideration of the project approval.</p><p>Regulation on infrastructure funding</p><p>Great care is also taken to ensure that European funding is used in line with the goal of climate adaptation. In the area of infrastructure funding, for example, Regulation 2021/1060/EU lays down common provisions for funds such as the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund Plus, the Cohesion Fund, linking the funding of medium- and long-term infrastructure investments to the requirement of ensuring climate compatibility. Accordingly, the managing authority must ensure the climate proofing of investments in infrastructure which have an expected lifespan of at least 5 years (Art. 2 no. 42 and Art. 73 para. 2 j of the Regulation). This is intended to prevent infrastructure from being vulnerable to potential long-term climate impacts (cf. Art. 2 no. 42 of the Regulation).</p><p>Taxonomy Regulation</p><p>Climate adaptation is also the subject of the Taxonomy Regulation adopted in 2020, which regulates transparency for companies and investors for investments in projects and economic activities. According to Art. 1 para. 1, the Taxonomy Regulation contains criteria for determining whether an economic activity is to be classified as environmentally sustainable, in order to be able to determine the degree of environmental sustainability of an investment. Climate change adaptation is one of the six environmental objectives pursued (cf. Art. 9 of the regulation). Other goals are: climate change mitigation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The criteria for determining the conditions under which a particular economic activity is considered qualified to significantly contribute to and establish climate change mitigation or adaptation were further specified in December 2021.</p><p>Floods Directive</p><p>Another example of the mandatory consideration of climate adaptation is the Floods Directive 2007/60/EC, FD, which aims to create a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks in the EU. The increase in floods constitutes a climate change impact. In this sense, the Directive mentions in the 2nd recital that climate change contributes to an increase in the likelihood and adverse impacts of flood events. The impacts of climate change on the flood hazard are explicitly taken into account in the provisions on preliminary flood risk assessment (cf. Art. 4 para. 2 FD). Furthermore, the projected impacts of climate change on the flood hazard also have to be considered in the periodic review and updating of the preliminary flood risk assessment and the flood risk management plans (cf. Art. 14 para. 4 FD). Guidance Document No. 24 of the European Commission provides detailed recommendations on how to take climate change into account in the various elements of flood risk management.</p><p>Water Framework Directive</p><p>However, there are also laws that do not explicitly mention climate adaptation, but do leave room for it to be taken into account, such as the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC, WFD). Climate change is not explicitly mentioned in the text of the WFD. Nevertheless, there is agreement that climate change should and can be taken into account in river basin management under the WFD. The reasons are seen in the regulatory approach of the WFD, which provides, in addition to extensive monitoring regulations (cf. Art. 8 WFD), for mandatory river basin management planning combined with a cyclical review of progress and updating obligations (cf. Art. 13 WFD). This allows for a flexible response to climatic changes and their impacts. The ambitious goals for improving water quality in the EU, i.e. the achievement of a good water status for all water bodies (cf. Art. 4 WFD), also contributes to improving the resilience of water ecosystems to climate change. The qualified, goal-oriented and regulatory approach leaves the choice of means up to the user of the law concerning how to achieve the goal, thus creating additional room for manoeuvre. Moreover, the European Commission has established guidelines on how to interpret and apply the WFD with regard to climate adaptation.</p><p>National law: the example of Germany</p><p>The European perspective would be incomplete without also taking into account the law of the European nation states. In many areas, this is decisively shaped by EU law, but also sets its own accents depending on the distribution of legislative competence between the EU and the Member States. In the following, the legal situation will be presented by using the example of the Federal Republic of Germany. Since it is a federal state, a distinction must be made between Federal law and the law of the 16 federal states (\u201cL\u00e4nder\u201d).</p><p>The path to federal climate adaptation law</p><p>There is no overarching climate adaptation law yet at the federal level in Germany. The Federal Climate Protection Act adopted in 2019 only governs climate protection (i.e. the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions). The subsequent proposal of the Federal Council (Bundesrat) to anchor climate adaptation in the Federal Climate Protection Act as well was unsuccessful.</p><p>The German Adaptation Strategy adopted by the Federal Government in 2008 sets the political framework for climate adaptation and enables the Federal Government to take a cross-sectoral approach. This ensures that the existing objectives of the sectoral policies can also be realised under the conditions of climate change. It describes the consequences of climate change for 15 fields of action and presents options for action. The fields of action include Health, Construction, Water management, Soil, Biodiversity, Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Energy, Finance, Transport, Industry and trade and Tourism. In addition, there are two cross-cutting issues: Land use planning and disaster control. In order to do justice to the large number of sectors and actors affected, the DAS formulates the goal of anchoring climate adaptation in all relevant sectoral policies and integrating it into long-term planning.</p><p>The German Adaptation Strategy (DAS) does not stand alone, but is underpinned and updated by various instruments. Action plans on adaptation (APA I 2011, APA II 2015, APA III 2020) substantiate the DAS with concrete measures. The action plans II and III are included in so called Progress reports on the DAS, which were adopted in 2015 and 2020 with concrete steps for further development and implementation of the DAS. Further instruments to support the implementation of the DAS are Monitoring reports, which were adopted in 2015 and 2019 and describe the effects of climate change and adaptation measures. They substantiate the impacts of climate change with scientific data and inform the public and decision-makers in all sectors. The Vulnerability analysis (2015) and the Climate impact and risk analysis (\u201cKWRA \u201c, 2021) describe the affectedness and adaptation capacity in various fields of action.</p><p>Since climate adaptation has not been included in the federal climate protection law, the enactment of a separate climate adaptation law is now being discussed and prepared. The Federal Environment Minister of the previous government, in office until 2021, already announced that \u201creliable financial and legal framework conditions for effective climate adaptation\u201d should be created. The current federal government has now explicitly anchored this plan in its coalition agreement: \u201cWith a Climate Adaptation Act, we will create a framework for implementing a national climate adaptation strategy with measurable targets, for example in the fields of heat prevention, health and allergy prevention and water infrastructure, together with the L\u00e4nder, and to be able to take follow-up action in good time.\u201d In May 2022, the new Federal Environment Minister presented an emergency programme for adaptation to climate change, which serves to quickly put the first steps and measures into practice.</p><p>The emergency programme focuses on supporting municipalities by expanding funding programmes and capacity building, providing tailor-made on-site advice and better training for local experts, and raising awareness among citizens and educating them. Further steps are to follow with the Climate Adaptation Act. A first draft of the Act was presented in April 2023. This includes regulations for even more consistent governance at the federal level, similar to the Climate Protection Act. The Act is intended to create a framework for setting measurable climate adaptation targets, measures for their implementation and a mechanism for regular review. The basic obligation to take climate adaptation into account in all public sector planning and decisions as well as to take on a function as a role model for federal properties is also anchored. Beside the Climate Adaptation Act the emergency programme announces a new precautionary adaptation strategy and joint financing by the federal and state governments.</p><p>Climate adaptation in sectoral federal laws</p><p>Before an overarching climate adaptation law was presented at the federal level, climate adaptation had been already anchored in a number of sectoral laws (explicitly or implicitly).</p><p>Spatial Planning Act (ROG)</p><p>With the amendment of the Spatial Planning Act (Raumordnungsgesetz, ROG) in 2008, climate protection and climate adaptation were introduced as principles of spatial planning (Sect.\u00a02 para. 2 no. 6 sent. 7 ROG). This provided the framework for adding the aspect of adaptation to climate change to spatial planning plans and for drawing the attention of spatial planning authorities to climate change management issues.</p><p>Federal Building Code (BauGB)</p><p>One of the most important examples is the Federal Building Code (BauGB) which was amended several times to integrate climate adaption issues in urban planning law. The so-called Climate Protection Amendment of 2011 (Klimaschutz-Novelle), explicitly aimed to take greater account of climate protection and climate adaptation in urban development. This amendment introduced a \u201cclimate protection clause\u201d into the BauGB (cf. Section\u00a01a para. 5 BauGB). According to this clause, the requirements of climate change are to be taken into account not only by measures that counteract climate change but also by those that serve to adapt to climate change. This principle is to be taken into account in the weighing process when drawing up urban land use plans.</p><p>In accordance with the Climate Protection Amendment of 2011, deficits in climate adaptation can also serve as justification for urban restructuring measures (Sec. 171a ff. BauGB) and, since the further amendment to the BauGB in 2013, also as justification for urban redevelopment measures (Sec. 136 ff. BauGB). In addition, it was regulated that urban redevelopment measures should contribute to the development of the built structure in all parts of the federal territory in accordance with the general requirements for climate protection and climate adaptation, Sect.\u00a0136 para. 4 p. 2 no. 1 BauGB. While urban redevelopment measures tend to be small-scale (e.g. unsealing of backyards), urban restructuring measures involve the conversion or demolition of entire houses or rows of houses. Further examples for the consideration of climate change are the introduction of different categories for the description and designation of climate adaptation concerns in preparatory urban land use plans and legally binding urban land use plans (cf. Sec. 5 and 9 BauGB). As part of the 2017 amendment to the BauGB, for instance, municipalities were given the opportunity to designate areas for the retention and infiltration of precipitation water in legally binding land use plans (Sec. 9 para. 1 no. 16d BauGB).</p><p>Federal Water Act (WHG)</p><p>Climate adaptation issues are also explicitly mentioned in the Federal Water Act (WHG). For example, one of the principles of sustainable water management is to prevent possible consequences of climate change (Sec. 6 para. 1 no. 5 WHG). This was justified by the fact that water management is affected by climate change in many ways (e.g. water temperature, low water levels and floods, water shortage). In the law, climate change is also explicitly mentioned in connection with flood protection. The obligation to take climate change into account within the framework of flood risk management planning (Sec. 75 WHG) was adopted from the Floods Directive. The Flood Protection Amendment Act of 2017, which has facilitated the planning and approval of flood protection facilities (Sec. 71, 71a WHG), was also a result of climate change adaptation considerations. Furthermore, the possibility of designating flood generation areas in hilly and mountainous regions was introduced (cf. Sec. 78d WHG). The designation allows for maintaining and strengthening decentralised water retention in those areas to reduce floods downstream. Last but not least, climate change must be taken into account within the framework of the legal instruments of water supply and wastewater disposal.</p><p>Law of the German States (\u201cL\u00e4nder\u201c)</p><p>Climate adaptation has also been taken into account in sectoral laws at the state level. Overarching climate adaptation regulations are legally anchored in the L\u00e4nder climate protection laws, which exist in 12 of the 16 states. An exception is the Rhineland-Palatinate Climate Protection Act (LKSG 2014), whose purpose is limited to mitigation (i.e. reducing greenhouse gas emissions). However, climate adaptation regulations are included in all of the other 11 state climate protection acts.</p><p>A first type of laws is focused on climate protection, whereas climate adaptation is only marginally regulated (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2014KSG BW 2013, Schleswig\u2013Holstein\u2014EWKG 2017). A second type of laws (Bremen\u2014BremKEG 2015, Berlin\u2014EWG 2016, Hamburg\u2014HmbKliSchG 2020, Bavaria\u2014BayKlimaG 2020, Lower Saxony\u2014NKlimaG 2020, Hesse\u2014HKlimaG 2023) contain extended regulations on climate adaptation in addition to the regulations on climate protection. The Thuringian Climate Act (Th\u00fcrKlimaG 2018) regulates climate protection and climate adaptation equally. Finally, a standalone Climate Adaptation Act passed in North Rhine-Westphalia (KlAnG 2021) alongside with the State Climate Protection Act.</p><p>This finding shows the increasing importance of climate adaptation, which is more and more being perceived as an independent task alongside climate protection. The legal formulation of overarching climate adaptation law is thus already significantly more developed in the German federal states than at the federal level. There are only three federal states (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg) in which no climate law exists or is in preparation. The content of the laws with regard to climate adaptation has similarities, but also differences. Most of the laws contain regulations on the issues of climate adaptation, and on obligations for public bodies, which regulate especially the establishment of planning instruments and monitoring reports, and the appointment of councils of experts including their functions and, partly, regulations for municipalities.</p><p>Goals of climate adaptation</p><p>Climate adaptation is at least implicitly mentioned as an objective in almost all laws (except LKSG Rhineland-Palatinate). Unlike climate change mitigation goals, climate adaptation goals are difficult to define and to measure, because they cannot be determined by concrete quantitative targets such as the reduction of emissions. Rather, the structure and extent of the measures required vary due to regional differences concerning climate risks. Therefore, it is necessary to set qualitative as well as quantitative targets in the relevant fields. Accordingly, some laws contain somewhat more specific objectives, which name the most important fields of action or sectors (cf. Section\u00a010 para. 1 Th\u00fcrKlimaG), such as health protection, preservation of natural resources or a promotion of a sustainable and competitive economy. In some cases, additional guiding principles are mentioned, e.g. principles of hazard prevention and precaution.</p><p>Obligations for public bodies</p><p>Some concrete obligations apply primarily to state governments and senates, as they are obliged to establish adaptation plans and strategies, to set up climate advisory councils and to carry out climate monitoring (in some instances, subordinate authorities are also responsible for the latter obligation). In addition, they are to act as role models in climate adaptation, contribute to raising awareness among citizens, provide advice and create appropriate supportive structures. In some states, tasks or obligations in the field of climate adaptation are also imposed on other public bodies. Section\u00a06 para. 1 KlAnG NW includes a general clause according to which public bodies must take into account the objectives of climate adaptation in their planning and decision-making. Occasionally, the climate laws also address citizens to cooperate in climate adaptation (appealing character).</p><p>Particularly noteworthy are regulations in the KlAnG NW, according to which legislative processes shall be examined in terms of their compatibility with the goal of climate adaptation. This Act obliges the government to ensure that the objectives of the Act are taken into account in the norm-setting process of legal ordinances and administrative regulations as well as in the use of funding provided by the Land. The review of climate resilience compatibility in existing state laws/ordinances and other projects (Sect.\u00a06 para. 4 sent. 2 KlAnG NW) is optional. These provisions are similar to the climate target compatibility check for EU legal acts and measures, which have to be carried out by the European Commission for legislative acts and measures under Art. 6 para. 4 CL.</p><p>Planning instruments</p><p>Almost all laws provide for the establishment of planning instruments to achieve climate adaptation goals. These are either plans, programs, or strategies. The Energy and Climate Protection Program of Berlin (BEK) as well as the Hamburg climate plan cover both climate protection and climate adaptation. In some cases, the plan was developed in a participatory process involving the general public, social groups or public authorities. Usually, the plans, programmes, concepts or strategies are adopted by the government or the house of representatives. In most cases, there is an obligation to update the plans regularly, usually every 5 years or 4 years. Few concrete specifications on the climate adaptation-related content of the plans or on the adaptation measures are to be found in the law.</p><p>Monitoring obligations</p><p>In most climate laws (except those of Hamburg and Bavaria) monitoring obligations are anchored to observe the changes of the climate and their consequences. In some cases, however, monitoring is explicitly required only with regard to climate protection. In most cases, the monitoring reports also form the basis for updating the adaptation programs and strategies. The laws of Hamburg and Bavaria regulate the reporting on the achievement of objectives and implementation of measures. However, the responsibilities and timeframes for the implementation of monitoring differ.</p><p>Council of experts</p><p>Almost all laws provide the establishment of a council of experts which have an advisory function (only Lower Saxony has a climate competence centre instead). Though the composition of the expert councils varies: in some states, the councils exclusively consist of scientists, in other states they are mainly or partially represented by personalities from different sectors of society. In most cases, the advisory boards are appointed by the ministry or senate. The functions of the advisory boards include providing advice, submitting proposals for the further development of goals and measures, and, in some cases, making public statements. However, not all laws explicitly mandate these tasks to apply to climate adaptation, but only to climate protection.</p><p>Provisions for municipalities</p><p>Cities and municipalities are particularly affected by the consequences of climate change due to their high population density, the high degree of sealed surface areas, exposed locations (e.g. on rivers), the density of specific infrastructures for drinking water, waste water, energy, transport, etc. and the concentration of vulnerable facilities such as hospitals, care institutions, schools and universities. Therefore, they have an important role to play in climate adaptation. Section 5\u00a0para. 4 KlAnG NW stipulates that climate adaptation needs should be taken into account in the context of municipal services of general interest. However, only five states (North-Rhine Westphalia, Bavaria, Thuringia, Bremen and Hesse) explicitly provide regulations for municipalities. These formulate the possibility or recommendation that municipalities carry out their own vulnerability studies and draw up their own adaptation concepts or programs of measures. However, they do not contain any clear further obligations.</p><p>The reason for this restraint is the associated financing of climate adaptation measures. Up to now, climate adaptation has been a voluntary task of local authorities within the framework of local self-government\u2014despite explicit regulations as a consideration in the Federal Building Code or in the climate laws at state level. In order to oblige the municipalities to adapt to climate change, this could be regulated by state law as a mandatory task of the municipalities. Accordingly, Art. 12 draft Federal Climate Adaptation Act stipulates that states should require municipalities and counties to draw up climate adaptation concepts. In accordance with the principle of connexity, which is regulated in the state constitutions, the states must provide the necessary financial resources to the municipalities in this case. In many states, however, the financing obligation impedes the process of defining new mandatory tasks significantly. Section\u00a012 Th\u00fcrKlimaG and Sect.\u00a08 HKlimaG at least stipulate that the state government shall support the municipalities financially and provide data bases and findings.</p><p>In order to oblige the municipalities to adapt to climate change, a binding commitment on the part of the federal government to increase the general financial resources of the states is therefore considered necessary. Another possibility to involve the federal government in the costs would be to formulate and add a new joint task called \"climate adaptation\" to Art. 91a of the German constitution (Grundgesetz) and to anchor the tasks of the municipalities concerning climate adaptation in the federal climate adaptation law. This would lead to a compulsory participation of the federal government in financing the municipal tasks, which seems appropriate having in mind the size and importance of the task. The coalition agreement provides for the anchoring of joint financing by the federal and state governments, but without explicit reference to Art. 91a Grundgesetz. The Federal Ministry for the Environment, together with the L\u00e4nder, has set up a working group to examine financing requirements and implementation options, which are conform with the constitution.</p><p>Conclusions and outlook</p><p>The analysis above has shown, that climate adaptation as a cross-cutting issue is affecting various fields of action. The legal framework comes from different legal areas and levels (international, European, federal, state law). At the international and European levels overarching climate adaptation laws already exist (Paris Agreement, European Climate Law). In addition, climate adaptation is already anchored in numerous sectoral policies and sectoral laws of the EU. The European regulations are either directly applicable in the Member States or must be transposed by national law, which has led to a \u201cEuropeanisation\u201d of national\u00a0climate adaptation law. The example of\u00a0Germany\u00a0shows that the legislator has set its own accents in different policy areas\u00a0with its national legislative competence, for example by anchoring adaptation in the Spatial Planning Act or the Building Code. However, there are still many policy areas which lack of climate adaptation regulations. Identifying these gaps and developing suitable technical solutions as well as regulatory proposals and adopting them in the political process is a major and, in consideration of the advancing climate change, urgent task for the future, given the large number of fields of action affected.</p><p>A gap existed in particular regarding the lack of a national climate adaptation law in Germany. Overarching climate adaptation regulations exist only in most of the federal states so far, though the scope and depth of regulations varies greatly. Insofar, the legal situation is fragmented. In this respect, it is welcomed that the current German government plans to pass a climate adaptation law during this legislative period. Although Germany already has a climate adaptation strategy, action plans to implement the strategy, progress reports and established monitoring reports, such an act would nevertheless result in an additional value as it could close gaps and contribute to a better interlinking between the federal and state level. A formal parliamentary act is an important instrument for controlling societal developments, triggering an implementation obligation and ensuring a continuous implementation over several legislative periods. Depending on the content, it could also be associated with a material gain in substance, for instance with regard to standards and procedural regulations. Legal objectives and principles could also be significant for the interpretation of sectoral legislation. Last but not least, efforts for climate adaptation would gain in importance with a climate adaptation act and would become more visible internationally.</p>", "publisher": "China-EU Law Journal", "instances": ["These consequences will continue for decades, even if global and European efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions prove effective.

This has been a year of bold moves, agile responses, and powerful collaborations, all aimed at tackling climate challenges head-on and raising the bar for environmental sustainability across the beverage sector. From accelerating climate resilience to setting new benchmarks in industry standards, BIER and its members have turned ambition into action. Now, with the final quarter ahead, BIER is harnessing this momentum to close out the year with impact and step into 2026 on the strongest footing yet.</p><p><br/><br/>Advancing Technical Guidance<br/><br/>The year began with the release of Beverage Industry Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Sector Guidance Version 4.3. This update aligned the sector with emerging standards such as the CSRD and SBTi's FLAG guidance, introduced enhanced methodologies for recycling, logistics, and cooling models, and strengthened protocols for data verification and disclosure. Collectively, these updates brought the industry one step closer to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040-2050.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, BIER published the Beverage Industry EUDR Interpretation Guide, a practical, sector-specific resource to help beverage companies navigate the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). With compliance deadlines beginning in late 2025 for larger operators, this guide provided actionable tools for mapping supply chains, assessing and mitigating risk, and integrating EUDR compliance with broader no-deforestation and climate commitments.<br/><br/>Innovation Through Collaboration<br/><br/>BIER's Sustainable Coolers Coolition continued to unite members in developing solutions that reduce the environmental impact of cooling systems while safeguarding technical and business performance. This initiative reinforced one of BIER's core commitments: advancing technologies that conserve energy and water without compromising quality or efficiency. In 2025, the Coolition also hosted the Cool Challenge, inviting passionate innovators to revolutionize commercial refrigeration for chilled, canned, or bottled beverages at their point of sale. The challenge pushed boundaries, sparked innovation, and inspired sustainable solutions to shape the beverage industry's future.<br/><br/>BIER's Charco Bendito Watershed Collaboration in Mexico also delivered tangible results in improving water quality and availability through multi-stakeholder action. In 2025, lessons from Charco Bendito began informing similar efforts in new geographies, demonstrating the scalability of BIER's collaborative water stewardship model.<br/><br/>Staying Ahead of Regulatory Change<br/><br/>This year, navigating an evolving regulatory landscape wasn't just a priority; it was a strategic advantage. Through the member-only Regulatory Round-Up and Ad-Hoc sessions, BIER kept members ahead of the curve on global disclosure standards, climate legislation, and emissions reporting expectations, not just tracking changes, but anticipating them. These quarterly sessions became a space for real-time intelligence sharing, where peers compared approaches, decoded new requirements, and identified opportunities to align sustainability ambitions with global expectations. The result? Members left not only informed, but equipped to turn regulatory challenges into catalysts for stronger, more credible sustainability strategies.<br/><br/>Highlighting Industry Leadership<br/><br/>Throughout 2025, BIER's Member Spotlight series shone a well-deserved light on the people turning sustainability ambition into measurable action. From Justin Merrell of LION to Ana Fernanda Romero of Diageo, and from Heineken's Nicolas Clerget - Chair of BIER - together with colleagues Hannah Hunt and Jade Mahuzier, to David Grant of PepsiCo - BIER's Co-Chair - each story revealed a unique path to driving environmental progress. Their insights, innovations, and on-the-ground impact showcased the many ways BIER members are translating commitments into results, inspiring peers across the global beverage sector.<br/><br/>Engaging In-Person for Greater Impact<br/><br/>In May, BIER members converged in the vibrant city of Sevilla, Spain, for the Spring 2025 Roundtable Meeting, hosted by Heineken at the inspiring Fundaci\u00f3n Cruzcampo. Over three days, the venue buzzed with forward-thinking discussions and collaborative problem-solving. Members dove deep into nature-positive strategies, explored innovative ways to measure water replenishment co-benefits, examined breakthroughs in renewable thermal energy, tackled the challenge of making zero-deforestation claims credible, and celebrated the power of industry coalitions in accelerating progress.<br/><br/>That momentum now carries into the Fall 2025 Roundtable Meeting, set for September in Louisville, Kentucky. Here, members will tackle another slate of high-priority topics, from discussing best practices for implementing Collective Action projects and utilizing green fertilizer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to essential discussions on how climate adaptation can be a business driver, with the same energy and focus that has defined the year. These sessions aren't just about sharing updates; they're about reinforcing commitments to watershed health, aligning on regulatory strategies, and charting sustainability roadmaps that will ensure BIER's collective voice remains a powerful force shaping the beverage industry's environmental future.<br/><br/>Looking to the Final Stretch of 2025<br/><br/>As we move into the year's final months, BIER is channeling the energy and achievements of 2025 into actionable next steps. Our shared focus is clear: finish strong, build resilience, and enter 2026 positioned to lead. With the dedication of our members and the momentum we've built together, the beverage industry is better equipped than ever to deliver on its sustainability promises, for our communities, our ecosystems, and our future. Together, BIER members are closing out 2025 not just with progress, but with a shared vision: a beverage sector that leads the way in building a sustainable future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.co.uk\">www.m2.co.uk</url>)) </p>", "publisher": "FinancialWire", "instances": ["Members dove deep into nature-positive strategies, explored innovative ways to measure water replenishment co-benefits, examined breakthroughs in renewable thermal energy, tackled the challenge of making zero-deforestation claims credible, and celebrated the power of industry coalitions in accelerating progress.
