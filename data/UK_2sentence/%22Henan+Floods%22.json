[{"relevance_score": 45, "title": "Emergency Deployment of Japanese F-15J Fighter Jets Against a Chinese GJ-2 Drone Off Coast of Okinawa", "published": "2025-03-04", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">On February 26, 2025, Japans Self-Defense Forces detected a Chinese GJ-2 reconnaissance and attack drone operating near Okinawa. This unprecedented event led to the immediate deployment of Japanese fighter jets. The incursion occurred amid rising tensions in the East China Sea, where Chinas military activities have been increasing, raising concerns about Beijings strategic objectives in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan identified the entry of a BZK-005 reconnaissance drone into its expanded airspace, along with a Chengdu GJ-2, also known as the Wing Loong 2, for the first time. These aircraft, originating from the East China Sea, passed through the airspace between Okinawas main island and Miyako Island before entering the Pacific Ocean. They continued south of Okinawa, flying near the Amami Oshima Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, before reversing course and returning to the East China Sea via the same route. In response to this activity, Japans Air Self-Defense Force promptly scrambled fighter jets from the Southwestern Air Defense Command to intercept and monitor the drones. This command operates the 9th Air Wing, which fields Mitsubishi F-15J fighters, a Japanese variant of the F-15 Eagle, optimized for the country's air defense missions.</p><p>The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan represents a significant development. This Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance (MALE) drone is designed for both reconnaissance and strike missions, enhancing China's ability to project power in contested areas. While the GJ-2 has previously been observed over the Taiwan Strait, its operation near Okinawa indicates an expansion of Chinas unmanned aerial operations in the region. The increasing use of drones by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) reflects a broader strategy to leverage these systems for advanced surveillance, targeting, and potentially precision strikes while reducing risks to human pilots.</p><p>The Wing Loong II, developed by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), is an upgraded version of the Wing Loong I, offering improved payload capacity, endurance, and operational versatility. First unveiled at the 2015 Aviation Expo China, it was designed to meet the growing requirements of the Chinese military and international buyers. Measuring 11 meters in length with a 20.5-meter wingspan and a maximum speed of 370 km/h, it is powered by a turbocharged engine driving a three-bladed propeller. With an endurance of 32 hours and an operational range of 1,500 km, it is well-suited for extended surveillance missions in strategic areas.</p><p>Equipped with satellite communications and an electro-optical sensor suite that includes daylight and infrared cameras, the Wing Loong II can operate in both day and night conditions across various environments. It has a payload capacity of 400 kg, spread across six hardpoints, enabling it to carry guided bombs such as the FT-9/50, air-to-ground missiles like the TL-10, and GB3 250 kg bombs. Compared to its predecessor, which had a limited payload of 100 kg over two hardpoints, this expanded capability positions the Wing Loong II as a more advanced armed drone. Remotely piloted from a mobile ground control station, it provides real-time secure data transmission for operational flexibility.</p><p>Primarily developed for export, the Wing Loong II has been acquired by several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Serbia. It is marketed as a cost-effective alternative to Western drones such as the U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper, with an estimated unit price between $1 million and $2 million, compared to approximately $30 million for a Reaper. This affordability and versatility make it an attractive option for militaries seeking to enhance their strike and surveillance capabilities. The drone has been used in various conflicts, including Libya, where it conducted airstrikes under Emirati control in 2020. It has also been deployed for non-military missions, such as disaster response during the 2021 Henan floods, where a modified Wing Loong II variant carried out reconnaissance and communication relay operations.</p><p>The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan aligns with broader regional tensions in the East China Sea. This area, particularly around the Senkaku Islandsadministered by Japan but claimed by China as the Diaoyu Islandshas seen frequent incursions by Chinese military aircraft. Just two days before the GJ-2 incident, Japan detected two Chinese Y-9 military aircraft flying a similar route between the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Y-9, a multi-role aircraft used for intelligence gathering and maritime patrol, is regularly involved in such operations, prompting Japan to deploy fighters in response.</p><p>Japans Ministry of Defense has raised concerns about China's increasing military presence and its potential impact on regional stability. Although the Chinese drones did not violate Japans sovereign airspace, their proximity is seen as a show of force and a possible attempt to test Japans air defense response. A spokesperson for Japans Joint Staff confirmed that the country is maintaining constant airspace surveillance and will take all necessary measures to ensure security.</p><p>This Chinese drone incursion coincides with the U.S.-Japan joint military exercise \"Iron Fist,\" which runs until March 7 and involves maneuvers across multiple locations, including Okinawa. During this exercise, the simultaneous presence of the GJ-2 and BZK-005 near Japanese islands raises questions about potential surveillance activities or strategic messaging from Beijing. The PLA has previously escalated operations in response to military exercises conducted by the U.S. and its allies, highlighting an ongoing competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>The growing integration of drones into China's military strategy presents a challenge for Japan and its partners, who must adapt their defense capabilities to counter these evolving threats. The potential use of armed drones near Japans territory raises considerations about strengthening detection, interception, and counter-drone measures. As China continues to expand its military presence in the region, Japan and its allies remain vigilant, closely monitoring any developments that could alter the strategic balance in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific.</p>", "publisher": "Defence Monitor Worldwide", "instances": ["This affordability and versatility make it an attractive option for militaries seeking to enhance their strike and surveillance capabilities.

climate change, scientists have found.</p><p>Climate change could even be having an effect on extreme cold spells, such as the one in Texas in February which may have been influenced by a rapidly warming Arctic, and cold weather in April in France which wreaked havoc on vineyards that are coming into bud earlier in the year because of rising temperatures.</p><p>Insurer Aon has said that 2021 is expected to be the sixth time global natural catastrophes have crossed the 100 billion dollar insured loss threshold, with all six happening since 2011, the report said.</p><p>Polling by Savanta ComRes, released alongside the report, asked 2,197 people what the UK Government's new year resolution for 2022 should be focused on.</p><p>Climate change and the environment topped the list with 27% of people opting for it, ahead of healthcare on 23% and the economy on 19%, the poll found.</p><p>Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's climate policy lead and report author, said: ``The costs of climate change have been grave this year, both in terms of eye-watering financial losses but also in the death and displacement of people around the world.</p><p>``Be it storms and floods in some of the world's richest countries or droughts and heatwaves in some of the poorest, the climate crisis hit hard in 2021.''</p><p>She said that while there was some progress on tackling climate change at UN Cop26 talks in Glasgow in November, the world was not on track to ensure a safe and prosperous future.</p><p>Dr Kramer added: ``It's striking that, despite being in the middle of a pandemic, the public view this issue as a greater policy priority than both healthcare and the economy.</p><p>``If the Prime Minister wants to build on the legacy of Cop26 he needs to ensure climate change is a Government priority in 2022,'' she urged.</p><p>- Here are 10 of the most expensive climate-related disasters in 2021, according to the report:</p><p>February: Texas winter storm in the US, 23 billion
