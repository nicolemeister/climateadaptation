Rising global temperatures are intensifying droughts, accelerating extreme weather events, and disrupting the availability and quality of freshwater across the world. These disruptions are no longer \"distant threats.\" They already impact operations, value chains, and local communities.</p><p><br/><br/>Despite this, many companies continue to treat water risk as a peripheral issue in their climate strategies. Water is often overlooked while carbon reduction and energy transitions take center stage. That approach is no longer sustainable.<br/><br/>To ensure operational continuity, meet rising regulatory expectations, and build long-term business value, companies must treat water stewardship as a core pillar of their climate resilience planning.<br/><br/>Why Water Must Be Central to Your Climate Strategy<br/><br/>Water-related disruptions are escalating. In 2024 alone, the U.S. experienced 27 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, including droughts, floods, and storms-nearly triple the long-term annual average. These events are no longer rare. Industries across the board are facing growing threats: factories halted due to flooding, supply chains broken by water shortages, and community tensions fueled by the overuse or contamination of shared water resources.<br/><br/>While climate change is a global crisis, water is often how we feel its impacts first-and most acutely. Drought, flooding, and water stress are amplifying in places already under strain. These disruptions can destabilize business operations faster than many other climate risks.<br/><br/>Importantly, water risk is not just a site-level issue.

With public budgets under pressure, much of the adaptation effort will need to come from the private sector. A new World Bank report lays out policy reforms that would help households and firms adapt to increasingly frequent and damaging weather events.</p><p><br/><br/>Released today, From Risk to Resilience: Helping People and Firms Adapt in South Asia, finds that awareness of climate risk is high. More than 60 percent of households and firms have experienced extreme weather in the last five years, and more than 75 percent expect it for the next decade. Many households and businesses are already taking steps to adapt to climate risks. Around 80 percent of households and 63 percent of firms have taken some measures to adapt. However, most of these measures are basic, such as raising house foundations or installing fans. More advanced options, like using climate-resilient seeds, or relocating from high-risk areas, remain less common.<br/><br/>'The urgency is growing. People and firms are already adapting, but they are doing so with limited tools and few resources,' said Martin Raiser, World Bank Vice President for South Asia. 'Governments must act quickly to remove the barriers that prevent more effective adaptation. This includes removing distortions in land and labor markets, expanding access to finance and investing in public infrastructure to support people and businesses as they respond to climate risks.'<br/><br/>The report finds that market barriers and income constraints are holding back stronger adaptation. Households with more education or access to formal finance are more likely to adopt advanced strategies. Similarly, better-managed firms with fewer regulatory barriers tend to be more adaptive. Removing these barriers would enable more effective adaptation by households and firms.<br/><br/>'Private sector adaptation could reduce one third of the region's projected climate damage, but this requires governments to strengthen enabling environments,' said Franziska Ohnsorge, World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia. 'Adaptation is most effective when markets function well and when essential services like transport, water, healthcare, and digital connectivity are widely accessible.'<br/><br/>The report calls for both targeted adaptation efforts and broader development measures that also build climate resilience. Governments have a critical role to play, even with limited fiscal space. They can expand access to localized climate information, promote weather-indexed insurance, and support the use of resilient technologies such as energy-efficient cooling systems. Public investments in infrastructure that keep people safe and connected, such as roads, drainage, power supply, and mobile networks, are also essential.<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, investments in early warning systems and cyclone shelters have helped reduce fatalities during major storms. In India, cities like Ahmedabad are leading with heat action plans to protect urban populations from rising temperatures. They demonstrate how targeted investments, and effective institutions can help scale up local adaptation successfully.<br/><br/>The report calls for policy action guided by three core principles.

For investors and asset managers, flood resilience is no longer just an environmental consideration, it is a critical factor in financial decision-making, asset valuation, and transactional due diligence. Understanding flood risk ensures informed investment strategies, mitigating liability, insurability challenges, and marketability concerns for properties and portfolios.</p><p><br/><br/>Beyond Standard Requirements: The Case for Climate Projections<br/><br/>Traditional Flood Risk Assessments (FRAs) often rely on historical flood data, but this fails to account for climate-driven risks. By integrating UK Climate Projections (UKCP) scenarios, investors can anticipate fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flood impacts, ensuring assets remain insurable, financially viable, and compliant with evolving regulations such as the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS S2), previously the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).<br/><br/>Key Considerations for Investors and Developers<br/><br/>* Fluvial, Pluvial, and Coastal Risks - Understanding diverse flood risks ensures effective asset protection and strategic investment decisions.<br/><br/>* Regulatory Evolution  Market Dynamics - UK policy shifts demand climate resilience strategies for sustainable investments.<br/><br/>* Insurance Feasibility  Asset Value Implications - Flood-exposed properties face higher premiums, reduced liquidity, and exit strategy limitations.<br/><br/>Leveraging Flood Maps for Smarter Site Selection<br/><br/>Modern Flood Maps, including those from the UK Environment Agency and other geospatial providers, offer vital insights into flood zones, historical flood extents, and modelled projections. These visual tools help developers and investors make informed decisions about site selection and risk exposure. However, Flood Maps alone are not sufficient for due diligence. They should be used alongside bespoke flood risk assessments and other relevant third-party reports that account for future climate scenarios and site-specific variables such as elevation, soil type, and drainage capacity. By combining mapping with relevant analytical assessments, stakeholders can avoid undervaluing, or overexposing assets.<br/><br/>Mitigation Strategies for Resilient Investments<br/><br/>* Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) - Critical for insurance and investment viability, SuDS reduce flood risk while enhancing environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>* Resilient Site Design  Adaptive Infrastructure - Flood-resistant materials, elevated structures, and site drainage enhancements protect assets from climate-driven risks.<br/><br/>* Financial Risk Modelling for Investors - Incorporating flood exposure into financial forecasting supports accurate valuation and market positioning.<br/><br/>The Role of Flood Risk Assessments in ESG and Sustainability Reporting<br/><br/>Flood risk has become a key disclosure topic in ESG frameworks. Investors and publicly traded companies are expected to report climate-related risks, including flooding, in alignment with IFRS S2, CDP, and other global reporting standards. A thorough flood risk assessment supports transparency and demonstrates proactive risk management. These insights can also help companies meet stakeholder expectations and avoid reputational harm tied to climate inaction or underreported liabilities.<br/><br/>Who Needs a Flood Risk Assessment?<br/><br/>While commonly associated with large residential or commercial assets, flood risk assessments are essential across many sectors: retail, logistics, manufacturing, education, healthcare, and more. Transactions involving data centers, infrastructure assets, even brownfield with a view to redevelop in the future and often require flood risk evaluation, especially where Flood Maps demonstrate uncertainty or indicate moderate to high flood potential. Lenders, pension funds, and insurers may request an FRA during due diligence to assess long-term viability and ensure assets are not exposed to unmanaged risks.<br/><br/>Impact on Insurability, Site Value, and Long-Term Viability<br/><br/>Flood exposure influences capital investment, portfolio performance, and asset liquidity. Poor flood resilience can lead to:<br/><br/>* Higher financing costs due to lender risk concerns.<br/><br/>* Decreased asset attractiveness for institutional investors.<br/><br/>* Challenges in securing property insurance and market valuation stability.<br/><br/>Linking FRAs to Transaction Support<br/><br/>Flood risk isn't just a consideration; it is a transactional necessity. A thorough FRA ensures:<br/><br/>* Clear risk evaluation for buyers and sellers.<br/><br/>* Transparent insurance feasibility for investment decisions.<br/><br/>* Strategic positioning of assets in evolving financial landscapes.<br/><br/>The Antea Group UK Advantage<br/><br/>At Antea Group UK, we provide specialist flood risk advisory, supporting investors, asset managers, and lenders with:<br/><br/>* Comprehensive flood assessments tailored for transactions.<br/><br/>* Climate resilience risk modelling to inform financial decisions.<br/><br/>* Data-driven insights to protect asset liquidity and investment viability.<br/><br/>* SuDS integration and resilience-based flood mitigation strategies.<br/><br/>Flood Risk Assessments Key Takeaways<br/><br/>* Flood risk is a financial risk - Climate-driven flooding impacts asset value, insurance availability, and investor confidence.<br/><br/>* Standard Flood Maps are not enough - They must be supplemented with bespoke, forward-looking flood risk assessments that incorporate climate projections.<br/><br/>* Flood Risk Assessments are critical for transactions and future development - From supporting acquisitions and divestments to securing planning permission, FRAs play a pivotal role.<br/><br/>* Mitigation strategies protect asset value - Tools like Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), resilient design, and adaptive infrastructure are essential for long-term viability.<br/><br/>* Flood risk assessments support ESG reporting - They align with frameworks like IFRS S2 and demonstrate climate resilience to stakeholders.<br/><br/>* Investors across all sectors benefit - FRAs are essential not only for large developments but also for logistics, retail, data centers, and institutional portfolios.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Why Proactive Flood Risk Assessments Matter<br/><br/>For investors, flood risk directly impacts financial performance, transaction success, and long-term asset viability. By embedding climate resilience into Flood Risk Assessments, businesses can secure investment stability, insurance feasibility, and portfolio integrity.

With 59 per cent of its population living in rural areas and agriculture accounting for 23 per cent of GDP, the sector is crucial for the country's development. Recognised as one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the repercussions of climate shocks, Madagascar is engaged in various fronts to overcome the challenges caused by erratic weather patterns including prolonged drought. DEFIS+ will help to reduce the negative impacts of climate variability by applying adaptation measures.<br/><br/>\"We are committed to working closely with IFAD, in alignment with the country's climate agenda, to deliver results that improve the lives and livelihoods of climate vulnerable communities.\" said Euan Low, GCF Sub-Regional Lead for East and Southern Africa Region.<br/><br/>PR-37-2025 (2)<br/><br/>\u00a9IFAD<br/><br/>As a prelude to the launch of the project, the IFAD and GCF teams, in collaboration with the State of Madagascar, organized a 3-day workshop to support the start-up and operationalization of the programme team. The workshop provided stakeholders with background information on the project and discussed the modalities required for effective and objective implementation to benefit small-scale producers.<br/><br/>\"In Madagascar, we are working to ensure that the fight against climate change makes a real contribution to transforming the country. DEFIS+ will be an illustration of this: by strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and agriculture, we are improving the lives of rural populations and moving towards more sustainable development\", said Max Andonirina Fontaine, Minister for the Environment and Sustainable Development.<br/><br/>Since 1979, IFAD has funded 18 rural development projects in Madagascar for a total cost of US$ 1,012.86 million, with an IFAD investment of US$ 502.83 million benefiting more than 635,000 households.

At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking<br/><br/>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.<br/><br/>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"<br/><br/>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:<br/><br/>* Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/><br/>* Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/><br/>* Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/><br/>* Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/><br/>* Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.<br/><br/>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.<br/><br/>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change<br/><br/>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking<br/><br/>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.<br/><br/>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"<br/><br/>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:<br/><br/>* Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/><br/>* Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/><br/>* Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/><br/>* Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/><br/>* Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.<br/><br/>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.<br/><br/>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change<br/><br/>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

It is embedded in corporate sustainability, supply chains, and ESG mandates.</p><p><br/><br/>* Finance is a critical enabler, with calls for creative, localized funding models and stronger integration into ESG and investment frameworks.<br/><br/>* Collective action is essential but complex, requiring trust, transparency, and local ownership to succeed.<br/><br/>* Communication matters-simplifying language and storytelling are vital to engaging stakeholders, driving action and breaking out of echo chambers.<br/><br/>* Policy frameworks must catch up, with stronger integration of water into climate adaptation plans and global governance. Scalable impact will come from localized solutions, backed by strong partnerships between government, business, and finance<br/><br/>* AWS Standard Version 3.0 introduces streamlined requirements, deeper integration of climate and biodiversity, and new expectations for collective action and water reuse.<br/><br/>As the climate crisis intensifies and biodiversity loss accelerates, water stewardship is emerging not just as a sustainability imperative-but as a strategic, economic, and social necessity. At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking<br/><br/>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.<br/><br/>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"<br/><br/>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:<br/><br/>* Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/><br/>* Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/><br/>* Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/><br/>* Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/><br/>* Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.<br/><br/>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.<br/><br/>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change<br/><br/>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking<br/><br/>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.<br/><br/>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"<br/><br/>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8.

The respondents, drawn equally from board-level executives and C-suite leaders, represented a cross-section of sectors including energy, health, infrastructure and finance. Half of the companies had annual revenues exceeding $1bn.<br/>The findings show a clear divide between companies that treat sustainability as central to business operations, termed \"Sustainability Integrators\", and those where sustainability remains siloed or is not meaningfully implemented.<br/>Only 27% of surveyed businesses fell into the integrator category. These companies reported a 40% higher level of confidence in their business outlook over the next 12 months compared to others.<br/>They also reported their boards were 1.5 times more effective at addressing sustainability issues and faced significantly lower reputational risk: only 6% of integrators reported media backlash over sustainability, compared to 39% among others.<br/>The report also found that investor and activist pressure remains high: 91% of respondents cited investor expectations to improve sustainability performance, while 78% reported pressure from activists. Yet many companies continue to deprioritise environmental concerns in the face of commercial decisions.<br/>Major gaps in corporate climate action remain<br/>Nearly 55% of companies admitted their sustainability strategies were either entirely separate from business operations or did not exist.<br/>A further 57% said sustainability initiatives were more likely to be cut than commercial projects if financial pressures emerged. In contrast, only 4% of Sustainability Integrators said they would deprioritise sustainability in a downturn.<br/>To address this gap, EY recommends fostering unified leadership on sustainability, building company-wide accountability, and increasing investment in sustainability-related capital projects.<br/>Climate adaptation yields high returns, WRI study finds<br/>Separately, WRI's new analysis of adaptation and resilience investments has revealed substantial returns, both economic and social.<br/>The study examined $133bn in adaptation spending across agriculture, infrastructure, health and water sectors, and found an average return of $10 for every $1 spent. In some sectors, particularly health, returns were significantly higher.<br/>Health-related adaptation investments, such as expanding access to care and combating climate-sensitive diseases like malaria and heat stress, yielded average returns of 78%. Investments in disaster risk management, including early warning systems and flood defences, also posted strong returns due to their ability to protect lives and infrastructure.<br/>WRI identified three main sources of value-what it refers to as the \"triple dividend of resilience\": avoided losses, induced economic gains (e.g. job creation or agricultural productivity), and broader social and environmental co-benefits. More than half of the benefits identified were realised even in the absence of a climate disaster, highlighting that adaptation infrastructure and services can provide consistent value.<br/>The study points to projects like China's Hubei Yichang Rural Green Development, which supports small-scale farmers with climate-smart practices and water treatment infrastructure, showing nearly double the return on investment. In South Africa, Durban's riverine management project is expected to deliver six times its cost in benefits by reducing flood risk through nature-based solutions.<br/>Despite these gains, WRI found that only 8% of projects included comprehensive assessments of all three dividends. This suggests that adaptation benefits may be significantly underreported in traditional cost-benefit analyses, potentially discouraging investment.<br/>Policy recommendations and economic implications<br/>Both reports highlight the need for integrated strategies and long-term planning. EY's findings suggest that aligning sustainability with commercial objectives, rather than treating it as a separate or secondary concern, leads to better governance outcomes and financial resilience.<br/>WRI, meanwhile, calls for governments to embed adaptation into national development plans and to adopt more systematic methods for measuring adaptation outcomes.<br/>The WRI report also found that nearly half of the investments assessed had co-benefits for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. In sectors such as forestry, transport and energy, nature-based adaptation projects like urban tree planting or coastal wetland restoration served dual purposes-building resilience while sequestering carbon or reducing emissions.<br/>This overlap, WRI argues, could help attract more climate finance by bridging the gap between adaptation and mitigation.<br/>The report warns, however, that current evaluation standards fail to capture this dual benefit, and calls for a new global standard in adaptation measurement to improve transparency and comparability. Such standards could support better investment planning and increase private sector confidence in adaptation financing.<br/>Leaders from the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action and COP30 climate envoys have called for this data to help reshape priorities ahead of international negotiations.<br/>As countries prepare for COP30 later this year in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, both the EY and WRI reports underscore a shared message: integrating sustainability and resilience into decision-making is no longer a reputational exercise; it is becoming central to financial performance and development effectiveness.<br/>Related article:<br/>Published 3rd June 2025<br/></p>", "publisher": "Edie.net", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 51, "title": "Nature is not someone else\u2019s problem", "published": "2025-08-22", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many readers of Utility Week might of course be forgiven for asking what nature and biodiversity has to do with them. They probably recognise that next to the climate emergency the nature emergency is perhaps the second biggest environmental issue. Some even recognise the risks to specific species such as \u2018pollinators\u2019 (aka bees) and puffins. But few will know that the government\u2019s 2024 \u2018State of Nature\u2019 Report found that \u201call of our ecosystem assets, and almost all the benefits they provide, are at high or medium-high risk\u201d, and that climate change is already making these risks much worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such readers are of course concerned with their day-to-day jobs of running large networks, building major new engineering projects, regulating and being regulated as natural monopolies. Given this, nature can inevitably seem more arm\u2019s length or \u201csomeone else\u2019s problem\u201d.</p><p>The answer is that for their organisations at least this is very far from the case. In addition to major infrastructure projects, utilities have a major maintenance footprint, and many own land as well. Nature has an important role to play in delivering carbon reduction, can help with climate resilience, and can help build community support for new projects. In a number of cases, nature can validly substitute for concrete infrastructure \u2013 e.g. with regard to water pollution. Nature also offers wider \u2018co-benefits\u2019 such as flood reduction/climate resilience and can potentially be traded (something the Corry review for Steve Reed the Defra SOS was particularly strong on).</p><p>                     Need to act                   </p><p>So, to start with the legal and political imperative. Legally, all new development in England, (extending to infrastructure development next year), must now provide for 10% biodiversity net gain \u2013 and utilities and utility regulation have an awful lot of new infrastructure to deliver. Public bodies (which include both regulators and water and energy companies) must also more widely have regard to biodiversity, and to the new local authority nature recovery plans, under Section 40 of the Environment Act. Finally, the recent Levelling up Act also requires such bodies to have particular regard to protected landscapes such as national parks and AONBs.</p><p>Politically, Number 10 may not be desperately interested at the moment, but when Defra and DESNZ ministers jointly come together to press the point, utilities and their regulators ought to sit up. And, speaking as a former No10 environment advisor, organisations such as the National Trust and RSPB gives them serious access and weight, when they choose to exercise it.</p><p>In England the Environment Act also contains a formal target to halt the decline in species populations by 2030, and then increase populations by at least 10% to exceed current levels by 2042.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.senedd.wales/mgIssueHistoryHome.aspx?IId=46004\">Welsh Environment Bill</url> (currently at Stage 1 of adoption) aims to tackle the climate and nature emergencies by strengthening environmental governance and reversing biodiversity loss. It introduces a legally binding framework for biodiversity targets aligning with internation aspirations to protect and manage 30% of land, freshwaters and seas by 2030.\u200b</p><p>The Scottish Government has developed a strategic delivery framework for Biodiversity comprising a Biodiversity Strategy to 2045 supported by six-yearly Delivery Plans, and statutory targets for nature restoration. The ambition is for Scotland to be nature positive, halting biodiversity loss by 2030, and to have restored and regenerated biodiversity across the country by 2045.</p><p>Finally, the third national climate change risk assessment identified biodiversity (along with energy and the built environment) as the area furthest behind in terms of climate resilience. The government accepted this finding.</p><p>Moving on from the law and politics, utility customers (and the wider public) are clearly concerned to ensure their electricity and water is supplied in a nature friendly way. Willingness to pay studies have consistently demonstrated an acceptance by customers of the case to go beyond statutory requirements. A survey for National Grid even showed that their customers put nature enhancement higher up their list than net zero.</p><p>There are also wider stakeholder interests. The NGO community is both vocal and well-organised in its response to perceived shortcomings. In addition, there is strong and growing support for nature-related initiatives from current and prospective employees, local communities, local authorities, and the rural sector. Investor interest is also emerging, with a new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) complementing the existing Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework for carbon. Past events\u2014such as the Brent Spar controversy\u2014have shown that nature-related issues can carry significant reputational and operational risks, particularly in the face of direct action.</p><p>Finally, the direct business case for nature within utilities stacks up in terms of natural capital values but also with direct benefits in terms of community support and reduced risk with regard to planning decisions.</p><p>                     State of play                   </p><p>So, what is being done already? Perhaps not surprisingly, the water industry and Ofwat are further ahead than electricity and gas networks, although there has also been a lot of work looking at making onshore and offshore wind nature friendly. Most wastewater companies have catchment management programmes \u2013 and many also have working and delivery relationships with their local rivers and wildlife trusts. They would have considerably more if it were not for the risk aversion in the Environment Agency identified strongly in the Cunliffe review. A significant part of the need for new reservoirs is also the extent of pressure on river environments from water abstraction and the need therefore for \u2018sustainability reductions\u2019 (something the EA are keen on, along with natural flood management instead of concrete flood defences).</p><p>For all the recent bad press on their wider regulatory record, Ofwat \u2013 after a slow start \u2013 are not bad in this area either. The recent price review allowed for in price review switching from \u2018grey to green\u2019 and introduces a performance incentive for biodiversity work, particularly on water company land.</p><p>In electricity, the companies seem to be showing some degree of willingness, and the RIIO2 environmental action plans showed intent in this area \u2013 supported in part by Ofgem. National Grid in particular wanted to build on this for RIIO3 (though not as far as their stakeholders wanted). However, Ofgem\u2019s draft determination simply argued that the statutory biodiversity net gain was sufficient: something which a number of stakeholders (including the author of this article) are likely to question \u2013 and may betray the inevitably rushed nature of draft determinations.</p><p>On gas by contrast the companies and Ofgem appear more aligned. Ofgem\u2019s text is definitely more nuanced than for electricity transmission: \u201cWe also propose that the GDNs collaborate with biodiversity experts, charities and consultants when preparing their AERs. We agree with the environmental group that the GDNs could go beyond their proposed projects and BAU activities to support BNG in RIIO-GD3. Engaging with biodiversity specialists will provide valuable insights into local biodiversity priorities, ensure projects are ambitious and encourage GDNs to identify additional, impactful opportunities to enhance biodiversity within the communities they serve\u2019</p><p>Taking proper account of nature is not only a legally requirement of utilities and their regulators, but also good business and popular with customers. This is likely to grow.

JLL estimates $340bn (\u00a3249bn) of global real estate assets will be at risk from climate-related events by 2050, with that figure potentially rising to more than $1tn if significant adaptation measures are not implemented.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate adaptation is driving financial decisions in the market. Physical climate risks and resilience are now key parameters for investors during their due diligence processes. Insurance markets are also responding with reduced coverage and higher premiums for vulnerable properties, creating financial pressures for property owners who have not invested in resilience measures.</p><p>In response, regulatory frameworks are evolving, with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures mandating transparency around physical climate risks and the EU Taxonomy\u2019s climate adaptation objectives creating clearer standards for effective climate adaptation in real estate. UK regulations currently deal with physical climate risks at a local level, so planning requirements relating to hazards such as flooding and overheating risk can only be inconsistent.</p><h>Climate adaptation vs mitigation</h><p>The real estate industry has historically focused predominantly on transition risks and climate mitigation strategies, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy adoption and low-carbon construction strategies. While these efforts remain essential, they address only half of the climate challenge. Assuming that 80% of the building stock in 2050 will already exist now, we need to understand how vulnerable standing assets are against the changing climate and develop robust adaptation strategies. However, climate adaptation \u2013 preparing buildings to withstand and recover from climate impacts \u2013 has received less attention compared to climate mitigation, despite its growing urgency.</p><p>The relationship between adaptation and mitigation efforts creates both synergies and potential conflicts. Green roofs exemplify positive synergy, providing cooling effects (adaptation) while reducing energy consumption (mitigation). Similarly, passive design strategies can enhance thermal comfort during extreme weather while reducing operational emissions. Nature-based solutions can also enhance resilience and they often require less capital expenditure compared to other retrofit measures and can unlock wider benefits enhancing ecology and biodiversity.</p><p>In comparison, there are some actions which conflict: for example, reduced air permeability rates, in new buildings or refurbishments, aim to minimise energy consumption for heating, but can amplify the risk of overheating unless coupled with high ventilation rates. Similarly, flood protection measures often involve carbon-intensive materials like concrete.

'Our $ 6.2 million investment in multi-country early warning systems is just one way we are translating vision into impact.'<br/><br/>Highlighting climate change as a fundamental development challenge, Dr. James Murombedzi, Head of the African Climate Policy Centre at UNECA, then stressed the need for home-grown solutions.<br/><br/>'Our response to climate change must be led from within, and ClimDev-Africa empowers us to integrate climate action into every facet of development planning. The programme has become a trusted platform for action, research, and capacity building.'<br/><br/>Progress made: Achievements from Phase I<br/><br/>The workshop reviewed progress under Phase I (2011-2023), which laid a strong foundation for the programme. Over this period, ClimDev-Africa supported 18 projects in 17 countries, including five regional climate centres serving over 42 million people. More than 60 meteorological experts-30 percent of them women-were trained, while 14 high-performance computing systems and 40 automatic weather stations were deployed.<br/><br/>'These weren't just investments in infrastructure; they were investments in African capacity,' said Dr. James Kinyangi, the Bank's Coordinator of the Climate and Development Special Fund.<br/><br/>'Our response to climate change must be led from within and ClimDev-Africa empowers us to integrate climate action into every facet of development planning.

These are the types of investments that build real economies and regional prosperity.\"<br/><br/>The Lobito Corridor, a strategic rail and road project connecting Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zambia, is among the largest regional integration initiatives currently under preparation with support from the African Development Fund. With a $ 500 million commitment, the Fund is helping to finance and de-risk the project, which is expected to catalyze investment in logistics, agriculture, and mining, particularly in critical minerals vital to the global energy transition.<br/><br/>Chanda also referenced the Kazungula Bridge Project, a regional integration initiative co-financed by the Fund with an investment of $ 68 million. Completed in 2021, the 923-meter-long bridge spans the Zambezi River, connecting Zambia and Botswana and replacing a long-standing ferry service. The project also includes One-Stop Border Posts on both sides of the bridge, significantly streamlining customs procedures and reducing transit times along the North-South Corridor. It supports intra-African trade, enhances regional logistics efficiency, and has become a key node for trade between Southern and Central Africa.<br/><br/>Participants raised questions on donor engagement, capital market access, and the future structure of the Fund. Dabady reaffirmed the Bank's ongoing efforts to attract non-traditional partners and finalize approvals that would enable the Fund to access capital markets.<br/><br/>\"The ADF has long flown under the radar,\" she said. \"But this is a pivotal moment to raise its profile, demonstrate impact, and unlock greater investment for Africa's most pressing priorities.\"<br/><br/>The session concluded with a call to action from Kerezhi Sebany, Africa Director for Economic Opportunities at the ONE Campaign. \"We must shine a light on the African Development Fund,\" she said. \"When people know what the Fund is and what it delivers, it fosters transparency, trust, and partnership. Now is the time to tell the ADF story and tell it boldly.\"<br/><br/>The African Development Fund is currently undergoing its 17th replenishment cycle (ADF-17). The next consultative meeting with development partner representatives will be held virtually on 18-19 September 2025.

The work aims to reduce carbon loss, improve water quality, and enhance habitats for birds and insects that depend on peat bogs.<br/>George Kohler, SWPP senior restoration officer, said the urgency of the work has never been clearer:<br/>\"The past year has shown us how important peatland restoration is. It can't wait. Fires on peatlands, and record-breaking rainfall over short periods combined with long periods of dry weather all take their toll.<br/>\"We need to get Dartmoor's peatlands as healthy and resilient to the changing climate as we can now, to benefit us all in the coming years. More and more research continues to show how peat bogs are a crucial habitat in need of restoration.<br/>\"This work improves wildlife habitat, helps to store water, reduces erosion and carbon loss into streams and rivers, and provides water sources for moorland livestock.<br/>\"Working through the Autumn and Winter helps us to protect nesting bird species. We're well prepared for the weather that a Dartmoor winter throws our way. You may spot our specialised low-pressure machines out on the moor this season, helping to stop ongoing erosion and crucially hold back water to raise that water table in the peat.\"<br/>The work is also vital for preserving Dartmoor's archaeological and cultural record.<br/>Martin Gillard, SWPP Historic Environment Officer, explained:<br/>\"Healthy peat keeps a record of human interactions with our environment and the climate dating back over thousands of years; if we let the peat dry out or erode away, we risk losing that information.<br/>\"In my role working with SWPP project officers and contractors I ensure that historic features are protected during the restoration works and carry out or commission surveys and studies that add to our knowledge of Dartmoor and its peatlands.\"<br/>The South West Peatland Partnership aims to restore hundreds of hectares of degraded peat each year across Dartmoor, Exmoor and Cornwall. The programme contributes to national peatland restoration targets and delivers benefits for climate resilience, biodiversity, water quality and farming.<br/>The project is delivered in collaboration with local contractors, landowners and organisations, with support from Natural England's Nature for Climate Peatland Grant Scheme, South West Water, the Duchy of Cornwall, the Environment Agency and the National Trust.<br/></p>", "publisher": "The Moorlander", "instances": ["In my role working with SWPP project officers and contractors I ensure that historic features are protected during the restoration works and carry out or commission surveys and studies that add to our knowledge of Dartmoor and its peatlands.
