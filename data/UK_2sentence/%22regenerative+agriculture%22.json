Programmes from agribusinesses and food brands provide support to keep the momentum going and deliver on the promise of regenerative agriculture.</p><p><br/>Martin Lines, whose Papley Grove Farm in Cambridgeshire, England, has been in his family since 1936 says: \"We need all partners to join together to create a healthy farming system that feeds the nation and also delivers resilience amid a changing climate.\"<br/>Financial incentives and technical assistance from companies like ADM are giving Martin and fellow farmers more confidence to implement practices aimed at improving soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Advances in data and technology, meanwhile, are helping to measure the impact of these approaches and providing farmers with crucial insights.<br/>Like Lines, Staffordshire farmer James Daw is determined to secure the future of his farm and ensure that his children can respond to an array of challenges, especially the rising threat of climate change. The autumn and winter of 2023-24 was England's second wettest period on record, impacting farmers around the country as they established their winter crops.<br/>\"Today, the extremes are worse, whether it is the dry, hot summers or the excessive rainfall we saw last year.\" says Daw who oversees about 3,000 acres (approximately 1,214 hectares) of farmland at Woodhouse Farm and Thorpe Estate in the West Midlands north of Birmingham. \"At the same time, the costs are high and the financial risks therefore in planting some of these crops are significant.\"<br/>ADM's regenerative agriculture programme in the UK - part of a wider global effort that began in North America in 2022 - rewards farmers with payments for regenerative agricultural practices such as planting cover crops and reducing tillage that can sequester carbon in the soil, as well as verifying the practices using the latest technology. Healthy soils are better able to absorb heavy rainfall, and they're also able to hold more water during droughts.<br/>\"We're doing this for the next generation,\" according to Daw. \"If we don't do this everywhere, not just on our own farm, these soils won't be there to grow crops and provide food in the future.\"<br/>Daw, who grows oats, wheat, barley, beans and oilseed rape, says he is encouraged by increasing support he sees for regenerative agriculture among companies across the food, agriculture and water sectors. Those industry contributions are key to scaling up regenerative agriculture and maximising its impact.<br/>Few companies touch every part of the value chain like ADM, giving the company a critical role to play in uniting the key partners in the sector, connecting farmers across the world to major customers. While talking to farmers every day, ADM is also partnering with downstream customers to scale up its regenerative agriculture efforts.<br/>In June 2024, ADM announced a partnership with Bayer in Poland, working with oilseed rape farmers covering about 9,000 hectares. A preliminary assessment showed emissions from those hectares relying on at least one regenerative agricultural practice were 15 per cent lower than those of conventional farms. As part of the next stage of the collaboration, the programme will expand into a broader range of crops such as corn, wheat and barley, and geographically across Eastern Europe. Earlier this year, ADM partnered with AgriTech company Klim, a leading European provider of Scope 3 solutions for agriculture, to expand its re:generations(TM) program across Germany. With a goal of enrolling 60,000 acres (approximately 24,281 hectares) in Germany by the end of 2025, the program in Germany is currently available for farmers growing wheat, oil seed rape, and soy.<br/>Financial support is vital for adoption of regenerative practices, but so too are data collection, third-party technical expertise, and peer-to-peer networks. In the UK, partner Map of Ag is connecting on-farm data sources to provide sustainability metrics such as nitrogen use efficiency, carbon emissions and biodiversity indicators to give famers a deeper understanding of their carbon footprint and environmental performance.<br/>ADM has also partnered with Ceres Rural to provide one-on-one technical support to growers, alongside farmer workshops to encourage knowledge exchange.

Well, everything. Whisky, as is the case for most spirits, is an agricultural product. We are living in a climate crisis, and large-scale agricultural processes are a large part of the problem.</p><p><br/>At Fielden, we live our 'no chem regen' philosophy through our genetically diverse and nutrient-rich grains within our farming partners' fields. We are trying to be part of the solution and not the problem. We are working with nature in our fields and not against it.<br/>And no, I am not advocating drinking whisky to save the planet or as part of a better diet. That is your choice, although, should you imbibe on occasion, I will advocate for drinking less and drinking better.<br/>Finally, a simple definition of regenerative agriculture: in the words of John Cherry, founder of Groundswell, \"it is any form of farming, i.e. the production of food or fibre, which at the same time improves the environment. This primarily means regenerating the soil. It's a direction of travel, not an absolute.\"<br/>Collective brain<br/>This is the beauty of Groundswell; it is a collective brain. Farmers, communities, scientists, academics, business folk, innovators, replicators, regulators, financers and royalty all thinking about the same issues and moving in the same direction. There is collaboration everywhere. It gives the gathering a real sense of being one healthy organism.<br/>It's unique; nobody is claiming to have solved the problem per se, but everyone is aligned to the fact that farming has to improve its impact on our planet and on ourselves. Soil health betters planet and gut health, and planet and gut health betters mental health; it all starts with the soil! These are the recurring soundbites that you pick up as you navigate your way between talks at the Cherrys' Lannock Farm.<br/>For hundreds of years, humans have ransacked planet Earth's ecosystems. We have picked up an addicted and unhealthy passenger on the journey, namely obesity. In 2022, 43% of all adults globally were overweight and 16% living with obesity, according to the WHO.<br/>The WHO noted; \"the obesogenic environment exacerbating the likelihood of obesity in individuals, populations and in different settings is related to structural factors limiting the availability of healthy sustainable food at locally affordable prices.\"<br/>Critical problem solving... by the afflicted?<br/>, widely recognised as the godfather of regenerative agriculture and author of the best-selling book 'Dirt to Soil', mesmerised his audience.

Asking them to solve the problem in isolation is ludicrous.<br/>Genuine hope, not ungrounded optimism<br/>It is critical that external help comes from influencers, the world of government and regulatory funding, finance, and large corporations. Establishing the business case for nature will drive radical farming improvements.<br/>Seeing the many organisations looking to support farmers on their journey into regenerative farming was heart-warming; how can we help you measure your soil health, the health of water that falls, remains, or drains form your land and the biodiversity above and below ground on your land?<br/>Hats off to all at ; a business that provides a guide to and a pathway through regen agriculture.

Bringing regen farming to UPFs is nothing to go on stage and brag about. Flip your model.<br/>Lastly, call me a royalist, but seeing and hearing the words of Prince William at Groundswell brought a lump to my throat and many others'.<br/>The Prince said: \"If we as a society are to meet the challenges ahead, it will be by learning from the land and those who tend it with wisdom and humility....\u00a0 let this festival be not just a celebration of innovation but a rallying call, for regenerative farming is not a fringe alternative.

Beneficial insects and pollinators thrive in these habitats, contributing to healthier ecosystems across the state. *Regulatory Alignment: New rules clarifying thresholds, licensing, and testing protocols give regenerative hemp farmers the stability they need to scale sustainable operations and access broader markets.<br/><br/>A New Chapter for Oregon Hemp<br/><br/>Under the updated regulations, growers must maintain detailed records of their cultivation practices, including any use of pesticides and soil amendments. This data-driven approach helps ensure transparency, traceability, and quality control-an important factor as hemp flower gains popularity in wellness, textile, and industrial applications.<br/><br/>Hemp Flower Co., an Oregon-based farm certified in regenerative agriculture, sees these developments as a sign that the industry is maturing. \"We're thrilled the state is recognizing hemp's enormous potential in regenerative farming,\" said Michal P., Founder of Hemp Flower Co. \"These regulations go hand-in-hand with our vision. By focusing on healthy soil and biodiversity, we can consistently grow premium hemp flower while contributing to a more sustainable farming system.\"<br/><br/>Looking Ahead<br/><br/>With the hemp sector expanding in both domestic and international markets, industry stakeholders and regulators are hopeful that Oregon's evolving rules will continue to bolster responsible cultivation methods.

Deep agronomic knowledge and quantification technology are key to getting placement and incentives right.<br/><br/>Indigo Ag's sustainability programs - rooted in agronomic knowledge, advanced quantification technology, and meaningful incentives - have shown scaling regenerative agriculture as a solution to achieve positive climate outcomes is possible. With over 7 million acres enrolled, we are pioneering this approach on an unprecedented and growing scale.<br/><br/>Scaling such solutions for widespread adoption, however, involves inherent complexities. Recognizing this, Indigo remains committed to upholding the highest standards of scientific rigor and integrity. To ensure transparency and credibility, we submitted our findings for scientific peer review. This research, which analyzed our first three carbon credit issuances, confirmed that large-scale initiatives can effectively build soil carbon and deliver significant environmental benefits when the right incentives are in place.<br/><br/>Our initial three carbon credit issuances alone totaled nearly 300,000 credits - by far the largest volume of high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits issued repeatedly at scale. This program has created real, measurable climate and environmental impact, resulting in millions of dollars paid directly to farmers for their efforts. And as our methodologies and understanding of soil carbon science evolve, our research shows that the impact per acre is even greater than initially estimated. With Indigo's carbon credits now priced between $ 60 and $ 80 per credit - and approaching the catalytic $ 100 mark - the potential returns for farmers continue to grow, offering a valuable opportunity amid volatile commodity markets and rising input costs.<br/><br/>Key findings from the study include:<br/><br/>* Technology enables scalable monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for regenerative agriculture that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon.<br/><br/>* Reduced nearly 400,000 tons of carbon equivalent emissions, resulting in nearly 300,000 carbon credits issued.<br/><br/>* The impact of farming practices varies by geography, underscoring the need for tailored solutions for different regions, ideally down to the field level.<br/><br/>* High-impact practices: No-till and cover crops contribute the most to soil carbon at the project scale, with cover crops having one of the highest impacts per acre across a range of geographies.<br/><br/>* By incentivizing outcomes and tailoring advice regionally, we can ensure the right solution is applied to the right acre.<br/><br/>Like other emerging climate solutions, regenerative agriculture faces the challenge of balancing lengthy research timelines with the urgency of reducing atmospheric carbon now. Carbon emissions avoided or sequestered today have a greater impact than the same reduction achieved a decade from now, helping us avoid critical climate tipping points. Decades of research demonstrate the benefits of sustainable farming practices, with some areas well-documented and others under-studied. In some cases, science is still building methods to measure the impacts of regenerative practices that people and communities working the land have known and witnessed for generations. Bringing together the experience and wisdom of these practitioners with peer-reviewed science is critical for scaling solutions with genuine environmental and ecosystem impact. A key question remains: Can findings from prior studies be generalized and scaled?<br/><br/>Rather than waiting for others to address this question, we chose to act - experimenting, gathering evidence, and sharing results with the broader scientific community. Our recent publication demonstrates impact at scale is possible with appropriate safeguards and a focus on areas of greatest certainty of impact.<br/><br/>And we are just getting started. We understand that sustainability and decarbonization in agriculture require multiple approaches, with carbon credits being just one tool.<br/><br/>Science and technology are at the heart of our approach to open new markets for farmers to participate in the programs that reward them best for the ecosystem benefits they provide. The same monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) engine that drives our carbon credit programs is helping supply chains incentivize sustainable practices, whether it's cotton for clothing, rice for food, or corn for biofuels. These flexible solutions are and will help companies meet their goals while improving farm profitability and resilience.<br/><br/>Since we launched our Carbon and Sustainable Sourcing programs, we've learned a tremendous amount and worked hard to use learnings to improve them. While we began in areas with greater scientific certainty, we've invested in scientific research, partnered with others to explore under-researched areas, and advocated for universities and government to fill gaps in knowledge. This approach, combined with transparency and a commitment to the highest standards of integrity, is driving progress in regenerative agriculture and carbon markets.<br/><br/>The benefits of programs that reward regenerative agriculture go beyond emissions reductions and carbon removals. Regenerative agriculture positively affects multiple ecosystem services and the environment, such as improved water quality and reduced erosion. When valued with market-based incentives, these systems also positively impact farm resiliency and rural communities by ensuring that farmers themselves receive the majority of the value generated by our programs.<br/><br/>Just as we continuously improve the science and technology behind our programs, we also expand the pool of producers that can benefit from them. Early on, we adjusted our minimum acre requirements to ensure more farmers, including smaller operations, could participate. We've also expanded the geographies and crops we can support.

With over 7 million acres enrolled, we are pioneering this approach on an unprecedented and growing scale.<br/><br/>Scaling such solutions for widespread adoption, however, involves inherent complexities. Recognizing this, Indigo remains committed to upholding the highest standards of scientific rigor and integrity. To ensure transparency and credibility, we submitted our findings for scientific peer review. This research, which analyzed our first three carbon credit issuances, confirmed that large-scale initiatives can effectively build soil carbon and deliver significant environmental benefits when the right incentives are in place.<br/><br/>Our initial three carbon credit issuances alone totaled nearly 300,000 credits - by far the largest volume of high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits issued repeatedly at scale. This program has created real, measurable climate and environmental impact, resulting in millions of dollars paid directly to farmers for their efforts. And as our methodologies and understanding of soil carbon science evolve, our research shows that the impact per acre is even greater than initially estimated. With Indigo's carbon credits now priced between $ 60 and $ 80 per credit - and approaching the catalytic $ 100 mark - the potential returns for farmers continue to grow, offering a valuable opportunity amid volatile commodity markets and rising input costs.<br/><br/>Key findings from the study include:<br/><br/>* Technology enables scalable monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for regenerative agriculture that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon.<br/><br/>* Reduced nearly 400,000 tons of carbon equivalent emissions, resulting in nearly 300,000 carbon credits issued.<br/><br/>* The impact of farming practices varies by geography, underscoring the need for tailored solutions for different regions, ideally down to the field level.<br/><br/>* High-impact practices: No-till and cover crops contribute the most to soil carbon at the project scale, with cover crops having one of the highest impacts per acre across a range of geographies.<br/><br/>* By incentivizing outcomes and tailoring advice regionally, we can ensure the right solution is applied to the right acre.<br/><br/>Like other emerging climate solutions, regenerative agriculture faces the challenge of balancing lengthy research timelines with the urgency of reducing atmospheric carbon now. Carbon emissions avoided or sequestered today have a greater impact than the same reduction achieved a decade from now, helping us avoid critical climate tipping points. Decades of research demonstrate the benefits of sustainable farming practices, with some areas well-documented and others under-studied. In some cases, science is still building methods to measure the impacts of regenerative practices that people and communities working the land have known and witnessed for generations. Bringing together the experience and wisdom of these practitioners with peer-reviewed science is critical for scaling solutions with genuine environmental and ecosystem impact. A key question remains: Can findings from prior studies be generalized and scaled?<br/><br/>Rather than waiting for others to address this question, we chose to act - experimenting, gathering evidence, and sharing results with the broader scientific community. Our recent publication demonstrates impact at scale is possible with appropriate safeguards and a focus on areas of greatest certainty of impact.<br/><br/>And we are just getting started. We understand that sustainability and decarbonization in agriculture require multiple approaches, with carbon credits being just one tool.<br/><br/>Science and technology are at the heart of our approach to open new markets for farmers to participate in the programs that reward them best for the ecosystem benefits they provide. The same monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) engine that drives our carbon credit programs is helping supply chains incentivize sustainable practices, whether it's cotton for clothing, rice for food, or corn for biofuels. These flexible solutions are and will help companies meet their goals while improving farm profitability and resilience.<br/><br/>Since we launched our Carbon and Sustainable Sourcing programs, we've learned a tremendous amount and worked hard to use learnings to improve them. While we began in areas with greater scientific certainty, we've invested in scientific research, partnered with others to explore under-researched areas, and advocated for universities and government to fill gaps in knowledge. This approach, combined with transparency and a commitment to the highest standards of integrity, is driving progress in regenerative agriculture and carbon markets.<br/><br/>The benefits of programs that reward regenerative agriculture go beyond emissions reductions and carbon removals. Regenerative agriculture positively affects multiple ecosystem services and the environment, such as improved water quality and reduced erosion. When valued with market-based incentives, these systems also positively impact farm resiliency and rural communities by ensuring that farmers themselves receive the majority of the value generated by our programs.<br/><br/>Just as we continuously improve the science and technology behind our programs, we also expand the pool of producers that can benefit from them. Early on, we adjusted our minimum acre requirements to ensure more farmers, including smaller operations, could participate. We've also expanded the geographies and crops we can support. As ecosystem markets grow, this must continue to ensure that structural barriers, which historically underserved some producers, are not perpetuated. It's why engagement with groups like the National Black Growers Council and the National Indian Carbon Coalition are vital to enabling us to build programs that are inclusive of the diversity of farmers across the continental U.S.<br/><br/>The science remains foundational, and we're committed to advancing it. It's why our customers and partners trust us, it's why we continue to share our findings, and it's why we invite the scientific community and the farming community to engage and work with us to answer the open questions and identify areas where our programs can improve. Only by working together will we build trust and confidence in regenerative agriculture's potential to deliver for farmers, our soils and our planet.<br/><br/>Join us in scaling proven regenerative agriculture solutions to deliver sustainable outcomes.

But we knew progress would require innovation, long-term commitment and supportive policy environments.</p><p><br/><br/>Five years on, we have better data, deeper insights and a clearer view of the practical realities to deliver net zero. Climate resilience is complex and key systems like regulation, policy frameworks and infrastructure have not advanced at the scale required.<br/><br/>Today, alongside our Annual Report publication, we're updating a few of our sustainability goals, with some important adjustments to our carbon and packaging goals to give us a stronger, more credible path forward. As our most strategic climate risk, our water goals remain the same.<br/><br/>Our revised carbon targets now have an extended timeline, a fiscal 2022 baseline and they have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for the near and long-term. They cover our net-zero journey in greater detail, they remain data driven and are still aligned to a 1.5 degree warming pathway.<br/><br/>Our revised targets include:<br/><br/>Reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, reaching net zero in direct operations by 2040.<br/><br/>Reducing our scope 3 emissions by 26% by 2030 and achieving net zero across scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2050.<br/><br/>Increasing the percentage of recycled content in our packaging to 50 % by 2030.<br/><br/>Implementing 10 regenerative agriculture programmes by 2030.<br/><br/>To simplify our reporting and bring greater focus to our delivery, we're also retiring a few of our goals:<br/><br/>With our updated SBTi targets across carbon, our 100% renewable energy by 2030 goal will be superseded by those new requirements. We remain committed to our target of 100% renewable electricity by 2030 through our RE100 target.<br/><br/>We're also retiring our 10% reduction packaging weight goal as the absolute nature of the packaging weight competes with volume growth.<br/><br/>We're also proud of the progress we've made on some tough targets in the last five years:<br/><br/>On water, we've surpassed our goal to provide Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities near our sites and we've implemented over 150 water replenishment projects. Since 2020 our water efficiency has improved by 20.6% and we're on track to replenish more water than we use in water-stressed areas by 2026.<br/><br/>On carbon, more than 85% of the electricity we use is now renewable and our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have also decreased by nearly one fifth on our 2022 baseline. We've also surpassed our goal of launching five regenerative agriculture programmes by 2030.<br/><br/>On packaging, we've hit our 2025 goal of 35% recycled content in PET bottles, reaching 43%.<br/><br/>Sustainability has never been simple. Collaboration remains essential and we cannot achieve our goals in isolation. We're clearer than ever on what it takes to achieve our objectives with renewed focus and expert knowledge.

For example, Kraemer told us, they can collaborate on enabling farmers to practice regenerative agriculture. Most farmers are \"very very far\" from this, he told us.</p><p>The alternative protein sector also has a responsibility to mitigate the potential impact of their sector on farmers. If meat consumption is reduced, he told us, there will be less demand for crops that go into animal feed, and therefore the farmers growing these crops will get less money for them. It is the responsibility of the alternative protein sector, he told us, to prevent this from causing farmers to go bankrupt.</p><p>One way in which the regenerative agriculture sector could learn from protein diversification, he suggested, is in getting new capital into food system transformation.</p><p>In order to ensure a collaborative, rather than combative, relationship between the two sectors, GFI\u2019s Walden suggested, it must be emphasised that protein diversification is \"one part of the solution,\" rather than the be-all and end-all of sustainable food systems. \u201cThere are no silver bullets in the food system.\u201d</p><p>She suggested, the sector should be more specific about the problems linked to animal agriculture, which, she told us, are caused by intensive, industrialised agricultural systems rather than regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Building on this more collaborative approach, the alternative proteins sector should work with farmers to find common policy goals that they can both aim towards. It also has the potential to help regenerative farmers in areas such as cover cropping.</p><p>One potential synergy is connected to space. While alternative proteins need less space for production than animal agriculture, regenerative agriculture needs significantly more than agriculture that doesn\u2019t use regenerative methods.

Kraemer, who works extensively with farmers as part of his role, believes that farmers view the sector as alienated from their lives. \u201cI think the perception is that it is driven by the interests of very very rich people who don\u2019t care about local regions, or local farmers, or local food culture,\u201d he told FoodNavigator.", "Kraemer, who works extensively with farmers as part of his role, believes that farmers view the sector as alienated from their lives. \u201cI think the perception is that it is driven by the interests of very very rich people who don\u2019t care about local regions, or local farmers, or local food culture,\u201d he told FoodNavigator.

In order to ensure a collaborative, rather than combative, relationship between the two sectors, GFI\u2019s Walden suggested, it must be emphasised that protein diversification is \"one part of the solution,\" rather than the be-all and end-all of sustainable food systems. \u201cThere are no silver bullets in the food system.", "In order to ensure a collaborative, rather than combative, relationship between the two sectors, GFI\u2019s Walden suggested, it must be emphasised that protein diversification is \"one part of the solution,\" rather than the be-all and end-all of sustainable food systems. \u201cThere are no silver bullets in the food system.

Unilever is a case in point: the food giant has committed to transition one million hectares of conventional agriculture to regenerative farming by 2030. </p><p>Five years out, the company is \u201cabsolutely on track\u201d, says Unilever\u2019s global foods sustainability lead Dorothy Shaver.</p><p>The big challenge now, for everyone moving towards regenerative farming, is proving that it works.</p><p>What Unilever wants from regen ag reporting</p><p>So far, Unilever has already put regenerative agriculture (regen ag) into action on 23 projects covering 130,000 hectares of land. These cover vegetables for Knorr bouillon cubes, and soybeans and rapeseed for Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise.</p><p>But putting programmes in place is not enough. Companies like Unilever need to measure the outcomes of these projects to know what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, and how projects can be improved.</p><p>So where does a food major like Unilever start? First up, with a set of practical metrics that track real project outcomes. </p><p>The approach is two-pronged: each outcome needs to be specific to the programme, and industry should be aligned on which metrics to use. Unilever is working with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to advance progress on both. </p><p>The goal is to regenerate whatever has been degenerated, explains Shaver. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a generic, overarching framework. It must be designed for certain crops in certain areas that are suffering from certain things.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why Unilever is firm in its focus on what it achieves, not just what goes in. If a practice restores precious but diminishing resources, such as water, soil or biodiversity, it\u2019s regenerative.</p><p>No single, unified definition of regenerative agriculture exists. But if it did, a prescriptive, catch-all definition won\u2019t be able to accurately measure if a project is regenerating ecosystems, stresses Shaver. </p><p>An approach to regenerative agriculture in the thirsty fields of Spain cannot mirror that of a tropical environment. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare water saved in an area that\u2019s drought-ridden, to an area that isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Is regenerative agriculture worth the cost?</p><p>Tracking environmental outcomes is not the only goal for business. Unilever wants to see social outcomes and like anyone in a for-profit organisation, return on investment. </p><p>Evaluating farmer livelihoods throughout the process is an important piece of the puzzle, and all outcomes can be linked. If farmers\u2019 crop yields are higher, crop quality is improved, and less labour on the field is required, that\u2019s the best outcome for all involved. </p><p>There is a \u201cstrong push\u201d to bring financial metrics \u2013 such as return on investment, cost saving, and yield gains \u2013 into the equation, too. Progress on this has been bubbling away in the background, suggests the food sustainability chief. </p><p>\u201cIt needs to be a coalition-based approach across the industry, and we need to make sure we have science to back it up. That\u2019s very much evolving.\u201d</p><p>A new report is helping on the research side of things. According to the European Alliance for Regenerative Agriculture (EARA), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2025/06/05/regenerative-agriculture-could-make-eu-farms-carbon-negative/\">regenerative agricultural practices make farms more</url> than those using traditional farming methods. The EARA concludes that regenerative agriculture, if adopted in full, could even make farming in Europe carbon negative.</p><p>How business can help farmers make the switch</p><p>Farmers have been working the land in a conventional way for years, and often, generations. Encouraging a farmer to move away from traditional practices such as tilling or heavy fertiliser use, towards regenerative alternatives, is a big change.</p><p>Companies like Unilever are asking farmers to take a risk, agrees Shaver. \u201cThe risk is big and could potentially impact the livelihood of the farmer. They know that if they move away from practices they\u2019re used to, there could be a reduction in yield \u2013 in the short term.\u201d</p><p>The solution is to share that risk, explains the food sustainability lead. Different stakeholders can partake in risk sharing, from governments to suppliers and manufacturers. Unilever agrees to share that risk if a crop fails, or if yield decreases.</p><p>Another way to help get farmers over the line is to show that regen ag is working. None of the 23 projects Unilever has instigated has resulted in a loss in yield.</p><p>In southern Spain, Unilever has seen an influx in neighbouring farms adopting regenerative agricultural practices after setting up its own project for tomatoes. The water-scarce areas had suffered from failed harvests in recent years, and Unilever has helped install drip irrigation to use less water more efficiently. Other practices instigated include cover cropping, and using fewer and more organic fertilisers.</p><p>Qualitative data suggests everything is on the up: from yield to quality, biodiversity, and importantly, the number of farmers turning to regen ag in the area. Farmers have been able to prove greater resilience in the face of unexpected weather events, Shaver explains.</p><p>Looking to quantitative data, Unilever says it\u2019s long been working with farmers on indicators and measurements. Digital tools that track progress can prove a \u201cmajor unlock\u201d, particularly when it comes to carbon emissions.</p><p>Examples of data-reporting technology leveraged by Unilever include sustainable food operations tool Muddy Boots and NASA\u2019s Sustainable and Regenerative Agriculture (SARA) initiative. </p><p>What\u2019s next for regenerative agriculture?</p><p>The future is regenerative, believes Unilever, which is advocating for government policy to support the same vision. Farmers must be \u201ccontinuously rewarded\u201d for using environmentally friendly practices, stresses Shaver. </p><p>It\u2019s not up to one business alone to prove regenerative agriculture is paying off. \u201cWe need other farmers to come on board, we need other businesses, financial investors and policymakers to show that it\u2019s working. And of course, we need to report on progress.\u201d</p><p>The final link in the chain is the consumer. According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01925-3\">fresh research</url>, an overwhelming majority of people \u2013 whether in poorer or richer nations \u2013 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.undp.org/publications/peoples-climate-vote-2024\">want stronger climate action</url>. </p><p>Shaver is hopeful that industry can encourage consumers to care more about how their food is grown. She wants to lean into storytelling and visuals to get there. </p><p>\u201cI really hope brands don\u2019t just shift to using words that don\u2019t make any sense to people.

Those yields, however, have occurred in a climate-stable regime,\u201d Rudzinski explained.\u00a0</p><p>Historic data is becoming a less valuable tool for institutional investors to predict future cash flows and farm performance as the climate crisis worsens.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Instead, institutional investors should be procuring and analysing data demonstrating the impact of regenerative agriculture, such as tracking soil health, he suggested. \u201cThe healthier the soil, the more resilient and stable the yield and the more predictable cash flows become,\u201d Rudzinski added. \u201cInvestors can either continue to operate on using outdated data or they can push for more stable farms that focus on regenerative agriculture.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Rudzinski also said investors needed to take a more proactive approach to monitoring how their land is farmed to protect against falling yields and valuations. In the US, around 40% of farmland is rented or leased, with owners of that land \u2013 typically institutional investors \u2013 expecting returns that match historic trends. As the negative impacts of climate change worsen, he said, the land is becoming less valuable, and output is decreasing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOver time, rents will decrease and, when it comes time to sell the land, returns will suffer further,\u201d said Rudzinski. \u201cAny farmland asset owner should be very concerned about what their tenants are doing to that land and how they are farming it. The asset is not just the physical land, it\u2019s what the land can produce that matters and investors need to pay more attention to that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Increasing engagement and disclosure is helping to increase oversight, with asset owners able to draw on stewardship-focused initiatives like the Principles for Responsible Investment\u2019s Spring or reporting frameworks like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures to improve insight of transition progress across their agricultural assets. Extended supply chains can make it difficult to secure granular, farm-level metrics, particularly through public equity holdings, but less so for private equity funds with direct holdings.\u00a0</p><h>Moving up the agenda\u00a0</h><p>Interest and investment in regenerative agriculture has increased in line with a growing awareness of soil degradation, water stress and other symptoms of over-exploitation of natural resources through food production, compounded by climate change.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Last year, the non-profit Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Platform launched a <url normalizedValue=\"https://saiplatform.org/regenerative-agriculture-programme\">global framework</url> to increase standards and consistency in the adoption of regenerative agriculture.

With almost 60% of the Mars value chain GHG footprint coming from agricultural ingredients, as part of our Net Zero Road Map, we are scaling up new climate-smart agriculture initiatives to drive decarbonisation.<br/>As part of this, Mars is aiming to deliver more than one million acres of regenerative agriculture practices by 2030 on a global scale.

At Mars, we are fostering partnerships across multiple geographies and platforms that bring diverse stakeholders together to share knowledge, invest in innovation and support farmers in the challenge of transitioning to more regenerative practices.<br/>For example, in Europe, to help tackle issues around the upfront costs of transitioning to a regenerative system, Royal Canin is working together with Soil Capital - a Belgium-based agronomy firm - to help engage, train, and support farmers in their transition to using regenerative agriculture practices\u200b. Through this partnership, Royal Canin is working with 220 farmers in its grains supply chains to implement regenerative farming practices across 46,000 hectares of land today. This represents the total wheat and barley for the brand sourced from France, and 30% of the corn.<br/>In addition, together with ADM's established re: generation program, Mars is helping to pair direct incentives for farmers with technical assistance support, demonstrating our recognition that farmers must be at the centre of all climate-smart agricultural practices.<br/>In Australia, Mars is working with industry peers and Charles Sturt University on the Cool Soil initiative - a farmer-focused, scalable framework for emissions reporting through the supply chain. This initiative works to enable a scientifically credible framework for the Australian food industry to support farmers to deliver healthy, sustainable products into the future. After two years of research by the Cool Soil Initiative, the Cool Farm Alliance developed a regional version of the Cool Farm Tool for Cool Soils specifically for Australian growing conditions.<br/>In North America, Royal Canin USA and Mars Petcare US, Inc, are collaborating with Riceland Carbon Ready(TM) program.

By 2030, regenerative agriculture should be scaled up in line with external frameworks, and companies should be able to demonstrate progress to switching operations to clean heating systems.

By 2026, suppliers will need to established \"science-aligned\" emissions reduction plans across all Scopes, set targets to switch to renewable electricity, start adopting regenerative agriculture practices, and commit to deforestation and conversion-free products. Suppliers are encouraged to cascade the targets down the supply chain to other suppliers, while non-member companies are invited to adopt the new targets.

Investor members collectively oversee $80trn of assets under management.<br/>Read on for Ridwaan's answers to our questions.<br/>How I got to where I am now:<br/>\"I spent part of my childhood visiting family in the Horn of Africa, where conversations often centred on the harvest: whether rain would come, if the drought would last, or how crops were holding up. From a young age, I saw how climate shocks like droughts and floods were part of daily life, not distant risks, and how much they disrupted communities who relied on agriculture for both income and food security. It made me ask why this was happening. The more I learned about climate change, the clearer it became that those who contributed least were paying the highest price. That early understanding shaped how I see sustainability and why I chose to work in it.<br/>\"I joined FAIRR in 2024. At FAIRR, I work across climate, equity, and investment strategy to ensure sustainability transitions deliver for the people most affected by them. I help shape FAIRR's approach to a Just Transition, defining what it means for the global food system and demonstrating how it can add value across climate, nature, and social workstreams. The goal is to build a shared understanding internally and provide investors with practical ways to engage on transition risks and equity.<br/>\"Right now, I am helping update FAIRR's regenerative agriculture framework to reflect real-world complexity. That includes the financial realities farmers face, whether related to income stability, access to fair labour conditions, or resilience against economic shocks.<br/>\"The transition to a low-carbon food system is already underway. The question is whether it will be designed to include everyone.\"<br/>My biggest career achievement to date has been:<br/>\"Helping to drive a multi-stage project at FAIRR that culminated in a high-level roundtable at biodiversity COP16 in Cali, Colombia, last year. The aim was to explore how investors can finance a Just Transition to regenerative agriculture.<br/>\"We brought together global food companies, financial institutions, and civil society to discuss how capital can support farmer livelihoods while reducing environmental impact. I helped shape the research, stakeholder engagement, and design of the roundtable itself, which turned months of background work into meaningful action with global stakeholders.\"<br/>The biggest challenge I have encountered has been:<br/>\"Showing that a Just Transition isn't a 'nice-to-have' - it is essential for resilience and long-term value. Many companies prioritise decarbonisation but overlook how these shifts affect livelihoods, incomes, and communities. When transition plans exclude people, the result can be disruption, unrest and rising future costs.<br/>\"That's why my work focuses on grounding Just Transition in data, risk and materiality, not sentiment. It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about ensuring supply chains remain stable, business models remain viable, and transitions are delivered effectively.<br/>\"For this to happen, we need more than climate ambition. We need real financial flows, not just loans, and practical support for those delivering change on the ground.\"<br/>I would describe my generation as:<br/>\"Carrying the costs of inaction.\"<br/>For me, a successful 12 months ahead looks like:<br/>\"Laying the foundation for a Just Transition strategy at FAIRR that integrates across internal workstreams such as regenerative agriculture, antimicrobial resistance, and protein diversification.<br/>\"The goal is to ensure transition planning reflects both climate ambition and the real-world social and economic conditions facing farmers, workers, and Indigenous communities.<br/>\"I'll also contribute to the refresh of FAIRR's Four Labours of Regenerative Agriculture\u00a0report. My focus is on strengthening the social dimension by supporting the inclusion of Just Transition best practices and indicators, as part of a broader team effort.\"<br/>Outside of my day job, I enjoy:<br/>\"Helping to lead Somalis for Sustainability, an initiative that I co-founded. It focuses on elevating climate issues in the Horn of Africa and creating space for young professionals to engage with climate justice. We work on building community, raising awareness, and connecting local challenges to global climate discussions. A highlight has been working with partners to deliver Somalia's first Local Conference of Youth (LCOY), which contributed to the country's first-ever National Youth Statement feeding into YOUNGO's Global Statement for the UNFCCC.<br/>\"Alongside this, I've picked up running as a new hobby and, as a beginner, have set myself the goal of completing at least two half marathons this year. Unfortunately, they're a week apart! But running with friends makes training enjoyable.<br/>\"I've also fallen into the padel craze and am enjoying the challenge of learning something new. These outlets help me stay balanced and recharged.\"<br/>My 'Mission Possible' message to business leaders is:<br/>\"We must move beyond seeing sustainability as simply reducing harm. The opportunity is to build systems that restore ecosystems, improve lives, and create shared value for people, nature, and business.<br/>\"So, sustainability must be holistic. It is not just about carbon or nature. Social impact, including livelihoods, fair work, and community resilience, is inseparable from environmental goals. One without the other is not sustainability. Climate justice must be central, especially as the Global South has long shouldered the consequences of a crisis it contributed least to.<br/>\"The first movers will be the businesses that act now. Do not wait for perfect data or outside pressure. Choose to lead. The cost of inaction will outweigh the investment in a planned, inclusive, and just transition. This is the chance to shape a future that is regenerative, resilient, and rooted in shared prosperity for people, communities, and planet.\"<br/>My advice for young people entering the sustainability profession is:<br/>\"Start by finding your people. The sustainability world is complex, spanning climate, food systems, equity, and nature. It's all connected, and no one makes sense of it alone. It took me a while to realise how important community is, but having people who challenge and support you makes all the difference.<br/>\"Learn from your peers. Find a mentor. Reach out to someone whose work you admire and ask for advice. The best guidance often comes from a single honest conversation.<br/>\"And hold onto your 'why'. It's easy to get swept up in frameworks, company assessments, and constant updates. When things feel overwhelming, return to that purpose. That's your anchor.\"<br/>To stay in the loop for the next round of annual nominations for the 30 Under 30,\u00a0.

Without the scale, there is no showing stakeholders that there can be a business case for regenerative agriculture; there is no showing them that it can fight food insecurity; there is no showing them that it can mitigate the effects of climate change and pollution, and improve biodiversity and soil health. Scale, in a word, matters.</p><p>Farmers are central to this process. Upskilling farmers will enable more regenerative agriculture projects to thrive, and cement regenerative methods as a part of agricultural practices.</p><p>\u201cThe Portfolio is focussed around demonstrating how actors within a region can work together to develop a viable transition towards regenerative agriculture. The Portfolio will upskill, train and support a core group of farmers within the region. This will involve a range of organisations working . . . to test solutions, from insurance companies and banks to startups and innovators working with farmers, cooperatives and offtakers.\u201d An offtaker is someone who has signed a contract agreeing to buy a portion of a producer\u2019s upcoming goods.</p><p>EIT is leading the programme in collaboration with the non-profit FoodValley, which aims to keep track of developments. \u201cWe will use an approach for baseline measurements and monitoring measurements, so we can monitor the developments,\u201d the organisation told FoodNavigator. \u201cWe aim to contribute in practice and accelerate the sustainable ambitions that various Portfolio partners have set.\u201d</p><p>The initiative, it stressed, \u201caims to demonstrate pathways in various regions to show how cross sectoral and cross value chain collaboration can facilitate farm to fork transition.\u201d</p><p> Derisking regenerative agriculture \u200b</p><p>Despite significant investment from organisations such as EIT, many corporates are reluctant to stick their toe into the world of regenerative agriculture, as the business case remains uncertain. The problem of upscaling regenerative systems is a complex one, Steven Lang, managing director from the climate change investment firm Pollination, told FoodNavigator.</p><p>To persuade investors to put money into regenerative agriculture, Lang told us, he would say to them: \u201cYou\u2019re investing in a system which is founded on robust and strengthening natural capital, which underpins all agricultural productivity; and you're investing in the social and human capital that is the unit of production.</p><p>\u201cSo in terms of risk mitigation for investors: strong natural capital, strong social capital and relationships.\u201d Furthermore, the fear of a yield drop in regenerative agriculture, he suggested, is overstated, and in some programmes, such as in India, yields even went up from using a regenerative system.</p><p>However, investors are cautious, and must be persuaded before they put their money into risky propositions like new farming methods. This is where blended finance comes in. Blended finance is when organisations put some money into an industry or practice, such as regenerative agriculture, that could be considered risky, in order to derisk it and encourage private sector investors to provide the rest.</p><p>\u201cThere's a massive gap,\u201d between the private sector on the one hand, and NGOs on the other, Lang told us. \u201cAt the moment you have philanthropy ploughing its own furrow, sprinkling philanthropic dollars across lots of pilot projects; you've got development finance that's doing the same, that haven't really committed at the billion-dollar level which they really need to; and then you've got private sector and they're doing their own thing in their own supply chains.\u201d</p><p>Blended finance is vital to get the private sector into a position where they feel they can invest, Lang told us. \u201cI would argue that we can't and we won't deliver the transition to regenerative without a major central role for blended finance facilities, because the private sector is showing interest in deploying capital but it will typically say \u2018we can't find enough bankable projects, particularly in emerging markets\u2019.</p><p>\"I would argue that we can't and we won't deliver the transition to regenerative without a major central role for blended finance facilities, because the private sector is showing interest in deploying capital but it will typically say \u2018we can't find enough bankable projects, particularly in emerging markets\u2019.\"</p><p>\u201cThey will also say that investing in some of these countries is just too risky, and it's really difficult to get money to large numbers of smallholders. So you've got fragmentation risk, you've got country risk, you've got project risk; so even though there's a wall of money building on the private sector side, it's not yet being deployed or committed because it needs to be de-risked.</p><p>\u201cThe only way that you can really de-risk it is a major intervention from climate finance and philanthropy, with the focus of that investment also including capacity building for local institutions, strengthening farmers and organisation, basically taking away all of the layers of risk that the private sector needs to get sufficiently comfortable to participate in a blended facility.\u201d</p><p>One of the organisations that is working to de-risk regenerative agriculture is the Global Environment Facility, or GEF (pronounced \u2018Jeff\u2019).

Thus, where the GEF comes in is giving investors a grace period where the part of the project with no returns is taking place.</p><p>\u201cWe fund the fund managers to have a whole period in which we're not expecting any type of return; we just stay there and fund those types of regenerative (activities) or changes in behaviour at the farm level,\u201d Benchimol-Dominguez told us. It is much the same for development banks.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is risky because, she told us, \u201cit\u2019s asking a farmer to move away from an existing track record and a given productivity of the soil to switch practices.\u201d This, firstly, requires a significant trust in the farmers \u2013 that they will be both able and willing to shift their practices \u2013 as well as a period of five or six years where no revenue will come in at all.</p><p>On top of this, the agricultural sector itself is risky as it is, added Peter Mbanda Umunay, senior environment specialist at the GEF. Climatic conditions such as drought and flood make the sector inherently unstable. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, he went on, the private sector is interested in using the GEF money to scale up regenerative agriculture practices. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more traction, many many companies and private entities are coming to us with different projects, and it happens to be quite often linked to agriculture and regenerative agriculture,\u201d he told us.</p><p>While many multinationals are still focused on sustainable agriculture, interest in regenerative is growing, albeit mainly in developed countries.

This means that regenerative agriculture practices now have a real price tag attached to them for farmers. First Milk is undoubtably the most invested in this with its members having to undertake a -regen plan- annually where points are awarded based on the number of regenerative or biodiversity enhancing interventions taking place on the farm. However, other milk companies also have points-based systems or advantage schemes such as Arla and M\\xC3ller, where premiums are awarded based at least in part, according to similar criteria. There is no actual universally agreed upon set of standards or practices that constitutes regenerative agriculture but there is consensus on the fundamental principles. These are:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Minimise soil disturbance. Keep the soil covered. Maintain living roots in the soil. Maximise plant diversity. Integrate livestock.</p><p>Furthermore, whilst not mentioned in the above list of principles, milk companies are also assessing farm practices in terms of biodiversity gain and carbon efficiency. With milk companies and the Scottish Government both offering financial incentives for hitting the same criteria, there has never been a more important time to invest in your farm-s natural capital, not just to tick a box, but for the bottom line. So, what are some of the things you can do to stay ahead of the curve and make sure you are securing the regen-ag, carbon and biodiversity premiums?</p><p>Grazing and cropping strategies</p><p>You may think that livestock integration on a dairy farm is easily achieved. However, even dairy farms can have large areas that are just cut for silage or used for arable cropping that are rarely grazed by livestock. With housed herds this is especially significant. Where grazing can be maximised, this can help to increase the regen score. Beyond the amount of land grazed, the method of grazing is also important, with rotational grazing or mob grazing being preferable to set stocking. Sward plant diversity is also a criterion. This could include multispecies leys that are intentionally seeded or semi-natural, and species-rich grasses. Where land is used for arable cropping, cover and catch cropping and incorporating livestock grazed grass leys into the rotation can help to meet the standards.</p><p>Biodiversity features</p><p>Milk companies are also allocating points for the establishment of new, or management of existing biodiversity promoting features. Hedges can help to meet both biodiversity and carbon targets. This is because they provide habitat and a food source for a number of species, and also sequester carbon whilst gaining biomass. Hedgerow sequestration is quantifiable in the Agrecalc carbon calculator for hedges younger than 30 years. To manage existing hedgerows for biodiversity gain, consider trimming hedges once every two or three years to allow them to flower. Hedges can also be enhanced by laying or coppicing. Other biodiversity options include wildlife corridors, wildflower strips, ponds, riparian buffers, conservation areas, wetlands, and silvopastures. It is worth noting that many of these options also fall under the Agri-Environment Climate Scheme (AECS). As such, there is funding towards the establishment capital and the management of a number of different biodiversity features and habitats that also satisfy milk company objectives.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Whilst milk companies are not all paying for the same regen and biodiversity practices, or may be incentivising some more than others, between the milk buyer premiums and the Scottish Government-s environmental schemes, the financial significance of environmental farming has never been higher. You may have land that you-ve previously considered unproductive and less valuable, but in the coming years that land may turn out to be one of your most valuable natural capital assets to help you access both government funding and milk buyer premiums. To find out more about what you-ve got and what you could create in terms of biodiversity and habitat, there is currently funding available towards biodiversity audits.

This visionary program, beginning in and around the Lowery Creek Watershed in Wisconsin, seeks to create a connected highway of climate-resilient habitats restoring biodiversity, improving soil and water health, and strengthening the long-term resilience of the food system.</p><p><br/><br/>The future of food depends on healthy, functioning ecosystems. Yet America's farmland is under intense pressure-biodiversity is disappearing, soil health is declining, and the land's ability to withstand environmental stress is weakening. By linking farms, watersheds, and wild areas, the biodiversity highway will reduce fragmentation, support pollinators and wildlife, and help buffer communities from climate impacts like flooding and erosion.<br/><br/>The program is building a practical model for reconstructing ecosystems in ways that have the potential to improve how the land functions-filtering water, storing carbon, managing pests, reducing erosion, and keeping farmland productive over time. This includes cultivating perennial crops, which stay in the ground over years improving soil health by reducing or eliminating the need for tillage.<br/><br/>'Teaming up with Mad Agriculture represents a meaningful step forward in our commitment to improving ecosystem health and fostering climate resilience,' said Jason Buechel, chief executive officer at Whole Foods Market. 'This initiative is about rethinking how we care for the land and support the people who grow our food. As the program expands, it will forge a more connected, resilient landscape - supporting biodiversity and more sustainable farming for generations to come. It's one of the most exciting efforts we've launched this year, and it builds on the momentum and progress outlined in our 2024 Impact Report.'<br/><br/>As part of the initiative, Whole Foods Market has pledged up to $ 500,000 in matching funds to catalyze $ 1 million in collective investment from food system stakeholders in 2025. The program aims to cultivate a 1,000 acre biodiversity highway across American farmland and invites Founding Member organizations to co-invest in ecosystem reconstruction efforts that will serve as an example for regenerative agriculture and collaborative supply chain transformation. Companies committed include Applegate, Bob's Red Mill, The Campbell's Company, New Belgium Brewing, OLIPOP, UNFI, UNFI Foundation, west~bourne, and Yogi Tea.<br/><br/>'This initiative is laying the groundwork for a new kind of agriculture,' said Omar de Kok-Mercado, Director of Wilding at Mad Agriculture. 'The biodiversity highway is a blueprint for the next era of American infrastructure. Not just pipes and roads but living systems that restore function to land. It operationalizes perennial agriculture at scale, connecting ecological health to economic resilience. We're not restoring the past - we're engineering the future, one corridor at a time.'<br/><br/>The initiative is a cornerstone of Whole Foods Market's broader commitment to sustainability, as detailed in its newly released 2024 Impact Report. The report highlights progress across our key focus areas, including:<br/><br/>Advancing Regenerative Agriculture: Doubled the number of certified regenerative products to 301, all verified by trusted third-party standards such as Regenerative Organic Certified, Regenified, and Ecological Outcome Verified.<br/><br/>Biodiversity Leadership: Ranked the top U.S. retailer for pollinator protection by Friends of the Earth and expanded biodiversity efforts through native prairie restoration and pollinator-friendly sourcing policies.<br/><br/>Food Access and Community Giving: Donated over 34.6 million pounds of food - nearly 29 million meals - to more than 1,000 food rescue and redistribution programs across North America.<br/><br/>Reducing Emissions in Our Supply Chain: Collaborated with key suppliers, including shrimp and dairy suppliers, to help accelerate their carbon-reduction efforts and mitigate the carbon impact of our supply chain.<br/><br/>Reducing Emissions at our Stores:64 stores with solar installations, 235 stores relying on lower-global warming potential refrigerants, and 389 electric vehicle charging stations across our store to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.<br/><br/>Impact Through Giving: Invested $ 14.2 million through the Whole Foods Market Foundation, supporting 1,239 organizations and schools in 39 countries to advance food access, education, and economic opportunity.<br/><br/>Responsible Sourcing: Supplied more than $ 8.8 million in premiums benefitting workers, their communities, and/or the environment through our Sourced for Good program.<br/><br/>'The 2024 Impact Report is a reminder that the products on our shelves represents a story-of people, places, and choices that shape our food system,' said Caitlin Leibert, Vice President of Sustainability at Whole Foods Market.

The project has been designed as a \"whole-life net-zero\" space, meaning every stage from design to construction aimed to minimise carbon emissions.<br/>The garden's centrepiece is a mushroom-inspired pavilion that draws from underground fungal networks, which help plants capture and store carbon. Its structure uses low-embodied-carbon materials, from recycled gravel foundations to European larch timber and a pioneering flax-and-resin canopy. Even the site's removed concrete was crushed and reused as a planting substrate in the garden's dry zone.<br/>Plants for a hotter, drier future<br/>Richomme explains that the garden's planting choices are rooted in climate resilience research. With London projected to experience hotter, drier summers, Kew's scientists have selected species, many from Mediterranean regions, that can thrive under future climate conditions.<br/>The garden contrasts lush, herbaceous areas with drought-tolerant \"future climate\" plantings. Striking bands of red, blue and orange flowers mirror Reading University's iconic climate stripes, highlighting traits such as silvery leaves or drought-resistant hairs that help species survive in harsher conditions.<br/>Nature's role in climate action<br/>Beyond aesthetics, the Carbon Garden aims to change how people think about climate action in cities. Lara points to research showing urban gardens can reduce local temperatures by up to 5C, making them a powerful cooling tool as cities heat up.<br/>The installation also plays a role in Kew's wider ambition to be climate positive by 2030. It forms part of the organisation's sustainability and landscape succession plans and doubles as a living laboratory, piloting an irrigation system that uses soil moisture probes and weather data to minimise water use.<br/>Education, biodiversity and community<br/>Educational features, such as interactive binocular animations of the carbon cycle, aim to engage younger visitors. The garden also promotes biodiversity with habitats including wildflower meadows, long-grass areas and log piles to support fungi, which are vital for locking carbon in soils.<br/>Visitors are encouraged to \"play their part\" through QR codes linking to plant lists and at-home sustainability ideas, from creating rain gardens to choosing climate-resilient species for their own plots.<br/>As Richomme puts it, the garden aims to offer \"hope\", reminding visitors that carbon, while often portrayed as the villain of climate change, is also the foundation of life on Earth.<br/>Never miss an edie Extra episode<br/>You can follow edie Extra on\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0You'll be the first to access new episodes when they are published.<br/>As well as podcasts live from key events, this channel is our home for 1:1 interviews with sustainability leaders in our Green Room and SustyTalks series.

End users of LCA data, such as brands, may need to work with consultants or other third parties to support with the application of LCA data.</p><p>2 Comparisons between separate LCA studies should not be made and neither should comparisons within a study, unless the study is a comparative LCA.</p><p>3 Textile Exchange discourages the comparison of LCA data between fibre or material categories or geographies. For example, comparisons between natural and synthetic fibres should not be made as the systems are fundamentally different and therefore not comparable. Textile Exchange also discourages shifting sourcing geographies as a method to reduce or avoid impact. Instead, we encourage implementing reduction measures within existing sourcing regions.</p><p>4 The usefulness of LCA data depends heavily on its quality. Robust, high-quality data supports a much broader range of applications. Generally, LCA data quality for the industry must be improved to enable the desired use cases.</p><p>5 Textile Exchange encourages LCA studies to fully document the assumptions, methodological decisions, limitations, and underlying datasets (primary and secondary) applied within an LCA. LCA data can only be improved if there is a good understanding of existing studies and how they have been developed.</p><p>6 Brands may choose to subscribe to an industry database such as the Higg Material Sustainability Index (MSI) or Quantis World Apparel and Footwear Life Cycle Assessment Database (WALDB) which house supporting information from Textile Exchange s Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Library. LCA data from industry databases should not be compared. These are not like-for-like comparisons, as each database will apply differing methodologies and assumptions.</p><p>7 There is a critical need to move beyond current LCA methodology and adopt an  LCA+  approach. This considers context-specific impact areas and includes beneficial outcomes not captured within current LCA methodology, such as biodiversity, soil health, water, animal welfare, and livelihoods.</p><p>8 For Scope 3 footprinting, Textile Exchange encourages the use of supplier-specific data and LCA data from well-documented LCA studies, with careful consideration of data quality in relation to the materiality of a fibre or material within the overall footprint.</p><p>9 To help close remaining impact data gaps, frameworks such as Textile Exchange s Regenerative Agriculture Outcome Framework can be used. This tool can help track progress across a holistic set of impact areas tailored to specific systems and contexts over time. Crucially, it supports measuring beneficial impacts ( doing more good ), not just negative impacts ( doing less bad ).</p><p>The critical role of LCA data in the apparel industry</p><p>LCA is the apparel and textile industry s main way of measuring the environmental impact of the raw materials and fibres they use. LCA data provides a consistent and robust framework for measuring impact when developed in accordance with ISO standards and validated through a third-party review process.</p><p>Reviewed LCA data is used by brands, manufacturers, and policymakersto set targets for environmental impact areas, such as setting science-based targets for climate and nature.</p><p>Textile Exchange says it supports the use of LCA data for the following purposes:</p><p> For GHGs, specifically Scope 3 reporting and target setting    As a source of default inventory data for internal use by an organisation or supply chain-specific assessments    As a source of validation and benchmarking data for internal or supply chain-specific assessments    Scenario analysis and the assessment of potential environmental impact reductions, where feasible, based on available LCA data. </p><p>It uses LCA data to track progress against its industry target of a 45% reduction in GHG emissions related to raw materials and fibres  by 2030, and to model potential interventions for achieving this target.</p><p>However, Textile Exchange suggests the use of LCA data in the industry has recently come under increased focus because of emerging regulatory pressures, ongoing methodology development, and the need to improve transparency for corporate reporting, impact measurement, and target tracking.</p><p>Challenges and limitations of LCAs in the apparel industry</p><p>Textile Exchange believes LCA can provide valuable insights, however itscurrent methodology has numerous limitations that should be carefully considered when interpreting the data.</p><p>The challenges and limitations include:</p><p>LCA studies are static. This means they only measure impacts at a single point in time. This can make it challenging to use them for tracking progress, however this can be done if LCAs are performed at regular intervals.</p><p>LCAs often average impacts across a variety of locations and geographies. These can be at a regional, country, or global level, so they may not represent location-specific differences. In some cases, average country-level impacts are assumed to be representative of global impacts, especially in the absence of more representative LCA data.</p><p>Secondary data may need to be used to proxy some data points when there there are data gaps in the underlying LCA data. But, it is sometimes not clear where secondary data has been applied in LCA studies.</p><p>LCA studies typically only measure a specific set of impact areas, such as greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, water pollution, or waste.</p><p>LCA practitioners need to make several assumptions. These assumptions can range from where and how to fill data gaps, which LCA methodologies to apply, and how to allocate impacts where a system has a number of products</p><p>For natural fibres and synthetic fibres, the system boundaries are different because the types of inputs vary between these production systems. This is one of the key reasons why Textile Exchange discourages the comparison between fibre and material categories.</p><p>There is contention around how products from the same system are &amp;#8216;assigned&amp;#8217; a portion of the impact. But there are guidelines on how to allocate impacts and preferred approaches to take included in the ISO standards.</p><p>Debates on allocating impact shouldn t be a distraction from taking action. For natural and synthetic materials, cross-industry collaborations are required regardless of the  portion  of impact allocated to a particular product (or sector).</p><p>Importance of LCA in apparel industry despite limitations </p><p>Textile Exchange maintains that despite the limitations of an LCA, it is still the most widely used methodology on offer for calculating the impacts of materials and products in the fashion, textile and apparel industry.</p><p>The report states: &amp;#8220;Currently, there is no other way for the industry to measure brand or industry greenhouse gas footprints or to conduct intervention modelling at scale.&amp;#8221;</p><p>However, it adds: &amp;#8220;A robust, transparent, and critically reviewed study provides important framing that must be carefully considered before data is taken and used.&amp;#8221;</p><p>Textile Exchange concludes that improving the LCA data available for the industry to use is an ongoing effort that requires support andcollaboration from the industry.</p><p>It also supports the development and use of other methods of impactmeasurement that take an  LCA+  approach.

These challenges pose barriers to widespread adoption.<br/><br/>In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed US$ 100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Through the Regenerative Catalyst Fund, Mad Agriculture helps farmers move from planning to action, offering small grants, 0% loans, cost-sharing opportunities, and other innovative financing models. In 2024, $ 500,000 was provided to over 30 farmers for regenerative practices such as prairie strips, perennial plantings (including trees, hedgerows, pollinator habitats, and silvopasture), and fencing for holistic grazing. In addition to ecological expertise, Mad Agriculture brings business acumen to support farmers in their full complexity, including enabling irrigation systems, agrotourism, and winning larger grants.<br/><br/>myAgro - Designing mobile tools that connect farmers in West Africa with climate-smart solutions<br/><br/>myAgro is a nonprofit social enterprise that helps smallholder farmers in West Africa move out of poverty. With myAgro's mobile layaway platform, farmers make small payments towards climate-smart packages of seeds, fertilizer, and regenerative agriculture training that increase soil health, yields, and income - boosting climate resilience. In 2023, myAgro reported their farmers grew 179% more food and earned US$ 164 more than control farmers.<br/><br/>Central to myAgro's model are Village Entrepreneurs (VEs) - local sales ambassadors (primarily women) who help farmers enroll for packages and make payments. Initially VEs used paper ledgers to manage sales, but they eventually needed digital tools to serve a growing number of farmers in their communities. With support from the Cisco Foundation, myAgro developed the Connect mobile app, enabling VEs to manage sales, enroll farmers, and collect payments digitally. Since then, myAgro has upgraded the app with support from Cisco to generate customer target lists, facilitate mobile money payments, and make year-round package sales among other key features.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Connect has enabled VEs to link exponentially more farmers with the tools they need to increase their income through regenerative agriculture.

Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Through the Regenerative Catalyst Fund, Mad Agriculture helps farmers move from planning to action, offering small grants, 0% loans, cost-sharing opportunities, and other innovative financing models. In 2024, $ 500,000 was provided to over 30 farmers for regenerative practices such as prairie strips, perennial plantings (including trees, hedgerows, pollinator habitats, and silvopasture), and fencing for holistic grazing. In addition to ecological expertise, Mad Agriculture brings business acumen to support farmers in their full complexity, including enabling irrigation systems, agrotourism, and winning larger grants.<br/><br/>myAgro - Designing mobile tools that connect farmers in West Africa with climate-smart solutions<br/><br/>myAgro is a nonprofit social enterprise that helps smallholder farmers in West Africa move out of poverty. With myAgro's mobile layaway platform, farmers make small payments towards climate-smart packages of seeds, fertilizer, and regenerative agriculture training that increase soil health, yields, and income - boosting climate resilience. In 2023, myAgro reported their farmers grew 179% more food and earned US$ 164 more than control farmers.<br/><br/>Central to myAgro's model are Village Entrepreneurs (VEs) - local sales ambassadors (primarily women) who help farmers enroll for packages and make payments. Initially VEs used paper ledgers to manage sales, but they eventually needed digital tools to serve a growing number of farmers in their communities. With support from the Cisco Foundation, myAgro developed the Connect mobile app, enabling VEs to manage sales, enroll farmers, and collect payments digitally. Since then, myAgro has upgraded the app with support from Cisco to generate customer target lists, facilitate mobile money payments, and make year-round package sales among other key features.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Connect has enabled VEs to link exponentially more farmers with the tools they need to increase their income through regenerative agriculture. In 2024, myAgro is on track to serve more than 280,000 farmers in Mali, Senegal, and C\u00f3te d'Ivoire.<br/><br/>\"I was drawn to myAgro's holistic approach towards farming, which emphasized the importance of sustainable techniques and access to quality inputs. Through myAgro's training programs, I gained valuable insights into soil management, seed selection, and crop rotation, which have been instrumental in optimizing my farm's productivity.\" - Mercedes Coly, myAgro Farmer in Senegal<br/><br/>Miraterra: A completely new way to look at soil<br/><br/>Miraterra is transforming measurement in the food system starting with soil. With 95% of food grown in soil, improving soil health and halting degradation is crucial for our food system. Regenerative agriculture practices build healthier, more resilient soil, yielding nutrient-rich plants and food. However, a comprehensive measurement system has been lacking. Miraterra, supported in part by a direct investment from the Cisco Foundation impact investing portfolio, is filling this gap by developing technology that analyzes unprocessed soil, providing accurate, affordable, and repeatable soil measurement not achieved by conventional methods, enhancing confidence and integrity at scale.<br/><br/>Their technology quantifies the benefits of practices such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and residue detection at the end of the harvest season. These methods improve soil health, increase farm profitability and carbon sequestration, while reducing environmental impact.<br/><br/>Collaborating with agricultural testing laboratories across North America, Miraterra helps growers and agronomists quantify and support healthy land practices. They are also developing AI-powered tools to correlate land practices with food nutrition and enable growers to interact with a living record of their land. By providing accurate, affordable, and rapid soil analysis, Miraterra empowers farmers to make informed decisions about soil management, ultimately contributing to improved soil health and increased carbon sequestration.<br/><br/>Cisco and the Cisco Foundation take a holistic approach to addressing environmental and social issues.

These challenges pose barriers to widespread adoption.<br/><br/>In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed US$ 100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Through the Regenerative Catalyst Fund, Mad Agriculture helps farmers move from planning to action, offering small grants, 0% loans, cost-sharing opportunities, and other innovative financing models. In 2024, $ 500,000 was provided to over 30 farmers for regenerative practices such as prairie strips, perennial plantings (including trees, hedgerows, pollinator habitats, and silvopasture), and fencing for holistic grazing. In addition to ecological expertise, Mad Agriculture brings business acumen to support farmers in their full complexity, including enabling irrigation systems, agrotourism, and winning larger grants.<br/><br/>myAgro - Designing mobile tools that connect farmers in West Africa with climate-smart solutions<br/><br/>myAgro is a nonprofit social enterprise that helps smallholder farmers in West Africa move out of poverty. With myAgro's mobile layaway platform, farmers make small payments towards climate-smart packages of seeds, fertilizer, and regenerative agriculture training that increase soil health, yields, and income - boosting climate resilience. In 2023, myAgro reported their farmers grew 179% more food and earned US$ 164 more than control farmers.<br/><br/>Central to myAgro's model are Village Entrepreneurs (VEs) - local sales ambassadors (primarily women) who help farmers enroll for packages and make payments. Initially VEs used paper ledgers to manage sales, but they eventually needed digital tools to serve a growing number of farmers in their communities. With support from the Cisco Foundation, myAgro developed the Connect mobile app, enabling VEs to manage sales, enroll farmers, and collect payments digitally. Since then, myAgro has upgraded the app with support from Cisco to generate customer target lists, facilitate mobile money payments, and make year-round package sales among other key features.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Connect has enabled VEs to link exponentially more farmers with the tools they need to increase their income through regenerative agriculture. In 2024, myAgro is on track to serve more than 280,000 farmers in Mali, Senegal, and C\u00f3te d'Ivoire.<br/><br/>\"I was drawn to myAgro's holistic approach towards farming, which emphasized the importance of sustainable techniques and access to quality inputs.

With 95% of food grown in soil, improving soil health and halting degradation is crucial for our food system. Regenerative agriculture practices build healthier, more resilient soil, yielding nutrient-rich plants and food. However, a comprehensive measurement system has been lacking. Miraterra, supported in part by a direct investment from the Cisco Foundation impact investing portfolio, is filling this gap by developing technology that analyzes unprocessed soil, providing accurate, affordable, and repeatable soil measurement not achieved by conventional methods, enhancing confidence and integrity at scale.<br/><br/>Their technology quantifies the benefits of practices such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and residue detection at the end of the harvest season. These methods improve soil health, increase farm profitability and carbon sequestration, while reducing environmental impact.<br/><br/>Collaborating with agricultural testing laboratories across North America, Miraterra helps growers and agronomists quantify and support healthy land practices. They are also developing AI-powered tools to correlate land practices with food nutrition and enable growers to interact with a living record of their land. By providing accurate, affordable, and rapid soil analysis, Miraterra empowers farmers to make informed decisions about soil management, ultimately contributing to improved soil health and increased carbon sequestration.<br/><br/>Cisco and the Cisco Foundation take a holistic approach to addressing environmental and social issues.
