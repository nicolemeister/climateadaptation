GIP is a leading vertically integrated infrastructure company established in 2022 by GFL, funds managed by HPS Investment Partners Inc. (\"HPS Investment Partners\" or \"HPS\") and Patrick Dovigi. On the closing of the transaction, GIP will receive aggregate gross proceeds of USD775.0 million, of which it intends to return approximately USD585.0 million to its shareholders and apply USD175.0 million to its balance sheet to fund future growth. </p><p>GFL will receive approximately $200.0 million of the USD585.0 million shareholder distribution. Pro forma for the transaction, GIP's total equity value will be approximately $3.0 billion. After the distribution to GFL of approximately $200.0 million, GFL will own an approximate 30.1% interest in GIP valued at approximately $895.0 million. HPS and Mr. Dovigi will each also continue to hold a minority stake in GIP and support the company's future growth. The transaction is expected to close on or about September 2, 2025. \"The recapitalization of GIP at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion is a testament to the quality of the business its management team has built since we started GIP in April 2022,\" said Patrick Dovigi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of GFL. \"The approximately $200.0 million in proceeds that GFL will receive from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including de-levering our balance sheet, executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategies, including our robust M&amp;A pipeline, and pursuing opportunistic share buybacks, subject to market conditions. This transaction allows GFL to monetize part of our position in GIP in a tax efficient manner, while still retaining a meaningful equity interest that will allow us to participate in what we expect to be continued value creation from the GIP business.\" Mr. Dovigi continued, \"After a robust evaluation showing significant interest in GIP, the board of GIP selected ECP to partner with on this transaction. ECP is a leading investor in critical infrastructure, with deep expertise and a demonstrated track record of value creation for its stakeholders. We look forward to working with ECP on executing GIP's growth strategy.\" Mr. Dovigi concluded, \"Over the years, I have re-iterated my belief that we could create $1.0 billion of value for GFL shareholders through our investment in GIP. Our original investment of approximately $250.0 million in 2022 has grown to approximately $1.1 billion in just over three years. That is a direct reflection of the strength of GFL's management team and the execution of our strategies to create long term shareholder value. We believe that this recapitalization positions GIP to significantly exceed our original value expectations in the near term and sets the company up for an exciting period of growth.\" Scot French, Founding Partner and Co-President of HPS, said, \"We congratulate management on this significant milestone and thank our longstanding partners at GFL for their vision and steadfast execution in building Canada's premier infrastructure service provider. We are proud to invest in companies like GIP and GFL that play an important role in maintaining and improving the critical infrastructure and essential services that people rely on every day.

However, green infrastructure typically results in long-term cost savings by reducing flooding, enhancing water quality, and providing additional environmental benefits.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Maintenance concerns:</emphasis> Another misconception is that green infrastructure requires too much maintenance. While trees and other green systems need care, they often require less long-term management than traditional stormwater infrastructure, which may require regular clearing, repairs and replacements over time. There's also the belief that green infrastructure is not as reliable or durable as concrete solutions, which can result in reluctance from developers and councils. However, we know that green infrastructure is both reliable and durable, often having a natural resilience against weather events like heavy rainfall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Lack of awareness or expertise:</emphasis> Green infrastructure, including urban forestry, is still a relatively new field for many councils and developers. There can be a knowledge gap regarding how to design and manage these systems effectively. As a result, projects may be mismanaged or underutilised, particularly in areas without dedicated arboricultural or ecological expertise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Green Infrastructure in action </emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thomsonec.com/services/arboriculture-services/\">Aboriculture</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thomsonec.com/services/arboriculture-services/\"> management</url> and green infrastructure implementation across various parts of the UK have proved how vital it is to flood mitigation.

These systems slow surface water flow and improve water infiltration, reducing the risk of flooding in urban areas. The project has effectively alleviated the risk of surface water flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The forecast for 2025 and how to respond </emphasis></p><p>Already this year, we have seen extreme weather events, starting with a cold snap of snow and ice across the UK, which subsequently thawed out and was followed by heavy rain and storms, leading to flooding across large parts of the UK (particularly in regions like Lincolnshire and Leicestershire). Now more than ever, green infrastructure needs to be taken into account when planning for flood mitigation.</p><p>Key to tackling flooding linked to climate change include <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thomsonec.com/services/freshwater-ecology/catchment-management/\">catchment-based approaches</url>, nature-based solutions and natural flood management, which are effective methods for slowing run-off into rivers following intense rainfall and avoiding pollution caused by soil erosion.

Local authorities must not only maintain existing defences but also upgrade them to withstand rising sea levels and increased rainfall associated with climate change.</p><p>Robust land-use planning is essential to regulate development in flood-prone areas, curbing construction and encouraging sustainable land-use practices. Comprehensive floodplain management reinforces these measures by maintaining natural flood defences like wetlands and restricting unsuitable development in floodplain areas. Zoning regulations can effectively manage risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Community engagement</emphasis></p><p>Engaging the community plays a pivotal role in effective flood mitigation. Authorities should raise awareness about flood risks, educate residents on preparedness, and foster a sense of shared responsibility. A well-informed public is more likely to take proactive measures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emergency response planning</emphasis></p><p>Local authorities should establish early warning systems, alerting residents in flood-prone areas and providing them with timely information. A variety of communication methods, from flood alerts to sirens, ensure that the public can access vital information in emergencies.</p><p>Equally significant, local authorities should engage with emergency services to develop and regularly update plans for flood events. This involves coordinating evacuation plans and resources to manage disaster response efficiently. Collaboration with neighbouring authorities, government agencies, and environmental consultancies and agencies is essential, as it facilitates the pooling of resources and ensures a comprehensive approach to flood prevention and management.</p><p>As we face increasingly unpredictable weather patterns and the growing threat of climate-related disasters, the importance of green infrastructure in flood mitigation cannot be overstated.

The project has effectively alleviated the risk of surface water flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall events.", "The project has effectively alleviated the risk of surface water flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall events. The forecast for 2025 and how to respond Already this year, we have seen extreme weather events, starting with a cold snap of snow and ice across the UK, which subsequently thawed out and was followed by heavy rain and storms, leading to flooding across large parts of the UK (particularly in regions like Lincolnshire and Leicestershire). Key to tackling flooding linked to climate change include catchment-based approaches, nature-based solutions and natural flood management, which are effective methods for slowing run-off into rivers following intense rainfall and avoiding pollution caused by soil erosion. Examples include wetland habitat creation, tree planting and low-intensity agriculture practices.", "This involves coordinating evacuation plans and resources to manage disaster response efficiently. Collaboration with neighbouring authorities, government agencies, and environmental consultancies and agencies is essential, as it facilitates the pooling of resources and ensures a comprehensive approach to flood prevention and management. It is clear that the future of flood management lies in innovative, sustainable solutions, and green infrastructure offers a path forward. \u2022Emily Trill is principal hydrologist at Thomson Environmental Consultants", "Collaboration with neighbouring authorities, government agencies, and environmental consultancies and agencies is essential, as it facilitates the pooling of resources and ensures a comprehensive approach to flood prevention and management.

The project is initiated by Ropeways Transit Rwanda Ltd (RTRL).</p><p><br/><br/>The funds, to be sourced from the Bank Group's Urban and Municipal Development Fund, are expected to help pave the way for the Kigali Urban Cable Car Project, a 5.5 km mobility initiative valued at $ 100 million and promising to ease the city's traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and connect underserved communities to jobs and essential services.<br/><br/>The Urban and Municipal Development Fund (UMDF) is a trust fund hosted by the African Development Bank, which provides direct support to cities, to mobilize funding and technical assistance, develop partnerships, city engagement, project identification and investment.<br/><br/>Phase 1 of the project will comprise two critical transit corridors: Nyabugogo Taxi Park to the Central Business District (CBD) Hub; and the Kigali Convention Center to Kigali Sports City, connecting public landmarks such as Amahoro Stadium, BK Arena, and the newly developed Zaria Court.<br/><br/>The feasibility study is expected to position the project to attract international investment, including through platforms such as the Africa Investment Forum (AIF). The UMDF provided funding for the feasibility of another project in the country, the Kigali Urban Transport Improvement project, to help attract critical investment.<br/><br/>Construction is expected to begin in late 2026, with commissioning scheduled for 2028. Once complete, the cable car will convey over 50,000 passengers a day on a 15-minute end-to-end journey, integrating into the city's existing transport infrastructure.<br/><br/>African Development Bank Group president Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said: 'This transformative project aligns perfectly with the Bank's vision for sustainable, green climate-resilient urban mobility infrastructure, and with the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy, which focuses on urbanization, and the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA), a global partnership initiative driven by the African Development Bank Group, Africa50 and the African Union.

The project is initiated by Ropeways Transit Rwanda Ltd (RTRL).</p><p><br/><br/>The funds, to be sourced from the Bank Group's Urban and Municipal Development Fund, are expected to help pave the way for the Kigali Urban Cable Car Project, a 5.5 km mobility initiative valued at $ 100 million and promising to ease the city's traffic congestion, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and connect underserved communities to jobs and essential services.<br/><br/>The Urban and Municipal Development Fund (UMDF) is a trust fund hosted by the African Development Bank, which provides direct support to cities, to mobilize funding and technical assistance, develop partnerships, city engagement, project identification and investment.<br/><br/>Phase 1 of the project will comprise two critical transit corridors: Nyabugogo Taxi Park to the Central Business District (CBD) Hub; and the Kigali Convention Center to Kigali Sports City, connecting public landmarks such as Amahoro Stadium, BK Arena, and the newly developed Zaria Court.<br/><br/>The feasibility study is expected to position the project to attract international investment, including through platforms such as the Africa Investment Forum (AIF). The UMDF provided funding for the feasibility of another project in the country, the Kigali Urban Transport Improvement project, to help attract critical investment.<br/><br/>Construction is expected to begin in late 2026, with commissioning scheduled for 2028. Once complete, the cable car will convey over 50,000 passengers a day on a 15-minute end-to-end journey, integrating into the city's existing transport infrastructure.<br/><br/>African Development Bank Group president Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said: 'This transformative project aligns perfectly with the Bank's vision for sustainable, green climate-resilient urban mobility infrastructure, and with the Bank's Ten-Year Strategy, which focuses on urbanization, and the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa (AGIA), a global partnership initiative driven by the African Development Bank Group, Africa50 and the African Union. By financing Rwanda's urban cable car system, we are investing in a scalable model of low-carbon, inclusive public transport that cities across Africa can emulate.'<br/><br/>The project is anchored in Rwanda's Green Taxonomy, E-mobility Strategy, and Climate and Nature Finance Strategy (CNFS) and aligns closely with Rwanda's national climate objectives, which target a 38% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.<br/><br/>The project implementation is expected to follow a Public-Private Partnership model, according to Imena Munyampenda, the Director General of Rwanda Transport Development Agency.<br/><br/>The feasibility study plans to draw lessons from successful cable car systems in La Paz, Bolivia, and Singapore. The system will prioritize access for the disabled, employment opportunities for girls, women and low-income residents; and job creation, capacity building and technology transfer.<br/><br/>'This pioneering feasibility study is a game-changing milestone,' said Solomon Quaynor, African Development Bank's Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure, and Industrialization.

Urbanisation continues unabated, with over four billion people now living in cities, and the built environment increasingly replacing permeable surfaces. Combined with more intense and frequent weather events driven by climate change, this creates a recipe for disaster in terms of flash flooding in places that have never seen it before.</p><p>Our infrastructure, much of it designed in the Victorian era, simply wasn't built to handle this level of demand. Today, we routinely design to 1-in-100-year storm events with 40% climate change allowances, but even that may no longer be enough. As I highlighted in my talk, the Spanish coastal city of Valencia recently received a year's worth of rain in just eight hours.</p><p>Nobody is designing for that. So what's the answer? Traditional grey infrastructure - pipes, tanks, channels - still has an essential role to play. It's reliable, engineered for efficiency, and especially effective in high-flow scenarios. But it's also expensive to build and maintain and offers limited adaptability or environmental benefit.</p><p>On the other side, green infrastructure - rain gardens, green roofs, wetlands - brings enormous value. It reduces runoff, supports biodiversity, improves water quality through infiltration, and even helps cool urban microclimates. It makes cities better places to live. But it too has challenges. It needs time and space to establish, and it often can't operate in isolation. That's why I'm advocating for a \"grey enabling green\" philosophy, where smart, engineered systems underpin and support nature-based solutions.</p><p>We've seen this approach work powerfully in practice. In Copenhagen, the city's response to frequent and devastating cloudbursts has become a global model. They've combined expanded sewer networks and stormwater storage roads (grey) with green roofs, permeable pavements, and pocket parks (green), all fully integrated into a city-wide system that prioritises both resilience and quality of life.</p><p>Amsterdam offers another inspiring example. There, Wavin has supported a multi-rooftop smart water management project across 21 buildings; what we call blue-green roofs. These systems temporarily store rainwater and slowly release it through evapotranspiration. On each balcony, smart soil moisture sensors monitor conditions and trigger irrigation only when necessary, using captured rainwater. The result? A self-sustaining green network that not only prevents local flooding but also generates high-resolution climate data to inform future planning.</p><p>Closer to home, we recently worked with a London borough to integrate rain gardens and smart irrigation into a streetscape regeneration project. By removing underused car parking spaces, the council created room for over 380 metres of green infrastructure. But while the rain gardens could handle typical rainfall, the area still needed help with extreme events. Our solution was to link the gardens to a below-ground attenuation system - grey supporting green. A smart pump recirculates stored rainwater to irrigate the plants, cutting costs and reducing reliance on water deliveries.</p><p>These projects show that we don't have to choose. When we combine the certainty and capacity of grey with the adaptability and environmental value of green, we build cities that are not only more flood-resilient, but also more liveable, more sustainable, and more responsive to future challenges.</p><p>But we can't do this alone. Designing smarter, greener cities demands collaboration - between engineers, planners, developers, local authorities, and communities. It also demands policy support, funding, and public education. We need to shift the narrative from \"grey or green\" to \"smart and hybrid\" - because the climate isn't waiting, and neither should we.</p><p>As we continue to evolve urban drainage for a changing world, I remain optimistic. We've come a long way from the early SuDS debates that divided hard and soft, grey and green. Now, the most exciting work is happening in the spaces in between - where engineering and ecology meet, where data drives decisions, and where infrastructure supports life, not just logistics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00b7 Martin Lambley is senior product manager - climate resilience at Wavin</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcivilengineer.com/opinion/grey-enabling-green-for-urban-flood-resilience-29-05-2025/\">How 'grey enabling green' approach supports urban flood resilience</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcivilengineer.com\">New Civil Engineer</url>.</p>", "publisher": "New Civil Engineer", "instances": ["We all know the problems.
