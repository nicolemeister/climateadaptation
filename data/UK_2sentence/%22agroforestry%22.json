It-s an increasingly important land management practice that should be part of every regenerative farmer-s toolbox, with enormous benefits for business, nature and climate.</p><p>1. Boost your farm-s resilience in the face of extreme weather</p><p>You-ll know from first-hand experience that farmers are feeling the effects of climate change.-In the last six years alone, we-ve had four of the UK-s five hottest days since records began in 1911. Temperatures exceeded 40oC in July 2022.-From October 2022, England had the wettest 18-month period ever recorded, with the Environment Agency logging 1,695.9mm of rainfall.</p><p>Agroforestry brings resilience and diversity into farming systems, enabling them to adapt to extreme heat, drought or wet.-Well-designed and managed agroforestry systems will maintain normal microclimatic ranges for your crops and livestock. They will provide vital shade and shelter and actively restore the essential components of a healthy ecosystem: soil health, water quality and biodiversity.</p><p>At the show, join discussions on how agroforestry can help add resilience to your business at a landscape scale, including with Claire Whittle, farm vet and farmer. She-ll take a fascinating look at how your farm might look and function in 2050 based on meteorological predictions both with and without trees.</p><p>Andy Dibben, head grower at Abbey Home Farm, Cirencester will also be speaking at the show about his own experiences. He states: -We-ve integrated trees into all of our cropping areas, at glasshouse, market garden and field scale. We see them as a powerful tool for improving existing horticultural production, as well as an effective technique for building in resilience to climate change.-</p><p>2. Tackle uncertainty around grants and trade</p><p>Numerous external factors both within the UK and from a global perspective are creating great uncertainty for farming. Agroforestry isn-t a magic bullet, but it can spread the risk and help farming businesses to diversify, offering an opportunity to develop new enterprises and enter new markets like fruit, nuts and timber. Alternative funding sources are also available in the emerging natural capital markets for establishing new trees and woods and restoring existing ones, such as Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) and carbon.</p><p>At the show, you can explore the potential for your business with sessions on markets for tree-based products, innovative sources of finance and the carbon impact of agroforestry.</p><p>You can also hear Stephen Briggs, perhaps the UK-s highest profile agroforester, in conversation with farmer and commentator Will Evans. They-ll discuss the success of Stephen-s 24m wide apple and cereal-based alley cropping system, established in 2009 on peat and clay soils, with results including:</p><p>Decreased soil erosion Enhanced productivity with an average Land Equivalent Ratio of 1.25 Reduced risk through growing annual and perennial crops alongside each other Circa 4t C sequestered per hectare Improved biodiversity</p><p>3. See first-hand a farm transitioning to a regenerative system</p><p>Woodoaks Farm is the perfect venue for the event, showcasing the early stages of a farm transitioning from a conventional arable farm into a mixed regenerative farming system. It demonstrates how trees and woods are helping this process, including the first foray into agroforestry and how to bring existing farm woodland into management. The long-term farm tenant is on this journey with the farm and several new business units are being established too, including a flower grower, brewer, and market gardener.</p><p>Don-t miss the farm walks to see the newly planted shelterbelt, initial woodland restoration and agroforestry alley planting in practice. The tours will share the farm-s plans to create a Biodiversity Net Gain habitat bank and visit the newly established businesses on site.</p><p>4. Gain the advice and confidence to take the next step</p><p>Whatever your experience and knowledge so far, the show offers everything you need to move forward on your agroforestry journey.</p><p>Many of us learn best from our peers and we-ll have plenty of inspiring speakers and in-depth discussions sharing real experiences of what has worked well and what hasn-t. See live demonstrations of tree management and establishment, check out the latest in tree protection options and speak to a range of tree nurseries. Get involved in hands-on workshops and small expert-led sessions at the Training Hub. Try out online planning tools and take advantage of a free 45-minute design clinic with an expert adviser to discuss plans for your farm - just bring a map of your site.</p><p>5. A great day out!</p><p>The show will be full of unmissable networking opportunities and chance to get away from the farm and relax while learning. Take a visit to the speaker-s corner or take a break with local food and an agroforestry beer brewed on site. Enjoy musical entertainment in the evening and camping and facilities are available too.

It's about designing systems where both thrive.\"<br/><br/>Glensaugh Research Farm has several areas of mature agroforestry which were planted in 1988 to explore the production benefits of integrating trees within a livestock farming system. These were planted as part of a National Network of seven UK research sites, co-ordinated by the Farm Woodland Forum (then the UK Agroforestry Forum). Three species were selected (Scots Pine, Hybrid Larch and Sycamore) and planted at a range of different densities, which allowed comparison of these differences on a range of factors including tree growth, grass production and livestock output. Findings from this have contributed significantly to advancing agroforestry research and knowledge.<br/><br/>The project continues to provide a living demonstration of the longer-term practicalities of agroforestry management as well as wider environmental benefits for climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity.

The pigs grew fat on the acorns, and the trees and surroundings were fertilised, leading to better crops.</p><p>-That was a form of agroforestry often used in medieval times,- Ian explains, -where you-re bringing trees and animals together to create a richer environment - but in the 20th century, in particular, we adopted this monoculture where hundreds of miles of hedges and trees were removed, and it became all about big fields.</p><p>-The UK has low tree cover compared to other countries in Europe.</p><p>-We had about 5-6 per cent after the First World War when the Forestry Commission was set up, and the ambition currently for the Government over the next five years is to get it up to about 16 per cent - Germany is already at 17.75 per cent - but agroforestry can help increase tree cover while boosting food production.</p><p>-With agroforestry, you-re putting more trees into fields, but you-re producing more food as a result, and that's the magic - some farmers will say: -Well, how does that work? How can you put lines of trees across the field and get more food?- But you can if you do it right; you absolutely can.</p><p>-What happens is you enrich the biodiversity in the landscape, which in turn has benefits - trees and farming go hand in hand.</p><p>-It-s all about the environment working together in synergy for the best natural results, about creating a more resilient, balanced and productive landscape. Trees offer numerous benefits, from carbon sequestration to habitat provision.</p><p>-They produce oxygen, prevent flooding, absorb pollution, and provide habitat, with all its benefits, instead of a monoculture. You-re introducing something that's perennial and has a positive interaction in terms of your business.</p><p>-We-re not talking about building forests but inserting trees, small amounts of trees, that decrease at regular intervals, all around that landscape so you see big fields broken up.</p><p>-It has been a really rewarding couple of years with the Churchill Fellowship,- said Ian, who now lives in Embleton and runs an environmentally friendly business. -It has involved travel and research and projects focused on promoting agroforestry and supporting practical implementation.</p><p>-Five years ago, hardly anyone talked about agroforestry, but now it is much more well known, there-s more scientific evidence about its benefits and the Government is now involved - larger projects are happening now, funded by the central Government.</p><p>-With increased funding and research, it can become a more common practice, leading to more diverse and sustainable landscapes.</p><p>-I'm excited to see the growth of agroforestry and its positive impact on our environment and food systems in the years ahead.-</p>", "publisher": "Hexham Courant", "instances": ["Ian Brown has spent years hoping to persuade UK farmers to incorporate science into their practice, which involves integrating trees into the farming system to increase biodiversity and agricultural output.

These forest management and restoration efforts can improve local food production, biodiversity conservation and cultural connection in places from land to sea.</p><p><br/><br/>For generations, Kanaka ?Oiwi, like other Pacific islands cultures, managed from land to sea (mauka i makai) through a system of land divisions (moku) that ensured food security and ecological balance. However, colonization, land privatization and industrial agriculture disrupted these systems. Over the past few decades, large-scale declines in plantation agriculture has now left 40% of Hawai?i's agricultural lands fallow and unmanaged, which can pose risks from elevated erosion, invasive species and wildfire.<br/><br/>The research found that combining native forest protection (100,000 acres) with transitioning suitable fallow agricultural land to agroforestry (400,000 acres) could increase sediment retention by 30%, thereby reducing erosion and boosting nearshore food production by almost 100,000 meals per year in some moku. Benefits of this magnitude were shown for west Kaua?i, the south shore of Moloka?i, west Maui and east Hawai?i Island, where communities are tightly connected to and reliant on fishing for livelihoods, subsistence and social networks.<br/><br/>While forest conservation and marine resources management receive significant attention in Hawai?i, lower and middle-elevation lands (wao kanaka)-traditionally used for agriculture and food production-remain underutilized in natural resource management efforts. In pockets across Hawai?i, ?Oiwi and kama?aina farmers are restoring fallow agriculture lands through Indigenous-informed agroforestry, integrating woody plants and crops to revitalize agriculture, enhance biodiversity and preserve cultural traditions.<br/><br/>'Our findings highlight the importance of forest stewardship from ridge to reef, including biocultural restoration of agroforestry systems in low to mid-elevation fallow agricultural lands which can enhance biodiversity, grow diverse and nutritious foods, on land and from the ocean, strengthen cultural ties, and create green jobs,' said Jade Delevaux, lead author and former post-doctoral researcher in UH Manoa's Water Resources Research Center.<br/><br/>While nearshore fisheries are essential for subsistence worldwide, their value is often underestimated due to limited assessment methods. This research developed a method to map changes in seafood production due to reduced sediment runoff, using fishing pressure, fish surveys and habitat structure maps publicly available.<br/><br/>'Our straightforward approach to connect land stewardship and seafood availability can be applied even in data limited places,' said Kostantinos Stamoulis, study co-author and director of Seascape Solutions.

The agroforests in the study are stewarded by placed-based and multi-generational informed knowledge systems that are uniquely attuned to local social and ecological conditions, and have enabled resilience to varying levels and types of disasters and disturbances for millenia. Researchers said these knowledge systems and management practices are critical to support a transition towards food production systems that are not only more environmentally sound, but also nutritionally diverse and resilient to climate disruptions.<br/><br/>'Our findings support stronger investment in Indigenous and agroecological food production systems, both in the Pacific and globally,' McGuigan said. 'We recommend working with practitioners to identify and record additional functions and traits, and use trait-based tools to help design food production systems that support ecological resilience and human nutrition. We urge policymakers to prioritize systems that reflect the interconnected nature of environmental and human health.'<br/><br/>The work was supported by the National Science Foundation, Fulbright Program and UH Manoa, among others.

The agroforests in the study are stewarded by placed-based and multi-generational informed knowledge systems that are uniquely attuned to local social and ecological conditions, and have enabled resilience to varying levels and types of disasters and disturbances for millenia. Researchers said these knowledge systems and management practices are critical to support a transition towards food production systems that are not only more environmentally sound, but also nutritionally diverse and resilient to climate disruptions.<br/><br/>'Our findings support stronger investment in Indigenous and agroecological food production systems, both in the Pacific and globally,' McGuigan said. 'We recommend working with practitioners to identify and record additional functions and traits, and use trait-based tools to help design food production systems that support ecological resilience and human nutrition. We urge policymakers to prioritize systems that reflect the interconnected nature of environmental and human health.'<br/><br/>The work was supported by the National Science Foundation, Fulbright Program and UH Manoa, among others. The other authors on the study include: Tamara Ticktin (UH Manoa School of Life Sciences), Rachel Novotny (UH Manoa CTAHR), Veniana Tikonavuli and Unaisi Vuli (The University of the South Pacific), and Abrania Marrero (Harvard University).<br/><br/>'Food production is a cornerstone of Fiji's economy and community well-being,' Vuli said. 'It provides essential food security and supports around 80% of rural livelihoods.

The 3-day event brought together more than 90 participants from 17 EU Member States, the UK and Serbia, representing 38 LIFE projects and other relevant Horizon and Interreg projects, as well as forest experts, researchers, NGOs and forest authorities.<br/><br/>The meeting provided a valuable opportunity to exchange knowledge and insights in support of the EU Nature Restoration Regulation and 2030 Forest Strategy.<br/><br/>. Keynote sessions with interactive panel discussions on the first day and 4 parallel working groups on the second day reflected the most urgent challenges and opportunities for Europe's forests. The final day was dedicated to excursions to the LIFE Carpathia and LIFE Rosalia project sites, where discussions about the topics covered in the platform continued directly in the field.<br/><br/>As CINEA project adviser Simona Bacchereti commented, 'The variety of approaches presented - from the restoration of forest beetle habitats to bioeconomy or climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies - illustrates how LIFE contributes to integrated forest management solutions.'<br/><br/>LIFE Forest Platform<br/><br/>European Union<br/><br/>Plenary sessions and thematic presentations - including insightful contributions from DG ENV and CINEA - set the current policy, technical and socio-economic background and provided space for some lively exchanges during the extensive panels.<br/><br/>Working Group 1 explored the restoration of degraded habitats and old-growth forests using native species, closer-to-nature forest (CNF) management and natural regeneration. Romania's LIFE Rosalia, for example, aims to conserve and restore forests for rare beetles; LIFE GOPROFOR-MED applies flexible CNF management models across four Mediterranean countries; LIFE for Eagles' Habitats encourages diverse, structure-rich forest habitats for raptors through public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Bulgaria; while LIFE in the Ravines combats ash dieback in the UK. Other LIFE projects sharing their work on floodplain forests included LIFE ALNUS TAEJO<br/><br/>in Spain and Portugal as well as LIFE WILDisland and LIFE-RESTORE-for-MDD, focusing on alluvial forest habitats along the Danube and its tributaries.<br/><br/>Working Group 2 tackled forests and climate change, looking at how adaptive forest management can reduce climate vulnerability while boosting carbon sequestration. Among those featured were Spanish project LIFE RedBosques_Clima<br/><br/>and Estonian LIFE ADAPTEst<br/><br/>which focus on nature-based adaptation - and LIFE STEMMA ATHOS from Greece, which develops strategic and integrated forest management through the perspective of climate change adaptation and mitigation.<br/><br/>Working Group 3 focused on how silvo-pastoral systems and agroforestry can jointly benefit biodiversity and rural livelihoods. Spain's LIFE AgroForAdapt<br/><br/>, for example, pilots different agroforestry systems to support climate change adaptation in Mediterranean farm and forest landscapes, while LIFE Natura 2000 Revisited in Czechia includes silvopasture trials among other innovations aimed at improving habitat and species status.<br/><br/>Working Group 4 - financing forest restoration - examined the role of economic tools and market-based instruments in forest management. LIFE Token CO2 presented its advanced CO2 life-cycle model and digital emissions trading system for efficient, sustainable forest management. Latvian project LIFE-IP LatViaNature<br/><br/>successfully encourages private landowners to conserve forest biodiversity, while the Romanian experience from the Forest Stewardship Council's FSC<br/><br/>illustrates how Payments for Forest Ecosystem Services (PFES) can drive restoration efforts.<br/><br/>In addition to those mentioned, many other LIFE projects made valuable contributions to the four working groups.

Samples are collected, experiments run, data analysed, as if these inanimate things had acted by themselves with no involvement of any human scientist. This leads to a distorted view of science as a wholly dispassionate endeavour, but nothing could be further from the truth. The personalities and passions of scientists are as important in shaping research as the results of the experiments that they perform.</p><p>Evidence of the human factor in scientific discovery runs through the stories of how fundamental discoveries were made. August Kekul\u00e9 day-dreaming of serpents eating their own tails and waking up to the discover the structure of benzene; Richard Feynman seeing spinning plates that put him on the path to the fundamentals of quantum mechanical spin; Isaac Newton watching an apple fall under the influence of gravity; Charles Darwin cruising in The Beagle around South America and the Galapagos; Albert Einstein musing on what would be happening if the Bernese tram he was riding in was moving near the speed of light.

It allows us to celebrate the people behind the science, providing a place for researchers to tell the stories that have made their work possible.

I had to whittle this down to the 1,200 words Q&amp;A, so not all of our discussion has made it into the final piece. Aster, for example, described the difficulties ecologists face in generating data in tropical regions. From challenging environmental conditions to monkeys ripping out field sensors, this was a humbling reminder for an editor who sits behind their desk all day that every piece of data is hard-won. What does remain in the Q&amp;A is a moving testimony from a researcher who believes deeply that her science has the power to save lives.

Indeed, in this issue, Ruochen Cao et al. describe how they used remote satellite measurement of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence to discover that forests with a richer mix of species tend to be more photosynthetically active. We believe that the same is true of science, so we intend to speak to researchers from varied disciplines, backgrounds and experiences for our Q&amp;As. In this way we hope to reflect the full breadth of individuals in our community.</p><p>Our next interviewee will be Helen Brabham, a team leader at 2Blades, who sat down with Catherine recently to talk about her work on NLRseek \u2014 a project focused on identifying and deploying nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes. Brabham has a particularly valuable viewpoint, sitting comfortably in both the worlds of academia and industry. Her Q&amp;A discusses how researchers can ensure that their discovery science translates into real-world impacts.</p><p>Q&amp;A\u2019s will provide a place to highlight a diversity of perspectives, and to bring you fascinating and inspiring stories that might otherwise be left out of the necessarily impersonal prose of a research article.

The sector faces mounting pressure: water scarcity, rising debt, and up to 15% post-harvest losses (NABARD study). In the last three years, 70% of smallholders have lost half or more of a crop, with 71% reporting severe climate impacts and incomes down 15.7% since 2022 (2024 Farmer Voice survey). Ultimately, by 2030, India is projected to see a substantial 5.8% decline in working hours - equivalent to 34 million full-time jobs - due to heat stress (WEF).</p><p><br/><br/>Yet, the promise of AI-driven innovation is real: investing in 15 foundational agricultural datasets could unlock $ 65 billion in value for Indian farmers (WEF), making food systems more resilient and profitable. According to the India Digital Agriculture Council, only 30% of Indian farmers were using digital tools-representing a vast, untapped opportunity for climate-smart transformation.<br/><br/>The Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund and Climate Grants Portfolio support tech ventures and nonprofits that combine technology and farmers' engagement for a more regenerative future. This means scaling reforestation, soil health, carbon markets, and nature-based solutions across India. Here are a few examples.<br/><br/>Mitti Labs: Transforming Rice for Climate and Livelihoods<br/><br/>Rice farming consumes 30% of the world's freshwater (WFP) and produces 12% of global methane emissions (WWF)-making it central to India's food and climate goals. Mitti Labs is pioneering a tech-driven approach to decarbonize rice production and reward regenerative practices.<br/><br/>Supported by the Regenerative Future Fund, an impact-first venture fund, Mitti Labs' AI-powered digital Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) platform combines satellite and sensor data with field support to help farmers adopt Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD reduces methane and water use by up to 40% while maintaining or increasing yields. According to Mitti Labs, here are a few ways they are gaining traction:<br/><br/>* Field results are compelling: In Telangana's Warangal, AWD cut water use by 37% while maintaining yields. In Haryana's Safidon, AWD reduced water by 19% with no yield loss. These results mean lower methane emissions, improved water conservation, and new income streams for thousands of climate-vulnerable farmers.<br/><br/>* Marketplace leadership: Partnering with Carbon Place, Good Carbon, Ceezer, and Cloverly, Mitti Labs enables secure purchases of methane-based carbon credits for buyers globally that would like to support avoidance efforts. Its entire 2025 offset supply is fully allocated, with more set for 2026 and 2027.<br/><br/>* Global recognition: Sylvera, a carbon ratings agency, called Mitti Labs a \"key enabler\" of methane reduction in rice (Sylvera, 2024).<br/><br/>As Madhuri, a Mitti Labs Field Manager in Warangal, shares, \"It is encouraging to see more and more farmers understanding our AWD programs and coming forward to join our movement.\" Community leaders echo the impact: \"One in every four farmers in Warangal is now participating.\"<br/><br/>Since 2023, Mitti Labs has onboarded 30,000 farmers, expanded digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (dMRV) capabilities to 10 million hectares, and launched projects with partners like Syngenta Foundation and The Nature Conservancy. Their pipeline spans India and Southeast Asia, targeting 200,000+ farmers and over one million carbon avoidance credits per year. With tech and new markets, Mitti Labs is shaping the future of rice decarbonization.<br/><br/>Digital Green: AI for Climate-Resilient, Regenerative Farming<br/><br/>Digital Green is transforming agricultural advisory services for smallholder farmers through its AI-powered assistant, Farmer.Chat. This innovative platform addresses the need for timely, localized, and actionable farm and market recommendations - especially for resource-poor, low-literacy, and low-connectivity populations. Farmers and extension workers can resolve queries using voice, text, images, or video in regional languages. The platform provides crucial information such as weather forecasts, crop and pest disease warnings, and reminders for regenerative practices.<br/><br/>Supported by the Cisco Foundation's Climate Grant Portfolio in 2024, Farmer.Chat has reached over 460,000 smallholder farmers since its launch in 2022. Evidence shows it drives behavior changes, particularly in adopting regenerative practices like improved crop nutrition, disease management, soil health, and organic fertilization.<br/><br/>With women making up over 42% of India's agricultural labor force - and facing barriers like lower mobile phone ownership - Digital Green's design enables climate-smart advice to reach those who need it.<br/><br/>As CEO Rikin Gandhi shares, \"Thanks to partners like Cisco Foundation, we're helping build a more resilient, equitable food system-one voice, one decision, one farmer at a time.\"<br/><br/>Farmers for Forests: AI-Powered Monitoring for Reforestation<br/><br/>Farmers for Forests (F4F) is using AI to revolutionize monitoring in agroforestry practices, particularly in regions facing significant tree cover and biodiversity loss - India alone has lost 5 million trees in two decades. With support from the Cisco Foundation's Climate Grants Portfolio, F4F is developing an open-source AI platform using drone and satellite data for scalable, accurate monitoring.<br/><br/>The platform detects even small trees under four feet - often missed by traditional satellite models - and monitors carbon sequestration and irrigation infrastructure. It integrates computer vision models like Meta's Detectron-2 and DeepForest, plus AI trained on tree datasets for species classification and biomass estimation.

How should I approach it?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Starting a diversification project is not something to be rushed and key to a successful project is careful research and robust financial planning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A great starting point can be to carry out a SWOT analysis of your farming business, so you can make an informed decision about the best opportunities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As part of this process, think about the location of your farm and how accessible it is, what assets you have - and their quality - as well as how much time you have available, your skills and what sort of diversifications appeal to you.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, if you are happy to be hands-on and are located close to an urban area, you may consider options such as a farm shop or wedding venue. If you are after something less time-consuming then you might want to think about letting out farm buildings for commercial use such as storage.</p><p>To identify the right enterprise, do your research about where there may be gaps in the market. This should also involve checking out what neighbouring farms are already doing, so you are not in direct competition with them. Consider how your project might integrate with existing farm activities. Also, speak to other farmers who have diversified and find out about their experiences to work out what might be right for you.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Once you have an idea you are confident in, then you can start preparing a detailed business plan which includes estimates of the costs of implementation, alongside projections for future profitability and a cash flow. This will be essential if you need to go to the bank for finance.</p><p>At this early stage you will also need to consider whether you will require planning permission. We would also suggest you speak to your accountant who will be able to advise on the implications of your project from a tax and accounting perspective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Q: Why should I diversify, is it not better to focus on maximising profitability of my main farm income? </emphasis></p><p>Having a strong core business is important and we would always suggest you ensure your farming business is in the best possible shape before embarking on a new project.</p><p>However, farm incomes continue to be very volatile because of the impact of the weather, high input costs and global factors. Plus, with Basic Payments in England now being phased out, margins are likely to continue to get tighter. Diversification can be a sensible way to reduce your exposure to risk, providing an alternative revenue stream in years when farm incomes come under pressure.</p><p>Remember, it can be as simple or complicated as you want to make it. Some may regard signing up to a scheme like the Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) as a form of diversification, in that it helps to derisk some farming income. Other farmers may want to do something much more ambitious, such as adding value to something grown on the farm and then selling it direct to consumers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Q: Is there Government funding available for diversification projects? </emphasis></p><p>Grant funding for diversification projects is now much thinner on the ground than it used to be. Defra is channelling most of its funding at nature-friendly farming initiatives and schemes to help boost farm productivity.</p><p>However, it is worth checking local authority websites as they sometimes have funding available for projects that boost the local economy.</p><p>The Farming in Protected Landscapes (FiPL) scheme, available to farmers in National Parks and other protected landscapes, has been offering grants for projects which increase opportunities for people to discover, enjoy and understand the landscape and its cultural heritage. However, the FiPL programme is scheduled to close in March 25 and in most areas the funding is likely to have already been allocated.</p><p>Whilst Government funding (or any type of external funding for that matter) can be helpful when financing a project be mindful that your autonomy can be impacted, and you can have less ability to develop a scheme or project as you see fit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Q: I am putting together a public-facing diversification, which is new to me. What should I be aware of when dealing with the public? </emphasis></p><p>\u00a0If you are inviting the public on to your farm, the priority has to be keeping them safe. This means carrying out a full risk assessment to identify hazards and to find ways to mitigate the risks. This might involve fencing off any areas where you don't want people to go and installing clear signage.</p><p>You will need to talk to your insurer about whether you have the right level of cover in place. Public Liability Insurance will be a must, as will Product Liability Insurance if you are selling a product. If you are employing anyone, you will also need Employers' Liability Insurance.\u00a0</p><p>More generally, think about the infrastructure required to host visitors, in terms of providing parking, handwashing stations or toilet facilities. How you are going to deal with any queries and complaints, particularly at busy times of the year for the farm?\u00a0</p><p>Social media is incredibly important for promoting public-facing diversifications, so you are likely to need someone with the time and inclination to engage with the public in this way. Be prepared for negative feedback and use it as a way to learn and develop your new enterprise.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Q: I would love to explore agroforestry options which can increase food security and reduce environmental impact.

It is likely to say that you will need written consent from your landlord for any change of use or alterations to existing buildings, but it is worth checking the exact terms. Be mindful of the term left on your agreement and if your diversification plans can be part of a wider discussion around a longer term.\u00a0</p><p>Tenants are advised to approach their landlord - or landlord's agent - at the earliest practical opportunity to open discussions about a potential project.

In cocoa, regen ag practices aim to restore degraded land, make life more stable for farmers, and conserve biodiversity, says the RA regenerative agriculture lead.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p><br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>*Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p><br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>*Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.<br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.<br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.<br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p><br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>*Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

Food spoilage is a widespread challenge for Nigerian farmers- over 90 million smallholder farmers report lost wages due to lack of cold storage at key points along the food supply chain. ColdHubs will use their funds to implement three new cold hubs and three ice points, impacting an estimated 640 smallholder farmers and market retailers.

In addition, JPL has purchased a new machine to transform the discarded palm kernel shells into fuel efficient briquettes.

Kawadah Farm Liberia will use their 3-year, no-interest loan of $ 290,000 to increase processing capacity so they can expand their network to reach 5,000 more farmers, provide training and small tool loans to increase farmer production and increase smallholder income in Liberia.<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited | Tanzania<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited (KKL), a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 300,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to purchase cocoa from a minimum of 533 farmers. Because cocoa is a year-round crop, these funds will be leveraged multiple times a year. Kokoa Kamili will also provide smallholder cocoa farmers with comprehensive services including seedlings, agronomic support, organic certification support, and above market pricing for their cocoa harvest through access to global premium markets.<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks | Cote d'Ivoire<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks is a for-profit social enterprise that creates additional income for smallholder farmers in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire by sourcing cocoa fruit juice- a byproduct of cocoa bean harvesting that is typically discarded- and transforming it into a marketable beverage. As a first-time partner, Kumasi Drinks will receive a 1-year $ 66,600 loan to bring online its Cote d'Ivoire supply chain, starting with cocoa juice purchases from 231 farmers to fulfill the needs of Ivorio, a leading juice brand in West Africa.

They are first put to a Whitebred Shorthorn bull to create the base cow with a Limousin bull being used as a terminal sire.</p><p>-On the sheep side we run 700 ewes using a mix of North Country Cheviots, Lleyns, and Texels for producing lambs for the store and prime rings.</p><p>-We have established woodland on farm including shelter belts and woodland grazing in small blocks. We have always run a regenerative model, using the regenerative abilities of the woods; using seed fall to restock, and designing felling areas to make sure we-re never too far from any seed source. This results in very diverse forest.</p><p>-Our nomination is primarily based on our development into integrating a Silvopasture model into our current business.
