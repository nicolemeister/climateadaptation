All Irish major cities and many regional cities and towns are located by the sea, while 20 per cent of the coastline is already exposed to erosion. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events will increase. Estimated sea-level rise could lead to a quadrupling in the number of properties affected by flooding in coastal locations. For Limerick city alone, the EPA estimates the cost of extreme floods under a high-end scenario of sea-level rise may increase up to 12.5-fold, amounting to over EUR 1 billion for a single event. </p><p>But there is still an air of magical thinking about our response to flooding. The public and political discourse continues to focus on quick-fix solutions and State interventions that, in the long-term, are neither financially nor socially sustainable. </p><p>This is not to underestimate the impact of flooding. The damage that flooding causes to property is devastating, but the stress is compounded by insurance difficulties. </p><p>There is no State-backed obligation on insurers to provide cover, leaving property owners acutely vulnerable in the event of another flooding episode. This problem is affecting a growing number of buildings, with as many as one in twenty buildings struggling to get any insurance according to a recent study by the Central Bank. Flood risk is also a barrier to new housing development, again driving up the political pressure for engineered solutions.</p><p>In turn, communities at risk put pressure on the political system to deliver engineering solutions to flood risk that will be acceptable to insurers, all of which tends to sideline the potential for transformative adaptation. </p><p>Interventions such as dredging, sea walls and river realignment are hugely expensive, often very damaging to ecosystems and wildlife, and tend to wear out or depreciate over time. The current investment programme by the Office of Public Works (OPW) only covers 21 projects, yet will cost an estimated EUR 1.3 billion by 2030. </p><p>In a 2020 journal article, Trinity College Dublin researchers, Marcus Collier and Mary Bourke, argue for more consideration of green infrastructure solutions such as constructed wetlands, afforestation and riparian buffers, and peatland restoration. They also suggest the construction of  leaky dams  to hold flood water and slow its movement or divert it away from at-risk areas. </p><p>They observe the OPW is confined in its actions by the immediate political and societal demand for protection of property and that this is a significant barrier to the adoption of nature-based solutions. </p><h>Nature-based solutions </h><p/><h>Short-term thinking and a lack of appreciation of the social and environmental costs of hard engineering mean that nature-based solutions are rarely given a chance to work. This happens even though green infrastructure, unlike grey infrastructure, appreciates over time and provides multiple societal and environmental co-benefits. </h><p>Complicating matters further is the fact that nature-based solutions, even in one area, tend to involve a mosaic of interventions from wetland restoration to sustainable drainage schemes for roads, afforestation and constructed reed beds on a patchwork of land parcels involving numerous landowners. All of this requires patient dialogue, lots of time and an attitude of co-operation and trust. </p><p>This is why the River Trusts have so much potential as they harness the multiple stakeholders and local expertise that is needed to protect rivers in their natural state. </p><p>We should be much better prepared for flooding, but hard engineering solutions will not provide all the answers. They are too expensive to implement everywhere given the likely number of properties at risk. </p><p>The OPW s approach reflects its outdated mandate under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act, which requires the OPW to prioritise drainage, even when harmful. Despite many EU directives covering the environment and water, no law mandates nature-based flood solutions. There is also a funding and cost-benefit bias towards dredging, pipes, tanks, walls and drains over wetlands. </p><p> Slow  water also filters out pollutants   even nitrates and phosphorous   and stores water more effectively for dry periods. Nature-based solutions limit damage to riverbeds and ecosystems that would be otherwise scoured by speeding up the flow of water in heavy rainfall. </p><p>In urban areas, we should be replacing hard surfaces wherever possible with plants to absorb heavy rainfall. We need more land to act as a sponge for excess water instead of continually trying to drive it away, so we will need to enlist the help of farmers and financially reward them for ecosystem services. </p><p>As the writer Erica Gies puts it, water always wins: better to work with it rather than to continually fight it.

Biodiversity loss is happening at the same time as climate change. They are two sides of the one coin. Our society relies on a healthy, functioning natural world,  says Iseult Sheedy of BFBI.</p><p>She admits the task is a demanding one.  We have been working from a place where businesses have very little understanding of how they interface with biodiversity to doing double materiality assessments to developing a nature strategy for the company.  </p><p>Double materiality assessments assess both the financial and the environmental/social impacts of business operations. Sheedy says that some businesses are starting to understand not only how their business impacts on nature, but also their dependence on the natural world.</p><p> There is a cohort of businesses   in the food and agricultural sector   which depend on nature, and unless they reinvest in nature-positive actions their businesses won t survive,  says Emer Ni Dh\u00faill, an ecologist who is head of research at BFBI.

Then they take steps to avoid and minimise these impacts and then they invest in restoration and regeneration,  says N\u00ed Dh\u00faill.</h><p>Sheedy adds:  We can t have an economy full of organisations built around profit only. We need mechanisms where reinvesting in nature happens.  </p><p>According to Sheedy, some businesses   in farming and food, construction and development sectors   have been thinking about these issues for a while, as have value-driven organisations that do voluntary reporting.  But we ll eventually come to a tipping point where all businesses will have to engage,  she adds. </p><p>The change in language from corporate social responsibility to environmental social governance (ESG) within business has been a significant step in how companies perceive themselves and their wider commitments to society. </p><p>ESB Networks was a founding member of the community of practice of BFBI. The State organisation published its biodiversity strategy, Networks for Nature, in September 2024. This policy statement outlines the company s commitments to environmental protection during the development, maintenance and operations of its infrastructure and assets.</p><p>The group is  drawing on technical expertise on assessments, tool kits and metrics from BFBI to help it comply with new reporting regimes, including the EU s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. </p><p>Those working in this space are, however, concerned that recent proposed delays to and simplifications of requirements for businesses to comply with the CSRD might slow down engagement from businesses in nature-positive strategies. </p><p>Announced by the European Commission in February, this so-called Omnibus package recommends postponing the application of the CSRD reporting requirements by two years for many companies that were due to report for the first time in 2026 for the 2025 financial year. </p><p>Furthermore, the proposals recommend that the large companies that were required to prepare sustainability reports in 2025 for the financial year of 2024 are given longer period to do so and with less detail than previously requested. </p><p>Commenting on the announcement in February, Irish law firm McCann FitzGerald said:  The Omnibus proposals, if implemented, are hugely significant. The commission estimates that the number of companies in scope will be reduced by 80 per cent. </p><p>Meanwhile, some universities have begun educating business students on the importance of biodiversity for business. </p><p>Sheedy teaches organisational change for a sustainable future to second-year undergraduate students at the school of business in Trinity College Dublin.</p><p> It s about understanding the political, economic and social reasons for the environmental crisis and a history around how business models were formed and need to change,  she says.</p><p>Assistant professor of business and nature Catherine Farrell, an ecologist, teaches fourth-year business students in Trinity College.  The course looks at the innate value of nature, how businesses impact on and depend on nature, why businesses need to work with nature and the benefits of doing so.  </p><h>Nature-positive actions</h><p/><h> The students have shown an appetite for this learning, and as part of their final year research they work with businesses to map their nature-positive actions. These businesses include A&amp;L Goodbody; Chartered Accountants Ireland, Dundrum Shopping Centre and Hibernia Real Estate. </h><p>The timing of introducing these modules on the natural world into business schools coincides with the rise in nature-related disclosures within the business community such as the aforementioned CSRD.</p><p>Martha O Hagan, the director of undergraduate programmes in the school of business at TCD, argues that it is essential to have ecologists teaching business students.  Nature is critical infrastructure which provides clean water, clean air, flood mitigation and its damage is a very realistic risk for businesses.  </p><p>Farrell adds:  There have been cases where businesses have invested in tree plantings that never happened in an unregulated unstandardised approach, which led to many instances of greenwashing. </p><p>By teaching business students the importance of monitoring, reporting on and verifying inventions in nature, such greenwashing should be avoided in the future. </p><p> They have to think seriously and understand what is the right thing to do. Finance that is misdirected is a lost opportunity for nature,  she says. </p><p>While there has been a lot of attention on climate targets, the global biodiversity framework 2022 nature-positive targets for 2030 should give the natural world more traction, Farrell says. </p><p> And the restoration of nature through rewetting peatlands, planting trees and regenerating seagrass in marine environments can all help achieve reductions of carbon-dioxide emissions. </p><p>Trinity school of business has launched a pilot project to give corporates opportunities to directly fund nature initiatives on farms in Ireland.

The Newtownstewart Town Centre Regeneration Framework document identifies a number of indicative actions for the next five to ten years with the aim of enhancing the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the town. The launch of the final draft of the document follows a detailed research and analysis period by council that included engagement with local stakeholders and government agencies to identify challenges and opportunities for the health and vitality of the town centre. The document was approved by elected members of council's Environment and Regeneration in late summer 2024. Deputy Mayor Guy welcomed the formal publication of the document and encouraged the public to read it and play their part in the regeneration of the town. \"I am delighted for the people of Newtownstewart that the blueprint for the town's growth and regeneration in the short, medium and long term has been completed,\" he said. \"Thank you to everyone who gave their feedback and who attended the public consultation events that have allowed council officers to develop a plan that has been tailored to meet local needs specific to the town centre. \"There is significant work ahead to make this exciting vision for the town centre a reality, but crucially we now have a framework that will allow all the stakeholders to work together to allow Newtownstewart to fulfil its potential in the years ahead. \"The Framework will be an important document that assist all of the partners in identifying and securing external funding opportunities in order to deliver the actions identified.\" The Framework document covers a wide range of themes including traffic management, parking, pedestrian/cycle infrastructure and connectivity, streetscape/public realm, built heritage, green infrastructure, business development and tourism. Regeneration project officer at council, Maura Fitzpatrick, explained more about the format of the document. \"The early chapters focus on the historic background and characteristics of Newtownstewart, how it has grown and developed over the years and the issues and challenges the town faces,\" she explained. \"This leads to a SWOT analysis, informed by local stakeholder engagement, which has helped identify the opportunities and potential for improvement of the economic, environmental and social wellbeing of the town . \"It is through this exercise that the framework defines the strategic regeneration vision for Newtownstewart, together with a series of indicative actions over the short, medium and long term that will help deliver change and improve the issues currently affecting the town centre.\" The Newtownstewart Town Centre Framework is available online at: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.derrystrabane.com/newtownstewart\">www.derrystrabane.com/newtownstewart</url> For further information or questions about the framework call 028 71253253 or email:  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:regeneration@derrystrabane.co\">regeneration@derrystrabane.co</email> m</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "Strabane Weekly", "instances": ["\"There is significant work ahead to make this exciting vision for the town centre a reality, but crucially we now have a framework that will allow all the stakeholders to work together to allow Newtownstewart to fulfil its potential in the years ahead. \"The Framework will be an important document that assist all of the partners in identifying and securing external funding opportunities in order to deliver the actions identified.

The 20m diameter dome by Viking Domes from Lithuania, is just one element of an exciting new environmental project set to transform the site, creating an innovative urban growing space for the local community promoting food growing technologies and sustainable practices. The Acorn Farm is being delivered by council's Green Infrastructure Team with support from the UK Government. The contractor is McKelvey Construction from Castlederg and the design team is led by Doran Consulting, Belfast ,with the dome design by Paul McAllister Architects. The \u00a36.2 million climate-smart project will assist in achieving climate resilience by incorporating circular economy principles and sustainable energy technologies. The site will also host a Green Skills Learning Academy, providing education and training on sustainable food production and environmental conservation. Work will go into the development of new farming systems, optimising growing conditions, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in urban horticulture. Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr said the project would have a major impact on the local area. \"There is no doubt that we are faced with many challenges when it comes to climate,\" she said. \"But the message we leave for future generations in our time capsule today is a hopeful one that demonstrates our commitment to changing things for the better. \"The Acorn Farm is an exciting vision of what we hope to achieve in terms of council's climate ambitions. \"The project will promote sustainable living, environmental education, and community involvement and become a hub for local events, activities and learning experiences. \"It will bring people together with the shared goal of adopting more responsible and sustainable practices that will protect our local environment and ensure a cleaner, greener city and district for future generations.\" In 2015 there was much excitement as a 175-year-old time capsule was unearthed at the former Gwyn's Institute site during the regeneration of Brooke Park. The lead capsule contained coins, newspapers and a scroll containing the signatures of local dignitaries dating back to 1839. The capsule placed at the Dome site holds a selection of images relating to the Acorn Farm project, including digital technical drawings produced by the design team. It also contains worksheets from the children from Bready Primary School with information on the food we eat today and their predictions of food they think people will eat in 200 years' time - from 3D burgers to seaweed pizza. Principal David Bogle explained. \"We are delighted to be here today at this milestone moment for the Acorn Farm and to make a little bit of history by placing some items in the time capsule for future generations to discover. \"Our pupils have been learning all about the importance of sustainable food and have had great fun recording their predictions for the favourite foods of the future. \"It's so important for young people to know where their food comes from and how we can all play a role in ensuring our environment can support vital food sources in a responsible and sustainable way.\" The children from Bready were joined on site for the placing of the capsule by project partners and the design team. Final preparations are also underway for the handover of the new Gate Lodge building which will greet visitors at the entrance to the site.

Abundance, the new book from Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, aspires to nothing less than breaking this 40-year-old political stalemate. It promises a new way of thinking about politics and policy, particularly on the left.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The central problem of modern politics, as identified by the book, is high living costs. Though we live in a world of cheap clothes, food and entertainment, the most important things are getting less affordable.</p><p>Take housing. Affordability could hardly be worse across America's most successful cities, from LA and San Francisco to New York and Boston. Until recently, the wage premium made it worthwhile to move to these cities from lower-wage states, but now high housing costs mean all but the most highly skilled employees are better off staying put.</p><p>This doesn't just limit opportunity for individuals, it hurts the whole economy. And housing is not an isolated problem. California's high-speed rail has been overpromised and underdelivered for decades. New York spent an incredible $17bn on the Second Avenue subway station.</p><p>Abundance is about the US, but could just as easily be about Ireland or the UK. And that's what makes Klein and Thompson's proposed solutions worth paying attention to.</p><p>Why is the cost of living so high? The thesis of Abundance is that governments, particularly those on the left, have lost sight of the importance of building.</p><p>Governments would much rather deal with problems by spending money on them. But money doesn't solve all problems. Beyond a certain point, more funding just drives up prices.</p><p>\"Giving people a subsidy for a good whose supply is choked is like building a ladder to try to reach an elevator that is racing ever upward,\" the authors write.</p><p>What are the bottlenecks?</p><p>Onerous planning and permit requirements make green infrastructure like wind turbines prohibitively expensive, so they never make it off the drawing board. States lack the in-house capacity to manage complex projects, which end up behind schedule and over budget. New housing is limited by planning law in the places needed most.</p><p>In the US, Republican-governed states excel when it comes to cost of living. Housing affordability is much better in fast-growing cities like Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, and voters are moving there from coastal cities. It's not just a housing issue: Texas has built more renewable energy than California.</p><p>The solutions Abundance sketches out are novel and exciting. Allow successful cities to grow. Build your way out of the climate crisis through new infrastructure and new kinds of energy generation. Reform scientific institutions to make them innovation engines and use the resulting technology to improve everyone's lives.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Klein and Thompson's vision is a positive and uplifting one. It focuses on the good things the left can unite around and get excited about, rather than the things it is against.</p><p>It comes at an important moment for the Democratic Party as they recover from their presidential election defeat and plot a path forward. Will any 2028 presidential hopefuls adopt the mantle of abundance?</p><p>Across the English-speaking world, political parties should take heed. Some already are.</p><p>The Labour government in the UK wants to \"rebuild Britain\", turning it into a clean energy superpower with over a million new homes. In Ireland, it's not yet clear if any parties will follow suit.</p><p>However, in an effort to be a grand theory of everything, the book skates over important details. How will the opponents of abundance be overcome? What specific policies can deliver abundance? Can those policies appeal to voters?</p><p>California's issues bring Ireland to mind. We have an acute housing and homelessness crisis. Climate change threatens us too. Our (EURO)335,000 bike shed is a complement to San Francisco's $1.7m toilet. After decades, we haven't even broken ground on a metro for Dublin.</p><p>Just like Californians, many young people are voting with their feet by emigrating.</p><p>An Irish abundance agenda could appeal to the broad swathe of voters in the middle ground who want a better life for their children and grandchildren while protecting the environment. It promises a government that removes the barriers to the things everyone wants. The issues it addresses are already top of minds in Ireland. Abundance gives us new tools and frameworks with which to tackle them.</p><p>An abundance-first approach has worked elsewhere. For instance, New Zealand's housing policies increase housing supply and help the environment by reducing sprawl. Madrid's capable bureaucracy builds its metro system quickly and cheaply. The UK is simultaneously streamlining construction and protecting the environment by creating a Nature Restoration Fund.</p><p>And the US is re-examining its science funding apparatus to ensure it gets the best bang for its buck, giving the world more new technologies, such as nuclear fusion.</p><p>It's possible to protect the environment, enhance living standards and embrace the future all at once.

The vast expanses of grassland meadows should be thrumming with bees and butterflies, but instead the air above is silent and empty. This is because there are no flowers. Unlike most agricultural fields, these meadows are not sprayed with chemicals or slurry and so you would expect them to host glorious displays of every kind of native plant. Instead, they are nearly devoid of anything except dense grasses. The reason? They are all being eaten.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h>The deer</h><p>A recent article in this publication <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/phoenix-park-deer-6606174-Jan2025/\">claims</url> that the deer in the Park have, for over 300 years, \"promoted the park's biodiversity\". In fact, the opposite is the case. The abundance of deer, 600 according to the piece, have stripped the Park bare, much as they do in the wild when their numbers are too high. Deer are not particularly fond of grass, so they will make a beeline for softer leaves of trees or flowering plants.</p><p>This is why you will not only see scarcely any flowers on summer's days, but you will never see any wild tree seedlings. The lack of young trees or bushy plants deprives birds of nesting places and so the Park's bird population also suffers. People will notice that in the wooded areas of the Park, there are practically no plants or scrub on the forest floor. This effect is most obvious in one small area, near the entrance to the Ordnance Survey, which has been fenced off to deer. Inside the fence is a tiny native woodland that is thriving with hazels, brambles and whitethorn. It's full of bird song in spring.</p><p>The fallow deer, which are native to the Mediterranean region, are the prime reason why the biodiversity of the Park is so poor, but they are not the only reason.</p><p>While the Park is full of impressively mature trees, too many are non-native and so provide few resources for native insects or other animals. In some areas, cherry laurel, an invasive species, is allowed to flourish. Many of the most beautiful trees are a hundred years old or more, but the OPW are still planting saplings of these exotic species (behind metal guards) that will replace them.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6616759/original/?width=580&amp;version=6616759\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Another issue is that mature trees that fall over are, nearly always, hastily chopped up and cleaned away. This denies the park of essential ecological processes as decaying trees (many are not even dead) are important habitats for specialist fungi and invertebrates. By being overly concerned with appearances, the OPW is tidying away a vital layer of the food chain.</p><h>How should we care for the Phoenix Park</h><p>I am not advocating for the Park to be rewilded in its entirety. It's important that the amenity value be preserved while open meadows are still important to some of the last nesting skylarks in the city (their song in summer is a joy).</p><p><br/></p><p>However, the OPW's 'Conservation Management Plan' from 2011 is out of date and is not fit for the biodiversity emergency. While I would be happy to see the fallow deer removed altogether, I accept that they are a popular attraction, but their numbers should be greatly reduced. Areas that have trees should be converted to native woodland, primarily by fencing out the deer. It's astonishing that there is no significant area of native woodland at all in the Park.</p><p>Non-native trees, particularly the likes of holm oak, which cast a very dark shade, should be gradually removed while cherry laurel needs to be quickly eradicated. Obviously, fallen trees that are a danger or an obstruction need to be cleared. But there's no reason why certain areas of the Park couldn't be rewilded, with fallen trees left in place and natural scrub, with brambles and blackthorn, allowed to regenerate.</p><p>This impact of this goes way beyond the Phoenix Park or even Dublin. Urban areas in Ireland are splattered with green spaces that are dull, boring expanses with next to no wildlife value.</p><p>The Park could and should be a showcase for how urban green spaces can be brimming with biodiversity. It may look a little scruffier around the edges but wouldn't the sound of bird song and the sight of bees and wild flowers be worth it?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P\u00e1draic Fogarty is an environmental campaigner.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p><br/></p>", "publisher": "The Journal (Ireland)", "instances": ["THE PHOENIX PARK in Dublin may or may not be the largest city park in Europe but it is certainly the largest in Ireland.

The Derg Active project is an integrated economic, health and wellbeing initiative incorporating infrastructure at a number of key sites in the town to promote and encourage more active lifestyles. The project is one of three major strategic developments to benefit from an overall \u00a316m funding pot secured by Derry City and Strabane District Council from the UK government's Levelling Up Fund in 2021. \u00a36.5m of the Derg Active project is funded though the Levelling Up Fund and council, with \u00a35,823,090 secured by council as part of a wider Levelling Up package, to create a high-quality public realm space at the Diamond in the centre of the town, new play provision and lighting at the Castle site and enhanced greenway connectivity at Dergview FC. In the latest development phase Lowry Building and Civil Engineering have been appointed to deliver the public realm space at the Diamond and Gibson Brothers appointed to deliver the new play provision and greenway connectivity at the Castle and Dergview FC. Welcoming the appointments, Mayor of Derry and Strabane, councillor Patricia Logue, said it was encouraging to see the project making further progress. \"I am delighted to be able to confirm these new appointments, and I want to acknowledge the work that has gone into reaching this stage of the project,\" she said. \"This is an ambitious and transformative development for the Castlederg area and much needed investment in our rural settlements. \"The green infrastructure element is particularly important due to the wide-ranging benefits it will bring to the community in terms of overall health and wellbeing.\" Works are set to commence in the spring and will be completed by March 2025. The planning process is already well underway for the delivery of the 3G multi-sport Pitch at Mitchell Park, and work will begin later this year.

Welcoming the completion of works throughout the eight small settlements, Myaor Lilian Seenoi-Barr said: \"I am delighted to see work begin on this important regeneration project to improve the visual appearance and character of the identified village and town centres within our district. \"The Covid Recovery Small Settlements Programme represents an important initiative in targeting investment into our rural settlements to assist local businesses who play a key role in the economic vitality and viability of the rural area. \"We hope that not only will the targeted properties and village/town centres benefit from the physical enhancements, but also from the increase in footfall and activity. \"This project represents a key collaborative rural regeneration initiative between council and the respective central government departments, and I would like to acknowledge the collective input of all involved.\" The scheme has been made possible through the COVID Recovery Small Settlements Programme in which council secured funding. The COVID Recovery Small Settlements Regeneration Programme is a collaboration between the Department for Communities (DfC), Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) and the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) working closely with local councils to identify priority projects for delivery on the ground. The programme supported a range of regeneration and active travel interventions targeting small settlements with a population of less than 5,000 people to help attract investors, visitors and to create vital and viable towns that meet the needs of local citizens and the surrounding areas. Out of the \u00a32.5m funding secured by council from the programme, \u00a31.2m has been allocated towards the commercial facade painting scheme and associated environmental improvements within the eight settlements, with the remaining budget committed to green infrastructure/active travel projects in Claudy, Newtownstewart and Park. The commercial facade painting scheme has been the culmination of work by council over the past two years in the identification of properties/technical surveys, engagement with businesses/property owners and the appointment of contractors to undertake the works. The painting works have been delivered over two separate contracts for Derg District Electoral Area (Castlederg, Newtownstewart and Sion Mills) and the Sperrin/Faughan District Electoral Area (Ballymagorry, Claudy, Donemana, Eglinton and Plumbridge). Communities Minister Gordon Lyons MLA said: \"It is great to see the completion of these schemes as part of the COVID Recovery Small Settlements Programme. \"They are great examples of collaborative working between departments, working closely with Derry and Strabane District Council and the wider community. \"The improvements made in these small towns will help to improve the economic and wellbeing of the communities who live there and of those who choose to visit.\" Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister, Andrew Muir MLA., added: \"I am delighted that my department has worked in collaboration with other Executive departments and Derry City and Strabane District Council to deliver the COVID Recovery Small Settlements Regeneration Programme. \"The Commercial Facade Enhancement and Environmental Improvement Schemes will improve aesthetics within rural towns and villages, which will lead to enhanced economic activity within the areas and help to build strong, sustainable, and diverse rural communities across the district.\" Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd commented: \"I am pleased that my department could contribute funding to these projects which will improve the appearance of these eight rural settlements in the Derry City and Strabane Council District area making them more attractive for residents and visitors. \"The Covid Recovery Small Settlements programme has been a great example of inter-departmental working to deliver real change in how people live and work and has already brought tangible benefits to many of our rural communities.\"</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "Strabane Weekly", "instances": ["Out of the \u00a32. 5m funding secured by council from the programme, \u00a31.

The Environmental Protection Agency s latest State of the Environment Report delivers a stark warning: our nation is failing environmentally, and only bold, systemic change can reverse this trend ( Irish climate to become  unrecognisable  if action on emissions is delayed , News, October 3rd). </p><p>As chairman of An Taisce, I am deeply concerned about our inadequate response to the escalating crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Our current approach   incremental at best   does not address the root causes of these emergencies. Minor adjustments cannot tackle the accelerating challenges we face. Despite some progress, nature is declining rapidly, pollution remains widespread, and our reported improvements in emissions often rely on ignoring land-use factors and outsourcing electricity generation, misleading us about our true environmental performance.</p><p>We strongly support the Environmental Protection Agency s call for five key measures to turn the tide: a national policy position that aligns actions across sectors, rigorous enforcement of existing laws, transformation of key economic sectors, significant investment in critical infrastructure, and prioritising environmental health for public wellbeing. All of these echo An Taisce s long-standing advocacy for deep, cross-sectoral engagement that recognises the intrinsic connection between environmental health and public welfare.</p><p>While the recent investments in climate transition and water infrastructure announced in Budget 2025 are welcome, they fall short of what is necessary. The Environmental Pillar acknowledges these efforts but highlights missed opportunities to enact sustainable shifts in tax and welfare policies. One-off measures, like the universal energy credit, undermine long-term sustainability and fail to effectively address energy poverty.</p><p>Blaming public participation for delays in housing and green infrastructure is misguided. Public involvement leads to better decision-making, as recognised by our courts. Limiting it undermines our collective efforts to restore the environment and build a sustainable Ireland. As Carl Sagan poignantly asked,  Who speaks for Earth?  In Ireland, it is the people who speak for the environment. The 500,000 individuals engaged in An Taisce s programmes demonstrate the public s deep commitment to nature. We should empower communities to act and hold systems accountable, not shut them out. </p><p>As we approach a general election, it is imperative that we demand more than rhetoric regarding environmental sustainability from our candidates. We need leaders who not only pledge but demonstrate a genuine commitment to aligning policies with our environmental obligations. The survival of our ecosystems, the quality of our air, the food on our tables, and the future of younger generations hinge on our decisions today.

Pocket parks, regional parks, street trees, window boxes, allotments, green walls, potted plants, hanging baskets, riverbanks and more. It really doesn't matter what form that nature takes. We need more of it. Urgently.</p><p>In recent times, there have been noticeable advances in access to green spaces in our urban centres. In Cork, Tramore Valley Park, now with improved pedestrian and cycle access, is a major public park, not far from the city centre. When you consider its previous use, as the city dump, its development over the last two decades is a notable long-term investment by Cork City Council. So too is the ongoing work on the Marina Park development. It is good to see major investment in public green spaces.</p><p>In Dublin, the opening this year of the new Bridgefoot Street Park in the Liberties shows what can be done to take a derelict site and create a genuinely interesting and useful green public amenity. Dublin City Council deserve huge credit for this and it's an indication of what is possible on a derelict, inner-city site. (Owners of the old tax office site in Cork, please take note).</p><p>Despite some genuinely positive developments, we continue to see the erosion of green infrastructure in other parts of our cities. In Cork city centre, the transfer of ownership of a portion of Bishop Lucey Park to the Freemasons continues to grate with people. To sell off, for  1, a chunk of public green space to a private members' club reflects poorly on everyone involved. Despite attempts to justify the sale, it detracts from the genuinely good work being done elsewhere.</p><p>With Bishop Lucey Park now behind hoardings, we wait to see what will emerge in 12 months. Based on the plans already publicly available, we will undoubtedly be faced with having spent millions of euro reducing the amount of green space in a city centre park. We will get a city square rather than a city park and I suspect lots of people will be happy with that.</p><p>The truth is many people seem to have forgotten the true value of trees, plants and nature within our cities. Unfortunately, many of those who have forgotten are also tasked with planning and managing our cities.</p><p>There is ample scientific research to confirm the positive benefits of urban green spaces. City dwellers who live close to such spaces have a longer life expectancy. Increased access to high-quality green spaces is also linked to better mental well-being. This realisation has encouraged the city of Barcelona, for example, to invest millions in creating new 'green axes' to replace busy vehicle intersections. Road surfaces will be minimised and replaced with trees, plants, benches and other street furniture. Recent research suggests that the work in Barcelona will improve the health of up to 30,000 citizens and reduce health costs by as much as  45m.</p><p>We also know that urban trees and other green infrastructure are good for business. Shoppers will spend up to 12% more for goods and services in streets with a decent tree canopy. Tourists want to visit and spend time in places where nature is considered important.</p><p>As Cop28, the UN climate change conference, continues in Dubai, the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions continues to dominate headlines. While planting urban trees alone will never soak up enough carbon to solve climate change - we need to reduce emissions, full stop - trees do offer a means of cooling our cities, reducing the effects of flooding and protecting biodiversity. There is also a role for trees and other planting in reducing air pollution (please don't mention the Robot Trees). Protecting and improving our urban green spaces will help us to adapt to the climate changes that are already here.</p><p>With all of that in mind, the latest version of Bus Connects in Cork is currently out for public consultation, with the deadline (December 18) fast approaching. While there is much to welcome in the plans, and the need for a functioning public bus system in Cork is self-evident, it's disappointing not to see more care being taken in planning the routes for the sustainable transport corridors and replacing any trees impacted.</p><p>Along the Blackpool to City route, the publicly available plans suggest that 67% of all trees catalogued along the route will be removed with one tree being planted in the whole of Blackpool as part of the plans. The problem, of course, is that trees, pedestrians, and cyclists are vying for the scraps of land available once private motorcars are facilitated. Is it really necessary to have five lanes of motor traffic on Leitrim Street - two minutes from Patrick Street - and is it so necessary that most of the trees on the street need to be lost in the process?</p><p>We need to rethink our relationship with nature in our cities and towns. Parks and trees are not a panacea for all of our problems. Nobody is suggesting that. However, there are clear benefits in investing in nature in urban areas.

These are solutions to challenges like reducing coastal erosion, providing clean water, reducing flood risk and sustainable food production.</p><p>Working with nature to develop solutions can deliver sustainable climate action to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and enable people to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. Restoring native forests in appropriate places is an example of a nature-based solution that can deliver climate, biodiversity, social and economic benefits simultaneously. </p><p>Planting forests in places where they replace a more diverse ecosystem is not a nature-based solution because it is harmful to biodiversity.</p><p>Different nature-based solutions provide different mixes of social, economic and biodiversity benefits, just like building a bypass around a town might provide different social and economic benefits to different groups of people. Some people benefit and others may face a cost through lost opportunities for income or a change in the services provided to them. </p><p>Careful planning and monitoring of nature-based solutions can reduce the risk of negative outcomes, mitigate risks and help us to learn how to better implement them in the future or in other locations.</p><p>Imagine if we designed and built 50 water treatment plants to provide clean water to people, but once they were built no one monitored the water or maintained the equipment. While we might expect that a natural ecosystem would fare better than a water treatment plant if left to its own devices, even nature-based solutions need to be monitored and managed. </p><p>The Connecting Nature project measured the impact of nature-based projects in cities on climate change adaptation, health and wellbeing, social cohesion and sustainable economic development across Europe. </p><p>This project demonstrated the great potential for job creation and  economic benefits from the deployment and ongoing management of nature-based solutions.</p><p>Natural ecosystems are far more complex than the  grey infrastructure  that we normally put in place to manage the supply of water or prevent coastal erosion. </p><p>Nature-based solutions change over time. If well managed, they can increase in complexity and even improve as the ecosystem develops. A biodiverse nature-based solution can adapt to changing conditions, with different species thriving in different kinds of situations. For example, a diverse grassland can better withstand drought conditions than a grassland with just a few species, because the chances of having a drought-resistant species in the mix is higher when you have many species.</p><p>There are challenges involved in deploying nature-based solutions more widely.

This drop-in event will also be used as an opportunity to share the emerging plans for Mitchell Park, which will see the creation of a new 3G Floodlight Sports Pitch which is also being funded through the UK Levelling Up Fund. Back in October 2021, Derry City and Strabane District Council secured \u00a35,823,090 from the UK Levelling Up Fund to deliver the Derg Active Project. The funding was part of an overall \u00a315.5m funding pot secured by the council from UK Government's Levelling Up Fund to deliver on three strategic projects across the council. A core element of the Derg Active Project is to deliver a high-quality public realm at the Diamond in the centre of the village. Since securing the funding council has been progressing with the project and has appointed GM Design to oversee the design and project management of the Derg Active Green Infrastructure elements, which included the Diamond. Doran Consulting Engineers were also appointed to design and project manage the Mitchell Park Sports pitch development. Local elected members were invited to attend monthly steering groups meetings and also two design workshops were held to help shape the emerging designs for this space. Among the consultees are the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) who are an active participant on the steering groups and workshops and engagement has also taken place with the British Legion with regard to the War Memorial. In an effort to consult with other stakeholders and the wider community, Council is planning on hosting a community engagement event as follows at the Derg Valley Leisure Centre on Thursday, February 23 from 11am to 2pm and from 4pm to 8pm and on Saturday, February 25 from 10am to 2pm. In addition to this, the project management team will further engage with the traders in the town centre while officers will continue to engage with DfI, the British Legion, Local Growth Partnership, Translink, the utility companies and other organisations and individuals potentially impacted by the proposed public realm works Encouraging the local community to get involved in the community engagement, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, councilor Sandra Duffy, said that the Derg Active project is a significant investment for Castlederg and input from the local community, businesses and stakeholders is vital to ensure it delivers benefits for all.

The AONB and Geopark programme provided by the Woodland Trust, in partnership with the Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale AONBs, is now available for farm owners located over a much larger area.  Previously a farm had to be within one of the AONBs to apply. However, now the eligible area has expanded to cover the whole of the Aspiring Geopark, which has its land boundary along the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council administrative border. Following a site visit and detailed discussion, the Woodland Trust works in partnership with the farmer to create planned, effective green infrastructure on the land. This plan can help provide shade and shelter, reduce the overland flow of water and much more. The farmer can also get help in exploring funding opportunities. The project has delivered 44 farm plans over the last four years. Since its inception in 2019, farms ranging in size from 4ha to 400ha have benefitted from the programme and in total it has provided woodland and hedgerow planning for more than 30000ha of farmland. Despite recent uncertainty in the industry, farming is still the mainstay of the rural community forming the bedrock of the rural economy in the area. However, there can be no doubt that farming, especially hill farming, is under significant pressure.  Increases in fodder, fuel and fertiliser costs have recently led to declines in overall income. With time and money at a premium, many farmers are now looking for more efficient ways to make farming pay. Research has proved that increased shelter from hedges and woodlands can have a marked impact on agribusiness. For example, shelterbelts can result in a 30% reduction in lamb losses, especially in multiple births, and more significant daily live weight gains per unit of food. Supplementary feeding can also be reduced, and the grazing season extended as land under trees absorbs rainwater up to 60 times better than exposed land.   Newry Mourne and Down Council Chairperson Councillor Michael Savage said, \"In a world of increased economic costs and more severe climate risks, even small changes to a farm's resilience can have a big impact. Properly planned planting is a vital tool in the movement towards viability\". Cllr Savage continued, \"I am pleased that we can offer this service to more farmers than ever, as we have been able to expand the eligible criteria beyond the boundary of the two AONBs to cover the whole of the Aspiring Geopark. Of course, not all farmers will be able to use this service, but we hope that many who could benefit will apply.\" Anyone interested in taking part in the programme should speak to the AONB and Geopark management team in the first instance by contacting Abby McSherry at 07708510344  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:abby.mcsherry@nmandd.or\">abby.mcsherry@nmandd.or</email> g or Judith Hassard at 07548159835  <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:judith.hassard@nmanddd.org\">judith.hassard@nmanddd.org</email> .

The Mourne Mountains Gateway Project aims to redefine the visitor experience of the Mourne Mountains whilst supporting the sustainable growth of tourism and protecting and enhancing the natural heritage and habitat of the region.  An iconic visitor centre with international appeal will allow visitors of all ages and abilities travelling by gondola lift to access breathtaking views in the heart of the Mourne Mountains. Environmental considerations are key to all aspects of the Belfast Region City Deal supported project, with the visitor centre itself designed to be reversible and large areas of the building prefabricated. With an Outline Business Case approved by Council and partners, concept designs have now been produced to take the project to the next stage, and the Council wants to hear from residents and stakeholders on how the project should develop ahead of the appointment of a Design Team in Autumn 2023 and subsequent surveys and investigations. Newry, Mourne and Down District Council Chairperson, Cllr Michael Savage said, \"We are excited to share details of the latest stage of the Mourne Mountains Gateway Project and the many benefits this will bring to our district. This is a project which aims to deliver a visitor attraction of international interest and create improved and more sustainable access to the Mournes. Importantly, we will be supporting our Newry, Mourne and Down hospitality sector and creating jobs. \"We're acutely aware of our environmental responsibilities and input from our residents, partners, and all those invested in tourism in the region is key. This project remains in development and the conversation continues.\" Cllr Savage continued, \"There are also wider considerations. The Mourne Mountains Gateway Project will, for example, provide the first opportunity to introduce a visitor management plan for the site that will align with wider visitor management across the Mournes. The aim is also to provide managed access onwards in to the Mournes from the visitor centre itself. Surplus revenue from the project will additionally be reinvested into trail development and repairs on the mountains.\" \"There is also the opportunity to put in Green Infrastructure to support the project, with transport solutions including a Park and Ride in Newcastle. Cllr Savage added, \"An overall \u00a3200 million package of investment is coming to our district through Belfast Region City Deal funding for projects based on tourism, regeneration, and innovation. For the Mourne Mountains Gateway Project, \u00a330 million of the total estimated project cost of \u00a344 million is earmarked for Belfast Region City Deal funding. This is an unmissable opportunity for us in Newry, Mourne and Down to offer a tourist attraction of international interest that will support the sustainable growth of tourism and hospitality.\" \"Today has been a great opportunity to discuss the project with residents. We have been able to answer many questions and following today's event we will also publish answers to a range of frequently asked questions. Further updates will be provided on our website (newrymournedown.org/mournes-gateway) and social media channels.\" John McGrillen, Chief Executive of Tourism NI, said, \"Tourism NI is excited to see the Mourne Mountains Gateway Project reach this stage and looks forward to seeing it further develop. We believe the Mournes Gateway will provide another \"must see\" offering for Northern Ireland, providing a reason to visit, particularly for the Republic of Ireland and GB markets. \"Our research has indicated that for the European and US markets, the Mournes Gateway will act as an anchor attraction, and go on to facilitate exploration of the wider area.\"</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "Newry Democrat", "instances": ["The aim is also to provide managed access onwards in to the Mournes from the visitor centre itself.

The Partnership meeting was held between senior government officials from both the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish government and civic leaders and officials from Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council. Members attending the meeting received updates on a range of thematic discussions that have been hosted by the North South Ministerial Council secretariat in relation to economy and investment, higher and third level education and skills and tourism and health. The group also had detailed discussions around the Strategic Vision and Regional Priorities/ Reviewed Memorandum of Understanding for the Third Level Education Sector in the North West City Region. Partnership ,embers also received a presentation on the innovative Regional Energy Agency which is progressing the green transformation agenda in the North West City Region. The Partnership is a unique structure that was first established in 2016 through the North South Ministerial Council, to provide support and discussion to the North West City Region. Jointly led by Derry City and Strabane District Council and Donegal County Council, and chaired by the two Mayors, the meeting was supported by the International Centre for Local and Regional Development (ICLRD). It is established in conjunction with and supported by The Executive Office and the Irish government. Jointly chairing the meeting was recently elected Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, councillor Patricia Logue, who described the Partnership meeting as extremely interesting and informative. \"This is a very significant meeting that is attended by very senior officers from government across the island of Ireland and I was very impressed with the level of work that is taking place on important issues relating to third level education and skills, tourism and health as well as the economy and investment,\" she commented. \"It is very encouraging to have senior government officials around the table working in partnership to drive forward ambitious plans for our region. \"The meeting was very interesting and informative and it was very reassuring to hear the work that is going on at a collaborative level to really develop and address the regional priorities for the growth and development across this North West City Region. She added: \"It was also positive to hear at first hand the joint strategic approach on job creation and FDI promotion, our shared vision for further and higher education and a commitment to address cross border barriers and the challenges facing our local tourism sector such as the proposed UK National Border Act 2022 if it is implemented. \"I was also glad to hear about the commitment to review tourism signage and recognition that more works needs to be done in terms of collaboration to deliver better mental health services and how we can work collectively to explore the potential to utilise current North South structures for data sharing and development opportunities.\" An Cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, councillor Liam Blaney, welcomed all participants and highlighted the significance of this unique partnership. He said: \"Collectively we are tasked with implementing joined-up cross-border initiatives to improve the North West City Region of Ireland. \"Since 2016 we have been working collectively as a unique partnership to support the region's commitment to growth. I am proud of what we have achieved since this time. Derry, Donegal and Strabane are inextricably linked. \"Our citizens live, work and play across this border area. We share common services, food, infrastructures and cultures.\" Councillor Blaney said the meeting was very informative and enlightening for all attendees, with the meeting highlighting the significant cross border collaboration that is underway in the region and the willingness on both sides for social, economic and environmental regeneration - and the balanced regional development of the North West. Another key element of the meeting was an update from the Regional Energy Agency on what progress has been made in relation to progressing the green transformation agenda in the North West City Region. Delegates attending the meeting heard how both council's are progressing with the Green Transformation of the NW City Region of Ireland Statement of Intent which aims to harness the transformative opportunity for 'green growth', enhanced sustainability and protection of our resources, and positions the region as a potential net contributor to important climate targets set by both governments in the coming decades through achieving a critical mass of impact in terms of carbon emissions reduction, net production of clean energy, green innovation, and enhanced conservation and protection through collaborative cross-border approaches. In the report delegates heard how the two councils are working towards their overarching goal to become carbon neutral by 2045 by restoring, protecting and enhancing the natural heritage and biodiversity and working collectively to achieve strong economic growth through a circular economy, zero waste and resource efficient initiatives that will be supported by a range of strategies and projects under green infrastructure including regional energy, climate action and sustainable economy. At the core of the regional commitment to Green Transformation is to drive forward leading innovations for regional development and economic growth alongside an improved quality of life whilst also sustaining the region's natural resources, habitat and environment. The Green Transformation Statement of Intent was developed via a multi-disciplinary working group of relevant departments and units within both Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council and facilitated by the International Centre for Local and Regional Development. Extending a sincere thanks to everyone participating in the meeting, chief executive of Derry City and Strabane District Council, John Kelpie, said it was more important than ever that these strong links with senior government officials are retained and re-emphasised the importance of collaboration.

Cork is the first Irish city to be included.</p><p>Accenture brought 18 organisations including UCC, AIB, Cork City Council, ESB, Gas NetworksIreland, and wholesaler Musgrave together for the initiative, which aims to accelerate progress towards net zero emissions in cities around the world.</p><p>Ms O'Regan said that the 18 organisations had come on board without obligation, and that this kind of collaborative effort and dedication towards improving city life is going to be paramount in the coming years.</p><p>Cork people would be shocked to hear that air pollution in the city can exceed that of London on some days of the year, she said.</p><p>However, transforming Cork will require buy-in from individuals, she and the panel of speakers concluded.</p><p>The local authority's chief executive Ann Doherty said that cities such as Cork had to have courage when it comes to making politically difficult choices in communities.</p><p>The trade-off from some gardens in existing homes being downsized to make way for bus lanes may be a difficult choice, but the upside of pollution-free communities unencumbered by traffic gridlock and thriving biodiversity could bring communities along, she said.</p><p>The covid pandemic proved to be a learning experience of what is important to people, she said, but conversations need to be had at a local level.</p><p>UCC associate professor in environmental engineering and future sustainability, Marguerite Nyhan, said that there was a saying that the battle for decarbonising is to be won and lost in cities.</p><p>She also said that while there are big challenges ahead, there are also vast opportunities to invest in green infrastructure that will lead to creating better and healthier cities.</p><p>There remains lots of work to be done around behaviou ral and societal changes, Ms Nyhan added.</p><p>Chief executive of ESB, Paddy Hayes, told the event that Cork is primed to be one of the country's most strategic places for the coming offshore and green-hydrogen revolutions.</p><p>His organisation is \"absolutely determined\" to get out of the coal-fired power station at Moneypoint in Co Clare by 2025, he said.</p><p>While there has been a \"lot of work\" on the east coast when it comes to offshore wind, there has not yet been as much off the south and west, where Cork will play a major role, he said.</p><p>The opportunities lie not just in fixed offshore infrastructure but also in floating facilities, he added.</p><p>Large-scale energy storage will also need to come into the picture, with green hydrogen a \"frontrunner\" when it comes to renewable energy in the future, according to Mr Hayes.</p><p>While many countries have been out in front for years on renewable energy infrastructure, there are advantages to only scaling up now, he said.</p><p>The technology has moved on rapidly even from six or seven years ago, he said, meaning Ireland can be at the forefront of the advances rather than relying on older models.</p><p>According to the WEF, cities \"are the frontline in tackling climate change\".</p><p>Cities house more than half of the people in the world and account for in excess of two-thirds of global emissions, yet they cover only 3% of the planet's land surface, it said.</p><p>It has been projected that by 2050, over two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities, and changes need to happen now to reduce emissions and deliver resilient and equitable urban ecosystems, according to the WEF.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Examiner", "instances": ["The covid pandemic proved to be a learning experience of what is important to people, she said, but conversations need to be had at a local level.
