Mr Forristal said the cost of establishing a crop using 120mm min-till was about  135/ha, 67% of the cost of plough-based systems ( 200), and direct drilling costs were about  60, only 30% of plough-based systems.</p><p>Mr Forristal said the Knockbeg experiment was begun in the early 2000s, when interest in alternative establishment systems had grown, due to potential labour, work rate, cost, crop, and soil-structure benefits.</p><p>\"We needed to validate some of these claims under a long-term trial system to capture the cumulative effects. More recently, we have incorporated environmental metrics, such as soil carbon and greenhouse-gas emissions in to our work\".</p><p>The effect of the establishment system (plough versus min-till and straw incorporation) was quantified over a seven-year trial, where continuous winter wheat was the main crop.</p><p>Further research studies at Knockbeg evaluated various nitrogen-application strategies for conventional or min-till systems, and a nine-year study assessed the impact of cultivations and rotations.</p><p>Ploughing resulted in the best average yield overall, followed closely by shallow ploughing, min-till, and strip-till, in that order.

The sauna scene has changed utterly in the last six years, and new saunas are opening almost every week to keep up with the demand. But Shirley is still pioneering new practices in Irish sweating culture. In recent times, Bosca Beatha has become a training hub for pirtis, the Lithuanian style of sauna, which is designed to awaken and delight all the senses by bringing the forest, flora and fauna into the heat. Shirley offers pirtis sessions to groups and individuals.

The days of easy handover to the next   usually more progressive   generation are largely gone. Inconsistent income levels undermine many family farms; which often struggle with lack of available labour. There is no silver-bullet solution, but scientists at Maynooth University are applying a breadth of thinking and innovation with a view to putting farming on a surer footing.</p><p>The ultimate aim, says Prof Gerry Lacey, head of the department of electronic engineering, is to optimise yields and resource use  while delivering a resilient ecosystem that nurtures soil health, biodiversity and long-term environmental vitality .</p><p> Our vision is to develop robotics technology that is suited to the Irish farming environment and Irish climate,  he adds.  We re also working closely with farmers and with companies who are in the agribusiness to understand what their needs are and develop a technology that will allow farmers to solve various different issues about being able to plant earlier in the year, when the ground is wetter, because the robots are lighter. </p><p>A key priority too is to use robots with  sensing solutions  to monitor and manage crop cultivation and to deploy vertical solar panels.

We ve looked at what are the kind of problems that farmers have, and we ve tried to address those problems that are top of their minds.</p><p> Soil compaction is a big one, making the machines easy to modify and to use as much of the existing equipment as possible, rather than giving them kind of a shrink-wrapped, shiny solution. It s something that they can repair if needed, that they have more agency when it comes to that robot,  Lacey adds.</p><p>This is part of a project called Aura, which co-funded by Enterprise Ireland and Comex McKinnon.</p><p>When it comes to renewable energy, using solar in farm settings is much easier, rather than  mechanically trickier  wind.</p><p> There s no moving parts in a solar panel, so that means they re much easier to maintain. They re relatively low to the ground, so particularly in the vertical solar panels they re very, very easy to install. It s basically a fence,  he says.</p><h>Upright panels with flexible roles </h><p/><h>They are investigating with farmers the effectiveness of vertical solar, ie upright panels that cover only 10 per cent of the land compared with a traditional solar farm. Agrivoltaic systems may not be as efficient compared with the raw energy outputs of turbines, but they are cheaper to install and maintain.</h><p>Dramatic reduction in solar panel prices has coincided with them becoming more flexible. Researchers are looking at possible roles as hedgerows /fences in farm fields with double-facing solar panels generating power while acting as windbreaks for crops and livestock.</p><p>Reducing excessive shading of plants is critical. Scientists in Austria and Denmark have devised two-sided prototypes for use in vertical rows in fields, which maximises space for farming while allowing solar generation during the morning and evening if panels face east and west, which avoids shading when the sun is at its highest. </p><p>In France, flexible panels are used to protect crops including vines which are vulnerable to hail and frost.</p><p>Lacey is evaluating Irish crop growth while integrating robotics with vertical panels, allowing farmers to manage the space around them optimally.

Comfrey is a plant native to Ireland, which grows in ditches and hedgerows. </p><p>And it was in the hedgerows of his parents' farm near Roscrea that Luke's projected originated. \"I had heard comfrey is high in nitrogen, and I researched it further and found that some gardeners use it, but there's no research on it on a full agricultural scale,\" he says. \"Most farmers would be familiar with comfrey. It's a perennial plant that grows around the edges of fields on most farms. It's quite a large, broad-leafed green plant with purple and blue flowers.\"  \"  Luke's project started in January las year, researching the plant and its structure and its relationship with the environment, then he carried out field trials. \"There was comfrey growing on the farm, so I harvested the leaves and stalks in March and decomposed them down to a liquid and mulch and used the liquid as a fertiliser,\" he says.  His study compared comfrey against artificial fertilisers, focusing on its impact on soil health, crop yield and environmental sustainability. Trials on the family farm demonstrated that comfrey improves soil structure, enhances organic matter and reduces nitrate runoff by 16.7pc, lowering CO2 emissions by 10.6pc compared to artificial fertilisers.  Combining comfrey with slurry further enhanced its effectiveness, providing a practical and sustainable solution to regenerative farming challenges in Ireland, Luke says. \"My dad, David, runs a beef and tillage farm on the Offaly border. It's an interest of mine to put science towards farming to see if we can make it more efficient and sustainable,\" Luke says. \"I wanted to test it combined with slurry and biochar and different things like that.

She's talking about a holiday to the \"spectacular and beautiful\" Bahamas she and her sister Peaches took last year. The sisters spent idyllic childhoods there, and have a half-sister and half-brother who still live in the Caribbean. (\"Our dad was married several times,\" says Domini.) Peaches is the older of the two and, while they look quite different, the sisters spend so much time together that they finish each other's sentences. If Domini is slightly distracted and checks her phone frequently, it's understandable. She's about to become a grandmother. (A few days later, Lauren, the eldest of her two daughters, gives birth to a baby girl).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a weird thing,\" she says, \"because it's wonderful but, at the same time, I'm thinking, 'Does my child really have to go through this?'\" The sisters came to be born in the Bahamas because that's where their Scottish father, Roy, and Dublin mother, Val, met.</p><p>\"Our dad was an accountant, and our mum travelled out as an au pair to mind children,\" says Peaches. \"The Bahamas is a very beautiful place to grow up. We came to Ireland on holiday every summer.\"</p><p>Roy died in 1982, when Peaches was 17 and Domini only 10. \"He'd had health issues for quite some time,\" says Domini, \"but he was only 57. Our whole world was turned upside down.\"</p><p>Val decided to bring her daughters back to Ireland and the family settled in Meath.</p><p>\"I was supposed to go back to the US, where I'd been to high school, for university but I ended up enrolling in Alix Gardner's cookery school and qualifying there,\" says Peaches. \"It was intended to be a stopgap, but my family - Mum and Dom - were here, and I had no real ties on that side of the Atlantic any more. Really our home was in Europe.\"</p><p>Initially, Peaches found it hard to settle; she missed her friends.</p><p>\"But Ireland is a small place and you can meet people very quickly. There was a racetrack in The Bahamas, and Mum was always trying to train young horses and sell them on, and Dom and I were always around horses; we were all horse crazy. When we moved back to Ireland, Mum did well buying and selling horses. I was doing showjumping and met my future husband through horse racing. So I formed a lot of friendships quite quickly.\"</p><p>For Domini, the transition was more difficult. \"When we first came back, I went to Headfort boarding school for the first year. Dad had just died, I was coming from a very warm tropical climate into a very \u2026 different sort of place. It was a real shock and I struggled. I was so homesick.</p><p>\"If you said nowadays you were sending your kids to boarding school at 10 or 11, people would think you were cruel, but it was par for the course back then. I went home at weekends, but Sunday nights were awful \u2026 you'd be home, eating something lovely and the fire would be lit and all you could think about was having to go back.</p><p>\"Of course, I'd manufacture tummy pains or headaches to delay the 7pm departure time. One night, Peaches dropped me and drove off and I ran down the drive chasing after the car in the dark. I was so miserable. Eventually, I got over it; I still have friends from there and we do laugh about the horror of it. Headfort was a great school, but Alex [Alexandra College, where she went to secondary school], was like summer camp in comparison.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Peaches was dividing her time between horses and catering, and had married. She drafted teenage Domini and her friends in to help out waitressing at events - 'cheap labour', she admits. Domini would sometimes help with the cooking; Peaches remembers her being very good from a young age, even without any formal training.</p><p>\"She was a natural, she'd picked it up from Mum, who'd gone to Cathal Brugha Street but conveniently forgot how to cook once we knew how.\"</p><p>Domini had no interest in school and, when she left, having competed at junior level and represented Ireland in the hunter pony category, tried to make a go of an equestrian career, but found it hard to make the transition to senior level competition. She worked for a Grand Prix showjumper in the US, bought and sold horses, did some teaching and had a tack shop.</p><p>\"I was always trying to hustle because the horses were expensive. I tried to get sponsorship but, in the end, had to accept that continuing wasn't practical. I lacked that killer streak and was too soft to make a career out of it.\"</p><p>She took herself off to Leith's Cookery School in London for a year to get a qualification.</p><p>\"I thought I'd make a career in restaurants and cooking,\" she says. \"I went out to Atlanta to cook during the 1996 Olympics. And then I came back to Ireland and ended up meeting Conrad [Gallagher]. And that was that.\"</p><p>Conrad Gallagher's Peacock Alley had just moved from Baggot Street to South William Street, and Ireland's first celebrity chef - known for his 'tall' food - was in need of help. Depending on the day, Domini was in the kitchen or front of house, running the office, doing whatever needed to be done.</p><p>\"Conrad was an exciting young chef who had landed on the scene and people wanted recipes. He got a book deal, and I looked after all the parts of the business that you don't have time for if you're an owner-operator. The publicity was plentiful and there was always a splash about everything - Conrad was very visible in a way that was unusual at the time, a great presence and a great personality. I was trying to harness that and it was a lot of everything.\"</p><p>Domini and Conrad were together for three intense years, during which they had their daughter, Lauren, won a Michelin Star and moved the restaurant to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was all too much.</p><p>When the couple went their separate ways, Peaches and her husband, who were also in business together, were splitting up too. Having always been close, the sisters grew even closer as they supported each other through difficult times and tried to figure out how they might work together.</p><p>\"It was a natural progression,\" says Peaches, \"to do something together. A no-brainer. We didn't have to think twice.\"</p><p>And so Itsa Bagel was born. Domini wanted a daytime business that would allow her to be at home with her young daughter in the evenings, and they both felt there was a dearth of casual eateries in Dublin. Bagels were something they'd enjoyed in New York and thought would go down well in Ireland.</p><p>\"We felt we could do something a bit different, and do some really gorgeous fillings that weren't just sliced red cheddar,\" says Peaches. \"That's where our cooking skill came into it because we were making everything fresh each day on site in this tiny kitchen. We started out with the two of us in December of 1999, and suddenly there were five of us in there and we were churning out an enormous amount of food.\"</p><p>Itsa Bagel's first home was in the Epicurean Food Hall, home to an eclectic bunch of food entrepreneurs before Dublin had anything approaching what you might call a food scene, and just across the road from the smart Itsa Bagel in Arnotts on Abbey Street, where we are meeting.</p><p>Initially, they imported frozen bagels from H&amp;H in New York, but realised how vulnerable their supply was during the Iraq war when the frozen containers were commandeered for food for US troops. They partnered with McCloskey's Bakery in Drogheda,</p><p>who have supplied them with bagels ever since. Itsa Bagel's core range has remained unchanged in 25 years, though they have made tweaks to the fillings in deference to changing tastes. At (EURO)7.75 ,th e Clu b- chicken, bacon, Wicklow brie, red onion relish, tomato, lettuce, mayo and butter - remains Itsa Bagel's biggest seller; the price compares well to that of other lunch options around the city.</p><p>\"We've always kept it affordable,\" says Peaches. \"We've survived the dotcom bubble, the recession, Covid. It does feel like people are getting more price sensitive now though, and that's a hard thing for businesses to be able to juggle.\"</p><p>When carbs began to fall out of favour, the sisters had already begun to diversify, and where once there were multiple Itsa Bagel outlets, now there is just the one. But the sisters are partners in Feast, run by Peaches, which operates the Commons cafe in MoLi, provides the food in the Royal College of Physicians Ireland, and has a big wedding catering operation at Powerscourt. Their B2B operation makes sandwiches, salads and some goodies for Butlers Chocolate cafes.</p><p>Separately, Domini is CEO of Valence Hospitality, where her business partner is Brian Montague of the Winding Stair Group, which operates Nancy Hands pub on Parkgate Street and Lottie's restaurant in Rathmines.</p><p>Between these businesses, Peaches and Domini employ 130 people (85 at Feast/Itsa Bagel and 45 at Valence) and share some services such as procurement, health and safety and HR, tapping into economies of scale. Peaches, who got the accountancy gene from her father, looks after the financial side of the business.</p><p>\"We've learned, over the years, just how important speedy financial information is. You have to be on it. That way, you see the trends very quickly. It's about making sure you give good quality and good service, and that the margins are there. It has been hard because the cost of everything is rising.</p><p>\"When you look at all the obligations hospitality business owners have, with additional bills for everything from outdoor seating to the grease trap licence, it's not surprising there's a sense of fatigue. It's a hard business and we're seeing people being driven out of the sector because they've just had enough. Perhaps because we've weathered so many storms, we know you can never take your foot off the gas, or allow yourself to be overwhelmed with things that come and hit you. It is just part and parcel of being in business and changing economic tides.\"</p><p>After working together for so many years, the Kemp sisters appear to be blessedly free of the tensions plaguing so many other family businesses, and after a quarter of a century in business together, neither is thinking about retirement.</p><p>\"I know this sounds cheesy,\" says Peaches, \"but I love it all. I really do. I love the different aspects of the business. I love the team, I love working with them. And when you've been doing it as long as we have, you know the things to avoid and the things that work. Personally, I'm in a great space, loving what I do and loving every day.

Planting cover crops earlier in the season and employing multi-species mixtures will foster resilience against pest pressures. Integration of livestock The ancient practice of integrating livestock into arable rotations is gaining renewed interest, as it can enhance overall soil health and productivity.

On the top part was a picture of chickens inside a straw-bedded house labelled 'barn-fed eggs' in the middle was a picture of caged chickens labelled 'organic eggs' and on the bottom part was 'pasture-fed eggs', with hens happily pecking grass outside.</p><p>Obviously organic hens are not caged or permanently housed. Yet this post had garnered so many likes and favourable comments from people who clearly didn't understood the hoops farmers jump through to become organic or even Bord Bia certified. 'Pasture-fed' and 'regenerative farming' are just well-meaning buzzwords without any certification backing in Ireland. In the UK and America, they've started trying to develop standards but they are still a long way off any worldwide or even EU-wide agreement.</p><p>And I'll give you an example of why consumers falling for these buzzwords is dangerous.</p><p>One of our social media reels was outlining how few organic dairy farmers there are in Ireland and a comment in the response section said \"even fewer regenerative farmers\". Well, don't worry anonymous internet commentator: because there is zero credential vetting of 'regenerative farming', I can now start calling the farm a 'regenerative' organic micro-dairy and be as rare as a dairy rainbow unicorn.</p><p>Of course, because of this lack of verification the term 'regenerative' has been hijacked by big corporations cashing in on consumer gullibility. You now have everyone from Mc- Donald's to Nestl\u00e9 claiming that they are supporting farmers who take up regenerative farming.</p><p>Don't think this is just an issue for organic farmers - anything with a Bord Bia logo in a shop is also likely to be met with a sigh of, \"but is it regenerative?\".</p><p>It's clearly something Bord Bia is monitoring, since a page of their website is dedicated to it, with the statistic that 72pc of customers in the US say it's important when choosing a supplier that they are \"supporting regenerative agriculture programmes and the promotion of healthy soils\".</p><p>The 'regenerative consumer community' are the ones with the money in their pockets willing to splash out on this buzzword. Waitrose, the supermarket Mecca for the UK middle class, has bought into the regenerative term in a big way.</p><p>Anyone who watched Clarkson's Farm will be familiar with the renowned DJ turned farmer Andy Cato who co-founded a company called Wildfarmed. Waitrose now stocks their bread and they're taking off in other shops and restaurants too.</p><p>In fairness, they have developed regenerative standards that their farmer suppliers have to meet, and I have nothing against trying to find a way to improve farming to help nature and make money for farmers.</p><p>However, the term 'regenerative' is still cavorting freely around its own version of the Wild West.</p><p>For example, here is what Bord Bia says regenerative farming is: \"An agricultural system that puts more back into the environment and society than it takes out.</p><p>\"By naturally reintroducing carbon and nutrient resources back into the land, this approach can support ecosystem health, mitigate climate change, and support farmers and their livelihoods through more reliable growing yields.\"</p><p>What farmer doesn't agree with that? Maybe we're all regenerative farmers, except I feel like the true advocates of the regenerative area would take issue with us all jumping on the regenerative bandwagon. So maybe they should introduce a certification body before we all start sticking the term on our labels.</p><p>As it is, I might as well tell the team to put it on our social media and website if that's what consumers want.

Organic farmers are permitted to till their fields, to kill weeds and fertilise without artificial chemicals. Regenerative farmers, on the other hand, of which most are believers in min till, may feel that it's less damaging to sometimes spray their fields than to disturb the soil with a plough.</p><p>Among the speakers that discussed these differences was Richard Perkins, one of the world's best-known regenerative farmers, with his YouTube videos garnering some 14 million views.</p><p>Perkins built up his influential Ridgedale Farm on a shoestring budget in the harsh climatic, regulatory and economic conditions of Sweden.</p><p>\"The baseline for regenerative agriculture is it must be carbon sequestering and soil building,\" he said. \"If you're not building soil, you're in a degenerative situation.\"</p><p>He said there were a few areas where organic doesn't suit his business and he needs absolute flexibility of management at all times.</p><p>\"An organic broiler chicken must be 84 days old.

They said 'this is great. We can use this and all our marketing material. Fantastic. So let's talk about the price of this barley.' It was probably \u00a320/t more, or something like this. Everyone took three steps back and started shaking their head and said absolutely no way, we can't afford to do that.</p><p>\"Everyone buys into the system, but when it starts to cost them, they are not quite so keen.

Last Saturday evening, a short message came through from a Green Party colleague who had given his all over the last five years. His three words,  l ve been eliminated , spoke volumes for how we all felt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, being in a democracy somehow helps you get over that feeling. You accept the majority opinion of your peers but draw strength from those who did vote for you. The privilege of being involved in the whole process allows you to look to come back again, with lessons learned from the school of hard knocks.</p><p>One worry from this election is that the environmental agenda we seek to represent might not be able to afford a five-year delay, or that the progress we made in recent years might slow down or come to a stop. The omens in several ways are not good. Many of the candidates who topped the polls were those who have been the most climate sceptical. Sinn F\u00e9in seems to have given up on climate ambition altogether. Several of the Independents define themselves by their opposition to the green transition.</p><h>Shelved two key memos Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael are very sensitive to losing votes to those groupings, and in recent months they too have been reading the public mood and scaling back on their own level of environmental ambition. In our last Cabinet meeting they shelved two key memos, one on sustainable transport and another on clean energy, that had been years in preparation. It was like sending a signal to the Civil Service: we re taking our foot off the pedal from here.</h><p>During the election campaign they also sent out clear messages that their preference would be to enter a coalition with the Labour Party. The only interpretation is that they think Labour might be slightly less demanding partners than we have been over the last four years. That impression of course puts the Labour Party in a real bind. Do they or the Social Democrats go into government now to deliver on the climate ambition they attest to, or do they wait for a more ideal coalition arrangement?</p><p>My advice would be that we can t really afford to delay on climate action. The actions required also bring real social justice in their wake. Promoting public transport and active travel delivers both social and health gains. The carbon tax delivers most benefit to those on the lowest incomes in the poorest homes. Regenerative agriculture will bring a better future for rural Ireland. Creating new housing in attractive environments with a strong sense of community is what the Left should be about, and can be delivered at scale in the next five years.</p><p>You are not going against the tide when you are fighting for climate action in government. The clean energy revolution is well under way and is not going to stop. Europe and Ireland are not going to regain competitiveness from burning imported fossil fuels. The only strategy that gives us real economic security and well-paid jobs is the  Green new deal  that has been legislated for in Europe and which the new Commission is now looking to deliver.</p><p>While the world is beset by populist politics, outrageous wars and economic injustice, there is a path to peace that a small island like ours can promote to real effect. The Paris Agreement should be our North Star. Many development agencies criticised the COP29 deal done in Baku as a betrayal   but delivering a  no deal  would have been a real defeat for the Paris Agreement. We did get 195 countries to commit to raising the $1.3 trillion a year for climate investment in developing countries. That investment is the best way to reduce conflict and forced migration. It means we spend less on weapons of war and more on the UN Sustainable Development goals. </p><p>Is it not better to take on that responsibility by making sure that the centre holds left, rather than letting it veer off to the right, which is the other option the electorate has delivered in the last few days?</p><p>The environmental agenda can still also hold, because despite the Green Party s electoral reverse, research tells us that the Irish people do want to play their part in addressing the biggest challenge of our time. </p><p>The tide of public thinking in this regard has, however, been out in recent years. Delivering change is hard and rarely immediately popular. It will in time turn, perhaps all the faster under a Trump presidency in the US or should the new Irish government turn their backs on what has been started here. </p><p>It continues to be our job to remind everyone of that and give our view on every legislative and executive act. We know the system inside out, from the bottom up, and we will put that experience to good use now.

If you go right down the supply chain, most of the world s cocoa comes from small, privately owned cocoa farms in Ghana, C\u00f4te d Ivoire, Cameroon and Nigeria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">West African cocoa farms are typically no larger than two to three hectares; the size of three to four soccer pitches. This can make it difficult for farmers to earn a living income. In recent times, ageing trees, crop disease and climate risks have increased the challenges they face.</p><p>Solutions to support the farmers and boost crop yields are needed. This requires investment, education and other practical support.</p><p>The Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan was launched in 2009. To date, it has engaged more than 150,000 cocoa-farming families, building on three pillars:?better farming, aiming to improve livelihoods in communities;?better lives, aiming to improve social conditions for families; and?better cocoa, aiming to improve product sustainability.</p><p>The innovative Income Accelerator Programme builds on more than a decade of experience within the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan and aims to improve the livelihoods of cocoa-farming families, while advancing regenerative agriculture practices. The ambition also includes transforming the global sourcing of cocoa to achieve full traceability and segregation of its cocoa products.</p><h>The importance of education Launched in 2022, the Income Accelerator Programme offers financial incentives and support mechanisms to encourage cocoa farming families to take action in four critical areas: enrolling children aged six to 16 in school; adopting good agricultural practices   in this case, pruning; planting additional forest and fruit trees on the farm; and diversifying income sources beyond cocoa. </h><p>Households receive a cash transfer of EUR 100 for taking action in each of these key areas. If they complete all four elements, they receive a bonus of EUR 100, meaning they can earn up to EUR 500 additional income per year in each of the first two years. The sum is paid regardless of farm size, meaning that farmers with the smallest plots are not disadvantaged.</p><p>The funds are paid in an innovative and efficient way as households receive payments via a mobile money cash transfer. The lead woman of the household is also registered and receives half of the cash transfers offered by the Income Accelerator Programme. She receives all the schooling incentive payments.</p><p>The timing of these transfers is important. Payments are staggered across the calendar year, which allows the farmer families to better budget for how the additional money is spent.</p><h>Pruning keeps the crop healthy Let s take a more detailed look at one of the main pillars of the programme: good agricultural practices. The action required to access the incentive is to prune one hectare of land. Pruning is key to keeping the trees healthy; effective pruning can dramatically increase the quality and quantity of cocoa produced versus unpruned trees. Crop disease and pests are reduced when there is better aeration around the trees. </h><p>However, it is hard, manual work for the farmer, and they may also be reluctant to undertake a harsh pruning, which can see half of the tree cut back. By establishing subsidised, professionally trained pruning groups, Nestl\u00e9 is providing farmers with the support and education to adopt these effective ways of farming, helping them understand how and when to prune their cocoa plants properly.</p><p>A report from the early stages of the 10,000 farmer test-at-scale, published this year by Kit Royal Tropical Institute, suggests the cocoa yield levels of households in the accelerator programme increased by almost one-third   32 per cent   in the 18-month period since the commencement of the programme, while school attendance rates also saw a noticeable spike among participants  families   from 79 per cent to 89 per cent.</p><p>Overall, families in the programme saw a 38 per cent rise in their income. In general, the report said the Income Accelerator Programme had significantly enhanced cocoa productivity, increased investments, and net income, mitigated diseases and pests on cocoa farms, promoted financial access and positively influenced female empowerment and child schooling rates.</p><p>The Income Accelerator Programme continues to expand, and more than 28,000 families in C\u00f4te d Ivoire and 2,000 in Ghana are already benefiting. The goal is to expand the programme to reach an estimated 160,000 cocoa farming households globally by 2030.</p><p>Alongside the Income Accelerator Programme, Nestl\u00e9 has been working with partners including the Rainforest Alliance and Cargill to create a traceable cocoa supply chain at scale.</p><p>Early 2024 saw the first KitKat bars made with cocoa mass traceable to farmers enrolled in the Income Accelerator Programme hit the shelves, arriving in Ireland from May with new  Breaks for Good  messaging on the packaging.</p><p>The cocoa from a group of income accelerator farms is segregated and kept separate all the way along the supply chain through to the European KitKat factories.</p><p>By choosing a KitKat the next time you decide to have a break, you re choosing to support a programme that is empowering farmers to build social, and economic and environmental resilience for themselves, their families and their communities.</p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["better lives, aiming to improve social conditions for families; and? better cocoa, aiming to improve product sustainability.

A reflection of innovation and emulation, they are societal signposts that draw us together. Trends tend to look to the future, but 2024's food trends show that we - the farmers, the chefs, the producers and diners - need to continue looking to the past, to tradition and heritage. Sustainability, ecology and community are the cornerstones of how and what we eat in the year ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Plant-based food (made with actual plants)</emphasis></p><p>Nothing annoys me more than fake meat products which seem to be full of everything except vegetables. The rise of ultra-processed vegan food is not a good sign. I don't believe the laboratory is the way forward for feeding the planet a healthy and nutritious diet. One trend that I'm looking forward to is the rise of more plant-based food that is actually made from plants and vegetables. Think beans and legumes as opposed to fake bleeding burgers. In Aniar, we offer both a 23-course tasting menu for vegetarians and vegans (only using Irish ingredients). It is certainly more popular than it was in the past and is becoming more popular as the years go by. Restaurants will have to accommodate more plant-based options on their menu, not only for customers but also for the planet. There are no two ways about it: meat consumption is far more onerous for carbon emissions than vegetables. Don't get me wrong: I love a nice Irish steak but we need to find a better balance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Regenerative agriculture</emphasis></p><p>We need a better agricultural system and regenerative agriculture may be the way towards a more sustainable and greener future. While there is no absolute definition, regenerative agriculture includes practices that increase soil fertility and biodiversity. Less in opposition to natural forces, the regenerative movement attempts to work in harmony with its natural environment in a more holistic manner by preventing land degradation and deforestation, minimising soil disturbance (such as a no-dig philosophy) and integrating plants and animals on the same farm. As well as regenerative agriculture, regenerative tourism is going to play a part in how we eat and travel. Regenerative tourism seeks to ensure travel and tourism reinvest in people, places and nature and that it supports the long-term development of our social-ecological systems. Indeed, 'regeneration' itself might be the biggest trend in 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Seaweed</emphasis></p><p>Although buckwheat is tipped to trend in 2024, my money is still on seaweed becoming more a part of our own cuisine as well as other cuisines around the world. Seaweed is a superfood with high amounts of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Though it's gold for the Japanese, many of us treat it with scorn. Seaweed not only cleans the ocean water, it can also be farmed alongside other shellfish which makes it a truly sustainable practice going forward. We need more seaweed farms in Ireland to not only feed ourselves but also to produce a truly green export.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Mindful food and more visible nutrition</emphasis></p><p>While I don't think we're at the stage were we can offer yoga after your meal, being more mindful of the food that we cook and eat is rapidly changing our approach to restaurants, work place catering and dining at home. \"We are what we eat\", as Alice Waters observed in her recent book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We are What we Eat: A Slow Food Manifesto</emphasis> (2021). Being mindful includes being more conscious about the nutritional value of our food as opposed to simply how it tastes. Fast food may be tasty and convenient but its overconsumption is killing us in terms of its nutritional value and its effect on the planet. \"Fast food culture has become the dominant culture in the United States,\" Waters writes, \"and it is becoming the dominant culture in the world.\" Expect mindfulness and wellness (which ties in with more plant-based food) to be more present in both your food and its surroundings in 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. More speciality restaurants and caf\u00e9s</emphasis></p><p>As our food culture becomes more sophisticated, the line between fine dining and a chip shop is becoming blurred. This blurring of the boundaries has already happened elsewhere, from London to New York. As chefs who once worked in fine dining spaces decide to open smaller, simpler restaurants, all of a sudden we have highly sophisticated establishments that might only serve one or two things, such as toasted sandwiches, burgers, and fried chicken. With the increased cost of food and everything that goes with it (from light and heat to rent and wages), restaurants and caf\u00e9s will have to adapt to provide a more cost-effective and financially sustainable model. Simpler, smaller and more specialist menus are one way of combatting increasing costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. More technology in/with our food</emphasis></p><p>As data driven systems become a bigger part of our lives, we should expect more smart technology entering into our food system, both in the way that we order food and the way that we consume it. Eating in the age of AI is going to be a big change, though I'm not sure exactly how this is going to happen. Augmented reality (AG) could become a feature of experiential dining. It already is in some select places where the design on both the walls and the table changes with each course for an immersive dining experience. Some take-away restaurants already hold data on your ordering preferences that helps create a bespoke experience. I'm not sure if 3D menus will take off but smart menus, where you scan the item to view an image, information, and providence are certainly on the way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Sustainability</emphasis></p><p>Despite the greenwashing around sustainability, many restaurants are attempting to become more efficient in relation to their environment. At this year's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Food on the Edge</emphasis>, Elena Reygadas, one of the world's leading Mexican chefs, spoke about the role of chefs as \"interpreters\" of the natural world. Creating a deeper connection between what we do as chefs and what happens in the natural world is becoming more and more important. It is no longer enough to cook and choose to order food from wherever one wants without considering the impact it has on the environment. The transportation of food around the world is one of the leading causes of climate change and we need to look closer to home and find alternatives for all the produce we unnecessarily import.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">8. Greater experiential dining</emphasis></p><p>Eating out is a cultural act and all eating is necessarily an experience. But some restaurants go beyond the usual format to offer customers a more holistic experience with the food playing just one part of the overall event. We're all used to our food coming with stories nowadays (often linked to the chef or the producers) but I think personal storytelling is going to expand beyond the world of fine dining into more casual spaces. With more people learning the Irish language, we should expect more engagement with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gaeilge</emphasis>, from simply ordering to whole dining experiences that revolve around the language and its history.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9. Greater alternatives to alcohol</emphasis></p><p>We may still have issues with our attitude to alcohol consumption in Ireland but there is a growing change in the country towards better alternatives for nondrinkers or people simply wanting an alcohol-free night out. I have enjoyed great juice pairings in some of the best restaurants in the world (it's something we offer now in Aniar) and while I love my wine I really didn't notice the absence of alcohol. Better alternatives mean more mindful seasonal drinks with a touch of the local about them: think apple and dillisk juice or beetroot juice and woodruff. We need to put as much effort into our juice menu as we do into our wine menu (in the same way that we have to put more effort into our vegan and vegetarian dishes).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">10. Sophisticated home dining and more online experiences</emphasis></p><p>Covid changed the way in which we eat and work. While many home dining options are not as available as they once were, I believe the increased cost of doing business in larger cities will see a return to more home dining and online experiences. Private online cooking classes as well group classes are making a come back. I don't believe they will replace the actual experience but rather supplement it, particularly if people cannot travel. Imagine a pasta class in Italy in the morning followed by a demonstration from Peru from one of the world's best chefs: online of course. Online experiences can help us cut down on our air miles while still tapping into a country's rich culture. Of course, it won't replace real travel but perhaps if we replaced one of our many trips abroad with an online experience or virtual cooking class the world may be a better place.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Examiner", "instances": ["Don't get me wrong: I love a nice Irish steak but we need to find a better balance. 2.

I came across a factory that manufactures no-till drills and they had one sitting out front on the forecourt. \"I was looking at it and someone came out to sell me one so I told them I'm only a tourist and I told them my dilemma.</p><p>\"He then offered me a tour of the factory and it turned out he was the company's managing director and we ended up having a chat and a coffee in the conference room.</p><p>\"He told me he wouldn't mind exploring the possibilities of trying the drill in the northern hemisphere, with Ireland and New Zealand having a lot of similarities.</p><p>\"He asked would I be interested in a drill and I said 'sure leave it with me for the minute and I'll think about it'.</p><p>\"We got talking on email when I got back home and he ended up sending a drill across and I tried it and I ran it for 12 months and I bought it after that.</p><p>\"I sowed winter and spring crops and there was very little difference so it proved to me that it worked.</p><p>\"He rang me the following year asking would I bring my drill down to a show in Gurteen, so I gave him a hand to set up the stand and that, and at the end of that he asked me would I sell drills for him in Ireland and the UK.</p><p>\"I've sold between 50 and 60 drills in Ireland and the UK since 2016.\"</p><p>Tom sells a range of Duncan Ag no-till seed drills for all conditions and soil types, through his business, Ballinafagh Farm.</p><p>\"Since I've gone no-till, I've been very reluctant to go back to the plough. I don't want to think about it,\" he says.</p><p>\"When you talk about carbon, if you're ploughing every year, every bit of carbon you've taken in with the plant is released again the following year when you plough it, so what's the point? \"The best outcome with the plough system is that you could be standing still.</p><p>\"It's the one problem I have with the organics side of the house: they have to plough in Ireland, it's the only way they have to control weeds.</p><p>\"People will say organics is the way of the future, but it's not the answer.</p><p>\"The answer is conservation or regenerative agriculture. Any of those two farming methods would be way better for the country as a whole than organics.\"</p><p>Tom follows the main principles of conservation agriculture, which include cover cropping, increasing soil organic matter, crop rotations and direct drilling.</p><p>\"With conservation and regenerative agriculture, we both want to maintain the soil and plant health and use less synthetics. But the singular difference is that regenerative will use livestock in their farming operation.</p><p>\"Conservation ag is about good crop rotations and minimum soil disturbance. It's about green living plants in the soil all year round and getting out organic manures as much as possible on the field and replacing synthetics with organic manure as much as possible.\"</p><p>Tom has reduced the amount of synthetic inputs required on the farm and there has been no insecticide used on the land in six years.</p><p>He has two wormeries on the farm and he makes his own bio-stimulants from vermi-juice, seaweed, molasses and silica, which further build the soil biology.</p><p>\"I melt urea down into liquid form and overall I can put on 128 units of</p><p>N in total instead of 160-180 and still maintain yield,\" he says.</p><p>\"I apply that as a foliar feed. I only apply seven units of N/ac and it's probably as good as 14 units using other methods. Here's the problem, though: it needs to be straight urea and not protected. I'm trying to use less synthetics, so why would I want a urea with another enzyme, polymer, or inhibitor in it?\"</p><p>Animal manure is brought in from neighbouring farms and composted on site before being spread on the land.</p><p>There is about 30ac of mixed forestry on the farm - 60pc hardwood and 40pc softwood - and Tom operates a continuous cover forestry system since 2000.</p><p>There are also about 12ac of conservation areas on the farm. There is an acre of wetland with naturally regenerating woodland, plus 7ac of wildflowers and 4ac of permanent clover.</p><p>\"Back then in 2000, it was simple because we had set-aside and my forestry area now is my set-aside area. It just sickened me to see that land left fallow every year and not doing anything,\" he says.</p><p>\"At that time you could plant it in forestry and still qualify as set aside under the rules back then. Now 24 years later I'm taking my first thinnings from the forestry. On my farm I'm a one-man-band and that's another reason for the no till.</p><p>\"When it came to forestry and the thinning, it seemed like the only way was to get a contractor in because that's the way it's done in Ireland. That was another cheque going out the gate if I got the forester in.</p><p>\"I was getting mixed advice about which trees to take and leave. My forester gave me the best advice to try and do my own harvesting.</p><p>\"I got more involved with that idea because it's another project I could be doing myself instead of farming it out.</p><p>\"I saw a harvester head from Finland and I got it. It does exactly what the contractor's machine does - it's just slower.</p><p>\"I log the trees into three metre lengths and bring them into the farmyard. In Ireland you can sell forestry three ways; standing, out of your yard, or delivered to the user. In all cases people typically use a contractor\u2026 then they'll get paid and you'll get what's left. Straight away there's a chunk of money gone.</p><p>\"As a small farmer, I'm going to harvest it, bring it into the yard, and then in autumn I'm going to ask buyers to come look at it or I might firewood it.\"</p><p>Tom's daughter Erin is an intellectual disability nurse, and is becoming more involved in farming.</p><p>\"Erin is doing her Green Cert,\" says Tom.</p><p>\"The aim is for her to take over the farm and she is talking about social farming.

Specially designed evaporation tunnels capture the heat from the sun when it is shining, while the wind passively removes humidity within the tunnel to encourage optimal conditions for natural slow evaporation.</p><p>\"Our evaporation stage is entirely driven by and dependent on the local weather conditions. This means that we have a limited and defined harvesting season. Our decision to favour sustainability over scale commits us to a small batch process.\"</p><p>Compared to conventional seawater evaporation in colder climates (i.e. made by boiling the sea water under pressure), their passive solar evaporation process means they save significant amounts of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each harvesting season.</p><p>Moe says, \"Our slow evaporation process gently creates a mineral-rich sea salt as nature intended, delivering a distinct taste of the Dingle Peninsula with a uniquely robust tang and a sweet finish.\"</p><p>Moe continues, \"The local Atlantic Ocean is our primary raw ingredient, and we want to protect this both for our business and future generations.

This is manifesting itself on supermarket shelves where fresh fruits and vegetables previously available all year round are now in short supply at certain times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A recent report prepared for the European Parliament studied how phenomena such as heatwaves, cold spells, heavy rain, flooding, landslides, droughts, wildfires and storm surges are impacting growers. The picture that emerges is of a rise in extremely hot summer temperatures over all of Europe, progressively drier conditions in the south of the Continent, and an increase in heavy rainfall in northern and central European regions.</p><p> The magnitude of these increases is concerning,  the report states.  The number of climatological heatwave days will see at least a fivefold increase by the end of the century in the coolest climates, and up to 30 times more in warmer climates. Drought severity in southern Europe could triple by the end of the century. </p><p>Losses specific to the agriculture sector already account for more than 60 per cent of drought-linked losses, or around EUR 5 billion annually. This is projected to increase in the future.</p><p> Vulnerable sub-sectors include non-irrigated cereals, and specifically maize, fruit trees and perennials, tubers grown in regions with heavy precipitation extremes, and livestock for its dependence on green fodder,  the report warns.</p><p>Some of this has already come to pass. Farm associations here are warning of a potato shortage later this summer, a result of high rainfall and waterlogged fields. But the impact of climate change is felt across a range of crops, from late frosts freezing spring buds and curtailing harvests to extreme heat at flowering time preventing grain formation. All such shocks send shudders up the supply chain.</p><h>Impact </h><p> Recent changes in weather patterns globally and here on the island of Ireland are having a significant impact upon the fresh produce supply chain. The impact is manifesting itself through numerous ways including later planting, lower farm yields, product shortages and thus country-of-origin sourcing decisions,  says Neal Johnston, business consulting partner in supply chain and operations at EY.</p><p> For example, it is likely this year that we may see salad produce from US growers on our supermarket shelves. This is produce that would typically have been sourced from our own domestic Irish production along with some European countries. While widespread shortages are not foreseen at this time there may well be some isolated exceptions, such as potatoes or broccoli, as Irish farmers will have struggled to achieve their second planting of the year which may lead to availability challenges later in the year. </p><p>Despite these challenges, Johnston believes there are clear indications in the marketplace that the consumer is increasingly seeking out fresh produce.</p><p> Industry indicators from independent bodies point to double-digit growth in fresh produce sales across the Irish supermarket retailers. While inflation contributes to this growth, there is also volume growth within it,  he explains.</p><p> As fresh produce is typically a promoted category within the supermarket network, the end consumer is experiencing some degree of shielding from the cost inflation. </p><p>But that looks set to change, says Johnston, who cautions:  The macro trends of supply chain disruption and extreme weather indicate that further cost inflation will be seen in the category, which will likely be felt by the consumer in prices on the shelf. </p><h>Consolidation</h><p> At industry level, additional costs such as those imposed by new Brexit arrangements are encouraging consolidation among fruit and veg producers into  bigger and bigger businesses,  says Donna Marshall, professor of supply chain management at UCD.  Small players are being crowded out by these regressive costs,  she adds.</p><p>The resulting  industrial level  production of fruit and veg is in itself a real worry  for a country, for a community, and a micro trader,  she says.  Traditional artisanal and family companies are just getting pushed out. </p><h>Tension </h><p>But consumers are pushing back.  There is a real tension now between big agriculture and demand from consumers for artisanal local produce. There is also a real tension between how governments view food security   a volume-driven legacy of the second World War   and what consumers are demanding. Historically it is the education and understanding from consumers that pushes the industry to change,  she says.</p><p>That includes growing consumer demand for produce that is in season, local and with minimal or no use of pesticides and industrial chemicals.</p><p> I want my food to be as fresh and natural as possible. It is not volume that consumers value, it is health and nutrition, which is why we are seeing a backlash against volume production and industrial farming,  says Marshall.</p><p> It s about, how do we create regenerative agriculture? One that is much closer to the local communities who have the knowledge and the passion for it. </p><p>Navigating the twin forces of climate change and changing consumer demand requires nothing less than a  reimagination of the industry  she says,  because the current incentives that drive it are not working. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["I want my food to be as fresh and natural as possible.

If we are, we are failing miserably at it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coming out of Covid in 2021, the Government set an ambitious target of getting 2.5 million people back in work by this year. The latest CSO figures show that by the end of 2023, 2.7 million people were employed in Ireland. While we still have significant challenges in housing and health, there is no doubt that our economic performance is raising living standards. In 2023, the median household income topped (EURO)55,000 and the rate of consistent poverty fell to 3.6pc, the lowest on record.</p><p>The health of our economy is feeding through to our public finances. The Central Bank estimates we are on track for a budgetary surplus of more than (EURO)30bn by 2026. Last week, Cabinet approved the establishment of two new funds into which we will invest this surplus, protecting us against an ageing population, economic downturns and the climate and biodiversity crises to come.</p><p>This success has come despite massive challenges affecting the entire Western world. Following the war in Ukraine, natural gas prices peaked at more than 10 times their pre-pandemic levels, and the price of oil almost doubled.</p><p>I am proud our party spearheaded the response to these challenges, supporting every household with (EURO)1,250 of energy credits, cutting public transport fares for the first time in 75 years, and halving childcare fees. These measures were accompanied by a series of tax and social welfare interventions which meant every budget by this Government has helped the poorest most. Thanks to such actions, the acute phase of that crisis has now passed. Choosing not to go Green would be economically reckless. It is cheaper to save the world than to destroy it and that is what is now at risk. Every scientist of note is raising the red alert about the dramatic change in our climate in the last year. Global sea and air temperatures, concentrations of emissions and indicators about the health of our natural systems are all going off the charts.</p><p>The one hope is that the green solutions to these threats are also unfolding with unexpected speed. A solar revolution, a switch to sustainable transport and the rise of regenerative agriculture are all now at hand. This is where all the jobs and investment are going and what we are increasingly good at as a country. Last year public transport numbers went up by 24pc, renewable power increased by about a fifth and the use of nitrogen fertilisers dropped by 27pc.</p><p>Provisional figures suggest that our emissions fell by 5pc last year, while our economy continued to grow ahead of our international competitors.</p><p>Each of the main contentions in Conor's article is either wildly inaccurate or misleading at best.</p><p>It is not true that we are opposed to the provision of new water supplies to Dublin and the eastern region; we know we will need it because of the weather extremes that climate change will bring.</p><p>It is true that our electricity prices are high compared to some other countries, but the main reason for that has been our historic dependence on imported fossil fuels, not the development of our own local renewable power, which we are delivering at speed and scale.</p><p>It is also true that under this Government there has been a significant increase in spending on active travel and public transport. For decades we neglected both. This is why we have such bad congestion in our car-dominated towns and cities.</p><p>It is simply incredible that the former head of planning in the Dublin Institute of Technology seems to be opposed to such sensible spatial and transport planning. It is even more bizarre he seems to argue we should ignore the conditions already set by An Bord Plean\u00e1la with regard to the development of Dublin Airport. Does he want us to go back to the bad old days when the corruption of our planning system cost us all so dearly?</p><p>My party is working to ensure that Ireland gains an early mover advantage in this Green transition. In the same way that we advanced our economy by going from a closed economic model to an open one under the economic plans set by TK Whitaker and Se\u00e1n Lemass in the 1960s, we now need to switch from an unsustainable to a sustainable model. If Ireland and Europe fall behind on this leap forward, we risk undermining our economic competitiveness as much as our natural systems.</p><p>We can prepare to benefit from the challenges of the future or we can cling to the ways of the past. In my view, the regressive assertions in last week's article are the real \"wrecking balls\" and the surest ways to hobble this country's economy and our people for decades.

While the problem of rising water may seem insurmountable during the flood event, the causes are surprisingly straightforward. These are twofold; in-creased rainfall and reduced catchment storage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In terms of rainfall, global weather systems are in turmoil. In addition to increases in Irish annual rainfall over the past 30 years, individual rainfall events have changed in character. We have been seeing storms of greater rainfall intensity as well as longer duration - both of which contribute to flooding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the sheer scale of climate breakdown may appear too big to do anything about, bear in mind that it is our collective decisions and actions - namely an over-reliance on fossil energy - that caused the problem; and similarly a collective step-down from fossil energy can reverse this trend. Meanwhile we need something we can do now to help prevent flooding next year and the year after. Fortunately solutions are there in abundance; specifically increasing the water storage in our river catchments wherever flooding is a problem. Not just the river; but the land covering the entire catchment.</p><p>Over the past 70 years and more, we have steadily and relentlessly reduced the ability of the landscape to hold water. Woods have been felled, wetlands and wet fields drained, hedges cleared, floodplains developed for roads and housing. Even the organic matter content of our farms has been steadily depleted by excessive soil disturbance and nitrogen fertilisers.</p><p>The consequences for water are fourfold. Firstly, the catchment response is faster; ie a shorter interval between rain falling on the land and water reaching the watercourse. Secondly, there is a larger peak volume of water from the rainfall event. Thirdly, a greater total volume of rainfall actually reaches the watercourse rather than being stored or evaporated en route. These three impacts not only lead to flooding, but also to droughts. The fourth impact is on water quality. The faster water runs off a catchment, the more pollution it carries with it and the less filtration it receives as it goes, so the quality of our waterways falls.</p><p>But where wetlands, woodlands and hedgerows have been lost, they can be replaced. Even though it has taken us many decades to arrive at our current predicament, positive changes can take place surprisingly quickly. I have seen new catchment-scale wetland projects take effect almost from the time of construction. Even modest storm-water wetlands can be built in a day beside car parks, roads, farm yards and industrial areas to soak up flood water and release it slowly into groundwater or local streams.</p><p>Within the stream and river channels we can install leaky log dams and brash dams, such as carried out in the successful flood prevention scheme in Pickering in North Yorkshire, where regular flooding stopped after a broad suite of nature based solutions were introduced. We can build artificial beaver dams.</p><p>We could bring back beavers (the jury is still out as to whether they were native to Ireland or not, but there is absolutely no arguing with their flood management skills).</p><p>Reestablishment of woodlands takes longer, but with careful drain management, new forestry projects and urban woodlands can be designed to greatly reduce runoff from the outset. Long term, the flood control effect of woodlands is tremendous. Native trees are particularly well suited to flood prevention because they are deeper rooted, providing more storage for water, and they are better suited to continuous cover forestry than conifers, which are typically clear-felled, exposing soil to erosion and rivers to pulse flows of flood water during storms.</p><p>Within our fields, we can replace hedgerows, particularly along the contours of sloping land so that any runoff from fields, whether close to the river or not, flows to the hedge and has time to soak into the soil. A Welsh study of the Pontbren farming project found that water soaked into the ground a full 67 times more effectively on fenced wooded land than on grazed pasture. That's all potential space to hold runoff water beneath contour hedgerows, fenced from livestock so the soil stays light and porous.</p><p>The ground beneath our feet holds more potential than we tend to appreciate. By increasing the soil organic carbon content we can build humus, which holds up to 20 times its own weight in water. This is a twofold process: Firstly cut back/ out high artificial nitrogen inputs which strip soil organic carbon and denude the soil of humus.</p><p>Secondly, compost farm yard manure into a stable humus form instead of using liquid slurry as a waste management tool. What this takes is to invest in technologies at government level that actively build soil carbon rather than those that denude it. Paradoxically, as well as increasing water holding capacity, increased soil organic matter also improves drainage, making farming easier and more productive on heavy or compacted soils.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture techniques such as reduced soil disturbance, continuous cover cropping, reduced chemical inputs and managed grazing techniques have been shown to build soil carbon and improve crop health. Working with trees on the farm using agro-forestry and silvopasture can greatly increase the moisture holding capacity of the soil, as well as providing valuable habitat, shelter belts and diversified income streams such as fruit and nut crops, firewood or timber crops. Tree cover also supports pollinators, which pollinate our crops; and shelters predator species which can then keep pests in check naturally.</p><p>Building soil organic matter also contributes greatly to sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Instead of agriculture being the biggest contributor of greenhouse gasses in Ireland we can make it one of our greatest assets in addressing climate change.</p><p>So what's the next step? Flooding, like climate change, is a symptom of many ills. The remedy needs to be similarly multifaceted.</p><p>At government level, we urgently need to provide incentives for farmers to protect and introduce wetlands, woodlands and other natural land-based flood defence measures, rather than penalising farmers for having excessive \"unproductive\" areas. We need to update forestry policy to include flood control as a central consideration. Planning policy that keeps new developments off floodplain areas is an absolute minimum requirement.</p><p>In flood prone catchments, all existing paved areas should have new natural flood amelioration measures introduced wherever possible. This can be as simple and beautiful as a garden pond or town park wetland; or lowlying parkland that can flood in wet weather and return to a park or a playing field again afterwards.</p><p>On a community level, we can team up with the local farmers and land owners and introduce habitat, buffer zones, ponds and the like in catchments that are at risk, such as the Owen-acurra catchment that flows into Midleton. LAWPro, the Local Authorities Waters Programme has recently announced a new round of funding for community projects of this sort, so it's an ideal time to meet with neighbours and discuss the possibilities. Many farming groups around the country are familiar with the EIP (European Innovation Partnership) projects which have provided assistance and expertise on farm scale measures. Check with your local farm advisors about either joining or setting up such a scheme in your catchment area.</p><p>Individually in our farms we can build ponds and wetlands, plant hedgerows and woodlands, we can compost and investigate regenerative agriculture techniques. In our urban areas we can build rain gardens to hold water, garden ponds to take roof runoff, compost to build our soil organic carbon levels in our own gardens. Many tidy towns groups around the country are leading the way with introducing SUDS (Sustained Urban Drainage Systems) in their local areas to catch urban runoff and reduce both flooding and pollution.</p><p>There are so many ways to start that it can be both daunting and exciting - so the trick is to choose the one that looks easiest and jump in. Then take it from there and soon it becomes habit forming. Whether the issue is the biodiversity crisis, climate breakdown or flooding, all routes lead back to habitat restoration and land-based solutions. The solutions are there. It's time to start implementing them.</p><p>* F\u00e9idhlim Harty is an environmental consultant, writer and speaker.

It is too expensive for him to produce to use as animal feed so all his production is for food.</p><p>He intends to keep trying it each year and to continue learning - and believes that consumers are beginning to choose quinoa over other protein sources for health benefits. It is enjoyed as an addition to salads and soups, or as porridge and cereal, amongst other uses.

You're smart enough. You can get the points. You can do whatever you want. Why would you do this?' Luckily, my parents told me to do whatever would make me happy, and if it didn't make me happy, I could change.</p><p>\"When I started at MTU, there were 80 in my year of level 6 culinary studies.

But all those courses are struggling to get the numbers now. They're tough, between working and studying, because in this industry, unfortunately, you have to be working. You can't do four years in college and not have any industry experience and come out and expect to do well.\"</p><p>Moore has spent most of her working life in Cork. While she was running the kitchen at another Cork restaurant, Elbow Lane, where she became head chef at the tender age of 23,  the owners spotted a gap in the market and suggested they open a fish restaurant together. \"It wasn't that I had a burning desire to work primarily with fish,\" she says, \"but I'm really happy it happened that way.\"</p><p>From the outset, Moore was determined to take the whole-catch approach, and for the menu at Goldie to feature both sustainable species of fish and parts of the fish that are generally spurned by Irish restaurants. Almost all the fish served at Goldie is landed by the boats coming into Ballycotton, and you won't find salmon on the menu, because Moore can't countenance the controversial farming methods used. She makes an exception, perhaps, once a year, when she gets a wild salmon and sells it below cost just to give her customers the experience of eating something truly special.</p><p>\"The Irish customer loves monkfish,\" she says, \"so if I put monkfish on the menu, no matter what day of the week it is, we will sell out. But we can only get so much of it, so we're always going to sell out of it and I want to use other species too. So it can be a struggle to communicate that. I try to write the menu as best as I possibly can so that we don't run out as quickly as we do, but it is a balancing act to manage people's expectations and make sure that there's enough variety and choice.\"</p><p>Pollock, for instance, is a hard sell. \"It divides people,\" says Moore. \"Personally, I really like it. Because we buy in whole fish, we get to see what the fish is eating, and that does affect how it tastes. And pollock always has sea truffle in its mouth and its gills, and I'm convinced that is one of the reasons why I like it so much. But a lot of people just say, 'No, absolutely not.' I tend to put it on with our best sauce, the one that I think will appeal to the most people, so they'll think, 'I want that sauce, so I'll have the pollock.' It's a bit of clever menu writing.\"</p><p>Despite the challenges facing hospitality, and a call for tax breaks for restaurants such as Goldie, which buy locally and minimise waste, Moore is happy with the way things are going at the restaurant, which opens for dinner only, four nights a week. </p><p>For her staff, it means they have achieved the holy grail of work-life balance in the restaurant industry.</p><p>\"To be honest, we wouldn't be able to do what we do any more than four days a week. We've gotten to a stage now where I'm really happy with how business is running, our quality, our consistency, and it would take a lot for me to jeopardise that. I've missed only two services here this year, and only two last year.</p><p>\"Our customers want me to be here and I want to be here. I didn't open a restaurant to not be in it, so being here is still very much my priority. And I'd miss it too much if I wasn't. And I love people. I've discovered I love making people happy more than cooking - it takes you a while to realise what your motivation is. I love being here and we're so lucky with so many regular customers. It's a real relationship. We have customers who come here sometimes twice a week, and we're only open four days!\"</p><p>On the first Wednesday of each month, Goldie invites children in to eat fish for free.</p><p>\"It's been really fun,\" says Moore. \"You see the kids come in and they're a little bit dressed up and they'll eat nearly everything. Some of them have a full three-course meal! We've had kids eat oysters, mussels, gurnard, mackerel. Some of them are really open to it. And for the ones that aren't, we'll have a fish schnitzel, and they can have that with some chips.</p><p>\"We don't want to lecture or preach but we do try and make a bit of an effort where one of the chefs will bring a dish to the table and tell the kids about it. I just think it's great to see kids in restaurants - and we're educating the next generation of diners. Hopefully it might encourage parents to cook some fish at home, which is a hard ask for a lot of people.\"</p><p>With Goldie on an even keel, I'm curious as to whether Moore has plans for another branch or another restaurant.</p><p>\"When we were opening, I thought, for a creative person, this is the most fun thing you could ever do. There are so many outlets, from the menu to the decor to the wine. I absolutely loved it and, as soon as we were open, I said, 'I can't wait to do another one.' And I thought, 'Oh, I could do this or I could do that,' something different, not necessarily just fish.</p><p>\"But now that I've spent the last four years working with fish, I've realised that probably nobody else on the island of Ireland has the advantage that I now have so I want to make the most of that. So while I will probably do something else in the future, I'm not in a rush. And I'm not sure whether it would be another restaurant or a different kind of creative outlet.</p><p>\"Long term, I want to get into regenerative agriculture in practice and on the plate. That would be the dream for me, I suppose. I see that as the future, and I would love to have a farm at some point, but I don't have the means or the information to do that yet. But I think I can be ambitious and say I could do it in 10 years. I'm really lucky to be young.\"</p><p>With things at Goldie the way she wants them, and the book about to be published, Moore's making time to reconnect with friends who don't work in hospitality - \"people with normal jobs\", she says. She likes to spend her time off walking George (after George Michael), the Cavachon she shares with her mum, and - believe it or not - cooking.</p><p>\"Because I cook all week, when I have a day off, I do want to cook, but I want to cook exactly what I want to eat, and I want to have one thing, and I can't eat the same thing the next day.

Because if we knew that story, we might not want to buy the food,\" Holden says.</p><p>Take the fact that intensive free-range chicken farming has been allowed to proliferate, particularly in Wales, nearly doubling in size since 2011, and has been blamed for an ecological \"death spiral\" on the River Wye, where colossal levels of nutrients from manure are choking off aquatic life.</p><p>Or the fact that around half of the UK's dairy comes from cows that live permanently in massive sheds, and will never touch grass, according to industry estimates.</p><p>Or the hundreds of miles their animals are forced to travel before they are slaughtered, often with long waits at either end, because of the demise of local abattoirs as supermarkets enter into contracts with the bigger players.</p><p>Holden says he is \"telling on himself\" as much as his fellow farmers here.</p><p>\"Some of our dairy cows end up in London restaurants,\" he says. \"But the rest will sell to a haulier who will take them to an abattoir somewhere. The truth is I don't know where they end up, and that is part of a system that makes everything anonymous, including to the farmers.</p><p>\"We can't ignore it any longer, that farming is a central part of the problem.\"</p><p>What he is keen to do is lay the blame in the right place.</p><p>\"I'm not denigrating the farmers. It's not their fault,\" he says. \"They've been led down this path by a combination of policy and economics for decades. They've been sacrificed on the altar.\"</p><p>What has been lost in the move to intensification is the kind of mixed farms that the SFT and other proponents of the rising 'regenerative' farming movement advocate returning to, which combine grassland, grazing livestock and crops on a rotational system.</p><p>Holden knows he is something of a difficult interlocutor to persuade farmers, still being considered a \"wacky\"</p><p>figure in the industry.</p><p>One of four children born to a family of Oxford scholars and Anglican missionaries in south London, his mother worked at Bletchley Park (the World War II code-cracking centre) and then became a social worker, and his father was a child psychiatrist.</p><p>With no farming in his blood, it was only when his father got a job at Stanford</p><p>University in California that he started to think more deeply about the land, eventually setting up a rural commune in Wales.</p><p>\"My parents were very sweet, actually, when I decided to become a farmer,\" he says. \"They were of a generation that will never be directly open about their kids. But Dad did say to me once, 'I'm proud of you.' That meant a lot.\"</p><p>Determined to farm with as little impact on the land as possible, the commune soon realised they would struggle to turn a profit. Instead, they decided to turn their new 'organic' approach into a selling point.</p><p>\"It was a means to an end really,\" Holden says. \"Survival in what was a very difficult economic time.\"</p><p>But if he remains something of an outsider in farming, Holden has won friends in high places along the way.</p><p>In the 1980s he was asked to join a group of experts to help King Charles set up his own organic holding at Highgrove, which became the Duchy Originals brand. He has remained a friend and advisor to the King ever since, and is in touch with him regularly.</p><p>\"He's highly intuitive and a bit of a visionary in his contribution to fostering a new understanding of our relationship with nature,\" he says. \"We're not separate from nature, we're part of nature.</p><p>\"His promotion and his advocacy, before he became King, especially of sustainable agriculture, but also in many other fields, is remarkable. I think he is a leader for our time.\"</p><p>In 1995, Holden took charge of the</p><p>Soil Association, the organic standards body, and oversaw an increase in annual sales from \u00a350m to \u00a32bn during his 15 years in the role. Since then, sales have lagged at around 2pc of the market.</p><p>\"The whole organic project has been misunderstood and stalled because of this distorted economic system where the polluter doesn't pay,\" he says.</p><p>\"And the other people aren't having the polluter-pays principle applied, because everybody's addicted to so-called cheap food, which is dishonestly cheap.</p><p>\"If you say to yourself, I can't afford to spend more on food, I think that is completely legitimate for probably about 20pc of the population. And for that 20pc, that's what governments are for. The other 80pc of us who can afford to spend less on something else, that's what we should do.\"</p><p>The challenge may be easier for Holden, who eats mainly from his own 300ac farm, than for the rest of us trying to navigate the endless labelling in our weekly supermarket shop.</p><p>\"I think you'd recognise our family's diet as being a diet that you'd want to eat,\" he says. There is unsurprisingly \"shed loads\" of cheese, milk and meat almost every day, including \"the most delicious sausages I have ever eaten\", from their own pigs that have just been sent to the local slaughterhouse. Vital role Livestock, he says, have a vital role to play in regenerative agriculture, helping to feed the soils.</p><p>\"Why are so many young people going vegan? I think they misunderstand the importance of livestock in sustainable farming systems,\" he says.</p><p>\"And they intuitively sense that the meat and other livestock products which supermarkets sell probably have a very poor welfare story behind them.\"</p><p>But he believes that the message of the important role that livestock can play is getting missed because of public figures such as David Attenborough, who call for us to eat less meat because of livestock's impact on the climate.</p><p>\"David is a national treasure and I wrote him a letter recently to ask if he would be prepared to get involved in the discussion about sustainable agriculture,\" Holden says.</p><p>\"He wrote a charming handwritten note back, saying 'I would love to help but I don't know enough about farming.' Which is honest.</p><p>\"But the people who have been writing his scripts have made him a mouthpiece for the one thing he's got wrong, which is the livestock thing. It's not the cow, but the how.\"</p><p>None of Holden's children, aged between 16 and 52, have shown an inclination towards veganism, although \"they all mind about the story behind the meat they eat\".</p><p>The family have just acquired 10 chickens to supply the many eggs eaten by Holden's rugby-playing son Harry, 19, who has just returned to the farm after dropping out of Edinburgh University after one term. His older brother Ben, 21, has also dropped out of Glasgow University and is back in the family home.</p><p>Both Harry and Ben are now helping out on the farm. Holden's youngest son, 16-year-old James has also declared his knowledge of farming to be \"cool\".</p><p>\"There's a whole generation of young people that are starting to think about farming in an interesting way now,\" says Holden.</p><p>He is keen not to dismiss the difficulty that farmers are facing, which are compounded by rising interest rates and input costs in the wake of the Ukraine war.</p><p>But he dismisses the \"no farmers, no food\" slogans that have appeared at recent protests, particularly in Wales, where protesters have rejected the Government's proposed sustainable farming scheme, which would require farms to maintain 10pc woodland and 10pc wildlife habitat to qualify for subsidies.</p><p>\"It's just a bit trite, isn't it? The point is, what kind of farming story do we want? It's got to be: no sustainable farmers, no food,\" he says.</p><p>\"Farmers are understandably confused and dismayed and anxious about the future because most farmers responded to the policy and economic signals of the last 40 years.</p><p>\"They have been locked into a system which they've assumed has been the right system for a very long time. And they've invested in it, and they're defensive. A lot of them have borrowed a lot of money to intensify.</p><p>\"The Government shouldn't back down on the farming transition, but realise more needs to be done to help farmers, who can't improve the way they do agriculture if they don't make money.</p><p>\"Farming is absolutely part of the problem.

In about 1720 they decided they wanted a more contemporary home and by 1745 Dowth Hall was built. Later, in 1877, the family developed an alms house for widows and orphans to a design by architect George Coppinger Ashlin, which became known as the Netterville Institution - a fine example of Victorian Gothic architecture - today known as Netterville Manor.

Dowth Hall, which has superb architecture, dimensions and impressive plasterwork, needs restoration but the Brennan family began that journey over the past decade. The roof was repaired and it took five years to dry the property out, so it is now protected from water damage and all dry rot has been treated. In addition, the family undertook extensive research, groundwork and guidance with heritage architects into what needs to be done to fully restore the house - especially the striking plasterwork, which is attributed to stuccodore Robert West.

We're looking at a pressurised metre system for umbilical systems where we might be able to use the clover hopper at the outlet point.</p><p>\"The hopper is also ideally suited for applying all sorts of slurry and soil additives, such as humates, biostimulants, molasses, vermicasts and compost teas to enhance soil microbiology, all of which I believe will play a part in a new era in regenerative agriculture.\"</p><p>Albert, who set up a company called , has automatic welding in place in his workshop for the induction hoppers, with a series of batches being made at a time.</p><p>\"So far this year there's 70 made,\" he says. \"We're looking ahead now as it takes so long to get parts ordered, cut and galvanised and bring it all together. You always have to be working two to three months ahead of yourself.\"</p><p>\"We are retailing them for \u00a3210. I've got dealers appointed throughout Ireland to sell them.\"</p><p>Ballyheather's other inventions include the labour-saving 'Tyreshift' which allows farmers to more quickly cover silage pits; and the 'mixing slat lifter' which is not only labour-saving but also aids in safety when agitating slurry on farm.</p><p>Albert left school in 1998 and graduated from Enniskillen Agricultural College in 1999. With no formal engineering education, the fourth-generation farmer credits his skills to getting 'stuck in' with activities on the farm's workshop at an early age.</p><p>\"I was always interested in anything mechanical from a young age,\" he says. \"Engineering was more of a hobby now turned into another business stream. Hobby \"Only really when taking on another farm employee last year have I really found time for engineering. Before it was pretty much just a hobby.</p><p>\"My father and another worker on the farm here were very hands-on here welding when I was younger and I was always watching them and what they were doing.</p><p>\"Because they were good at what they were doing with a wellequipped workshop, I was able to get stuck in.</p><p>\"I have hardly ever put pen to paper on anything. I usually don't start to make anything until I can picture it in my head and then I start to work back from there.\"</p><p>Albert hopes to be able to build his own zero grazer for the farm for around \u00a33,500.</p><p>\"When I left college we were milking 160 cows and I embarked on my own agricultural contracting business on a small scale,\" he says. \"Bit of work here and there: grass raking, round baling straw and hay, and helping out sometimes with other contractors.</p><p>\"It was long hours at the contracting. Profit margins - any contractor will tell you - are slim. It was hard to make a decent profit out of it. We did that for about 10 years and then I decided to concentrate more on the cows and that's when we upped cow numbers to 200.</p><p>\"Contractors do the majority of silage work here now. Machinery is just too expensive. Our policy is just to run good second-hand equipment where the depreciation is already gone.\"</p><p>The farm, just outside the village of Artigarvan, now has a herd of 200 Montb\u00e9liarde Holstein cross cows, and grows around 40ac of crops between spring barley and spring beans.</p><p>Albert farms alongside his parents John and Evelyn and brother Wesley.

There's about 160ac on the milking platform,\" Albert says.</p><p>\"We're in very sandy loam soil here, very fertile and free draining land. The river Foyle runs through the valley from Strabane right up to Derry. The farm ranges from 25-300ft above sea level.</p><p>\"Land price can vary according to quality and location. In general, land rental prices here for grassland could vary from \u00a3150-300/ac ((EURO)170-340/ac).</p><p>\"There's been a few one-offs where it has gone a bit higher than that. Bigger dairy farmers and AD plants are calling the shots.</p><p>\"If more land were to become available we'd put that into crops. We'd utilise those crops for homegrown forage.</p><p>\"We're growing beans - it's a valuable protein source. It's a legume fixing nitrogen and any field in beans needs very little nitrogen for two years. We're following on with winter cereals and reducing our nitrogen use by about 75pc.\"</p><p>The herd is autumn and winter calving and the cows produce on average 9,000L/lactation.</p><p>\"We're about 20 odd years with the Montb\u00e9liard cross. My father went to see them at the Paris show and took a liking to them. He purchased a stock bull from Cork when he came back.\"</p><p>Nowadays it's all AI and sexed semen, Albert explains.</p><p>\"We're getting a good premium for the bull calves, around \u00a3100/hd more than your typical pure-bred Holstein. They're stronger, biggerboned and bigger-framed so they'll hold a bit more flesh.</p><p>\"We calve down at two years old and we're getting an average of five lactations, with a replacement rate of 20pc.

With a focus on nutrient cycling - he sees his farm's soil health as his wealth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pair first began to make radical changes to the business a decade ago, starting their journey to conservation farming and no-till arable farming, following Sam's experiences working on other farms for his placement for his ag science degree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sam prefers to refer to himself as a \"conservation farmer\" rather than using the \"regenerative\" label.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The core principles are very similar to regenerative farming, but the FAO's definition is that conservation farming should include minimum soil disturbance, crop rotation, and retention of crop residues and cover crops.</p><p>It's an approach which fits well with his day job as a New Generation Agriculture agronomist.</p><p>\"People come to us and might, for example, say they want to use less bagged nitrogen fertiliser, so we will look at their farm, and start looking at how they can better use their slurry,\" he said.</p><p>\"They'll often come with very complicated things that they have seen online or heard in a regen podcast, for example.</p><p>\"But in my experience, the best way to start is usually with something really, really simple, and come back in six months and review it, let's see how it went for you... Is it making you money? Is your soil in better condition? And then go forward from there. That's very similar to the approach we take on the farm as well.\"</p><p>Sam's own curiosity about finding better ways to manage his soil was sparked during his university work placement in 2012.</p><p>\"It was an atrocious harvest - there were ruts put in fields - but I ended on a farm that was big into min till and improving soil fertility and the next spring, then, 2013, I came home and the seeds had been planted in my head,\" he said.</p><p>Previously, the Deanes had a very conventional approach to farming - spring barley and sugar beet, being close to the Mallow factory.</p><p>\"We were having conservations down in the field about how we hadn't seen seagulls in a long time. This year, now 10 years on, we're having birds landing on the ground even behind a no-till drill,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are on extremely dry ground and there was water lying on the ground.\" Luckily his father gave him the freedom at a young age to make major decisions and bring in new ideas.</p><p>First of all, he convinced his father to invest in a strip-till drill, realising it would save them money in the long-term.</p><p>\"I'm not allowed to go totally crazy, but he is a big believer of allowing someone to give things a go.</p><p>\"When we bought this, we thought it was the peak and it was where we would stop, then we got involved in cover crop trials with a seed company.\" From there, preserving the soil nutrients has become a cornerstone of the business decision-making process on the farm.</p><p>Today, the pair grow 35 acres of barley, 25 acres of beans, 20 acres of winter linseed, and 17 acres of spring wheat for feed, with mustard, phacelia, oats as cover crops. As crops are grown in a no-till system, he simply drills straight into the old crop's residue. He says the yields have been similar, if not, slightly higher, but without the higher input costs.</p><p>\"If they weren't, we would give up, because it wouldn't matter how much money you'd save, if you're not earning anything, you won't be able to keep going.</p><p>\"Before, we would have been around 2.7 tonnes per acre, we are now pushing closer to three... so it's around a quarter of a tonne extra in the last 10 years, while saving significantly on costs.</p><p>\"Because we adopted conservation agriculture, [cover crops have] now become part of our yearly plan,\" he said. \"We look and go, 'Right, what cover crops are going to go where, and how much will we spend? And how will we get them in?'\" Sam explained, but he added that it has taken time to reap the rewards.</p><p>\"The first couple of years, we didn't see many benefits, but we knew other people were saying it works, so we stuck with it, and now we are really seeing the benefits; I went out yesterday in the rain, and the water is circulating properly through the soil rather than sitting on the surface.</p><p>\"At the moment, we have beans and spring wheat in the ground, we have stubble and dying cover crop everywhere. I'll get out my trowel, and there are seeds germinating below - that's where we are now.</p><p>\"When I walk our farm, I do it with either a trowel or a spade in my hand. Harvest is my time to reflect on what has happened on the farm in the last 12 months - to look at what has happened and to assess things.</p><p>\"Every year, I look and say, 'Wow, my soil has never looked so good'. And then I come back the next year, and I say, 'Nah, last year was nothing. Now, my soil has never looked so good.' And it just keeps going and going like that every year.\" Soil samples are taken every three years on the farm, but this has recently been upped in frequency to every other year.</p><p>\"This comes from having a big, big interest in soil health and improving its fertility. Our fertiliser use is coming down slowly but surely,\" he said. \"A lot of people are trying to make very dramatic cuts this year with the price of fertiliser, but we have been trying to build up the soil fertility to do this gradually and sustainably. For example, we might try cutting fertiliser by 10%, seeing how that works and then trying the same the following year, but if we take it too far we aren't afraid to adjust either.</p><p>\"We haven't quite got to the point where we can take a holiday from P and K, but we have been able to reduce our P and K usage significantly.\" We would have been the kind of people using 18-6-12 to start off spring barley, but now we're using ?????. We can do that because our soil P and K levels seem to be holding steady and they're not going down.\" Sam explained the cover crops were \"mopping up nutrients\" that would be lost off-farm, while the decision to chop straw was helping to sequester carbon and also maintaining the P and K content of soil.</p><p>He tested the practice of chopping on headlands, but when the headlands started performing better.</p><p>The next big challenge he is taking on is working out how to significantly reduce the farm's use of chemicals, focusing instead on growing healthier, more disease and pestresilient plants.</p><p>It's something he believes will become a bigger focus even for conventional farmers in the future, as he expects more regenerative agriculture programmes will be launched in the next few years, bringing renewed focus on modern farming practices.</p><p>\"For me, farmers are part of the solution, if you we have healthy farms, we have healthy rural communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"Soil health is farm health, and that's the rural community's health too.</p><p>\"If farmers don't look after themselves and their farms, how can the rural community thrive, and the same goes for their soil too.
