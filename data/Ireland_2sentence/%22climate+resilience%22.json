The term  climate suffering  may be more apt than  climate resilience .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Extreme weather events are predicted to become more frequent, bringing more disruption, material damage and inevitably loss of life. But is Ireland adequately prepared?</p><p>What is clear from Storm \u00c9owyn is that our overhead power lines and telecommunications infrastructure are very exposed to high wind speeds. Cascading failures occurred in our water and railway networks due to their heavy dependency on our electricity network.</p><p>There are interdependencies across our critical infrastructure networks which require a co-ordinated approach to adaptation and planning across different sectors, with multiple infrastructure owners and operators. These interdependencies will only intensify in future as we electrify more of our transport and heating sectors to meet our targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions.</p><p>As we saw this week, one critical area of concern is water infrastructure, particularly water and wastewater treatment plants. The storm left about 84,000 people without water, with an additional 100,000 classified in the  at risk  category in areas where treatment plants have lost power and are relying solely on reservoir stores.</p><p>Extreme weather events disrupt water infrastructure in several ways, including increased flooding, which can overwhelm treatment systems and compromise water quality. Droughts reduce the availability of source water, putting additional stress on already limited supplies. Addressing these challenges requires investments in adaptive infrastructure such as flood-resilient treatment plants and systems designed to handle variable water levels. </p><p>Enhanced monitoring technologies can also support operators in responding swiftly to changing conditions, thereby minimising service interruptions.</p><h>Back-up systems </h><p/><h>Electricity supply discontinuity is a critical concern for water infrastructure during severe weather events. Robust backup power systems, such as on-site backup generators and battery storage, are essential to addressing this. </h><p>Microgrids can be established for such critical infrastructure to ensure localised energy independence, reducing reliance on external power supplies. Co-ordinated efforts with energy providers can help direct restoration efforts to critical infrastructure during outages.</p><p>Strengthening water infrastructure also requires improved collaboration between utility companies and local governments. Public education initiatives could help these efforts by encouraging water conservation during shortages and preparing communities for potential service disruptions.</p><p>Our transport networks are also affected by extreme weather. In the case of Storm \u00c9owyn, there was little choice but to halt public transport services due to the risk of life. Resilience in this case was seen in the ability of large parts of the workforce to work from home, but of course this depended upon them having power and internet connectivity. The costs to the economy of periods like this are significant and are predicted to become greater in the future. </p><p>Social media was full of stories of people without power using alternative sources such as electric vehicles to run their fridges and freezers. Sales of these vehicles are, however, highest in urban areas   and these were the areas that felt the least impacts last week.</p><p>The west of the country was by far the worst hit. Much of this region consists of rural, sparsely populated areas where it is a slow process to restore power in the aftermath of a storm. </p><p>The risk has been greatest to vulnerable older people, and that s reflected in the increase in hospital admissions in recent days, making it clear that extreme weather events in Ireland pose a significant threat, not just to our quality of life, but also to the health of our population.</p><p>While the scientific consensus on some climate hazards in Ireland is very clear in terms of projected changes due to climate change, for other risks it is less certain. Scientists confidently predict warmer, wetter weather in Ireland, with more intense rainfall during winter, and longer, drier periods during the summer months. Windstorms appear to be trickier to pinpoint in terms of projected patterns. </p><p>However, there is no doubt that we are in uncharted territory with the record- breaking wind gusts recorded in Co Galway last week. The link between the extremes experienced during Storm \u00c9owyn and climate change is expected to be firmly established by a weather-attribution study in the coming months, similar to the one carried out for the heavy precipitation during 2023 s Storm Babet, which scientists demonstrated was made 13 per cent more likely due to climate change.</p><p>There is an urgent need for the implementation of adaptation measures across all aspects of our society. Although Ireland has set out a legal requirement to become a climate-resilient society by 2050, according to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, it is not yet clear what this looks like or what the pathway to achieving it will be.</p><p>Ireland s first national climate-change risk assessment, which is due to be published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the coming months, will help us to understand how climate risk varies in Ireland, geographically and over time. This is a critical first step in terms of adaptation. </p><p>However, once the risks have been pinpointed, significant investment and a commitment from government in terms of adaptation finance, alongside a clear strategy, will be needed. Clearly defined metrics and targets towards achieving climate resilience are vital to effectively monitoring progress. We may need something akin to the carbon budget approach to climate-change mitigation in Ireland.</p><p>The imminent decarbonisation of many sectors presents an opportunity simultaneously to develop climate resilience. The adoption of battery storage alongside renewables would decrease the reliance of communities on the electricity network and increase their ability to cope with extreme storm events.</p><p>We must protect those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This means ensuring just adaptation that targets resources where the climate risk is greatest.

Because of this it has an unusual greenhouse gas emissions profile, with a far higher share of methane emissions than most other countries.</p><p>New Zealand is similar. But there are not many other places in the developed world where agriculture is so dominant.</p><p>Methane from agriculture is an enormously potent greenhouse gas. It is capable of trapping about 85 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a short time frame.</p><p>After about ten years however, methane dissipates. It breaks down and disappears from the atmosphere.</p><p>So, its impact on global temperature ceases in a few short years while the warming effect of carbon dioxide carries on for several hundred years.</p><p>All this means that a country with a huge agriculture sector can have an outsized impact in terms of limiting global warming by doing a relatively small amount of methane reduction.</p><p>It gives it more wriggle room if the main aim is to eliminate a nation\u2019s contribution to rising global temperature.</p><p>In some circumstances it could even enable a country to ease up on carbon emission efforts in sectors outside of agriculture and still ensure a lower contribution to the global warming potential of its national greenhouse gas mix.</p><p>It turns out that this is precisely the impact the Climate Change Advisory Council\u2019s adaptation of the temperature neutrality target has for Ireland.</p><p>The council itself has gone to some length to explain and document this impact.</p><p>It calculated that aiming for temperature neutrality instead of net zero emissions will enable Ireland to emit an additional nine million tonnes of greenhouse gases during the first five years of the next decade.</p><p>It also said it is entirely up to the Government to decide which sectors of the economy can share in that additional climate mitigation wriggle room, and by how much.</p><p>Its carbon budget proposal document says all this will be fine \"provided the rest of the world follows an emissions pathway that can be considered compliant with the Paris Agreement long term temperature goals\".</p><p>In essence, what they are saying is that since most countries in the world do not have as large an agriculture sector as Ireland, or New Zealand, they are unlikely to choose the same temperature neutrality approach.</p><p>That is because there is no advantage for them in doing so. And if that remains the case then all will be well.</p><p>It is an approach that has startled the critics who have specifically highlighted the polar opposite argument - that it would be a disaster if every country followed Ireland and adopted temperature neutrality as their climate target.</p><p>The dissenters insist it would seriously jeopardise the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u02daC.</p><p>These criticisms are outlined in a paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, by Dr Colm Duffy and David Styles of University of Galway, Dr R\u00f3is\u00edn Moriarty and Professor Hannah Daly of University College Cork, and Carl Doedens and Malte Meinshausen of the University of Melbourne.</p><p>They claim that Ireland\u2019s approach rewards modest cuts in methane emissions and serves to protect what they describe as \"methane emissions privileges\" at the expense of poorer nations.</p><p>In doing so, they say it locks in current inequalities in the global food system.</p><p>Their paper highlights that by enabling Ireland to maintain a high share of global agriculture emissions, adopting the temperature neutrality target undermines the global transition to a sustainable and equitable food system.</p><p>They note too that it dramatically reduces the level of ambition needed for overall greenhouse gas emissions reduction.</p><p>Many might argue that the additional wriggle room it provides of nine million tonnes of emissions for Ireland spread out over a nine-year period does not sound particularly dramatic.</p><p>However, if lots of countries were to benefit from the same approach the impact could become dramatic very quickly.</p>", "publisher": "RTE News", "instances": ["There are massive commitments packed into that single sentence, yet it is not really clear what precisely it means.

While the system plays a critical role in shaping sustainable communities, public perception has grown more critical due to delays, negative media coverage, legal challenges and political tensions.</p><p>At the core lies a perception of inefficiency, inconsistency and distrust. Delays in securing planning permission, particularly for large-scale housing and infrastructure, are widely reported. Appeals and judicial reviews frequently delay and often derail granted projects, reinforcing the image of a slow, bureaucratic system vulnerable to obstruction. Developers, investors and communities alike express frustration at what often seems like an unpredictable and overly legalistic process.</p><p>Recent reforms aim to address these challenges. The Planning and Development Act 2024 will introduce mandatory timelines for appeals and narrow the grounds for judicial review to improve transparency, provide greater certainty and rebuild confidence. Simultaneously, the recently approved National Planning Framework   First Revision offers a chance to better align long-term spatial planning with housing, infrastructure and climate goals. Nonetheless, some argue the reforms may fall short or create short-term disruption.</p><p>These reforms are also complemented by the recent establishment of the Housing Activation Office (HAO), which seeks to support local authorities in proactively progressing housing and infrastructure projects. This initiative reflects a more joined-up, solutions-focused approach to activation. </p><p>However, recent discussions around the potential appointment of a new housing  tsar  to head this office led to political tensions between the Government and Opposition, and within the ranks of the Government itself, resulting in the individual withdrawing their name from consideration for the role.</p><p>A further challenge lies in the disconnect between national and regional strategy and local implementation. Despite ambitious targets, delivery often slows due to local political opposition, resource constraints and community resistance. This fuels a perception that the system is pulling in multiple directions. </p><p>Political interventions and media narratives further complicate matters. Headlines often present planning as  a barrier  or the  number one issue  to delivering housing and infrastructure projects across the State. </p><p>Furthermore, the planning process is portrayed as a battleground, highlighting cases where objectors  win  against developers or the planning authority. In one instance, councillors dezoned serviced lands following opposition to a project, despite the site already having permission for a larger development   this decision has now been challenged in the High Court. </p><p>These  David v Goliath  portrayals oversimplify complex planning decisions and reinforce the idea of an inherent conflict between development and community or environmental interests.

It demands visible enhancements to how the system operates and communicates. This includes better resourced and supported planning authorities, stronger alignment across governance levels and more meaningful community engagement. Embracing digital tools, data-led decision-making and proactive communication will be essential in shifting perceptions and rebuilding trust.</p><p>Ultimately, the optics around planning reflect real structural challenges   but also offer an opportunity.

While it has become fashionable to highlight big commitments to sustainability, there is a growing risk of greenwashing, particularly in business and the corporate world. All too often t</h><p>hese promises don t stack up.</p><p>But others are responding meaningfully to the dual climate and nature loss crises in their collective best interests and that of their locality   sometimes, it s the beginning of a journey. </p><p>Prof Yvonne Buckley, who is co-director of Co-Centre for Climate + Biodiversity + Water based in Trinity College Dublin, is uniquely positioned to comment on the island of Ireland s green credentials. </p><p>While she experiences the realities of environmental degradation constantly, she believes much of Ireland, often driven by community initiatives, is transforming to more sustainable living. </p><p>She points to biodiversity officers in almost every local authority area   ie  in every community    and the adoption of the All-Ireland Pollinator Plan, notably by the Tidy Towns movement. </p><p>Then there are specific initiatives, such as Killarney becoming the first town in Ireland to phase out single-use coffee cups,  where people come together to deliver things . </p><p> This shows change is possible and you can follow that down to other areas of sustainability,  says Buckley. </p><p>Another strong trend is increased focus on sustainable foods, she says, particularly in restaurants, with a rebalancing away from carbon-intensive foods (such as red meat) to less carbon-intensive plant-based ingredients. This is frequently backed by provenance, indicating where food was grown, caught or raised with a priority for the local. </p><p>Prof Buckley says there is considerable support for sustainable transport in public places and around schools. While the negatives around this get a lot of coverage,  a lot of good work is being done [driven by community action]. They are often the silent majority. </p><p>If there is a critical mass of people doing things, individuals are more inclined to act themselves, she says. </p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency s Climate Change in the Irish Mind survey is very clear that the Irish public wants more effective climate action at every level. It also confirmed strong preference for environmental actions to counter  local environmental hazards , with high levels of concern about water pollution, severe storms, air pollution, flooding and rising sea levels. </p><p>Nonetheless, Buckley says action can still be hard as people are frustrated by  higher costs and other kinds of friction . </p><h>Where does  climate action  fit in?  There is, rightly, much focus on decarbonisation, cutting our extremely high carbon emissions and switching to clean energy, but as Green Party senator Malcolm Noonan has highlighted:  As we make vital progress in reducing energy-related emissions, we must also remember that decarbonisation doesn t stop at power plants and vehicles. Nature-based solutions   like restoring peatlands, planting native woodlands, and protecting biodiversity   are essential allies in this transition. </h><p> It is also important to note the role being played by farming and the agriculture sector.  </p><p>In all corners of Ireland, there is evidence of sustainability in action. It ranges across bog and habitat restoration; rewilding; scaling up afforestation with native trees and hardwoods; deployment of low-cost, nature-based solutions such as restoring dune systems and countering coastal erosion; farmers working together to enhance river catchments and recording of Ireland s remarkable biodiversity. </p><p>Of course, being green goes beyond nature and is seen in people, for instance, embracing circularity in the pursuit of zero waste; devising innovative climate action strategies proven to work; or achieving energy independence with clean technologies and building sustainable energy communities. </p><p>They all have one outstanding attribute: they don t involve greenwashing or tokenism.

The 20m diameter dome by Viking Domes from Lithuania, is just one element of an exciting new environmental project set to transform the site, creating an innovative urban growing space for the local community promoting food growing technologies and sustainable practices. The Acorn Farm is being delivered by council's Green Infrastructure Team with support from the UK Government. The contractor is McKelvey Construction from Castlederg and the design team is led by Doran Consulting, Belfast ,with the dome design by Paul McAllister Architects. The \u00a36.2 million climate-smart project will assist in achieving climate resilience by incorporating circular economy principles and sustainable energy technologies. The site will also host a Green Skills Learning Academy, providing education and training on sustainable food production and environmental conservation. Work will go into the development of new farming systems, optimising growing conditions, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in urban horticulture. Mayor Lilian Seenoi-Barr said the project would have a major impact on the local area. \"There is no doubt that we are faced with many challenges when it comes to climate,\" she said. \"But the message we leave for future generations in our time capsule today is a hopeful one that demonstrates our commitment to changing things for the better. \"The Acorn Farm is an exciting vision of what we hope to achieve in terms of council's climate ambitions. \"The project will promote sustainable living, environmental education, and community involvement and become a hub for local events, activities and learning experiences. \"It will bring people together with the shared goal of adopting more responsible and sustainable practices that will protect our local environment and ensure a cleaner, greener city and district for future generations.\" In 2015 there was much excitement as a 175-year-old time capsule was unearthed at the former Gwyn's Institute site during the regeneration of Brooke Park. The lead capsule contained coins, newspapers and a scroll containing the signatures of local dignitaries dating back to 1839. The capsule placed at the Dome site holds a selection of images relating to the Acorn Farm project, including digital technical drawings produced by the design team. It also contains worksheets from the children from Bready Primary School with information on the food we eat today and their predictions of food they think people will eat in 200 years' time - from 3D burgers to seaweed pizza. Principal David Bogle explained. \"We are delighted to be here today at this milestone moment for the Acorn Farm and to make a little bit of history by placing some items in the time capsule for future generations to discover. \"Our pupils have been learning all about the importance of sustainable food and have had great fun recording their predictions for the favourite foods of the future. \"It's so important for young people to know where their food comes from and how we can all play a role in ensuring our environment can support vital food sources in a responsible and sustainable way.\" The children from Bready were joined on site for the placing of the capsule by project partners and the design team. Final preparations are also underway for the handover of the new Gate Lodge building which will greet visitors at the entrance to the site. UK Minister for Local Growth and Building Safety, Alex Norris, said: \"The completed Gate Lodge building is the first step towards an amazing environmental and community hub at St Columb's Park. \"\"The Acorn Farm project promises to be a shining example of how hard work and creative thinking can bring new life to disused urban sites, and I will watch its progress with great interest.\"</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "Strabane Weekly", "instances": ["The contractor is McKelvey Construction from Castlederg and the design team is led by Doran Consulting, Belfast ,with the dome design by Paul McAllister Architects.

Some welcomed it, citing employment and economic benefits, while others express concern about the impact on our climate obligations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Ireland has been sheltered for many years from the impacts of climate change and energy insecurity, the more frequent extreme weather events and the cost of living crisis due to reduced natural gas supplies coming into the EU after Russia invaded Ukraine have exposed our vulnerabilities to both.</p><p>There is a lot to unpack about this decision and its implications. Here are four factors to consider.</p><p>Firstly, we urgently need to wean ourselves off natural gas and other fossil fuels. Climate science is unequivocal about the fact that burning natural gas and other fossil fuels is the main cause of widespread, rapid climate change.</p><p>The growing evidence of climate change occurring in Ireland is clear, with Met \u00c9ireann reporting recently that seven of Ireland's 10 warmest years have occurred since 2005.</p><p>The more noticeable impacts of climate change are the growing number and severity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, drought, wildfire, storms, and floods.</p><p>The World Weather Attribution reported in January that \"climate change contributed to the deaths of at least 3,700 people and the displacement of millions in 26 weather events we studied in 2024\".</p><p>The impacts in Ireland are also growing, as evidenced by the 2023 flooding in Midleton from Storm Babet and the damage caused across the west and south of Ireland more recently during Storm \u00c9owyn.</p><p>We need to improve our climate resilience, and also to wean ourselves off fossil fuels to stop contributing to the devastation.</p><p>The good news is that the transition away from a fossil fuel energy system to a renewable energy system is underway here, helped by our abundant supplies of renewable energy.</p><p>Based on data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the share of total energy use for electricity, heating, and transport in Ireland coming from renewable sources doubled over the 10-year period from 2013 to 2023.</p><p>The bad news is it is not happening fast enough. Ireland's renewable energy share is currently only at 15%, meaning 85% of our energy still comes from fossil fuels.</p><p>Secondly, we also need to increase our security of electricity supply. Most of the progress we have made has been in electricity supply, with 40% of our electricity now coming from renewable energy, mostly from wind, with growing amounts of solar and a small contribution from hydro power.</p><p>We have a target to double our renewable share of electricity to 80% by 2030. But delays in developing wind power at sufficient pace, coupled with growing consumption of electricity, largely due to the growth in data centres, have stopped renewables from exceeding 40% for a few years now. We therefore need as a first priority to accelerate wind and solar development to ensure sufficient security of electricity supply in the future to keep the lights on.</p><p>It is clear from our research at UCC that we also need to invest in the electricity grid, increase electricity storage, manage electricity demand and sufficient electricity capacity from other sources for those times when it is not sufficiently windy or sunny.</p><p>Thirdly, new gas-fired power plants are essential but need to operate very differently.</p><p>More gas-fired generation capacity is necessary in the short term as we increase the amount of wind and solar energy feeding into our system.</p><p>These gas power plants, however, should only be called on when needed, rather than operating continuously, to get the benefit of the available generating capacity while at the same time, reducing our overall use of gas.</p><p>This need has long been recognised and Ireland's electricity grid operator EirGrid holds auctions for projects to deliver generating capacity through a capacity renumeration market that operates in parallel with the electricity trading market.</p><p>While auctions have taken place, many projects have not materialised within the timeframe required, leading to reductions in the security of Ireland's electricity supply over the past number of years. To address the failure, the Moneypoint Power Plant has extended its operation, along with the use of emergency generators, both of which lead to higher carbon emissions levels.</p><p>Shannon LNG did secure a capacity contract from EirGrid in March 2023 for this approved power plant, as noted in An B\u00f3rd Plean\u00e1la's Inspector report.</p><p>Fourthly, gas security of supply is also essential as we wean off natural gas.</p><p>An B\u00f3rd Plean\u00e1la's decision has also prompted further discussion regarding Ireland's position on accommodating liquefied natural gas terminals. While they were not directly included in this decision,they have been proposed by Shannon LNG under a separate planning application.</p><p>In addition to increasing our security of electricity supply, Ireland also needs to increase our security of gas supply.</p><p>There are two key distinct dimensions to security of gas supply, the risk of significant price fluctuations and the risk of a physical interruption of gas supply.</p><p>The Government published a policy document <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Securing Ireland's Gas Supplies</emphasis> in 2023, concluding that there will be a significant reduction of natural gas use (drawing on UCC analysis) but also a need to establish a State-led strategic gas emergency reserve.</p><p>Reducing our dependence on natural gas limits our exposure economically to fuel price fluctuations internationally due to geopolitical events that we do not control.</p><p>We were strongly impacted in price terms by Russia turning off the natural gas taps to the EU but we did not experience an interruption in physical gas supply because we import most of our natural gas from Britain and very little of their gas comes from Russia.</p><p>However, Ireland is amongst a small few EU member states that do not have gas storage facilities, hence the benefit of our own strategic gas emergency reserve.</p><p>In conclusion, building new gas infrastructure is essential for increasing electricity security of supply and for gas security of supply, but if, and only if, this infrastructure is operated so that Ireland is quickly weaned off gas usage.</p><p>* Brian \u00d3 Gallach\u00f3ir is associate vice president of sustainability at UCC.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Examiner", "instances": ["The World Weather Attribution reported in January that \"climate change contributed to the deaths of at least 3,700 people and the displacement of millions in 26 weather events we studied in 2024\".

By the next evening Storm Gudrun had reached southern Sweden, where it unleashed hurricane-force winds. What followed was the most devastating storm in Sweden s history: 250 million trees toppled like matchsticks, 18 lives were lost, and 700,000 people were left without electricity. The disaster was a wake-up call, forcing the country to rethink and overhaul its approach to preparing for extreme weather events. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The scale of the destruction, with wind speeds of 165km per hour, was of a magnitude unlike anything seen before. In a single night, parts of the landscape became unrecognisable. Locals awoke the following morning to scenes resembling a war zone; one woman described it to Swedish Radio, saying:  You get out on to these roads, and you re lost; it s all so changed, you don t know where you are.  Within days, police reported 100 people missing, theorising that they had probably ventured along familiar paths and roads only to find them gone. Some lost their way; others fell into holes left by uprooted trees.</p><p>Locals had been warned that a storm was coming, but no one anticipated its scale. It was chaotic, and communities were unprepared. Forests were destroyed, with the entire annual timber harvest flattened in hours. Beyond the woods, roads became impassable, railway lines were shut down, and communication networks collapsed as phone lines and mobile masts took the hit. </p><p>Fixing the damage was a relentless task. Underground electricity networks remained intact, but the storm severely damaged 30,000km of overhead power lines, snapping 10,000 poles. It plunged much of southern and central Sweden into darkness for up to 35 days, and the government had to enlist the help of crews from 15 countries to restore power. </p><p>Storm Gudrun acted as a stark warning about the vulnerabilities in Sweden s crisis response, infrastructure and forestry. It became clear that unless disaster preparedness and climate resilience were strengthened, the impact of future events would be even worse. And so, a new, climate-proofed power grid was built. </p><p>Thousands of workers were mobilised to weatherproof the lines, with much of the system buried in the ground. (Other countries have similarly prioritised such strategies. By 2036, Finland s leading power grid operator will have buried 90 per cent of the electricity network, working alongside telecommunications companies installing fibre-optic cables to minimise cost.) </p><p> The remaining overhead power lines were replaced with stronger poles and insulated wires, and the distance between poles was shortened with better anchoring to make them more resilient. Remote-controlled switches were installed, allowing electricity to be quickly rerouted. New laws were passed to fine electricity companies if power was not restored within 24 hours, which acted as an incentive to invest in upgrades. Rural areas saw an increased focus on distributed energy systems such as microgrids, which use solar, wind, batteries and hydrogen storage. </p><p>The Swedish Forest Agency reported that 80 per cent of the fallen trees were monoculture Norway spruces, a commercially grown species with shallow roots vulnerable to high winds. To incentivise mixed forests, forest owners received grants from a  storm-support  disaster fund to plant diverse species such as birch, Scots pine and beech, which have stronger root systems. </p><p>Investors keen to safeguard the long-term value of their assets quickly realised that in the face of extreme weather, a diverse forest is a financially robust option. </p><p>To strengthen resilience, local communities in Sweden took steps to increase readiness for storms. Households are expected to manage for 72 hours without relying on the help of external services. Every September, the Civil Contingencies Agency runs Preparedness Week, educating the public on preparing for emergencies such as water, energy, food, communication and security. Radio and network communication has been strengthened at so-called safety points   meeting places where local people go in an emergency. Voluntary civil defence groups receive ongoing training in first aid, food handling, language skills and flood management. </p><p>In 2016, climatologist Kieran Hickey told an audience at an Irish Maritime History event in University College Cork that Ireland was  radically underprepared  for big meteorological events. Two years previously, Storm Darwin   described by Met \u00c9ireann as the worst in living memory   had torn roofs off buildings, leaving 260,000 homes without electricity and felling seven million trees. </p><p>In the wake of Storm \u00c9owyn, Dr Hickey s warning  holds true. At the most basic level, preparedness remains inadequate: there weren t enough generators, leaving communities without water; the collapse of Tetra, the emergency services  sole digital radio system linked to mobile phone masts, was alarming, leaving people vulnerable; and concerns remain about whether the 28 Civil Defence units across the country   with 1,800 active volunteers when  2,500 is the minimum   are adequately resourced. </p><p>According to Met \u00c9ireann, when it comes to extreme weather, it s not a matter of if but when it will happen again. Storm \u00c9owyn is our warning; the costs of action might be high, but the price of inaction is incalculable. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["It plunged much of southern and central Sweden into darkness for up to 35 days, and the government had to enlist the help of crews from 15 countries to restore power.

These ancient ecosystems, storing more carbon per hectare than forests, are critical for mitigating climate change. They also regulate water quality, provide flood mitigation, and support unique biodiversity. The importance of peatlands is stated in Ireland's Climate Action Plan 2023, which commits to restoring 77,000 hectares of degraded peatlands by 2030 as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51%. Yet, Ardee Bog, an unprotected peatland, has become a victim of Ireland's fragmented conservation framework.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A victory for development?</emphasis></h><p>In May 2024, the High Court dismissed a judicial review brought by environmental group Friends of Ardee Bog (ardeebog.ie), which challenged An Bord Plean\u00e1la's decision that neither a natura impact statement nor an environmental impact assessment report was needed for the proposed N52 Ardee bypass. The bypass, a 4.5km road designed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve connectivity, is set to traverse Ardee Bog. Friends of Ardee Bog argued that the lack of these assessments overlooked serious environmental risks, including carbon emissions from peat disturbance, habitat destruction, and increased flooding potential.</p><p>However, Justice Miriam O'Regan ruled that the group had not sufficiently demonstrated flaws in An Bord Plean\u00e1la's determination, effectively dismissing the case on all counts.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The loophole</emphasis></h><p>The decision to build a road through Ardee Bog highlights a major weakness in Ireland's climate and environmental laws. Many peatlands are left unprotected unless they are designated as special areas of conservation (SACs) or natural heritage areas (NHAs).</p><p>While flagship peatlands enjoy robust safeguards under the EU Habitats Directive, smaller or degraded bogs such as Ardee are effectively invisible in policy. This gap leaves these ecosystems vulnerable to development pressures, despite their importance as carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots. Ireland's reliance on designations to protect specific sites ignores the broader network of peatlands that together contribute to national climate resilience.</p><p>Friends of Ardee Bog responded: \"We hoped a reasoned engagement would result in deviation of the route to avoid the core proposed NHA and the area most favoured by waders and migrating red listed birds, for example. Sadly, this did not happen and much to our disappointment no recognition whatsoever has been given to the bog and its true value [wasn't] acknowledged as an ecosystem let alone as a mitigation factor in climate change.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economic costs of climate inaction</emphasis></h><p>This case also raises concerns about the broader economic implications of failing to meet Ireland's climate targets. According to a 2023 report from the European Court of Auditors, failing to comply with EU climate regulations could cost Ireland over  2bn by 2030 in non-compliance fines and penalties alone. In addition, the longer-term costs of inaction are staggering. Research by the Irish Climate Advisory Council suggests that climate-related damages, such as flooding, droughts, and extreme weather events, could cost Ireland  5bn annually by mid-century if emissions are not curbed. These figures dwarf the projected economic benefits of infrastructure projects such as the Ardee bypass.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contradictions in climate action</emphasis></h><p>The decision to build through Ardee Bog is not just a local issue, it is emblematic of a wider inconsistency in Ireland's climate approach. On the one hand, the Government is funding peatland restoration projects through initiatives such as the EU Life Programme, spending millions on rewetting bogs to reduce carbon emissions. On the other hand, developments such as the Ardee road project actively degrade peatlands, releasing the very emissions that restoration projects aim to sequester.</p><p>Draining peatlands for construction leads to substantial emissions of carbon dioxide. Research suggests that drained peatlands emit up to 30 tonnes of CO per hectare per year, turning natural carbon sinks into carbon sources. Allowing the destruction of Ardee Bog for a road sends a contradictory message about Ireland's commitment to climate leadership.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Planning policy v climate goals</emphasis></h><p>Ireland's planning policies also reveal a critical tension between development priorities and environmental goals. The Ardee project was approved despite environmental assessments highlighting potential damage. Moreover, the Climate Action Plan's sectoral targets for transport and land use do not adequately address how to prevent peatland degradation through infrastructure projects. Without aligning planning policy with climate action objectives, Ireland risks undermining its environmental progress.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Closing the loopholes</emphasis></h><p>The controversy over Ardee Bog is a wake-up call. If we are serious about achieving climate goals, we must address these policy gaps and extend legal safeguards beyond SACs and NHAs to include smaller, fragmented, and degraded peatlands that are still ecologically and climatically valuable. Ireland needs to integrate climate goals into planning laws to ensure infrastructure projects undergo stricter climate assessments and require carbon accounting for developments impacting peatlands.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The bigger picture</emphasis></h><p>Ardee Bog's fate is a litmus test for Ireland's climate action and environmental governance. While the N52 bypass may bring local economic benefits, it is at the cost of a unique ecosystem that has taken thousands of years to develop. The decision to sacrifice Ardee Bog reveals not only the fragility of Ireland's peatland protections but also inconsistencies in our approach to balancing development with climate action. If Ireland fails to close the loopholes exposed by the Ardee Bog case, we risk both financial penalties and the loss of natural resources critical to our climate resilience.

Adaptation means anticipating the adverse effects of our already changing climate and taking appropriate action to prevent or minimise the damage from extreme weather events which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the coming years. Indeed, EUT requires businesses to assess the future resilience of assets to our changing climate, for a business activity to be considered sustainable.</p><p>The importance of adaptation is further highlighted through Ireland's second National Adaptation Framework (2024) which mandates the development of adaptation strategies by 13 key sectors of the Irish Economy and recognises the critical role businesses play in delivering national resilience through the development of new solutions and business practices.</p><p>Dr Barry O'Dwyer is a Director in KPMG Sustainable Futures and leads the Climate Risk Team.

CBD COP16 has just ended in Cali in Colombia - the first biodiversity COP since the landmark Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was agreed in 2022. The sharp increase in corporate attendance and the announcement that 502 organisations globally have committed to adopting TNFDaligned nature-related risk management and corporate reporting is testament to how seriously a growing number of businesses are taking these topics.</p><p>In Ireland, 2024 saw the launch of the 4th National Biodiversity Action Plan (NBAP) - Ireland's contribution to the Global Biodiversity Framework. Many of the NBAP actions relate to government, local authorities, and civil society, but businesses and financial institutions must also play their part in tackling nature loss.

With a circularity rate of 1.8%, Ireland currently lags well behind the EU average of 12.8%. This traditional, non-sustainable economic model is not only wasteful and harmful to the natural environment, but it is also a barrier to progress against national climate targets, particularly for the waste sector.</p><p>At present, many business models are centred around linear economies due to this model being engrained in modern society, such as extracting oil to manufacture single-use plastic products and disposing of them in landfill. In contrast, a circular economy model aims to close the loop and adopt a 'take-make-remake' pathway for resources, seeking to prolong product lifecycles for as long as possible and ensuring waste materials can be salvaged and re-used as input materials elsewhere.

It is easy to understand why so much recent climate policy focuses on electrification.</p><p>Homes with A-rated energy certifications are more efficient: they lose less heat, thus require less energy to stay warm, and use renewable energy sources. Heat pumps are a genius alternative to carbon-heavy oil or gas boilers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/heat-pumps_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">enormously reducing emissions</url>.\u00a0Much like our electric cars, trading fossil fuels for renewable energy.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6607020/original/?width=580&amp;version=6607020\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>But this shift has come with a blind spot. By replacing fires, gas stoves and oil boilers with systems that are entirely grid-dependent, we're creating a new kind of vulnerability. When the grid goes down, as it did for three-quarter of a million homes last week, those that rely solely on electric systems are left completely inoperable. No heat. No way to cook. And for those relying on electric pumps, no access to water.</p><p><br/></p><p>I'm not here to argue against the electric evolution. It is absolutely the right direction for the planet. What is clear, in these early stages of adoption, is that we need to pair it with backup systems that work in emergencies.</p><h>How to balance?</h><p>So, how do we balance sustainability with resilience? The good news is there are many ways to build a sustainable home while maintaining a little resilience along the way:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Backup heating systems</emphasis></p><p> If you're switching from oil or gas to a heat pump, consider also installing a solid fuel wood-burning stove, as a backup heating system.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6607032/original/?width=580&amp;version=6607032\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Modern stoves are highly efficient and burn with a much lower carbon footprint than traditional open fires.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Renewable energy at home </emphasis></p><p>If you're installing solar panels, consider adding battery storage with an emergency socket. A 5kW battery can keep essential appliances, such as your fridge and freezer, running for up to 24 hours during a power outage. Small-scale wind turbines are another good option, particularly in rural areas with consistent wind.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6607034/original/?width=580&amp;version=6607034\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>While these systems won't fully replace grid power, they can provide enough energy to keep essential systems operational. If these feel out of reach due to their high price points, a portable solar panel to charge your phone can ease some anxiety.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Water storage and filtration </emphasis></p><p>Water outages are often an overlooked consequence of storms. And in a climate like Ireland's, the obvious answer is in the sky.</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6607036/original/?width=580&amp;version=6607036\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>A rainwater harvesting system can collect and store water for non-drinking uses, such as flushing toilets and washing dishes. For drinking water, a gravity-fed filtration system or portable filters can ensure you have safe, clean water, even when mains water is unavailable.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cooking without electricity </emphasis></p><p>Consider installing a gas hob rather than an electric hob in your home. Alternatively, ensure you have a small camping stove or portable gas cooker in storage. Keep in mind that butane gas freezes at -0.5\u00a0\u00b0C so it won't work in very cold weather, while propane gas has a much lower freezing point of -42\u00a0\u00b0C. Also, make sure you have a stock of non-perishable food that can be prepared without much cooking.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Learning practical skills </emphasis></p><p>One of the most empowering things you can do is learn practical skills to become more self-sufficient. Take every opportunity you can to learn how your home works and how you can better work with it. Learn from your neighbours, friends, grandparents and elders - many of whom are well-versed in resilient, conscious living.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6607037/original/?width=580&amp;version=6607037\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>At Common Knowledge, we teach skills like basic carpentry and plumbing and simple solar set ups. Knowing how to take care of your home and adapt during emergencies can make a huge difference when the pressure is on.</p><h>True sustainability</h><p>Storm \u00c9owyn is our reminder that true sustainability is not just about reducing carbon emissions, it is also about ensuring our homes and communities can withstand the challenges of a changing climate. You can install the most energy-efficient systems in your home, but if they leave you entirely dependent on the grid, how sustainable for you are they really?</p><p>True sustainability is about resilience. It is about creating systems that work for you in all situations - whether the grid is up or down.</p><p>And it is about recognising that sometimes, the old ways of doing things still have a place in our modern lives.

Unwieldy and interminably slow in reaching a decision by consensus, critics dismiss Cops as ineffective talking shops; a  circus of parties . Yet against the odds, they frequently drive change.</p><h>Is the Paris Agreement  fit for purpose? </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><h>In the room will be signatories to the Paris Agreement   almost 200 countries   a monument to collective action. It is a guiding map, reinforced by climate science, showing the way to a more benign physical world, less polluted and healthier   nature balanced with humanity.</h><p>But it is flawed.</p><p>Countries have committed to hold warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial times and to work to limit this to 1.5 degrees. But the agreement allows each country to determine what contribution it makes to these efforts. This inevitably led to a wide gap between collective goals and national commitments. The bottom line is that the collective response is wholly inadequate given what is facing Earth.</p><h>Where are we on temperature and emissions goals? </h><p/><h>It s best summarised in three words: over the limit. This year is set to become the first on record when average temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, breaching that Paris threshold   though this has to happen over years to be declared lost.</h><p>Emissions are at unprecedented levels, especially from burning fossil fuels. Global temperatures are at their highest in human history. Like a household budget, climate science sets a carbon budget on greenhouse gases that can be  spent  (emitted) for a given level of global warming. If we exceed this budget, global temperatures will become higher. We continue to exceed that budget to an alarming extent.</p><h>Is anything helping us to  get to a better place? </h><p/><h>Many countries have pledged to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions, the main antagonists of warming. Added to that, a clean energy revolution is gathering pace. The single biggest way to pivot the world is to replace fossil fuels with renewables as the prime energy source. It is the quickest route to a decarbonised world.</h><p>Analysis would suggest this is unstoppable, despite US president-elect Donald Trump s return to the White House.</p><h>Why should Ireland  slash emissions? </h><p/><h>Ireland generates a mere 0.1 per cent of global emissions, so on the surface it s not our problem. But for many reasons that s not a sustainable position. As climate scientist Peter Thorne has highlighted:  Ireland has among the highest per capita greenhouse emissions in Europe.  We put a small proportion of total emissions into the atmosphere, but if every person in the globe had the historical emissions profile of Ireland, global mean temperature today would be north of 3 degrees. In short, the world would be cooked and humanity would be lucky to survive..</h><p>We need to get a handle on this, Thorne added.  If we can t solve these challenges, challenges on the island of Ireland, then where on Earth can? We have a highly educated population. We have, fundamentally, the capital resources. We have the nimbleness, if it is our priority to act faster. </p><p>What s more, climate disruption is already on our doorstep. Intense rainfall and associated flooding may be a permanent threat to Irish food production.</p><p>Ireland has continued to dodge a bullet and is overdue a storm surge several metres high; not quite of the scale that hit Spain s Valencia region but enough to cause widespread damage. Infrastructure across the island cannot cope with the impacts of climate extremes already happening. </p><h>  So the climate response is  an ethical/fairness issue?</h><p/><h> Yes, and a lot more. The world cannot decarbonise with ensuring climate justice, but ultimately achieving net-zero emissions brings huge economic opportunity   notwithstanding upfront costs and rocky terrain ahead.</h><p>That transition needs to empower people, not heap blame on them. Climate guilt should rest primarily with Big Oil and carbon polluting industries.</p><h>So what are key agenda  items at Cop29?</h><p/><h> By some distance it is about money and resetting a climate finance goal. A target of $100 billion a year from developed countries for vulnerable countries is in place.</h><p>Remarkably, there is broad agreement this should scale to trillions but gaping differences over who should pay, how much and sources of finance.</p><p>The EU is pushing for much more diversified funding sources, including private finance. What constitutes a rich country is also contested. </p><p>A 1992 list doesn t include China and many wealthy petrostates despite their economic might after decades of growth. Setting out a credible path towards that target will be key to building trust. Ireland s Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has been asked to play a lead role on adaptation measures to build climate resilience in developing countries.</p><p>Again, this will require money on the table but also, as he sees it, a better way of addressing climate and development.</p><p>A good outcome at Cop29 could provide momentum on overall negotiations and progress parts of the Paris Agreement to ensure meaningful carbon trading and transparency on credits. </p><h>With Trump likely to pull  out , does that make  Cop29 largely irrelevant? World leaders from almost 100 countries are gathered in Baku and Trump will be the main conversation topic. </h><p>The US   the country responsible for most emissions historically and currently the world s second largest emitter   is walking away from its responsibilities. </p><p>It risks heightening fear about inevitable emission impacts in coming years as Trump ratchets up oil and gas production. This may translate into paralysis that scuppers Cop29.</p><p>In the past alliances of more ambitious countries formed during Cops and helped forge strong outcomes against the odds, often with unlikely partners. But big economic blocs, the EU and China, will have to provide leadership and drive the process on this occasion in spite of what has been described as the  Trump whiplash  looming over the talks.  </p><h>Surely a small country like Ireland has minimal impact? </h><p/><h>This is far from the case.</h><p>Ireland has an excellent record in international diplomacy and especially development, in how it supports poorer countries and its presence on the ground. Ireland s negotiating team in recent Cops has played an important role, especially in securing a landmark loss and damage fund.  Ireland s position can be a bridging position between the Global North and the Global South,  Ryan told a pre-Cop29 briefing. </p><h>What s the best that  can be hoped for? Some will adopt a nihilistic view and declare the 1.5 degree target dead in the water. The evidence suggests, however, the world is a different place since Trump was first elected in 2016 and a green economic race, rather than politics, is driving decarbonisation.</h><p>Leaders of this transition need to reunite parties under the Paris Agreement, while increasing ambition and accelerating actions, for Cop29 to be declared a success.</p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["A 1992 list doesn t include China and many wealthy petrostates despite their economic might after decades of growth.

To make Cop16 effective, three things need to happen.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Decide on a plan</emphasis></h><p>When delegates gather in Cali, questions of implementation will be front and centre. How to monitor progress on all 23 targets - including issues such as improving access to nature in cities, reducing harmful subsidies, and restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems - has not yet been agreed.</p><p>For some, the approach so far has lacked ambition. Suggestions of how to monitor the impact of consumption on nature remain very weak, for example. For others, monitoring may prove too challenging.</p><p>For example, countries with limited access to data might not be able to track alien species or assess how critical services provided by nature to make societies more resilient might be affected by climate change.</p><p>Getting agreement at the Cop16 negotiations will be vital in order to hold countries to account as the 2030 deadline approaches.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Find the funds</emphasis></h><p>Another crucial issue is funding: Who will pay for the action required? The global biodiversity framework fund (GBFF) was established in 2023 to provide financial support.</p><p>Yet, so far, it has only attracted contributions of $230bn from a small group of countries, including Canada, Britain, Germany, Japan, and Spain.</p><p>Leaders gathering in Cali, and especially those from developing countries, are calling for more funding and for greater control over how it is allocated.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Make biodiversity matter</emphasis></h><p>A third debate will decide how best to ensure biodiversity action is mainstreamed across governments, businesses, and communities.</p><p>In Montreal, countries agreed to make sure the impacts on nature were considered across different policy areas (such as new roads or new energy sources) and in economic sectors, from fishing to agriculture and mining to tech.</p><p>They agreed that groups most likely to be affected by the loss of nature, including indigenous people and local communities, women and youth, should help make key decisions.</p><p>While targets such as protecting 30% of the land and sea for nature are crucial, progress will only happen if nature is put on everyone's bottom line.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4.

There is a real risk that the promise countries made in Montreal, to deliver \"transformative action by governments, and regional and local authorities, with the involvement of all of society\", will not be met.</p><p>However, there are some hopeful signs of transformative change to conserve and restore nature and ensure its sustainable use.</p><p>Take, for example, the Tree Equity Partnership in Detroit, US. This partnership between the city, USbased charity American Forests, and the local nonprofit charity, Greening of Detroit, aims to plant 75,000 trees.</p><p>This will create places of beauty, biodiversity, and climate resilience in underserved neighbourhoods and generate 300 jobs in the city.</p><p>In Pakistan, the Living Indus initiative is an umbrella organisation that has identified 25 projects, involving local and regional governments, businesses, and communities working together to restore the ecological health of the Indus river.</p><p>Businesses are also calling for real change. More than 170 investors have signed a pledge developed by a coalition of financial institutions, called the Finance for Biodiversity Foundation, to take action for nature across their portfolios.</p><p>New science-based standards are being developed to drive the mainstreaming of biodiversity action through their companies and associated supply chains.</p><p>Cop16 is expected to see increased interest from the private sector and a focus on tackling climate change and biodiversity together.</p><p>These projects are successfully tackling the root causes of global biodiversity loss.</p><p>They integrate solutions and deal with social and environmental issues - poverty and exploitation, climate risks, and land-use change.</p><p>Tackling these problems is just as vital as the need for sustainable production and consumption, plus investment that works for, and not against, nature.</p><p>Projects such as these are the ones that give scientists and conservationists like me - and organisations like WWF, with which I work - hope.

I didn t ask for this mapping process, but our co-operatives arranged it,  he said.  They said when we supply to the companies, they want some papers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most people haven t heard of the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), the bloc s new law aimed at tackling climate change and halting biodiversity loss, let alone in a remote corner of Indonesia. Yet, it s threatening far-reaching consequences for more than $110 billion (EUR 102 billion) of trade annually, economies across six continents and suppliers struggling to get to grips with the reality of Europe s drive to be greener.</p><p>Come the end of the year, large companies handling seven key commodities   coffee, cocoa, soy, palm oil, cattle, rubber and wood   and products derived from them will be required to prove that people in their supply chains didn t work land that was deforested after 2020, legally or illegally.</p><p>That means that every coffee bean   along with such things as chocolate, tyres and books   will need to be traced to the exact locations they came from, or the EU will levy hefty penalties.</p><p>There are more than 55 countries that each export on average at least $100 million a year of goods to the EU that will be affected by EUDR. The impact will depend on the commodities they ship, who buys them and whether there are resources to handle farm mapping and all the necessary paperwork. But already there are warnings of higher prices for consumers in Europe, including Ireland.</p><p>The task is magnified in coffee. It s reliant on millions of smallholder growers scattered across dozens of countries. Many lack the means to show they can comply with the law.</p><p> We really are starting just to see the scale of this challenge around the globe,  said Elizabeth Teague, senior director of climate resilience at Root Capital, an impact investor supporting small-scale farmers in the transition.  Everyone is trying to scramble and respond to the EUDR reality. </p><p>Small nations like Honduras risk losing customers in Europe, an economic lifeblood.  We re working against the clock,  said Celso Alvarado, a regional coordinator for the Honduran Coffee Institute, which assists one of the nation s critical export industries.</p><p>Then there are countries with opaque supply chains, such as Ethiopia, home to the greatest number of smallholder coffee farmers. They re the backbone of the economy but are often poor, unprepared and unequipped to respond to the law.</p><p> There s the abject fear of countries over what this will mean for their exports and therefore their bottom line,  said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, executive director of the International Trade Centre, which works with vulnerable economies.</p><h>Watering down </h><p>Nobody disputes the need to protect forests. In just three decades, the world lost an estimated 4.2 million square kilometres (1.6 million square miles) of woodlands, an area larger than the EU itself.</p><p>At the COP26 climate summit in 2021, more than 100 nations pledged to halt and reverse that trend. While some have watered down their promises, the EU is sticking with it, arguing it s a matter of credibility after receiving overwhelming public support.</p><p>A spokesperson for the European Commission said the EU is committed to addressing concerns and to ensuring the successful roll-out of EUDR. The inclusion of smallholders in the ongoing dialogue is a priority, they said. The EU has a EUR 70 million fund to help support them in partner countries.</p><p>But adapting to the new rules highlights the scale of the challenge to introduce green policies, some of which are already facing a backlash. Ever since it came into force last June, the piece of Brussels legislation has led to calls to delay it, numerous letters of concern over its implementation and heavy lobbying from governments.</p><p>Industry groups as diverse as coffee roasters, parquet-floor makers, printers and farmers have expressed concerns over the law. Countries as far as Australia have asked for a delay until the requirements are understood well enough. Traders have blamed the EUDR for adding to this year s surge in cocoa prices. Coffee-trading nations warned of a potential shortage in Europe.</p><p>The law has also struck a nerve across the less-developed world, much of which still endures the legacy of Europe s colonial past. Indonesia branded EUDR a form of  regulatory imperialism  while Paraguay s industry minister recently spoke out in defence of his country s  legal sovereignty. </p><p>In recent weeks, even some EU member states have expressed concern their farmers and companies haven t got enough time to prepare, and calling for a  swift revision  and an extension of the implementation period.</p><p>Meanwhile, the race is on to prove that farms haven t been involved in deforestation and comply with local laws. Companies, governments and farmer co-operatives are busy geolocating land around the world.</p><p>In Amsterdam, Thomas Vaassen oversees a laborious process of field-data verification from more than 35 countries, and mapping of farms in Indonesia, Ivory Coast and Ghana.</p><p>The company he runs, Meridia Land, is in high demand from some of the biggest consumer brands and traders   Unilever, Mondelez and Cargill to name a few. Its clients have doubled since the EUDR was announced in late 2021 and it s got a pipeline to verify millions more farms, said Vaassen.</p><p>He estimates that about half of the farms caught up in EUDR may not have been mapped.  Thousands and thousands of people are now geolocating farms around the world   there s a huge ongoing effort,  said Vaassen.  There are millions of farms and they all have to be mapped in a few years. </p><p>EU officials say that presenting the exact locations of farms can be easily done with a phone and for smallholders. But the reality is turning out to be more complex, with many farmers without connectivity, the right training, and   most importantly   little awareness of what s coming.</p><h>Daunting task </h><p>What s at stake is evident in Honduras, whose economy relies on exports of textiles, coffee and palm oil. With a GDP per capita of about $3,000, it is among the poorest countries in the western hemisphere.</p><p>About half of its coffee exports go to the EU, which together with palm oil, makes it one of the most dependent nations for trade with the bloc   some 3.5 per cent of the country s GDP. Europe takes coffee shipped from family farms largely in remote, hilly areas. Climate change and an exodus of workers to the US have hurt the industry in recent years.</p><p>Most of the country isn t ready for the EUDR regulations, according to the Honduran Coffee Institute, known as IHCAFE. The group has just 120 experts to assist some 120,000 growers in preparation for the law, according to Alvarado, the coordinator for the mountainous region of Yoro.  The risk is that a lot of Honduran farmers lose access to the European market,  he said.</p><p>Less than 20 per cent of Honduran farmers are ready for EUDR due to reasons like a lack of traceability or due diligence, according to Dimitra, which is currently covering the mapping costs at Comisuyl farms.</p><p>Tracing supplies all the way to their farms can be a daunting task. That challenge is writ large in Ethiopia, regarded as the birthplace of coffee, but with centuries-old production techniques and opaque supply chains. Coffee is Ethiopia s number one source of export revenue and the EU is its top customer, accounting for about a third of shipments.</p><p>There are at least 2 million coffee farmers in the country, more than anywhere else in the world, according to Enveritas. It estimates some 40 per cent of them live under the poverty line.</p><p>Farms are remote, tiny, at times rendering a few bags of coffee in a year, which then get handled through a chain of brokers and mixed up, making traceability even harder. Before it leaves the ports of Djibouti or Kenya for overseas markets, one cargo could potentially come from thousands of farms.</p><p>The Oromia Coffee Farmers  Cooperative Union has so far managed to map out about 5,000 farms out of its 557,000 members, at a cost of some $4 a farm.</p><p>Ethiopia will suffer significant losses if it fails to meet the requirements,  said Dejene Dadi, Oromia co-op s general manager.  And for the EU member states, it holds little significance. </p><p>As the clock ticks, the EU is dispatching more officials on an information tour about the EUDR. Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius himself recently toured Latin America and Africa where the legislation was a subject of discussions with local governments. Not finalising and implementing the legislation  would be a huge mistake for this planet, for our climate resilience,  Sinkevicius said in March.</p><p>But seven months before the legislation formally kicks in, the implementation details   from how the mapping data gets added to the EU s computer systems to how the arriving cargoes are policed by authorities   are yet to be fully disclosed. The bloc has already deferred categorising supplier countries by their risk status until a later date.</p><h>Higher prices </h><p>Meanwhile, there are small signs of how the regulation is quietly starting to reshape trade. Palm oil exporters are already diverting hard-to-trace supplies to regions outside Europe, raising concerns it may undermine efforts to eradicate deforestation.</p><p>Ethiopia s farmers are exploring alternative markets in Saudi Arabia, China and Russia. Uganda, another large coffee exporter dependent on the EU, is meanwhile trying to expand its trade with Russia and the Balkans, according to a local government agency.</p><p>One thing is clear. Farmers and companies want to get compensated for their efforts to comply. And that spells higher prices for European consumers.</p><p>In Honduras, farmers at the Comisuyl co-op   who for decades have ensured the land remains forested   expect to make at least $10 a bag more on top of the market price, according to farmer Wilson Cardenas.</p><p> We aren t asking for handouts and we don t want to be given stuff for free, but we want buyers to understand that this requires more effort, more technical knowledge and more labour,  said Cardenas as farmers gathered in Comisuyl s warehouse to sample recently harvested coffee.

From the very first moment man began to farm we shaped the world around us, clearing forests, breaking rocks, planting seeds, and making space to nurture animals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As time passed, we etched and moulded the earth to fit our needs. Inventions such as fertiliser enabled our population to swell from 1bn to 8bn over a very short period of time.</p><p>The production of our food continues to shape the land in ever-increasing and, at times, alarming ways. As our population and our hunger grew, so too did the damage. The need to mitigate this damage has been dawning for the past few decades because the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are becoming more prevalent, and more difficult to ignore.</p><p>One way to help the next generation to undo some of the things that have been done is through education. Food education is seen as key by many, but what exactly does it mean?</p><p>If we teach a child to cook but do not have a conversation about where the ingredients for the recipe come from we are missing a vital point.</p><p>Children knowing how their food is grown or produced is as important as knowing the skills to prepare it for themselves.</p><p>Food education is a great way to teach children that there are tangible things that they can do in regard to biodiversity loss, that actions matter and that they can take positive steps and help find solutions.</p><p>There are some vibrant educational initiatives that are supporting schools to teach about the environment and the role food plays within it.</p><p>Green-Schools is Ireland's, and in fact Europe's, leading environmental educator. It provides education within 94% of schools, primary and secondary. Its flags can been seen fluttering outside schools up and down the country.</p><p>Those flags are not easy for a school to obtain. The students have to complete a number of steps and make changes within their school over two years to earn the flag. The students focus on topics such as recycling, water, and more recently food.</p><p>I worked alongside Green-Schools staff to create a pilot programme in eight schools to build the new theme that educates about food and biodiversity.</p><p>There was such positive feedback and tangible results that the programme is now being rolled out nationwide. The feedback from teachers and children has been very encouraging.</p><p>After completing the programme, one teacher said that \"the children are now able to bring their knowledge of food, food waste and global issues into the wider world to be shared\".</p><p>Another teacher in Co Louth said the opportunity to eat what the children had sown had a positive effect on all the pupils. She described the children sampling radishes and varieties of lettuce, experimenting with recipes for potatoes and beetroot and shelling their own peas.</p><p>It is lovely to read that \"the children loved getting involved with all the hands-on aspects such as planting, growing, weeding, harvesting, and cooking.</p><p>\"Children were excited to try the crops that they had grown and were eager to look after the crops that they grew.\"</p><p>One school said growing and nurturing food in the garden also encouraged some of their picky eaters to try new fruit and vegetables.</p><p>GIY, which is based in Galway, also works with schools around fruit and vegetable growing and help teachers to create an edible garden. A project called Biodiversity in Schools, which is based in Co Longford, helps to support schools that want to create a food garden or an outdoor classroom on their grounds.</p><p>Fostering an interest in food and nature at a young age has been proven to enhance relationships with food as children get older.</p><p>There is another aspect of food education that is also important and cannot be overlooked.</p><p>Every child is exposed to food advertising on a daily basis and much of that is cleverly focused on getting their attention.</p><p>This advertising does not generally focus on selling a sprig of broccoli or an onion, it is mainly focused on selling ultra-processed foods that yield high profits and tend not to be sourced from nature.</p><p>Companies spend millions on advertising, with budgets that far overshadow government spending on health messages. The companies would not invest in this way if their tactics did not work. We can help children to navigate this complicated world through education looking at how companies use marketing to entice us all.</p><p>Food education has a lot to give. As well as learning about marketing, air miles, and how to reduce packaging, children can learn the importance of food traditions to people from different parts of the world. This can engender empathy and create connections across cultures.</p><p>Even if children do not share the same language they can learn together and see that that people from different countries host similar meals on celebrated days, use the same ingredients in their cooking, or enjoy sharing sweet treats for a family birthday.</p><p>While at home families may not be able to grow all the food they need to feed themselves, having a few edible plants in pots on a windowsill shows children that growing food takes time and care and putting your hands in the soil is proven to lift our mood.</p><p>Schools are not the only places where we can teach children about where food comes from. There is a growing movement of community gardens and these provide places where families can come together to gain knowledge and enjoy the neighbourly aspect of a shared food-growing space.</p><p>A new project funded by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications called 'Our Shared Plate' recognises the power of connection over food. It is working with communities in the Midlands to increase food security and climate resilience by developing educational workshops and creating shared growing and eating spaces.</p><p>It is a hopeful time, young people are very engaged in the debate about biodiversity and caring for the ecosystem in a way they were not when I was younger.</p><p>There is a lot of momentum coming from the European Union on local food.

Will Dunkettle make a difference to traffic levels? Will east Cork now be open to all? And, per my research assistants, whatever happened to the rabbit colony that flourished in the middle of the old Dunkettle interchange, and what does that tell us?</p><p>That's why I picked up the phone to call Ben Goldfarb, author of a new book which caught my eye - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crossings: How Road Ecology Is Shaping the Future of Our Planet</emphasis>.</p><p>A sample paragraph?</p><p>\"Our midcentury automotive revolution spawned not only highways but also parking lots, driveways, suburbs, pipelines, gas stations, carwashes, drive-throughs, tire shops and strip malls, a totalising ecosystem engineered for its dominant organism, the car.\"</p><p>That's the good news, by the way. On our call, Ben laid out some of the \"many different forms of damage\" done by roads. Like roadkill.</p><p>\"That's the most visible one, we've all seen dead animals on the roads. Here in the States we see deer and raccoon, among others, while in Ireland you'll see badgers and foxes.</p><p>\"But that's the tip of the iceberg. There are so many other issues, like the barrier effect - there are these walls of traffic that many animals don't attempt to cross. As a result, they can't access habitat and food and mates. In the US there are many examples of animals which have starved because they can't cross roads to get food.</p><p>\"There's noise pollution - the grumble of engines and tyres chase animals away from places they might want to live, while songbirds which have to sing to attract a mate ... if the mate can't hear the song over the noise of the traffic, then the birds don't mate and the population dies out.\"</p><p>(It's not just bad news for the birds, either: he adds that noise pollution is demonstrably bad for human beings.)</p><p>There's also overt pollution to contend with: \"There are tyre particles entering the environment - six million tons of tyre particles get into rivers around the world every year, while the chemicals in tyres have killed salmon in American rivers in enormous numbers.</p><p>\"Some of these problems are visible and obvious, but many others are hidden.\"</p><p>Some of those problems are bad news on the double, he adds. Take the roadkill: \"This is really important - in nature predators take out the weak, the sick, and the old, those are precisely the animals targeted because they're the easiest prey to catch.</p><p>\"Cars are not discerning predators, they kill everything in their path, including the strongest and healthiest animals. Those are the animals which may be the most important for the breeding population, but unfortunately they're getting killed as well - and maybe in higher numbers because they're the ones with the strength to try to cross the roads in the first place.\"</p><p>The harm being done by roads doesn't seem to stop once you start taking notice, but that appears to be the key element. For instance, we notice that bigger animals are killed: what about the smaller ones?</p><p>When you're speeding along in a steel-and-glass cocoon, coffee at the elbow and music on the stereo, then you don't notice as much about the environment. Ben agreed.</p><p>\"One of the experiences I had, which attests to what you're saying, was doing a roadkill survey on a bicycle. My wife and I cycled along this giant highway, with cars flying by at seventy miles an hour.</p><p>\"And when you're out of the car yourself, out of that bubble and travelling at a slower speed, closer to the ground, then you notice the environment in a very different way.</p><p>\"Something we noted in that survey, for instance, was how many dead birds were on the road. It was lined with them. In the US we kill approximately 300 million birds with our cars every year, but those are deaths you would never notice if sealed off from the environment in a car.</p><p>\"That's the double effect - cars kill animals while also blinding their drivers to that killing. It's not until you're on foot or on a bike that you recognise how destructive these roadways are.\"</p><p>He also pointed out the contradictions involved in using roads to get to nature.</p><p>\"I'm in Colorado, which has great hiking and so on, but the way you get to the hiking is by driving, which is a great irony. Roads are how we get to nature even though they're often destroying nature, as I've said.</p><p>\"Irish readers will be familiar with many of the big national parks here in America, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, but the way to access nature in those parks is by car. Nearly every one of those parks has a huge road going right through the middle of it, and that's how people fall in love with the nature in those areas.</p><p>\"Historically the automobile industry was a big advocate for creating those parks in order to give people somewhere to drive to. Those are really difficult subjects to disentangle because roads, cars, and national parks are all linked here.\"</p><p>I found this particularly interesting because the obvious necessity for roads is entangled, to use Ben's phrase, with other subjects - not just cars and national parks, in this case, but employment patterns, school enrolments, public transport availability. There are so many strands of contemporary life deeply involved with the road network that it can be difficult to get a view from the outside.</p><p>For all the catastrophic effects on wildlife of roads and road users, Ben sounded a positive note as well.</p><p>\"Roadkill is a problem but we also have an idea about how to address it. In the book I mention overpasses and underpasses for nature, tunnels animals can use - those are features which help them avoid cars, and I know that those are used in Ireland as well as America.\"</p><p>(Correct - take the badger underpasses at the Fermoy by-pass as an example.)</p><p>\"So at least there's a sense of how to address this, and many counties are trying to mitigate this as we try to preserve biodiversity on the planet.\"</p><p>Too late for the Dunkettle rabbits, maybe.

The answer, as we re discovering, is to take a nature-friendly approach that supports and nurtures resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One obvious example is the use of paving in our front gardens, which often double up as much-needed car parking spaces. Unfortunately the widespread use of impermeable materials such as concrete and Tarmac contributes significantly to the problem of urban flash flooding, resulting in water run-off that puts huge stress on struggling urban drainage and sewage systems already under pressure. Not only can this also contaminate wildlife-rich waterways as a result, but it contributes to soil pollution, leading to less than ideal growing conditions for the plants in our gardens and cities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Impermeable garden paving materials also contribute to the problem of soil shrinkage during prolonged dry periods, sometimes leading to problems with building subsidence. In urban areas in particular they compound the problem of summer heat extremes, interfering with the naturally cooling effects of the ground. If you ve ever walked down a city street in a heatwave you ll have experienced this first-hand.</p><h>Permeable materials  In this case the best solution is to replace garden paving materials such as concrete, Tarmac and tiles with any of a variety of permeable materials that allow water to naturally percolate through the soil. Examples include pebble or gravel laid on to an  open-graded  permeable hardcore base; pebble or gravel laid on to a moulded plastic or concrete  honeycomb  structure of interlocking cells that stabilises the ground and makes it suitable for heavy traffic (these structures are also known as  matrix pavers  or  geo-matrices ); open-joint brick pavers laid on a permeable base where the fine joints between bricks are left open for drainage; natural stone laid on a permeable base where the joints are filled with a permeable mortar or left open; and hard-wearing lawns using species of grass recommended for intensive use, grown through a rigid plastic or concrete honeycomb structure similar to that described above, resulting in a resilient, permeable surface that can tolerate a surprising degree of heavy traffic.</h><p>Unfortunately not all landscapers and designers follow best practice in this regard despite the efforts of city councils to highlight the problem. To find one that does check out the websites of reputable associations such as the Garden and Landscape Designers Association (glda.ie) and the Association of Landscape Contractors of Ireland (alci.ie).</p><p>Permeable paving aside, the simple act of planting even just one small garden tree helps to counter the effects of climate change in innumerable ways. Not only will its leafy canopy provide shelter from harsh winds, fierce winter frosts, torrential downpours and summer droughts (all of which negatively impact soil and plant health), but its large and intricate root system also naturally improves drainage and protects soil structure.</p><p>Trees also lock in carbon, clean polluted air, filter noise, and provide a precious habitat for countless species of garden wildlife, while the fallen leaves of deciduous species provide a nourishing and protective organic blanket for the soil at that time of the year when it s most needed. Examples of species suitable for small gardens include Cornus kousa var. chinensis (Chinese dogwood), the Japanese maple known as Acer palmatum  Sango Kaku , and the compact variety of serviceberry known as Amelanchier  Ballerina , as well as cultivated forms of hawthorn (Crataegus), crab apple (Malus) and birch (Betula).</p><p>Unfortunately climate change also threatens the health of an increasing number of tree species as a result of the rise in pests and diseases (many of them new to our shores) as well as unfavourable growing conditions caused by flooding and drought. For a comprehensive guide to choosing climate-resilient species most suitable for your garden get your hands on a copy of  The Essential Tree Selection Guide for Climate Resilience, Carbon Storage, Species Diversity and other Ecosystem Benefits  by Henrik Sj\u00f6man and Arit Anderson, recently published in association with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</p><p>No space for a tree? Then the good news is that garden hedges, especially flowering and fruiting kinds that use a high percentage of ultra-hardy native species such as hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), guelder  rose (Viburnum opulus) and spindle (Euonymus europaeus), provide a similar range of benefits. But the same can t be said for most garden boundary walls (dry-stone walls being the notable exception), which further contribute to the problem of urban flooding as well as the fragmentation of garden wildlife habitats.</p><p>Leaving aside the bitter cold and fierce storms experienced recently, Irish gardeners are also grappling with the growing threat of spring and summer droughts as a result of climate change, with similarly serious consequences for human, plant and soil health. Again a leafy, habitat-rich, wildlife-friendly, organically-managed garden, no matter how tiny, can do much to mitigate their negative impacts. As mentioned above plants  leaves act as an all-important skin that protects and regulates soil temperatures, prevents excessive water loss through evaporation, and provides precious shelter for all kinds of garden wildlife from earthworms, woodlice, springtails and spiders to birds, insects and mammals.</p><h>Improving drainage </h><p>The use of organic mulches using nature- friendly, peat-free materials such as home-made garden compost, well-rotted manure and leaf mould will also greatly help to nourish a resilient, healthy soil food web in your garden or allotment by adding organic matter, improving drainage and boosting beneficial soil microbial activity.

Humanity will not limit global heating to safe levels or stem the ongoing loss of wildlife without them. From the boreal forest that stretches around northern Europe, Siberia, and Canada, to the Amazon, Earth's forests are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet, home to species found nowhere else.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet all too often, forests are worth more money dead than alive - despite promises from global leaders to halt deforestation. Their exploitation has pushed many plants, animals and fungi to the brink of extinction, while slowly degrading their ability to generate rainfall, sequester carbon and cool the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the race to create incentives to preserve forests rather than cut them down, the carbon-offsetting market has taken centre stage. Forest-offsetting schemes often sell credits on the basis that they will fund conservation schemes, protecting sections of forest that would otherwise be cut down - thereby preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.</p><p>Scientific research and journalistic investigations, however, indicate that many of these schemes are essentially \"hot air\" and failing to protect forests as promised. As some major firms reassess their use of forest credits, it raises questions about how we pay for and in-centivise the protection of these crucial ecosystems.</p><p>Here are five ways that experts have suggested we could tip the balance in favour of keeping forest ecosystems alive.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1: Pay countries to look after forests</emphasis></h><p>At Cop28 in Dubai, the Brazilian government put forward proposals for a multibillion-dollar global fund that would reward countries for conserving forests and penalise them for deforestation. Tasso Azevedo, a forest expert and adviser to president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said countries could be paid $ 30 a year for every hectare of forest they kept intact, while being penalised for every hectare lost.</p><p>\"Imagine you have a country that has 1,000 hectares of forest. If you maintain the forest, you will get $ 30,000, but if you clear cut 10 hectares, you get nothing,\" he told a side event at the summit.</p><p>In order to qualify for the Tropical Forests Forever fund, countries would have to meet three conditions: Keep deforestation below 0.5% a year; have forest loss trending downwards or keep it below 0.1%; and give the majority of funds to the people looking after the trees. The fund could be could be financed by putting a charge on fossil fuel sales, Azevedo said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2: Ban goods that harm forests</emphasis></h><p>Coffee, beef, rubber, soy and palm oil have driven the destruction of huge areas of forest - releasing vast carbon emissions along the way - and are often consumed in countries thousands of miles away from the Amazon or the Congo basin where they are produced.</p><p>To make sure European consumers are not driving further demand for forest loss, the EU has introduced strict regulations on high-risk products. From 2024, firms working in deforestation hotspots must certify that their goods have not harmed forests after a cutoff date of December 31, 2020. If countries like China and the US also introduced restrictions on deforestation-linked commodities, economic demand would probably fall sharply, lessening the incentive to further clear forests. However, this does not solve the problem of finding alternative livelihoods.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3: Introduce a global tax</emphasis></h><p>Barbados's prime minister, Mia Mottley, has been a strong advocate for an international tax that follows the \"the polluter pays\" principle to generate climate finance. This could also include funding nature-based solutions, such as forest protection, say experts.</p><p>By taxing oil and gas profits or the global financial system, Mottley argues that the huge sums required for the global energy transition and future climate resilience could be raised. Propon ents say that money should also go to protecting climate-critical ecosystems, without which global heating cannot be limited to 1.5C.</p><p>\"If we took 5% of oil and gas profits last year - oil and gas profits were $ 4tn - that would give us $ 200bn,\" Mottley said at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai earlier in December, as she discussed the need for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4: Swap a developing country's debt for spending on nature</emphasis></h><p>Many of the world's most nature-rich countries are also the most indebted, meaning that they struggle to pay for conservation. By refinancing debt at a lower interest rate in exchange for commitments on conservation, debt-for-nature swaps are growing in popularity and could be used to finance forest protection.</p><p>Earlier this year, Ecuador struck the largest deal of its kind, refinancing $ 1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Gabon has entered into a similar deal to unlock money for marine conservation.</p><p>At Cop28, Colombia - the host of next year's UN biodiversity summit, Cop16 - was a leading voice on calling for more action on debt relief in exchange for climate and nature finance. The country's president, Gustavo Petro, has said that biodiversity will be the basis of the country's economic wealth after it transitions away from fossil fuels, but his environment minister, Susana Muhamad, warned that debt was hindering the transformation.</p><p>\"For developing countries, the situation is critical, because many of our economies are highly indebted, especially after covid. We require fiscal space capacity for climate action to start making the real commitments,\" she said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Reform the carbon and biodiversity markets</emphasis></h><p>Despite deep flaws in the current system, world leaders and international institutions such as the World Bank have thrown their weight behind carbon markets as a tool for funding forest conservation globally. Supporters of carbon markets say that by purchasing high-quality credits, countries and companies could transfer some of the billions needed to keep forests standing as part of their efforts to offset their emissions. Cop28 negotiations on how to make this work ended in failure, however.</p><p>The sector is wrestling with human rights concerns, scientific evidence that many carbon credits are largely worthless, and lack of clarity about financial flows, but there are those who say it can still work. Among them is Johan Rock-str\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and chief scientist at Conservation International, which manages a number of carbon-offsetting projects.</p><p>\"On the one hand, the voluntary carbon markets on nature are not working, and there's reason to be deeply concerned about how they are misused as offsetting mechanisms for companies that are not following the scientific pathway on fossil fuel phase-out,\" said Rockstr\u00f6m \"On the other hand, we need nature-based solutions more than ever.

reshape jobs or be used to create conspiracy theories that could cause political instability, according to a document outlining the possible threats facing Ireland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Risk Assessment report, which began in 2014, aims to outline economic, security or political risks to Ireland in the coming years, with the aim of informing decisions and to prepare for those possibilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It also aims to guard against ``group think'', and states that it highlighted the risk of Brexit in its 2014 report, and the housing challenge in its 2015 report.</p><p>In the introduction to the report, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the list of 25 risks range from climate change to newer risks such as the security of Ireland's energy supply and the proliferation of disruptive technology like AI.</p><p>The report stated that as disruptive technology trends develop, ``these advances create a range of opportunities'' but also pose a possibility for malign use.</p><p>It said that disruptive technologies such as AI could cause automation that could ``displace or reshape'' jobs and sectors, or be used for ``malign'' purposes.</p><p>``Generative AI systems, which make the rapid production of content based on a variety of source material (text, moving or still images, computer code) easily available to the public, will bring extraordinary change, but will also pose a challenge for societal resilience, in particular how we counter the harms that could flow from their malicious use.</p><p>``This could include the use of AI to generate disinformation and misinformation, deepfakes, or conspiracy theories, with the potential to distort markets, undermine cohesion or cause political instability.''</p><p>It added: ``The spread of mis/disinformation, including via social media and other digital platforms, has the potential to undermine the State, the integrity of elections, social cohesion, and the functioning of the economy.''</p><p>In relation to Northern Ireland, the report said that certain groups with ``very limited levels of support'' are ``intent on disrupting the significant progress'' to bring about peace on the island of Ireland.</p><p>``The risks to Ireland posed by armed conflict, terrorism and hybrid security threats are potentially compounded by our having one of the lowest levels of investment in military and defence capabilities within Europe,'' it said.</p><p>The assessment also stated that Ireland's housing shortage and pricing issues ``are unlikely to rectify themselves over the short term'', with inflation and skilled labour shortages impacting supply.</p><p>It said that high rent costs create a risk of a ``locked-out generation'', and is impacting on homelessness, which is at record high monthly rates.</p><p>``The housing challenge risks increasing social exclusion and impairing labour mobility,'' it said, adding that the growing number of asylum seekers highlighted the ``undersupply of appropriate housing and the inflexibility of the sector''.</p><p>It highlights that climate change is happening at ``an accelerating and alarming rate'', and that Ireland needs to urgently ``step up'' efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>``...Failure to meet obligations and targets on emissions, energy usage, and renewable energy, set both by the EU and in national legislation, is a risk.</p><p>``Inertia and resistance to change risks Ireland's efforts at adaptation and mitigation.''</p><p>It also highlighted extreme weather events in Ireland such as flooding and extreme temperatures, which have ``major'' impacts on the environment, people and economy.</p><p>``Coastal erosion, which can impact upon infrastructure and human settlement, will accelerate in the coming years,'' it said.</p><p>``In this regard, it is notable that much critical infrastructure, such as power stations, wastewater treatment plants, and rail infrastructure can be found along our coastline.</p><p>``Very significant investment, with associated delivery risks, will be necessary to build climate resilience into flood defences and water management systems, in order to secure communities and the infrastructure they depend on.''</p><p>The assessment added: ``Trade-offs and public expenditure choices will be required.''</p><p>It also warned that vulnerabilities in global financial markets ``have grown more pressing'' and highlighted ``a wide range of financial vulnerabilities and elevated uncertainty''.</p><p>It said that Ireland's post-Brexit relationship with Great Britain ``will continue to present challenges'', particularly on trade as the UK moves to introduce checks and controls on imports.</p><p>It warned that while Ireland is ``a strong supporter'' of EU enlargement it also poses a risk to cohesion across the bloc and may lead to changes in how the EU operates.</p><p>The report said that the most extreme risks to Ireland ``are outside exclusive national control'', and as a result, international relations, such as Ireland's EU membership, are important.</p><p>The development of the National Risk Assessment is overseen by a group of departmental officials and members of relevant agencies, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p>A proposed list of strategic risks is drafted which is then published for public consultation, which took place from December 7 2022 to February 17 2023.</p><p>The proposed risks are then reviewed and further considered by Government departments and agencies, and the final draft was considered by government on July 25. end</p>", "publisher": "Regional Press Releases: Ireland", "instances": ["``Coastal erosion, which can impact upon infrastructure
