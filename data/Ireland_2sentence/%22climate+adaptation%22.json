As grid resilience and flexibility become increasingly important, skills in battery technologies, systems integration, and energy system design are in high demand.  </p><p> Key to our success in the green energy transition is achieving a balanced workforce of specialists and experts in renewable technologies and support functions who know how to connect and operate the energy system,  says Paula Carroll, associate professor at the UCD School of Business and co-chair of the UCD Sustainable Energy Community. </p><p>Carroll points out that the future energy system will be interconnected and digital, opening up opportunities for people looking for a challenging, rewarding sector in which to work. </p><p> Digitalisation of many work tasks reduces the requirement for physical labour   women who may not have considered working in the energy sector in the past now have new opportunities to contribute and participate in the energy transition,  she says.</p><p>Skills gaps are now consistently identified as being the biggest barrier to transformation, says David Gethin, manager, workforce consulting, with PwC Ireland.</p><p> The education sector has a critical role to play in meeting our future capability and skills needs at a national level,  he says.  There is a real opportunity for Irish universities to partner with the sector in ensuring proper alignment in educational offerings with industry needs. </p><p>Developing talent is an important part of the supply chain, agrees Geraldine Carroll, University of Limerick (UL) associate vice-president, graduate and professional studies. However, she offers the caveat that a degree of caution is required. </p><p> Renewables talent is crucial and universities need to play a significant role,  she says.  However, a skills response needs to be multi-institutional, with education providers working together to ensure learning pathways are targeted, complementary and timely.  </p><p>After all, Carroll points out, many of the forecasted jobs are not yet in existence. </p><p> Education providers should avoid producing expectant graduates in areas of low employment only to export them,  she says.</p><p>Universities must introduce renewables into undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and, as career pathways emerge, continue to evolve each curriculum, Carroll advises. </p><p> An excellent example of this is the bachelor/master s degree in electrical engineering at UL, which offers an accelerated path from bachelor s to master s level, with a focus on energy storage, solar and wind energy and net zero carbon. </p><p>UCD s Paula Carroll notes that the university offers a broad range of undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses across relevant disciplines:  Not all degrees are specifically focused on the renewable energy sector   but many provide multidisciplinary perspectives that can be applied to the clean energy transition. </p><p>The good news is that whether transitioning from traditional energy roles or entering the renewable field for the first time, individuals have access to a range of upskilling options. A key initiative in this national effort is the Skillnet Offshore Wind Academy, which Ruane says is designed to accelerate workforce development through a career-switching model. </p><p> Targeting mid-career professionals from other sectors with transferable skills, the academy provides new opportunities to upskill and transition into high-impact roles in offshore wind,  he explains.</p><p>Skillnet Ireland is also launching a series of micro-credential courses tailored to key roles in the offshore wind supply chain, including roles such as resource analyst, wind turbine technician, able seafarer and geophysicist. </p><p>Geraldine Carroll also notes that UL offers one-year part-time professional diplomas in sustainability and climate adaptation and sustainable work, and a certificate in sustainable resource management. These are delivered in partnership with Climate Ready Academy Skillnet and provide flexible learning options for work-based learners, she adds. </p><p> Professionals increasingly move laterally between roles and sectors and UL s programmes are designed to support that flexibility,  says Carroll. Ireland s proactive approach to skills development in renewables is gaining international attention: Green Tech Skillnet was recently spotlighted by the Renewable Energy Skills Partnership in an EU Pact for Skills position paper as a European best practice. l </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["Targeting mid-career professionals from other sectors with transferable skills, the academy provides new opportunities to upskill and transition into high-impact roles in offshore wind,  he explains.

At the event transition year students from Gortnor Abbey, Crossmolina, Summerhill College, Sligo and Sligo Grammar School participated in an interactive session trialling the game to provide feedback and recommendations for further development.

Scientists use the term to refer to areas with the climate and geographical conditions to be deemed highly vulnerable to global warming-related disasters. </p><p>Sitting-duck cities are informally classified on the basis  they ve got lucky so far . The Financial Times has identified big cities across the planet, the places yet to experience a Valencia moment (devastating flash floods) or a Los Angeles engulfment (wildfires raging through neighbourhoods). </p><p>The four extremes analysed were flooding, wildfires, rainfall and storm surge   that is, abnormal water-level rise generated by a storm over and above predicted tides. The so-called sitting ducks have been  lucky  to avoid a combination of conditions that will lead to the next disaster. The odds against them are worsening because of accelerating warming. </p><p>Although Irish cities are not deemed to be among the 24 highest-risk places   which include Athens, Cape Town and Buenos Aires   some of our cities at the mouth of estuaries are extremely vulnerable to a combination of flooding, rainfall and storm surge. </p><p>A highly co-ordinated response is needed to build resilience in adapting for inevitable climate impacts and to minimise risk from all three happening in quick succession or all at once   a key message from Ireland s first national climate risk assessment conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). </p><h>Storm \u00c9owyn </h><p/><h>Most of all, Ireland has got lucky on storm surge. Storm \u00c9owyn, which struck in January, reveals the extent of the most recent near miss. The bottom line is: storm surges in the order of five metres are looming, and we should probably be planning for 10m in some of our most populous urban centres. </h><p>A research team at University of Galway School of Engineering showed \u00c9owyn generated the highest storm surges ever recorded   more than 2.5m  above the normal predicted tidal water level. At Galway Port, it peaked at 2.6m above mean sea level, the average height of the sea surface. </p><p>The highest surge along the western coastline was recorded at Limerick Docks: 2.99m. Had these surges occurred a week earlier during a spring tide, Galway Port would have reached 4.96m and Limerick Docks 5.85m. </p><p>That indicates that tens of thousands of people and properties narrowly escaped disaster in the form of inundation by little more than luck of timing when \u00c9owyn hit the country. The storm s track was equally fortunate, with record overland wind speeds concentrated on less populated areas of the northwest. </p><p>Climatologist Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University spends much of his time analysing risk as chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council adaptation committee; whether it s the remotest places such as the Aran Islands, areas that habitually flood (and cannot get reasonable insurance cover) or our sitting-duck cities. </p><p>When it comes to Ireland s sitting ducks, he highlights places with river flows   Cork, Dublin and Galway. Cork is  very, very vulnerable , while in the capital much of the risk is due to so much of the State s critical infrastructure, as well as functionality of Ireland s political and financial systems, being  within a few metres of the river Liffey . </p><p>He worries about anywhere taking a long time to drain  so impact will be long-lived , as opposed to  short flashy catchments  draining in a day or two   or within hours. That includes anywhere along the river Shannon. In Limerick, the EPA has estimated extreme floods  under a high-end scenario of sea-level rise  may increase up to 12.5-fold, amounting to more than EUR 1 billion for a single event. </p><p>Physical risks have not changed, but our understanding of risk has. It is going up incrementally due to sea level rise, especially where it intersects with river flow and increased rainfall intensity. The more we push the climate system, the bigger the risk and it rises  very, very quickly , becoming more erratic, says Thorne. </p><p>While much of the east coast is  incredibly vulnerable , individual households and farmland are most threatened, with its rail links, ports and major roads at risk. </p><p>Thorne accepts a lot of work is being done on protections in urban areas, where poor design including hard-paved surfaces can aggravate flooding. Cork, for example, faces particular challenges because of its central island, though it has developed a park that can become a lake if necessary   a measure that is standard in many French cities and towns due to flash-flood risk. </p><p>But it s particularly hard to deploy such adaptation measures in built-up, already congested areas, even if they are nature-based solutions rather than hard engineering. Invariably, installing them causes large disruption for business, tourism and the daily lives of commuters. </p><h>Wicked problem </h><p/><h>The data and more accurate computer modelling indicate, however, we have to get to grips with the wicked problem of climate adaptation. In some places, protection within a decade is required. The vulnerability of places such as Portrane in north Dublin and Greystones, Co Wicklow, for instance, stands out. </h><p>The World Meteorological Organisation says global mean temperatures are likely to continue at or near record levels between 2025 and 2029. Models have flagged the imminent possibility of a  two-degree year  (above pre-industrial times), which a few years ago would have been considered impossible within such a narrow time-frame. </p><p>This means there is a high probability temperatures and precipitation will exceed long-term averages in the next five years. Sitting-duck places   including Ireland s equivalent   are in the firing line. </p><p>And yet a European Commission assessment of the Government s national energy and climate plan, published on May 28th, highlights a disturbing lack of coherence on adaptation. While climate vulnerabilities are acknowledged, proposed adaptation actions are vague, unquantified  and poorly integrated into overall planning . </p><p>The shape of what is required is clear. The Climate Change Advisory Council has spelt out what needs to be done to support preparedness for extreme events in its annual review for 2025. The EPA assessment provides critical indication of what the climate risks are, when they are likely to arise and, most importantly, where. It s now up to government departments, key sectors such as energy, transport and communications, and local authorities to better frame the response. </p><p>They should do so mindful of a World Resources Institute report providing powerful evidence that bolstering funding for adaptation and resilience is not only urgent but also one of the smartest development investments available today. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["But it s particularly hard to deploy such adaptation measures in built-up, already congested areas, even if they are nature-based solutions rather than hard engineering.

But will they truly understand what that means or what is urgently needed from them to assist these countries?</p><p>In northern Kenya, five successive failed rains meant there were no proper rains in 2021 and 2022. The impact on the mainly pastoral communities was devastating. An estimated 50-70% of livestock died during the drought. The cattle were first, followed by sheep and goats, then donkeys - which are normally very resilient - and then finally, camels.</p><p>Some 50% of camels in the region died during the drought. They are the most important asset for pastoral people, a sign of wealth. Camels are only sold when there is a huge need or for a dowry.</p><p>The drought of 2021/22 has had a devastating and long-lasting impact. It takes between six months and one year after a drought before goats breed again. For cows, it is a further year. To replace the livestock lost during the recent drought could take between three and 10 years. But communities now expect droughts every five years, making herd replacement impossible.</p><p>A major humanitarian response across the region meant the loss of human life was limited in 2021 and 2022. However, malnutrition levels soared with approximately 1m people in the region becoming malnourished during the drought.</p><p>The lack of rain has forced some families to move to urban centres, abandoning their homes and potentially their way of life. Usually, community meetings are attended by women as they are closer to the family homes. But these meetings, facilitated by Concern staff are now increasingly attended by men and boys. They are there to see what is happening, in search of hope. They carry small clubs and herding guns - essential tools for herders but now they have no animals to care for. Their animals have died and their herds have shrunk - in some cases going from 50 down to two goats.</p><p>In Bangladesh, climate change poses an existential threat to the 169m population. Two-thirds of people - 112m live less than 15ft above sea level. With sea levels rising, one in seven Bangladeshis - 24m - are expected to be forced from their homes by climate-related issues by 2050.</p><p>In addition to increasing rainfall levels, greater uncertainty comes as to when the rain will fall. Soaring temperatures between April and June meant that much of this year's Jute crop was damaged and burnt.</p><p>Bangladeshi families also face the increasing risk of river erosion, which is destroying fertile land and people's livelihoods. In parts of the south, where we work, 563 families (approximately 2,500 people) lost their farms and homes this year alone. Some families try and remain in the area. Others have no option but to migrate to cities, where they face living in very poor conditions in informal settlements.</p><p>Concern is working with communities in Bangladesh and Kenya as they adapt to climate change. Concern supports people at at household and com munity level, helping people to be sustainable today, tomorrow, and in the future beyond the next drought or flood.</p><p>Kenya has a lot of fertile land but not enough water. It can produce sufficient food and livestock but investment is needed in water sources. If all the available water is harvested, it can be sufficient.</p><p>In several regions of Kenya, much of the underground water is saline or high in metals. Major investment is needed to treat water for multiple use - livestock, crops, and human consumption. Concern has done a lot of work rehabilitating boreholes.</p><p>Work is also needed to manage rangelands so that the vast pasturelands used by pastoralists to graze their livestock can regenerate. This is one the key areas where climate adaptation funding could have major results.</p><p>Research is being undertaken into hybrid and drought-resistant seeds. However, you cannot plant them without sufficient water. The use of fast-maturing and drought-resistant seeds is being rolled out to communities, with the seeds being harvested and kept in communities for the following year's harvest.</p><p>In Bangladesh, Concern is a member of the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance, working to develop effective early warning systems. This gives communities advance notice of impending floods, enabling them to limit the damage done by taking steps such as strengthening flood defences, and moving livestock and assets to higher ground.</p><p>Adaption work to protect communities includes raising households and community buildings such as mosques and schools on plinths and raising the height of key access roads. Nature-based solutions such as strategic tree planting near households and along roadsides are also effective in protecting structures and limiting soil erosion during floods.</p><p>The new reality of worsening climate change means these adaptation measures are becoming more difficult and ineffective given the increased ex tremes of weather. For example, we may raise a road or a building above the previously highest flood level, only for flood waters to rise further this year. Climate change means we are planning for unpredictable and previously unimaginable situations.</p><p>If the communities we work with in Bangladesh got 60 seconds with decision makers at Cop28 they would tell them that the people of Bangladesh are bearing the burden of climate change, although they have done little to create the problem.

At the event, policymakers, academics, farmers and landowners spoke about finding new opportunities for, and more value from, Irish land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It took place against the backdrop of the Land Use Review, phase two of which has been completed. When it is made public, the review will offer suggestions on future land use in Ireland. Phase one, completed in 2023, gave baseline figures on current land use in terms of the types of agriculture, forestry and associated areas. </p><p>The bigger picture involves a realisation that land can no longer be seen solely in terms of food production, but instead with multiple roles in an interconnected system. </p><p>This system will place value on good water and air quality, as well as reducing carbon emissions. It will be geared towards helping biodiversity thrive while bringing socioeconomic benefits from land use alongside production of food. </p><p>Land has multiple potential uses when you consider the broader bioeconomy in which value can be extracted at various stages of food production. Every part of the process, including farmyard manure, offers the possibility of an income stream.</p><p> This multifunctional land use includes farm land with biodiversity and climate benefits, but we need private and green finance to fund the transition,  says Prof Mark Scott, of University College Dublin s School of Architecture, Planning and Environmental Policy. </p><p>Prof Scott, who chaired the technical group for the review, says change is needed at scale because current land use will undermine both biodiversity and the economy. </p><p>Phase two will inform the Government s climate-action plans to achieve emissions reductions in the areas of land use, land-use change and forestry. This is in the context of potential EU fines for overshooting our agricultural emission targets. There is also a need for climate adaptation to protect our rural landscapes from the effects of climate change. </p><p>Prof Scott adds that as so much land is owned by farmers, rural communities must be central to managing change in the long term.  We need to give farmers certainty about how they use their own land,  he says.  Deciding about land-use goals should be a social process rather than a top down technological process.  </p><p>At the festival, Dr David Styles, associate professor in agri-sustainability at the University of Galway, presents a number of future scenarios. They included maximising livestock protein within environmental constraints (ie specialising in dairy with significantly less beef farming) and a focus on cattle and nature through extensive rather than intensive grazing. </p><p>He also emphasises a focus on pigs, poultry and protein crops (all of which have lower emissions than cattle farming), with grass in clover to reduce fertiliser input and a bioeconomy focus with plant protein, willow and energy. </p><p> We have a very productive land bank, but if we used less land for animals and animal feed, we could bring down phosphates and ammonia levels,  says Dr Styles.  We could produce more protein with half the land, so business as usual isn t necessarily the way forward for food security. Business as usual is very negative with a 2050 lens. </p><h>Well-designed bioeconomy</h><p/><h> Dr Styles suggests a well-designed bioeconomy could deliver well for both the Irish economy and environment.</h><p> In the fourth scenario, farmers could grow protein crops (peas and beans) and grass for biorefineries, which produces high-value animal feed as a replacement for imported soyabean,  he says.  They could also grow willow on marginal land as a feedstock for bioenergy plants producing energy, which could compensate for residual agricultural emissions.  </p><p>He talks up the importance of farmers engaging in honest and open conversations about future land-use policy.  Farmers could be more prosperous. We need to know what fits together for resilience in an uncertain future. </p><p>Dr Styles also suggests that 16,000 hectares of forestry be planted annually from 2030 onwards. Currently, about 2,000 hectares is planted annually, which is about one-quarter of the target. </p><p>Paul O Brien is a sheep and tillage farmer in Co Kilkenny as well as South Leinster regional chairman of the Irish Farmers Association. He is concerned about the expectations being placed on farmers. </p><p> We are asked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase biodiversity, change our land use and participate in wind and solar energy production, but where is the funding going to come from for all this?  he says. </p><p>Mr O Brien stresses the need to compensate farmers in the event of new policies failing. In this context, he mentions ash dieback disease, which damaged the majority of ash trees planted by farmers in recent years. </p><p>Dr Andrew Kelly from EnvEcon environmental consultancy firm suggests Ireland needs to engage strongly if the European Commission decides to develop an emissions trading system for agriculture. Such a development would, in essence, be the equivalent to a carbon tax on agriculture emissions. </p><p> The emissions trading scheme for energy companies has generated investment in renewables,  he says.  There are different types of farms and levels of profitability and some farmers won t be viable in the future, just like some businesses fail.  </p><p>Prof Yvonne Buckley of Trinity College, co-chair of the All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network, also at the event, says:  To be agile in the future and to make money from land, we need diverse landscapes. Healthy ecosystems are at the heart of this. We need to protect the ones we have and restore degraded ones.  </p><p>She accepts the case for farmers getting payments for ecosystem services on their land. </p><p>Dr James Moran, lecturer in ecology and biology at Atlantic Technological University in Galway, believes 30-year planning for land use is essential.  We need to start working together on future policy and we need to consider the interlinked challenges of biodiversity, water quality, food and health of humans and animals,  he says. </p><h>A liveable climate   </h><p/><h>Dr Moran acknowledges that in more recent years, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has moved from a food-first approach to one that  protects nature and water in a liveable climate . </h><p>He says:  All other EU policies on climate, nature, soil, water need to be integrated into CAP now and we have to transform our land system. Business as usual is not an option and a national land-use framework will need to be implemented at regional and local level.  </p><p>Niamh Garvey, senior policy analyst with the National Economic and Social Council, says scaling up would give more farmers a sense of what future land use might look like. </p><p>She also points to the importance of lengthening many of the European Innovation Partnerships and EU Life Programme projects that have proved inspirational.</p><p>Patrick Barrett, agricultural inspector at the Department of Agriculture, suggests that the biotechnology and food sectors could eventually come together. </p><p>He says:  The Government will need to support investment in cluster-type developments where one company s waste is another s feedstock and the agrifood sector will be part of this, supplying feedstocks and energy to anaerobic digesters and biorefineries. </p><p> For farmers, foresters, fishers to get more value from what they produce, this sidestream of products needs to be unlocked.

The beach is 1.2km long and and I stated thinking if we were able to collect that much rubbish from one beach is every kilometre of the coast just as bad?\"</p><p>From there, the group has seen the area it covers and the number of volunteers steadily increase. Today, the group has 300 local volunteers and looks after three percent of the Irish coastline as well as managing 34 acres of land for biodiversity purposes. Proinsias says that the group has evolved into a large and friendly organisation but it could not operate without sponsorship.</p><p>He said: \"We engage with hundreds of school children. Marine education, coastal biodiversity, workshops, beach cleans.</p><p>\"In this area, coastal flooding is a major issue. We try to open their eyes, to get them off their phones for a while and get them out to the coast. You hope that maybe you can awaken their their spirit to something else that's going on around them.

It takes 450 years for a plastic bottle to break down but that's actually only to break it into microplastics, then it's broken into nanoplastics but it's still there. Plastic has crossed the blood/brain barrier and we still don't know what the long-term effects of that are in terms of things like Alzheimer's or dementia.\"</p><p>Workshops also try to make children think about how products and produce are packaged: \"If they need to buy an orange, what do they buy? Do you buy them in a plastic net? Do you buy an orange that's peeled and segmented in a plastic container ready for consumption? Do you buy an orange and peel it?\"</p><p>According to Proinsias people do not always appreciate just how long our waste materials can remain as pollutants in the ocean.</p><p>\"I have aLux detergent bottle that I found in 2017 and the price on it is in Nouveau Francs.

Meanwhile, I reflected on the six weeks that have just passed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tradition of giving something up - a guilty pleasure, a bad habit, maybe the morning scroll through social media - still resonates with many, but this year, as I finish my first Lent working for Tr\u00f3caire, the idea of giving something up carries a heavier weight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Guatemala, children are giving up something they should never have to: Their education.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In March, I had the privilege of visiting the community and a family featured in Tr\u00f3caire's box appeal for Lent.</p><p>Guatemala sits on the Central American dry corridor, which encompasses parts of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. This area exposes those living there to heat-waves and unpredictable rainfall.</p><p>The ecosystems and people of the dry corridor are some of the most vulnerable in the world to climate change. When we arrived in this small rural community in central Guatemala, we crossed a long wooden bridge connecting it to the outside world.</p><p>Prior to 2020, when - with the help of Tr\u00f3caire - this bridge was built, the only way to get to the community and their land was by boat. We were welcomed into the community with a ceremony where they prayed for our safety travelling back to Ireland, for Mother Earth, and for a strong, healthy crop.</p><p>The people in this community are Mayan and are indigenous to their land, much like 40% of the population of the country - 6.5m people.</p><p>They know the importance of understanding the movements of Mother Earth but, recently, she has become less predictable than ever. For them, uncertain weather means failed crops.</p><p>Crops they rely on for income.</p><p>Julio, Ilma, and their four children: 13-year-old Miriam; 11-year-old Julio Jnr; 4-year-old Deborah; and baby Gloria, feature on this year's Tr\u00f3caire box.</p><p>Ilma and Julio grow cardamom and corn to earn money for the family. Julio showed us where he used to plant crops twice a year, but now only plants once a year because of the extreme weather conditions. This means they no longer have an income from their crops, something they could rely on in the past.</p><p>The increasingly unpredictable climate, failed crops, and the negative effects that come with this are daily realities for people whose lives depend on the land and whose children's futures depend on being in school.</p><p>Unfortunately, education is often the first thing to go when a crisis strikes. In 2024, 242m students in 85 countries had their schooling disrupted by extreme climate events.</p><p>In the community where Julio, Ilma, and their family live, there is a small school - a one-room wooden hut with a dirt floor. During the ever-increasing rainy season, the roof of the school leaks, and a bowed plank of wood is the only thing preventing the roof from caving in. The dirt floor becomes muddy, but the children in the community are determined to learn. Their teacher travels an hour each day to teach them.</p><p>She told me how the conditions for learning are not ideal, yet the school is full every day. This school serves the children of the community up to the end of their primary education.</p><p>The teacher described Julio and Ilma's eldest, Miriam, as the brightest student she has taught. She explained how Miriam has now become too old for this school and has begun to attend secondary school. That school is a two-hour drive each way, and Miriam takes the local public bus service every day, costing about  5 a week. I asked Miriam what she wanted to be when she grew up and, after some hesitation, she said her dream is to become a teacher.</p><p>Her pause before answering this question was deafening, because she knows that this dream may never become a reality. Her mother, Ilma, explained that Miriam is happy to travel to school and is determined to continue her education.</p><p>However, after another failed crop of cardamom, she and her husband know the day will come when they will have to choose between feeding their family of six or paying for Miriam's school bus - a choice no parent should have to make.</p><p>The whole world is experiencing the impact of the climate crisis, but this is what climate injustice looks like: Those who did the least to cause the crisis are paying the highest price. Children are losing their education, and with it, their chance at a better future.</p><p>It's easy to feel overwhelmed in the face of global problems like these.</p><p>The climate crisis is complex. Education systems are under pressure. Poverty is deeply rooted. Conflict is ongoing. No one person can fix it all.</p><p>Working at Tr\u00f3caire, I have already seen the impact of Ireland's generosity.</p><p>We're working with communities such as Julio and Ilma's to build resilience through sustainable farming, climate adaptation, and, crucially, by keeping children in school.</p><p>The iconic Tr\u00f3caire box isn't just a symbol of Lent. It's a lifeline. Every coin dropped in becomes something powerful - it becomes clean water, school bus fare, shelter during conflict, and healthcare during emergencies. It becomes hope. It becomes justice.</p><p>This year, that support is more critical than ever. One of the world's biggest donors, the US, has slashed 90% of its aid budget, and Britain has followed suit. As funding disappears, we're seeing devastating consequences.</p><p>In Somalia, where Tr\u00f3caire provides the only healthcare in Gedo - a region the size of Ireland - we lost  1.7m in funding due to US cuts. Three health centres were forced to close. In just one of those centres, 100 babies were safely delivered in February.</p><p>Maternal mortality rates had dropped significantly since clinics were opened. Now, mothers are being turned away.</p><p>We are not as reliant on US aid as others, but our partners are. When their programmes collapse, the pressure falls on the remaining services.</p><p>We're now doing more with less, and stretched to the limit. So yes, what starts as small change in a cardboard box can feel insignificant. But it's not. It's everything. It's the  5 that keeps a child like Miriam on a bus to school. It's the funding that helps a community rebuild after a flood. It's the difference between a closed clinic and a safe birth.</p><p>In a year where global compassion feels like it's in retreat, our Irish tradition of giving - especially at Lent - matters more than ever.</p><p>This isn't just a story about Guatemala.

But this crisis is not an isolated event; it is a stark reminder that the impacts of climate change are accelerating, and our ability to withstand them is increasingly uncertain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this month, the Climate Change Advisory Council urged the Government to take immediate action to prepare for future extreme weather events. Moving beyond the headlines about the physical damage caused by extreme weather events, the council highlighted the need for action to protect and support people and futureproof our communities. In other words, we need to think beyond the immediate concerns of electricity supply and flood damage and develop our capacity to withstand shocks.</p><p>If we want to build a more resilient society, our mindsets need to shift. Technological solutions alone cannot address the root causes of the threats to our existence. To truly respond to the environmental crises, we must focus on transforming our relationship with the land, the living world, and each other. If we are to weather the storms, literally and metaphorically, we need to build resilience in our homes and communities to face an unpredictable future.</p><p>And this resilience is crucial. In countries such as France, Sweden, and the Netherlands, governments have started asking citizens to prepare for crises such as weather events and power cuts. France plans to distribute survival manuals to households, urging the creation of emergency bags, or 'catakits', containing essential items such as food, water, medical supplies, and basic survival gear. While these suggestions are sensible and help provide short-term security, true resilience goes beyond prepper stockpiling; it means developing practical skills such as growing food, repairing household items, managing common health issues, conserving resources, and generating local energy.</p><p>Furthermore, our response to crises should do more than try to return to the way things were. Instead, our society must aim to emerge stronger from setbacks. This requires a profound shift in values, behaviour, and systems. It demands a rethink of what we mean by society and prosperity, and a new consensus of what is worth protecting in the event of a crisis.</p><p>Resilient living is about making our homes places of strength and security. It means creating a lifestyle that is not only more sustainable, but also more rewarding, taking satisfaction from growing your own food, reducing waste, and living in harmony with nature. It is also about developing a mindset of preparedness, and the knowledge that we can rely on each other when it matters.</p><p>Secondly, we need to acknowledge that building resilience requires a collective effort. True adaptability is about building and maintaining co-operation and strong networks. In a world of environmental and social disruptions, wellbeing is about supporting each other and ensuring no one is left behind.</p><p>If we are to start a discussion about building Ireland's resilience, a good place to start is to invest in \"social capital\". We need to strengthen the trust and networks within communities so that people can support each other and adapt to changing circumstances. This requires tangible investments in public spaces, community hubs, and local initiatives that bring people together to share skills, resources, and knowledge.</p><p>It also means funding educational programmes on climate adaptation, repair skills and sustainable living, and it means promoting intergenerational learning and local economic initiatives. Social capital includes strengthening local emergency preparedness, creating networks that ensure the most vulnerable are supported during crises.</p><p>True resilience is not just about infrastructure; it's about fostering connected, empowered, communities that can collectively navigate an uncertain future.</p><p>Finally, to build true resilience, the Government must take a leading role in creating policies that go beyond short-term responses. This means investing in climate-adaptive infrastructure, such as decentralised renewable energy grids and sustainable public transport. It also requires more financial support mechanisms, including grants for home retrofitting, subsidies for local food production, and incentives for businesses to adopt sustainable practices. And it means moving beyond an obsessive focus on GDP growth to an economic model that measures and promotes well-being for all.</p><p>Fortunately, many individuals and organisations in Ireland are already demonstrating what a resilient future looks like.</p><p>The Cloughjordan Ecovillage in County Tipperary serves as a model sustainable community, integrating energy-efficient housing, community-owned renewable energy, and local food production. The Sustainable Energy Communities Network empowers over 200 local communities to develop energy master plans for their communities and implement local renewable energy projects.</p><p>Similarly, many non-governmental organisations like Global Action Plan provide training on themes related to mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. Not to mention the many allotments and community gardens all over Ireland that enable people to grow their own food, and share the proceeds with their communities.</p><p>Ultimately, Ireland's resilience isn't just about withstanding extreme weather; it's about thriving in an uncertain world that demands constant adaptation. The time to act is now, and by putting communities at the heart of our resilience strategy we can build a society that emerges from crises stronger, more united, and more sustainable.</p><p>* Hans Zomer is CEO of Gap Ireland.

The melting Arctic ice is causing sea levels to rise and this disrupts the main Atlantic current that makes Ireland s climate temperate. Coastal communities are already feeling the impact of extreme weather patterns. Our vulnerability to climate disruption was evident in 2023, the warmest year on record, when a severe marine heatwave caused damaging flash floods.</p><p>Last week s landslide in Papua New Guinea   caused by extraordinary rainfall   killed 2,000 people.

One person died and more than 70 people were injured recently on a Singapore Airlines flight because of severe air turbulence and just days later eight people were taken to hospital here after a flight from Doha to Dublin experienced turbulence. Studies have found that this problem increased by 55 per cent over the North Atlantic between 1979 and 2020.</p><p>Our decarbonisation efforts need to be scaled up, and, with the predicted changes to our weather conditions, our adaptation plans. We must stop burning fossil fuels and make the transition to renewable energy sources. But there is one big problem: planning laws.</p><p>Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan believes that Ireland can address climate challenges, but emphasises the need for significant changes in planning legislation to expedite wind energy development   the timelines for planning and delivering offshore and land-based wind farms are too long.</p><p>The State of the Climate in Europe report for 2023 highlights rising temperatures, unprecedented glacier melt, low precipitation and more wildfires. However, the report also stresses the potential for renewable energy development. Ireland s Climate Action Plan 2021 outlines a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51 per cent by 2030, with a goal of generating five gigawatts of offshore wind power by that year. Achieving this target would significantly enhance our renewable energy supply, powering millions of homes and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. In May 2023, four projects were awarded contracts and are expected to provide three gigawatts once operational. However, this will not be enough to meet the target.</p><p>Farming and agriculture play a significant role in climate change, both by contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and being affected by climate shifts. Our beef and dairy herds release greenhouse gases, leading to global warming, which in turn alters weather patterns, growing seasons and crop productivity. Climate change impacts precipitation, causing water shortages, droughts and flooding, while unsustainable farming practices degrade soil health and diminish carbon storage. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns threaten crop yields and food security. Additionally, climate change extends the range of pests and increases extreme weather events, damaging crops and infrastructure.</p><p>Implementing sustainable practices such as crop rotation, conservation tillage, agroforestry and organic farming can help mitigate these impacts. Government support through incentives and research is essential for building a sustainable and resilient food system. Farmers have the power to drive the necessary changes to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensuring a sustainable agricultural future in Ireland.</p><p> But is not just farmers that must prioritise climate change. A major challenge in tackling this crisis is persuading everyone that there is a direct link between their daily activities and climate change. We don t have to be passive, or fatalistic   we can tackle the problem. But we need to believe what the scientists tell us. Climate denial is now out of the question   for leaders in politics, business and agriculture. And people at home. Better communication is a matter of urgency.</p><p>As citizens we need to recognise that our daily actions, consumption, behaviour have an impact not only on us, but on Ireland and the world. We can make small changes like choosing to buy local, use public transport, recycle, consume less and reduce food waste   which will have a massive impact if achieved at scale. Almost everything we do on a daily basis consumes precious energy. But we can lower energy use at home by taking shorter showers, reducing heat settings on boilers and using less water.</p><p>Climate innovation stimulates the economy. We need entrepreneurs with innovative technologies and business models to accelerate climate adaptation. Replacing fossil fuels and creating new sources   renewables   will revolutionise the economy. We must incentivise innovative smaller companies to develop solutions to transform how we provide energy, water, food and clothing to meet or even exceed climate targets.

However, only 27 per cent rated adaptation as a  very high priority , compared with more than double (60 per cent) for mitigation.

It underlined that while much of the focus remains on reducing emissions, Ireland is not doing enough to adapt its communities to address the damage that climate change is already causing   and the damage it will do in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of the focus for policymakers has been on mitigation action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and not on adapting society to our changing climate, which also needs urgent attention. Climate adaptation, that is preparing for, and adjusting to, the now inevitable impacts of climate change, continues to be under-resourced and ignored. It is the  Cinderella  of Irish climate policy.</p><p>It is notable that only about 14 per cent of the nearly 4,000 actions set out across the 31 recently adopted local authority climate action plans specifically relate to adaptation, despite local authorities having significant power and responsibility in preparing communities for climate impacts.</p><p>In particular, preparing the built environment for the changes that we are already seeing in the climate is crucial to communities across Ireland, be that to prepare towns and cities for flooding, storm surges and erosion, or our homes for heatwaves. The planning system is an important instrument for managing risks associated with flooding, heatwaves, air quality and our buildings.</p><p>As part of its commitments to address this, the Government recently published Ireland s second National Adaptation Framework (NAF). The new framework needs to embed climate adaptation considerations across government decision-making in a much more meaningful and urgent way if we are to protect current and future infrastructure from the impacts of climate change.</p><p>There has been some success to date in the development and delivery of sectoral adaptation plans, such as in agriculture and flood-risk management, where the Minister for Agriculture and Minister of State for the Office of Public Works respectively have clear responsibility for the area. However, it has been less successful in other areas, including communication networks, where a range of regulators and private sector organisations, such as mobile phone network operators, operate with less government oversight.</p><p>There is a danger that the need to prepare our built environment for future climate impacts could be lost in the ever increasing layers of spatial plans and policies that the planning system has to address. For example, the Planning and Development Bill will add even more layers of policy with which adaptation action and policy must align. </p><p>The distance that adaptation policy still has to travel can be seen in the Climate Change Advisory Council s annual adaptation scorecards, which highlight the limited progress Ireland has made in preparing our electricity networks for future climate impacts.</p><h>Far from clear </h><p>This confirms that significant attention must be paid, now, to how adaptation and resilience is considered in the forthcoming national, regional and local renewable electricity strategies. The planning system will be a key part of delivering these strategies and this infrastructure, but how a planning sectoral adaptation plan and an already underperforming electricity networks sector will interact is far from clear.</p><p>As for the projected increase in temperatures and heatwaves, there is limited understanding of what this means for overheating homes and commercial buildings.

It is the  Cinderella  of Irish climate policy.

The choreographer lives in Ballydehob, in west Co Cork, and her dances are rooted in the area and have grown around the people who inhabit it. In a more global sense, she believes that communities are the answer to climate change, the fundamental existential problem facing society today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She is not alone in these views. Many environmental scientists agree. But she is part of a small minority that believes in dance as a way to bring about that change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Growing up in west Cork in the 1970s, there was a strong sense of collective responsibility,  she says.  My family had one of the only phones in the area, so the neighbours used it regularly. My father often drove people to the vet or helped in other ways. I always felt that it wasn t just my parents raising me. It was the whole community. </p><p>She felt a deep connection to that community.  From an early age I saw myself as the village dancer, much like there was a village baker or carpenter. </p><p>This sense of community naturally extends to her artistic approach. Brandel s earliest works spurned homogeneity on stage. Rather than presenting similar bodies in perfect synchronicity, she was drawn to difference, underpinned with a strong collectivist ethos.  When I trained at the Laban centre [in London] I wrote a manifesto about my vision as a choreographer, and it was rooted in representing diverse voices and perspectives. </p><p>This idealism hasn t been worn down by the realities of professional practice.</p><p> For me it isn t about ticking diversity boxes. It s about creating work that truly reflects the world around us. I am always analysing power dynamics in performance. Who holds privilege? How is it expressed? Are the artists aware of it or is it unconsciously embedded in their work? These are the kind of questions that shape my approach to choreography. </p><p>After training at Laban she worked in London, Berlin and San Francisco before returning to Ireland. In San Francisco she collaborated with Axis Dance Company, which focuses on integrated dance.</p><p> Returning home for a visit, I spoke with Ian McDonagh at Cork County Council s arts office about integrated dance. He encouraged me to write a five-year plan, which ultimately led to the founding of our own integrated dance company. </p><p>Brandel formed Cro\u00ed Glan with Rhona Coughlan, a dancer with spina bifida. (She is now artistic director of Inclusive Dance Cork, based at Firkin Crane in Cork city.) The company had a repertory model, inviting other choreographers to collaborate and create new dances rather than creating dances in-house.</p><p>Some of these visiting choreographers have had experience working with disabled dancers; others needed guidance. Brandel sees it as a two-way exchange: they bring their artistic vision and Cro\u00ed Glan helps them explore new ways of working inclusively.</p><p> Sometimes it was easier for me to see the movement range of the disabled dancers and where they could go and how far they could go,  she says.  You really have to work with someone for a while before you have a sense of their limits. So we could guide the choreographers to push things further. </p><p>Cro\u00ed Glan has collaborated with most big Irish choreographers and performed nationwide and abroad. All the while west Cork provided a constant inspiration.</p><p> I m influenced by this beautiful landscape and the opportunity to be in really remote places,  says Brandel.  The quietness and the ability to focus is fantastic, but there s also a cultural richness in the area that is unique. </p><p>When she was a child, her father wrote for Granada Television; he would fly to Manchester to record current-affairs documentaries.  That gave me a model of living very rurally and working very internationally. I think that s really true in general here in west Cork. The composer Benji Bower has an amazing CV and was nominated for outstanding achievement in music at the Olivier awards. But I met him on walking a beach. </p><p>Bower is part of the creative team behind Change, Cro\u00ed Glan s latest work. It follows on from Unseen, a multidisciplinary work based around unseen but vital parts of our ecosystem.</p><p> What I ve learned from creating Unseen, and now through Change, is that climate scientists   or just scientists, probably, in general   are hungry to make connections with artists, because we help them to disseminate their ideas. </p><p>She contacted the Environmental Research Institute at University College Cork during the planning stage and asked if it would be interested in being involved.</p><p> During our research week, three scientists would come to rehearsals each day. When they arrived I d ask them to talk individually for 20-30 minutes about the core of their personal passion for environmentalism and climate change.</p><p> There were four dancers and visual artists in the space, and we all reacted to their words, moving and painting as they spoke. Afterward, the speakers would talk with each other while we continued responding through movement and art.</p><h>Boundaries dissolved</h><p/><h>  Gradually, the boundaries between discussion and performance dissolved. Conversations flowed into movement, and movement into conversation. I never instructed anyone to dance, but it happened organically. </h><p>By the end of the week, a key realisation emerged: addressing climate change cannot be separated from addressing global inequalities.  The consensus was clear: tackling climate change requires deep co-operation and community building. The writer Ian Hughes emphasised that social movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter must be part of the same conversation. This isn t just about climate. It s about a total paradigm shift.</p><p> At the time I didn t know exactly what I would take away from the process, but by the end I realised I needed voices from every continent, particularly from the Global South. However, I didn t want to fly anyone in, so I sought out individuals living in Ireland who represented different global perspectives. That marked the second phase of my research. </p><p>Since then, Change has evolved into a performance with a cast of five dancers from around the world: Bobbi Byrne (Ireland/Spain), Oran Leong (Ireland/Malaysia), Yves Lorrhan (Brazil), Tanya Turner (Czech Republic/Ireland) and Andrea Williams (Cape Verde).</p><p>A community has developed around Change. Brandel was particularly inspired by Hughes and Karina Buckley, a former dancer who cofounded Climate without Borders. This organisation collects climate stories from around the world in collaboration with other weather reporters.</p><p>But however powerful the stories, Brandel and Buckley believe in the power of dance to be an agent of change.</p><p> Dance offers something unique to the climate conversation,  says Brandel.  Facts and figures can be overwhelming, but dance operates on a visceral level, allowing audiences to experience ideas in a way words cannot fully capture.</p><p> When we presented our work at Uillinn Dance Season [in Skibbereen], the climate adaptation scientist Lydia Cumiskey, who had been collaborating with us, attended for the first time. She was so deeply moved by the performance that she was barely able to speak during the postshow discussion. That moment reinforced how dance can communicate the urgency of climate action in ways that traditional discourse cannot. </p><p>Cumiskey, a senior postdoctoral researcher at University College Cork, has become a Climate Pact ambassador and is furthering the idea that the arts must play a role in engaging people with climate action and adaptation.</p><p>A key influence, too, is Rebecca Solnit s Not Too Late, a collection of essays by various writers that not only promote community and the arts as ways to address climate change but also, and most importantly, encourages immediate action, however small.</p><p>There is never a sense of despair in Brandel s steadfast vision of how we can address such a monumental challenge. Just a quiet confidence in the transformative power of dance.</p><p>Change will be performed at Dance Cork Firkin Crane, Cork, on Friday, March 14th, and Saturday, March 15th</p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["Dance offers something unique to the climate conversation,  says Brandel.

Fallen leaves litter the ground; broken twigs are soggy with moisture; and dampness infuses everything. The dormancy and dampness create perfect decay conditions, as summer's growth is subsumed back into the soil, replenishing nutrients as part of the annual cycle of our temperate seasons. This decay is a precursor to the resurgence of fertility and growth in spring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But this is not a passive process. It is dependent on a wealth of organisms working away underground, breaking down detritus in to component parts, and recycling all the nutrients back into the soil. Earthworms are the most familiar of these. In Ireland, we have 27 species of earthworm. They are so abundant in healthy soils that the weight of earthworms beneath the ground is greater than the weight of cattle above ground.</p><p>And an unfathomable diversity of other, mostly microscopic, soil organisms is also busy beneath the surface. These include soil-dwelling algae; probing fungal filaments; a multitude of microscopic protozoa; an assortment of millipedes, centipedes and beetles; miniscule, alien-like tardigrades, nematodes and mites, and copeopods, to name but a few.</p><p>Communities of good bacteria actively process and recombine carbon and nitrogen molecules into available nutrients that plants roots can then absorb, with the help of mycorrhizal fungi. Just as with the more familiar, above-ground food webs, soil organisms are all interconnected in complex food webs, too: Predators and prey, producers and consumers, each with a specialised metabolism and exact niche in the soil ecosystem. Each is a necessary contributor to the maintenance of healthy, living soil.</p><p>Scientists are only beginning to recognise the complexity of soil biota and their essential contribution to life on earth. A 2023 review of research, published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reveals that more than half of all the species on Earth live in the soil. These include everything from microbes to mammals, with a staggering 90% of fungi, 85% of plants, and more than 50% of bacteria living in soil.</p><p>In addition to the diversity of life in soil, its abundance is staggering, too. Protozoa, for example, are tiny single-celled organisms - so abundant that just one teaspoon of fertile soil can contain as many as a million of these tiny creatures. In fact, one teaspoon of healthy soil contains more living organisms than there are humans on the whole of Earth. It's as though the scientific world is catching up with the insight of poet William Blake, who wrote these words in the early 1800s: \"To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.\"</p><p>The health of soil biota has far-reaching implications for global food security, and soil also plays a massive role in climate-change feedbacks. Soil management affects the biological processes that lead to soils either losing carbon to the atmosphere or sequestering carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Healthy soil, with a full array of soil biodiversity, also helps in climate adaptation, by increasing soil resilience to the impact of floods and droughts. So, protecting soil life and soil carbon is a crucial component of climate-change mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>And yet, in the frenzy to maximise trade and generate ever-increasing profits, more attention goes on fertiliser use than to maintaining natural soil biota and associated fertility.</p><p>Chemical fertilisers can dramatically reduce biological activity in the soil. Because soil biota plays a crucial role in holding soil particles together, any loss in life within the soil also impacts on its physical structure, leading to compaction, erosion, and loss of natural fertility, which ties farmers in to a loop of dependence of ever-increasing quantities of fertiliser.</p><p>Impacts of agricultural fertilisers are not limited to impacts on soil biodiversity. Nitrogen fertilisers are responsible for around 5% of global greenhouse-gas emissions, more than global aviation and shipping combined.</p><p>Agricultural fertilisers are also the largest contributor to declining water quality across Ireland, with nutrient pollution from intensive agriculture a key culprit. Forty percent of rivers in Ireland are overloaded with nitrogen, with levels of water pollution that deprive aquatic invertebrates and fish of the oxygen they need to thrive, thus hampering the efforts of all those trying to restore good health to our freshwater ecosystems. Intensive dairy, in particular, is linked with elevated nitrate levels detected in the southeast and Midlands and eastern regions.</p><p>The last few years have seen a reduction in chemical-nitrogen nutrient fertiliser use in Ireland, compared to soaring quantities at the turn of the century. Recent reductions are due in part to sectoral climate targets, and in part to a rise in prices as energy costs soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. However, nitrates pollution remains one of greatest challenges to the health of Irelands environment. An environmental assessment just carried out for the fifth Nitrates Action Programme, in preparation, states clearly there is no evidence that the measures proposed for regulating and reducing the use of nitrate fertilisers will reduce water pollution and restore good water quality.</p><p>Restoring soil health is a critical task now facing us all, in non-agricultural habitats as well as in agricultural systems. Innovative approaches to farming, such as agroecology, can benefit biodiversity, while simultaneously building up soils' natural fertility and resilience. This contributes to food security, as well as a healthy environment. As we are discovering the complexity and fragility of healthy soil, the importance of protecting our soils becomes ever clearer.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Examiner", "instances": ["The health of soil biota has far-reaching implications for global food security, and soil also plays a massive role in climate-change feedbacks.

The Department of Transport in Ireland and the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) in Northern Ireland published the report last week which sets out a strategic vision for the development of the rail system across the island of Ireland over the coming decades. The report sets out 32 strategic recommendations to enhance and expand the rail system in Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2050, aligning with net carbon zero commitments in both jurisdictions. Among its recommendations is the restoration of the line from Derry to Portadown with a view to increasing North West connectivity, linking Strabane, Omagh and Dungannon to the network. Other recommendations include connecting Dublin, Shannon and Belfast International airports to the rail network, the reinstatement of the Lisburn to Antrim line for Belfast International, restoring a line linking Portadown in County Armagh with Mullingar in County Westmeath via Armagh and Cavan, building a new direct line between Lisburn and Newry and developing a new rail link from Letterkenny in County Donegal to Derry. The plans include commitments to continue investment in accessibility, refreshing the review every decade, and improving connectivity to the south east. It is expected the recommendations would take up to 25 years to implement in full. Northern Ireland will pay a quarter of the cost, estimated to be between (EURO)35bn (\u00a329bn) and (EURO)37bn (\u00a331bn) in 2023 terms. DfI Minister, John O'Dowd, said the publication the final report marked 'a historic' day. He stated: \"The publication of the Final Report of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review, the first of its kind across this island, is historic and I am pleased that we have reached this point. \"The report provides an evidence-based framework to help guide future investment in our rail network, and will help us meet our climate commitments. \"The Review has been an excellent example of joint collaboration on cross-border priorities, and this continued partnership will be key to realising its ambitions. \"This publication brings us to a new chapter where we can shape a better future for everyone by decarbonising key services and investing in climate adaptation measures, while at the same time supporting economic productivity through projects, policy and legislation. \"Getting infrastructure right, and investing in it accordingly, can create the foundations for better rural and urban communities.\" Minister for Transport, Ireland, Eamon Ryan, added: \"This is an important day for the island of Ireland. \"This is not just the first All-Island Strategic Rail Review, it is the most ambitious vision for rail in a century, bringing us forward to a new age of rail. \"This vision has been made possible by close cooperation between the departments and agencies north and south. \"Rail not only allows us to carry more people and freight in a more sustainable way, it is the great connector, enabling greater regional accessibility and balanced regional development. \"The report provides a long-term vision and a series of recommendations for the sustainable development of the rail network on the island. \"I would like to see the recommendations actioned as soon as possible, and I am pleased that work is now well underway, with European Investment Bank assistance, on how we can move forward.\" The All-Island Strategic Rail Review Report and associated Strategic Environmental Assessment reports can be accessed via the Department of Transport's website and the Department for Infrastructure's website.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "Strabane Weekly", "instances": ["\"The report provides an evidence-based framework to help guide future investment in our rail network, and will help us meet our climate commitments. \"The Review has been an excellent example of joint collaboration on cross-border priorities, and this continued partnership will be key to realising its ambitions. \"Getting infrastructure right, and investing in it accordingly, can create the foundations for better rural and urban communities.

It is the transition and transformation of the power system to take a greatly increased level of renewables.</p><p> The Climate Action Plan has set a target of up to 80 per cent renewables on the grid by 2030. We need to look at what the grid will look like in 2030. It will be a very different asset base to the one we manage now. </p><p>She says the design of the grid is not best suited to renewables.  The transmission system was developed to bring power from large generating plants like Moneypoint, Ardnacrusha and Poolbeg to the distribution system. The transmission system is the backbone of the power system, it is the motorways of power and is largely made up of 400mw, 220mw and 110mw overhead and underground cables. We also have substations that change the voltage up and down. This is what makes up our asset base. My team s role is to ensure that the asset base is maintained and repaired, and then replaced when it comes to its end of life. </p><p>That asset base will expand over time with hundreds of kilometres of new cables being added along with supporting infrastructure. But developing new assets will be avoided where possible.  As we move to 80 per cent renewables we want to make the most of the existing grid,  she says. </p><p> It requires a huge investment to build new assets. Maximising the efficiency of existing assets is a quick win. </p><p>That means ensuring the assets last as long as possible.  We are certified to the ISO55001 asset management systems standard. We are planning assets to last 40, 50 or even 60 years. The decisions we make now will have implications far into the future, and we need to plan for the full life cycle. Hence the ISI accreditation. We have billions of euro invested in assets, and we have to get the most out of them. </p><p>When assets are replaced the aim is to upgrade what is there.  The Powering up Dublin project will replace older cables that have reached their end of life. They have been in the ground for between 40 and 60 years, and we are replacing them with new ones with greater capacity. This will help us meet increasing demand in the Dublin area as well as accommodate more renewables on the system, particularly from offshore wind farms off the east coast. </p><p>Innovation plays a key role.  We are using new technologies like dynamic line rating (DLR) and dynamic power controllers (DPCs) to help maximise the efficiency of the grid. DLR measures the temperature of the conductors in real time. Temperature affects the carrying capacity of the conductor. Broadly speaking the lower the temperature the higher the capacity. By measuring temperature in real time the amount of power carried on the system can be based on actual weather conditions. We are at the beginning of this journey. We pilot each new technology and what is successful we look at how to deploy it. </p><p>Climate adaptation is another key aspect of the work of O Flanagan s team.  We look at the impact of flooding in coastal areas, for example, and make sure the grid is safe and secure in those locations. We also look at the impact of an increase in temperatures on the grid carrying capacity. We are getting a lot more frequent heavy downpours and that affects drainage around our substations. We look at the risk of floods, model their impacts and assess the need for mitigation measures. </p><p>The team also plays a central role in making sure EirGrid is able to implement the technological solutions that enable new projects to include biodiversity-friendly features.</p><p>  We work very closely with our colleagues in the public engagement team. We look at how to include nature in the design of our projects. One of the initiatives is to look at introducing vegetation over our underground cables. We are looking at international best practice there. We can t plant deep rooted trees, of course, but we are looking at what we can do. We are trying to do something positive for nature, and we are running pilot schemes to see what might work for us and for nature. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["We are at the beginning of this journey.

Sectors at most risk could be non-irrigated cereals, and specifically maize; fruit trees and perennials; potatoes in northern Europe; and livestock which depend on green fodder.</p><p>Irish farmers will agree with the latter point, after the March deluges have delayed grazing and fer tiliser for grass, with some sources already warning last week there could be a severe impact on winter fodder supplies in 2023-24.</p><p>To support farmers and to maintain productivity, the EU sees options such as risk management tools (insurance, hedging, etc); early warning systems implemented by local authorities; farmers diversifying their revenue sources; improvements to soil health and agroecosystems; or investment in specific equipment such as greenhouses, irrigation, etc.</p><p>In the new CAP, some member states seek to prevent flood damage with practices favourable to soil structure, such as rotations, plant cover, and limitation of tillage, plus maintenance or establishment of hedges or buffer zones.</p><p>It is understandable that several EU members have given climate mitigation higher priority in the CAP strategies than Ireland. Climate change is much more evident in other EU states.</p><p>In 2022, a sweltering heatwave with record-breaking temperatures had disastrous consequences for agriculture in many continental countries, and in the UK.</p><p>In 2021, extreme rainfall led to severe flooding in the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, and in Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Earlier in the year, a very cold early April after a very warm March caused large-scale frost damage in grapevines and fruit trees in central France.</p><p>In 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, record-breaking summer heatwaves hit Western Europe and Scandinavia. The 2018 heatwave made life difficult for Irish livestock farmers, and we had Storm Ophelia in October 2017.</p><p>In 2017, severe winter weather brought extreme cold and snow in Italy, the Balkans, and Turkey.</p><p>In 2016, extreme rainfall forced the evacuation of thousands in central and northeastern France and southern Germany.</p><p>Irish farmers escaped most of the extreme weather events. For example, Storm Desmond struck in December 2015, a winter month when farmers are well prepared for bad weather, even though Desmond broke records for 24-hour rainfall.</p><p>Other member states have not been so lucky, with 2015 also bringing a heatwave across much of Europe in early July. There were heavy rains and landslides in France, Germany, and the Czech Republic in 2010; and extreme heat and droughts in many western and southern European countries in 2003, 2006, and 2007.</p><p>The new report for the European Parliament acknowledges pronounced regional differences in the increasing climate extremes across Europe. It warns that adaptation requires a systemic approach, whereas CAP interventions generally support single practices.</p><p>It recommends that better efforts be made to support risk-management tools such as insurance, and says synergies between water management policies, agricultural policies, and climate policies still need to be strengthened.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Examiner", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 35, "title": "No regrets . . . the science of saying no at work", "published": "2024-08-26", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were once four scientists who decided to take a systematic approach to honing one of working life s great skills: the art of saying no.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With workloads heading to burnout levels of busyness, they agreed that in the space of one year, they would collectively turn down 100 work-related requests and track what happened as a result.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having drawn up a spreadsheet to record what each passed up and why, and how they felt about it, they set about declining a raft of requests to review journal articles, write grant proposals or run more things at work. Together, they also turned down 31 speaking invitations   fewer than the 43 talks and guest lectures they still gave.</p><p>It took them 10 months to rack up their 100th  no , or roughly 25 rejections each, by which time they had learnt several things. First, the act of tracking your work itself makes it easier to say no, partly because you get a better idea of everything you re doing.</p><p>Also, a firm rejection is better than a  soft no  because agreeing to, say, give a talk in a few months  time, or review a paper instead of co-writing it, invariably leads to bigger asks later. And there are useful rules to adopt, such as  does this fit with my work? ,  does it spark joy?  and  can I do it without messing up existing commitments? .</p><h>Guilty</h><p> The four academics   all environmental social scientists and all female   wrote about their year in a 2022 Nature science journal article, which I recommend. But one of their discoveries has stuck with me since: they had no regrets about saying no.</p><p>They did routinely feel guilty and they worried about letting others down   despite visible evidence of the substantial commitments each had made. Yet they also felt their fears of missing out, or suffering reprisals for saying no, were unfounded.</p><p>I was curious to know if this was still the case two years on. When I contacted one of the four last week to ask, I found that not only did they still have zero regrets, they were doubling down on saying no. Or rather, quadrupling.</p><p> One of our big takeaways was that 100 declines collectively is great but it s not enough,  said AR Siders, an associate professor at the University of Delaware s disaster research centre, who researches climate adaptation.</p><p> So now we re trying for 100 each in the year ending December 2024, so together we should say no to 400 things. </p><p>Prof Siders had so far managed 34 declines, putting her behind the other three who had recorded 37, 51 and 54.</p><p>But she was pleased to have beaten the 25-odd  nos  she achieved the last time. She put this down to strategies she adopted to make rejections easier, such as limiting the number of peer reviews she writes to two for each journal article she takes part in submitting.</p><p>She is also trying to cap the number of speaking invitations she accepts. And crucially, she is trying to whittle down big commitments that affect how well she can work, such as research projects, not just smaller things like talks.</p><p> So even though I might say no less often, I m saying no to bigger things and it s making a difference,  she says. When she fell ill recently she had enough slack in her schedule that getting sick didn t throw everything into disarray.</p><h>Mentoring </h><p>I find all this instructive, especially for women, who often find it hard to say no to far more thankless requests than giving a talk. Female employees are statistically more likely than men to be asked to take on mentoring, training and other time- eating  non-promotable tasks .</p><p> They are also more likely to do them, according to four different female academics who wrote a 2022 book about the problem<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p><p>Siders had not heard of the book until after she and her colleagues published their Nature article.

The early signs are concerning.</p><p>Microsoft's CO2 emissions jumped some 30% since 2020 as the company invested in AI infrastructure, while Google's are up almost 50% over the past five years.

To project those, we need to know how the electricity to power AI data centres will be generated and how AI will impact carbon-intensive industries.</p><p>According to the International Energy Agency, data centres accounted for roughly 1%-1.5% of electricity use worldwide in 2023. This share is sure to grow in the short term.</p><p>Microsoft, Google, and Meta nearly doubled their cumulative electricity consumption between 2020 and 2022, and that was before the arrival of ChatGPT. Since then, they have only strengthened their commitments to expanding this infrastructure.</p><p>While data centres represented roughly 1% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, the electricity systems that power them are rapidly decarbonising.</p><p>In the US, 41% of electricity was produced from zero-carbon sources in 2023 - marking a 25% increase over the past decade.

Noting the results of a recent ESRI study which found that 25 per cent of people had changed what they eat to reduce their carbon footprint, he points out that this change in behaviour will not necessarily result in a reduction in Ireland s carbon emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> If the average Irish consumer decides to eat less meat, as they are fully entitled to do, it will not actually lead to an emissions reduction in the national inventory,  he says.  Any beef, lamb, pork, or poultry not consumed in Ireland will simply be exported to meet the growing global demand. On the other hand if you were to use public transport more there would be an immediate benefit for the transport emissions inventory. Likewise, if you were to retrofit your home, making it more efficient, there would be an immediate benefit to the energy inventory and so on. </p><p>He also notes a report published last year by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Office (UNFAO) which found that dietary change represented a small percentage of all known options to reduce agricultural greenhouse emissions globally.  The responsibility falls on the entire agricultural sector, working together, to deliver on the emissions reduction options available to us so that the consumer can continue to enjoy the nutritional benefits of meat. This is where the focus must be, and the sector is starting to generate real momentum in this regard. Emissions in the sector have peaked and are starting to decline, this is not the case for all sectors. Hopefully this will result in a more balanced commentary. </p><p>The relatively low carbon footprint of Irish beef is also worthy of note, he adds.  Consumers must understand that our farmers produce beef in a way that minimises its impact on the environment with grass accounting for most the animal s diet. The grass is often produced from land that would not support other agricultural enterprises such as tillage or horticulture.</p><p> Grassland is the most climate resilient crop we have, so this is also important from a climate adaptation perspective. Our most efficient farmers are producing beef at 6kg CO2 per kg of beef, while beef in other parts of the world, the comparative figure could be as high as 80kg CO2 per kg of beef. There is no comparison, and our farmers should be praised, not vilified, for making such significant improvements over recent years. Ultimately this is what a just transition looks like for agriculture, with government and industry collaborating with farmers to drive efficiency improvements, thus reducing absolute emissions. </p><p>Efforts continue to reduce emissions still further.  At a practical level the industry is focused on finishing animals earlier by using better genetics and farm management practices,  says Crammond.  Our industry invests EUR 46 million annually in age-related bonus payments to encourage earlier finishing ages. The industry is also funding the world-leading National Genotyping Programme, which will allow the sector to breed more methane-efficient animals, thus reducing emissions further. Furthermore, an additional EUR 150 million has been invested into animal health, biodiversity and knowledge-transfer programmes for farmers over the last five years. </p><p>He emphasises the nutritional importance of meat.  Irish beef, lamb, pork, and poultry products contain essential vitamins and minerals that are critical for human nutrition. These include vitamin D, vitamin B12, manganese, iron, zinc, selenium and other essential amino acids, some of which are only found in animal-sourced foods. For children and the elderly animal-sourced protein is even more critical. Studies have shown that this animal protein is critical for proper neurocognitive and brain development in children. </p><h> Higher quality  </h><p>And not all protein is created equal.  Research is now showing us that animal protein is of a higher quality than plant-based protein and is generally more available to us as humans,  he says.  For example, there is the same amount of available protein in 100g of nutritious red meat as there is in 400g of chickpeas, a plant-based alternative. Therefore, from an available protein perspective the emissions levels associated with the cultivation of chickpeas versus our efficient beef production are much closer than many people realise. The nutritional science is there for everyone to review and simplistic narratives around meat must be avoided. </p><p>He says consumers want to eat safe, nutritious and sustainably-produced animal products, and the Irish agri-food sector produces these products better than most.  As an industry we will continue to do everything we can to improve on our already excellent sustainability credentials. The Paris Agreement is clear, we must meet our climate objectives in a manner that does not threaten food security.

Climate adaptation, however, receives much less attention and profile but is also crucially important. Adaptation looks at how we reduce and manage the risk of present and future climate impacts and how we can do this in the most sustainable and effective way.</p><p>Only by addressing both climate mitigation and adaptation together can we truly prepare for our future climate and limit the pernicious effects of climate change. The conference, this week, will focus on adaptation topics that are actively being discussed across Europe, and are of real significance here in Ireland. This includes how we as a country support our coastal communities to respond to sea level rise and coastal erosion and how we prepare our infrastructure to deal with more frequent and severe climate events such as storms, flooding or prolonged drought.</p><p>As with many other countries across the world, in Ireland, we are facing an existential threat from climate change. Almost 1,500 km of our 7,400 km coastline is at risk of coastal erosion. Many of our coastal areas are susceptible due to a high composition of soft sediment. These areas are most common on Ireland's eastern and southern coasts and in sedimentary bays such as the Shannon estuary, Clew Bay, Tralee and Dingle Bays.</p><p>With increased erosion, rising sea levels and more frequent coastal storms we need a clear Coastal Management Strategy to help actively manage our changing coastlines and address the challenges our coastal communities face. It is only by planning and taking action now that we can prepare communities and society to be resilient to the challenges of tomorrow.</p><p>With a targeted response climate adaptation actions can help to slow the loss of biodiversity, which is in decline, across the country. Moreover, we can combine adaptation and mitigation actions together to increase their positive impacts and lead to biodiversity gains.</p><p>Planting in areas close to waterways, for example, can help create natural capacity to absorb flood waters, absorb carbon dioxide and increase green space.

When most people think climate change, they immediately think of climate mitigation, which is reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Adaptation looks at how we reduce and manage the risk of present and future climate impacts and how we can do this in the most sustainable and effective way. Only by addressing both climate mitigation and adaptation together can we truly prepare for our future climate and limit the pernicious effects of climate change.", "With increased erosion, rising sea levels and more frequent coastal storms we need a clear Coastal Management Strategy to help actively manage our changing coastlines and address the challenges our coastal communities face. It is only by planning and taking action now that we can prepare communities and society to be resilient to the challenges of tomorrow. Moreover, we can combine adaptation and mitigation actions together to increase their positive impacts and lead to biodiversity gains.
