We are ready to work with Rwanda to link its carbon credit supply to the global market through Singapore,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rwandan Environment Minister Jeanne d'Arc Mujawamariya and the Ministry of Trade and Industry's deputy secretary, Mr Keith Tan, signed a memorandum of understanding on Dec 2 to collaborate on carbon markets.

Tackling heat-stress inequality will be critical for policymakers all over the world, as part of their national climate adaptation plans. </p><p> Scientific research shows that the world is headed towards more extreme heat. A national climate change study by Singapore, released last week, predicts that the city-state's mean daily temperature could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. </p><p> Scorching days are set to become a new normal. In the last four decades, Singapore on average had 21.4 \"very hot\" days annually, when daily maximum temperatures exceeded 35 deg C. By 2100, the country is projected to experience 41 such days annually at best, and 351 at worst. </p><p> Night-time will be more uncomfortable too. Singapore has on average had 76 annual \"warm nights\" -- hotter than 26.3 deg C -- over the last 40 years. By 2100, almost every night could be a warm one.</p><p> Heat will have a great economic toll. Over 40 countries, especially those in Asia, will experience declines in their economies because of heat stress, according to a 2016 paper by the United Nations. China's gross domestic product could fall 1 per cent and Indonesia's by 6 per cent by 2030. Extreme heat could also curb annual working hours across South-east Asia, the paper said.</p><p> The social impact may be less visible, but just as dire. Low-income households would face harsher living conditions, especially those in crowded and poorly ventilated areas. Hotter homes can indirectly reinforce poverty, by making it harder for children to study and posing numerous health risks. </p><p> Indoor cooling would be the simplest solution, but remains out of reach for the poor. In the Indian city of Kolkata, air-conditioning can cost a third of a worker's monthly salary, which ranges from US$120 to US$144 a month, an analysis by The Washington Post found. In a cruel irony, those who do manage to afford air-conditioning end up blowing hot air into their neighbours' homes.</p><p> Also at risk are blue-collar workers exposed to the elements. Extreme weather is more likely to restrict low-paid and low-skilled jobs -- such as farming and heavy labour -- while those who work corporate jobs are shielded from the outdoors. Blue-collar workers may also end up working longer hours without an increase in pay, as the weather limits their productivity. Once again, this could reinforce poverty. </p><p> Governments all over the world will need to ensure that the most vulnerable segments of society are given extra support to cope with the heat. This may mean redesigning buildings and infrastructure in poor communities to ensure that they do not trap heat, while increasing access to cooling equipment. Employers will also need to manage their workers' heat exposure and invest in safety equipment. </p><p> Tackling heat-stress inequality will no doubt involve substantial costs, which will need to be budgeted for.

Tackling heat-stress inequality will be critical for policymakers all over the world, as part of their national climate adaptation plans. Scientific research shows that the world is headed towards more extreme heat. </p><p>A national climate change study by Singapore, released last week, predicts that the city-state's mean daily temperature could rise by as much as 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Scorching days are set to become a new normal. In the last four decades, Singapore on average had 21.4 \"very hot\" days annually, when daily maximum temperatures exceeded 35 deg C. By 2100, the country is projected to experience 41 such days annually at best, and 351 at worst. Night-time will be more uncomfortable too. Singapore has on average had 76 annual \"warm nights\" - hotter than 26.3 deg C - over the last 40 years. By 2100, almost every night could be a warm one.Heat will have a great economic toll. Over 40 countries, especially those in Asia, will experience declines in their economies because of heat stress, according to a 2016 paper by the United Nations. China's gross domestic product could fall 1 per cent and Indonesia's by 6 per cent by 2030. Extreme heat could also curb annual working hours across South-east Asia, the paper said.The social impact may be less visible, but just as dire. Low-income households would face harsher living conditions, especially those in crowded and poorly ventilated areas. Hotter homes can indirectly reinforce poverty, by making it harder for children to study and posing numerous health risks. Indoor cooling would be the simplest solution, but remains out of reach for the poor. In the Indian city of Kolkata, air-conditioning can cost a third of a worker's monthly salary, which ranges from US$120 to US$144 a month, an analysis by The Washington Post found. In a cruel irony, those who do manage to afford air-conditioning end up blowing hot air into their neighbours' homes.Also at risk are blue-collar workers exposed to the elements. Extreme weather is more likely to restrict low-paid and low-skilled jobs - such as farming and heavy labour - while those who work corporate jobs are shielded from the outdoors. Blue-collar workers may also end up working longer hours without an increase in pay, as the weather limits their productivity. Once again, this could reinforce poverty. Governments all over the world will need to ensure that the most vulnerable segments of society are given extra support to cope with the heat. This may mean redesigning buildings and infrastructure in poor communities to ensure that they do not trap heat, while increasing access to cooling equipment. Employers will also need to manage their workers' heat exposure and invest in safety equipment. Tackling heat-stress inequality will no doubt involve substantial costs, which will need to be budgeted for. Failing to do so could ultimately exact a bigger economic and social toll.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Extreme weather is more likely to restrict low-paid and low-skilled jobs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as farming and heavy labour.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B2P-BJR1-JCF2-807X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.</p><p> Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.</p><p> Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.</p><p> Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.</p><p> With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.</p><p> Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.</p><p> Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub. \"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.</p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.</p><p> Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.</p><p> In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.</p><p> Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.</p><p> While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.</p><p> Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.</p><p> For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.</p><p> Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.</p><p> Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.</p><p> One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.</p><p> This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.</p><p> Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.</p><p> Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.</p><p> \"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.</p><p> Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.</p><p> The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.</p><p> However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.</p><p> In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.</p><p> Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.</p><p> The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.</p><p> Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.</p><p> \"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mangrove trees on Singapore's Semakau island; beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers say.

It will have a crucial role in channelling the industry's perspectives and standards continue to evolve,\" he added.</p><p>The SSFA will be able to improve the bankability of projects by combining financing solutions from different asset classes including risk mitigation tools, highlighted Chia. This extends beyond climate mitigation to encompass the financing of less viable projects associated with climate adaptation and biodiversity preservation.</p><p>He elaborated further, indicating that the SSFA can play a role in supporting upskilling and capacity-building initiatives by providing guidance on the relevance of sustainable finance courses. This involves aligning training programmes offered by institutes of higher learning and other providers.</p><p>At the same time, the SSFA can encourage the adoption of IBF's skills certification schemes and organise capacity-building workshops in areas not readily covered by existing training providers, such as carbon markets, taxonomy application and blended finance.</p><p>\"I look forward to the SSFA playing a key role in galvanising partnerships and collective efforts to shape the future sustainable finance landscape for years to come,\" Chia added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Focus areas</emphasis></p><p>During the launch event, the first SSFA co-chairs - Deborah Ho, BlackRock's Head of Singapore and South-east Asia, and Wong Kee Joo, Chief Executive, HSBC Singapore - said that the association had formalised the governance structure and outlined the workplan for the upcoming year at its inaugural Executive Committee (EXCO) meeting held earlier in the day.</p><p>They said that this includes the establishment of workstreams to focus on five key areas - carbon markets, transition finance, blended finance, natural capital and biodiversity, and taxonomy.</p><p>SSFA members can actively participate in these workstreams, gaining access to sustainable finance events and forums. Additionally, they will be kept informed about the latest developments in government policies and initiatives at local, regional, and global levels.</p><p>To support these initiatives, the SSFA will be backed by a dedicated secretariat team, led by its director, Kavitha Menon.</p><p>The association will be governed by the EXCO comprising C-Suite representatives from financial \u00a0institutions (banks, insurance and investment management firms), non-financial sector corporates and academia.

More than $30 billion worth of such financing originated here in 2022.</p><p> It also has a carbon services and trading ecosystem of over 100 companies, the highest concentration in the region.</p><p> \"Singapore has stepped up in leading change and seeding solutions. We have shaped standards and guidance, and championed innovative financing approaches for green and transition finance projects, together with international partners,\" Mr Chia said.</p><p> But Singapore can do more to contribute in the areas of standards, solutions and skills -- that will require the financial sector and industry \"to collaborate and leverage the deep expertise that resides in each domain. The SSFA will be a key platform to achieve this\".</p><p>Singapore has to adopt innovative financing approaches, so it can tackle projects that are only marginally bankable or considered to be currently unbankable, he added.</p><p> The country also needs to invest in its people.

Most of us barely give it a thought. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet, we depend on these grids to keep our lives ticking. They are set to expand rapidly as populations grow and economies use more electricity. They are also widening their reach to tap more green energy sources. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But what if these grids are increasingly likely to let us down'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Grids are at risk of being damaged by worsening climate impacts, especially more powerful storms and floods and more intense heatwaves and cold snaps. This can lead to outages. Without greater investment in resilience, they risk becoming a weak link. </p><p> A recent disaster in the Australian state of Victoria is a stark reminder. </p><p> On Feb 13, 2024, six high-voltage transmission towers collapsed during a powerful storm south-west of Melbourne. More than 500,000 homes and businesses lost power across the state. </p><p> The blackout was not a one-off. Similar collapses have occurred in recent years in southern Australia.</p><p> \"Climate change is increasing the risk of outages due to the increased frequency, severity and distribution of extreme weather events,\" said the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Climate Resilience for Energy Security report released in November 2022.</p><p> \"Electricity networks are the leading cause of climate-driven outages in many countries and are considered the element of the power system most vulnerable to climate impacts,\" it says. And these outages are costly in terms of disruption to people, communications and businesses. </p><p> Grids comprise long-distance transmission lines that connect states within countries or cross national borders. The power is then channelled to the local distribution grid, which delivers power to customers. </p><p> The technology exists to make grids more resilient and is already being deployed, but it needs to be rolled out faster and at scale. The IEA says grid investment needs to double to more than US$600 billion (S$806.3 billion) a year by the end of the decade, a large portion of it in Asia. </p><p> \"There's an increasing imperative that we need to do this much faster because we just don't have time, both from a climate perspective and an ageing infrastructure perspective, which is being impacted by climate change,\" said Mr Scott Hamilton, senior adviser to Australia's Smart Energy Council, an industry-funded body.</p><p> Australia, like many nations, has to simultaneously upgrade ageing grid infrastructure as it builds thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines to connect scores of large solar, wind and battery storage projects around the country, many in rural areas, he said. It's an immense and costly challenge as the climate risks grow, bringing storms, flash floods and forest fires in their wake. </p><p> Storms, floods and fires\"These events are causing more of these impacts. It's only a matter of time until another one happens in Australia or another part of the world,\" said Mr Hamilton, an adjunct associate professor at Melbourne's Monash University.</p><p> About a quarter of global electricity networks are exposed to severe storms, and more than 10 per cent are exposed to tropical cyclones, particularly in North America, Australia and East Asia, the IEA says.</p><p> In January 2005, when storm Gudrun hit Sweden, outages in rural areas lasted up to 20 days because of damaged distribution lines, while those in urban areas with underground cabling lasted only a few hours, the IEA report said. </p><p>Swedish network operators lost around EUR250 million (S$365 million). But the broader losses to ordinary people and businesses due to the interruptions were estimated at EUR3 billion.  </p><p> Nearly half of global power networks are also exposed to fire weather conditions for more than 50 days a year -- and close to 18 per cent of the global electricity network sees more than 200 fire weather days annually, the IEA said. Australia, California and southern Europe are especially vulnerable.</p><p> Grid expectationsDespite the risks, investment in green power is charging ahead. </p><p> The United Nations COP28 climate conference in Dubai in December 2023 set the world a great green goal. Nearly 200 nations backed a target to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.</p><p> Wiring up all this additional green power is going to require a lot of poles and wires. </p><p> The IEA said the world's electricity use needs to grow 20 per cent faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one to meet national climate goals. This means adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km of national grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid. </p><p> Rystad Energy, in a research note on Feb 15, 2024, said US$3.1 trillion of grid infrastructure investments is needed before 2030 if the world is to limit global warming to 1.8 deg C above pre-industrial levels. Under this scenario, an additional 18 million km of grid network would be needed to keep up with the growing electrification under way across cities and countries as economies expand, including new renewable energy capacity and the rapid adoption of electric vehicles and more electrical appliances. </p><p> Asia is set to contribute more than half of the global additions this decade, with China and India leading the way as the world's largest and third-largest power consumers, Rystad said. \"We predict global grid investments will reach US$374 billion this year, with China accounting for about 30 per cent of the total.\" </p><p> China is leading the world with record additions of solar and wind energy capacity and has been building long-distance transmission lines to bring that power to the heavily populated coastal hinterland. It added just over 38,000 km in each of the past two years -- that's nearly twice the distance around the planet at the Equator. </p><p> But worsening storms and floods present a growing challenge, especially at the local level. Record flooding in Zhengzhou in Henan province in July 2021 knocked out power and communications for days to the worst-hit parts of the city of 13 million people. </p><p> China has invested heavily in research and development of its grid, boosting interconnections and strengthening weather forecasting, among other key steps. </p><p> \"Electricity reliability is highly prioritised by China's government,\" said Beijing-based Ms Yujing Liu, principal, China power decarbonisation, for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US think-tank. </p><p> But she added that more needs to be done to strengthen the much larger distribution grid at the local level, where development and investment are lacking. </p><p> In Europe, grid operators and European Union regulators are increasingly focused on climate-proofing the transmission network. The Renewables Grid Initiative (RGI), a collaboration of non-governmental organisations and European transmission system operators, is helping to promote a greener and resilient grid. </p><p> \"Over the long term, electricity grid infrastructure resilience measures can not only increase security of supply and reduce overall operation and maintenance costs, but also further contribute to climate change mitigation as the electricity grid integrates more renewable energy,\" said Dr Andrzej Ceglarz, RGI's director of energy systems. </p><p> Costs, though, remain a concern for grid operators, he said. </p><p> The EU's Trans-European Network for Energy Regulation sets out rules for cross-border energy infrastructure and promotes the integration of renewables. It also explicitly promotes the need for climate adaptation measures, which will increase the grid's resilience, Dr Ceglarz said.</p><p> For green energy investors and asset managers, a climate-proof grid is essential. Macquarie Asset Management, a major global renewable energy investor, says companies in its portfolio, including utilities, have been strengthening their networks, including using sensors, drones and geospatial technologies to anticipate and manage extreme weather events. </p><p> SolutionsOne key solution is burying power cables underground. Tokyo is doing this as part of its climate adaptation plan. </p><p>Singapore has gone one step further and built a cross-island network of transmission cable tunnels 60m below ground. Completed in 2019, the 40km network not only protects high-voltage power lines, but also makes it easier to repair and replace them. </p><p> In Finland, Elenia, the nation's second-largest power grid operator, has a long-term programme to put 90 per cent of its electricity network underground by 2036. By the end of 2023, nearly two-thirds of its 76,600km network had been buried. </p><p> This solution is generally more expensive and is not foolproof -- underground cables are vulnerable to heatwaves and construction accidents from road, telecoms and building construction. But burying power lines generally boosts reliability and reduces downtime. </p><p> Other steps include designing stronger transmission towers, more frequent visual inspections of power lines, especially those vulnerable to wildfires, and regular pruning of trees and branches as well as grass in fire-prone areas. </p><p> Traditional power lines carrying two to four wires are also vulnerable to high winds as the wires can touch each other, causing sparks. One solution is highly insulated cables that bundle the power cables tightly. </p><p> Building in redundancy is another way to reduce outages. Increasing interconnections between different parts of the grid gives operators greater chances to reroute power during emergencies. </p><p> There's another solution that means no grid connection at all: distributed renewable energy. </p><p> Power to the peopleThese are mini-grids, in which a community's electricity is generated locally from solar, wind or pumped hydro and is supported by battery storage. It's a solution for rich and poor nations alike, such as remote towns or remote islands -- or places that have never been connected to the grid. </p><p> Some Indonesian islands are shifting away from diesel-powered generation to renewable energy mini-grids, for example. </p><p> \"One of the real advantages of having a big investment in distributed energy, or community energy, is you don't really need to build these massive transmission lines,\" said Mr Hamilton. </p><p> One example is Yackandandah, a town of 2,000 people in north-east Victoria, which is close to achieving 100 per cent renewable energy generation from rooftop solar and community batteries. The project has been in development for several years and is widely supported by the community and the state government. </p><p> And it is just one of a growing number of similar projects in Australia in which communities are going green, cutting their power bills and aiming to be self-reliant for electricity. Distributed energy systems have the potential to reduce or avoid significant power network and generation costs in the years ahead, some experts say. </p><p> Missing linkFor now, though, grids will be needed to channel the energy from the many large solar, wind and battery projects being built or planned globally. These investments are a key part of cutting reliance on polluting fossil fuels that are driving climate change. </p><p> But for that to work, grids of the future must remain reliable and resilient and cope with everything that climate change can throw at them. </p><p> There's still a lot of work to do, says the IEA. </p><p> Governments need to prioritise grid investment and national adaptation strategies need to include clear action plans to strengthen the power transmission network. Weak grids will only hold back the global fight against climate change and prove very costly down the line. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Electricity transmission towers in the Gobi desert in Yinchuan, in China's northern Ningxia region.

It can also bring together financial institutions and industry sectors to identify integrated approaches to scaling the financing needed. </p><p> \"For example, it can combine financing solutions from different asset classes, including risk mitigation tools, to improve the bankability of projects. This applies not only to those in climate mitigation, but also in financing less-bankable projects related to climate adaptation and biodiversity preservation,\" he added.</p><p> The association can contribute to upskilling and capacity building initiatives by guiding the relevance of courses in sustainable finance; these include training courses offered by institutes of higher learning and other training providers. </p><p> In tandem, SSFA can also promote the skills-certification schemes run by the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) Singapore, and organise capacity-building workshops in areas not readily offered by the training providers. </p><p> Chia, noting that MAS, IBF and Workforce Singapore are studying the impact of sustainability on Singapore's financial sector workforce, said: \"Preliminary findings suggest that most of the jobs must be augmented by upskilling to support changes in regulations, products and processes. In addition, new and highly specialised roles, such as sustainability-risk analysts, will be created.\" </p><p> The full findings and key initiatives to beef up the sector will be released in April. </p><p> \"Sustainable finance is a key thrust of Singapore's development as a leading international financial centre,\" said Chia, for whom Wednesday's event was his first public industry engagement since taking over the helm of Singapore's central bank from his predecessor Ravi Menon, who has retired. </p><p> The setting up of the SSFA was mooted by MAS last June; The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) was named the main coordinator. </p><p> The new association comes on the heels of efforts by the Green Finance Industry Taskforce, which was formed in 2019 to kickstart the development of green finance in Singapore. Its work culminated in the sustainable and transition finance taxonomy launched at the United Nations climate change conference last December. </p><p> The taskforce had at first been set up as a temporary body, but the industry recognised the need for a permanent entity to navigate the evolving sustainable-finance space. </p><p> The first-term co-chairs of the SSFA, set up as that permanent entity, are Deborah Ho, country head of Singapore and regional head of South-east Asia at asset manager BlackRock, and Wong Kee Joo, chief executive officer of HSBC Singapore. </p><p> Gillian Tan, chief sustainability officer and assistant MD for development and international at MAS, and ABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon will be standing members of the association's executive committee. </p><p> Other members include the chief sustainability officers of the three Singapore banks -- DBS, OCBC and UOB. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chia Der Jiun, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, says the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association will be a key platform for the financial sector to collaborate and make a difference through standards, solutions and skills.

The Agreement establishes a legally binding framework for the generation and transfer of carbon credits, promoting sustainable development and benefiting local communities. Singapore's International Carbon Credit framework allows companies to offset their emissions, strengthening its position as a carbon services and trading hub.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p>Dec. 8 -- Ministry of Trade and Industry, Government of Singapore issued the following news release:</p><p>1. Singapore signs first Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea to collaborate on carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement Singapore signs first Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea to collaborate on carbon credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement</p><p>2. This marks the first Implementation Agreement for Singapore. The Agreement sets out a legally binding framework and processes for the generation and<br/><br/>international transfer of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, between Singapore and Papua New Guinea.</p><p>3. This collaboration will advance both countries' climate ambition and help to channel financing towards additional mitigation efforts through carbon credit projects which would otherwise not be possible. The carbon credit projects authorised under the Implementation Agreement will also promote sustainable development and generate benefits for local communities, such as creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction of environmental pollution.</p><p>4. As part of Singapore's Article 6 cooperation, project developers will be required to cancel 2% of the carbon credits authorised under the Implementation Agreement at first issuance to ensure additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions. They will also be required to make a contribution equivalent to 5% share of proceeds or authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Papua New Guinea. This will help Papua New Guinea prepare for and adjust to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>5. Singapore is also supporting the development of carbon markets, by enabling the demand and supply of high-quality carbon credits to be matched. Under<br/><br/>Singapore's International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, Singapore-based carbon tax-liable companies can source for eligible ICCs generated under this Implementation Agreement to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. Trading these credits through Singapore will help to unlock new business opportunities in areas such as carbon services and sustainability solutions, strengthening Singapore's position as a carbon services and trading hub.</p><p>6. Minister Fu said, \"High-integrity carbon markets can contribute to much-needed climate action globally. As an alternative energy disadvantaged country, effective international cooperation, such as through carbon markets, will also help us to achieve our climate ambitions. We are delighted to sign our first Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea, a fellow Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) member.</p><p>We look forward to working with Papua New Guinea to advance climate action together.\"</p><p>Annex A: (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2023/12/Press-Release--Signing-of-Implementation-Agreement-with-PNG-8-Dec.pdf\">https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2023/12/Press-Release--Signing-of-Implementation-Agreement-with-PNG-8-Dec.pdf</url>)</p><p>Annex B: Implementation Agreement Factsheet(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2023/12/Press-Release--Signing-of-Implementation-Agreement-with-PNG-8-Dec.pdf\">https://www.mti.gov.sg/-/media/MTI/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2023/12/Press-Release--Signing-of-Implementation-Agreement-with-PNG-8-Dec.pdf</url>)</p><p>[Category: Energy, Partnerships and Alliances, Procurement and Sales, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Trade and Industry,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063287979</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69TY-S5B1-DXMP-K2M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 8, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A3R8</classCode><className>CARBON OFFSETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Challenges persist, ranging from the unpredictability of certain events to the disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, with rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, posing significant threats to communities globally. All of these things are happening alongside rapid urbanisation and population growth, intensifying the vulnerability of densely populated areas to disasters and the potential for catastrophic impacts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the critical need for robust disaster preparedness and response mechanisms, exposing vulnerabilities in healthcare systems, supply chains, and social infrastructure.</p><p>Amid these challenges, innovative solutions are emerging to enhance disaster preparedness and resilience. Advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and data analytics, are revolutionising disaster forecasting, early warning systems, and response coordination. Moreover, community-based initiatives that build local resilience and foster collaboration among diverse stakeholders are gaining traction. These initiatives emphasise the importance of grassroots participation, cultural sensitivity, and inclusive planning processes in enhancing community resilience to disasters.</p><p>Also read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon-x-sustainable-development-through-empowering-commerce-in-indonesia-20240314/\">Sustainable development through empowering commerce in Indonesia</url></p><p>Furthermore, there is a growing recognition of the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental factors in shaping vulnerability to disasters, driving efforts to address underlying systemic issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. As the global community confronts the complex challenges of the 21st century, innovative approaches and collaborative strategies will be essential in building a more resilient and sustainable future.</p><p>Taking on the mantle of fostering education, research, and support for disaster-preparedness efforts is Prudence Foundation, the community investment arm of Prudential PLC which aims to address target issues in three key areas with purpose-built programmes to make communities safer and more resilient to life's risks: financial literacy and inclusion, health and safety prevention, and climate adaptation.</p><p>Prudence Foundation as a catalyst for disaster tech</p><p>Technological advancements such as blockchain and decentralised platforms are enhancing coordination and transparency in disaster response operations, facilitating efficient resource allocation and accountability have proven important. These innovations spell the difference between saving and securing human lives before, during, and in the aftermath of disasters.</p><p>However, despite these advancements, persistent challenges such as funding constraints, political inertia, and systemic inequalities continue to hinder progress in achieving comprehensive and equitable disaster preparedness and resilience. Thus, there remains a pressing need for sustained commitment and collaboration at all levels to navigate the increasingly complex landscape of disaster risk management.</p><p>Over the past few years, Prudence Foundation has been spearheading initiatives such as the SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards to address these challenges.</p><p>In a nutshell, the SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards finds, funds, and supports innovative technology solutions which save lives before, during and after events of natural disasters. Since 2019, the SAFE STEPS D-Tech Awards has helped support startups working towards various aspects of disaster resilience, from digital platforms for remote project supervision and monitoring as well as infrastructure quality assurance, to cleantech startups offering waste-to-worth solutions focused on transforming waste materials into reusable products while delivering social and environmental benefits, and even to social enterprises that build simple and portable filters to make clean water accessible through water shortage solutions.</p><p>Also read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/safe-steps-d-tech-community-hub-is-leading-the-way-to-a-resilient-future-20240314/\">SAFE STEPS D-TECH Community Hub is leading the way to a resilient future</url></p><p>By examining these examples, Prudence Foundation demonstrates a holistic perspective of where to offer its support. This stems from their understanding that empowering disaster tech initiatives that address challenges in natural disasters before, during, and after they occur is paramount for enhancing resilience and reducing the impact of these events.</p><p>These initiatives are crucial in proactive preparedness by providing early warning systems, predictive analytics, and risk assessment tools, enabling communities to mitigate risks and plan effectively. During disasters, technology facilitates rapid response and coordination among stakeholders, improving the efficiency of search and rescue operations, resource allocation, and communication with affected populations. Moreover, post-disaster recovery efforts are bolstered by innovative solutions that streamline aid distribution, assess damage, and facilitate reconstruction, thereby expediting the recovery process and promoting long-term resilience.</p><p>By seeking out opportunities for investors to discover and support these initiatives, societies can better adapt to the evolving challenges posed by natural disasters, ultimately saving lives, protecting livelihoods, and building more resilient communities.</p><p>Meet Prudence Foundation at Echelon X!</p><p>Aligned with this commitment to promote and empower innovators addressing today's most pressing global challenges, Prudence Foundation will be joining Echelon X as an official Disaster Technology Partner!</p><p>Echelon X will bring together industry leaders, visionary entrepreneurs, and groundbreaking startups from all corners of the region for two packed days.

This leads to a continuous decrease in yield and threatens food security and farmers' livelihoods. Regenerative farming, on the other hand, solves climate adaptation and mitigation. Transitioning to regenerative farming, however, remains a daunting challenge for most smallholder farmers.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/sustainable-farming-supply-chain-traceability-startup-koltiva-raises-series-a-funding-20230918/\">Sustainable farming, supply chain traceability startup Koltiva raises Series A funding</url></p><p>RegenX addresses this challenge by introducing the RegenX Flywheel, which empowers global buyers to procure toxic-free and traceable ingredients directly from regenerative farming regions. This unlocks higher farm-gate prices for farmers that RegenX supports through post-harvesting guidance and regenerative agriculture monitoring.</p><p>In turn, better farming economics incentivises regenerative practices, creating more supply for RegenX ingredients that buyers can secure, enabling a virtuous cycle. This approach sequesters more carbon, improves soil health, and fosters biodiversity and water conservation.</p><p>Using farming systems encompassing intercropping, agroforestry, and the elimination of harmful pesticides and herbicides, RegenX reduces farmers' input costs and aims at sequestering 100 Megatons of CO2e annually-or ~8 per cent of the 1.3 Gigatons of CO2eq emitted on Southeast Asian agricultural farmland.</p><p>This could regenerate 6 million hectares of arable land in Southeast Asia while significantly improving farmers' livelihoods and resilience to climate change.</p><p>\"The crux of having a sustainable agrifood production system is to make regenerative agriculture more profitable for farmers than conventional agriculture, and to do so in a commercially viable way. Though it may seem deceptively simple, executing has always been a huge challenge. But we are now proving that it can be done,\" said Founder and CEO Nguyen.</p><p>-</p><p>Image Credit: RegenX</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/wavemaker-impact-backs-regenx-to-promote-regenerative-farming-in-sea-20230918/\">Wavemaker Impact backs RegenX to promote regenerative farming in SEA</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co\">e27</url> .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG119314169508889736125876100108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696M-0X11-F03R-N02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"422\"/><timeReceived>2:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>e27</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 19, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climate Tech &amp;

The world urgently needs to wean off fossil fuels, but this has been difficult with soaring inflation. South-east Asia especially is in a tough position: coal is king in the region, generating about 60 per cent of Indonesia's electricity. In Vietnam, thermal coal imports hit a three-year high in mid-2023, as air-conditioner use spiked during a brutal heatwave. </p><p> Shifting from coal to cleaner energy sources will be painful, considering that the region has coal plants that are relatively young or still in the pipeline to be built. To phase down coal assets, South-east Asian countries will also need to be assured that the rest of the world is going to decarbonise in tandem, an expert from consulting firm BCG recently told The Business Times. COP28 is a vital forum for the region to build consensus around this transition and set realistic targets. </p><p> There are a host of other sticky issues for South-east Asian countries to untangle at COP28 -- from coping with rising sea levels to hashing out details of the \"loss and damage\" fund, an initiative meant to help poor nations facing climate disasters. There is no shortage of controversy around the question of who pays for such initiatives. Carbon credits, a financial instrument that unfortunately has become mired in scandals, may also be a flashpoint in discussions.</p><p> While the challenges are overwhelming, there are also opportunities that South-east Asia can seize. </p><p>Indonesia, for instance, is blessed with rich nickel reserves, a key \"green metal\" needed to power electric vehicles (EVs) and other sustainable innovations. </p><p> The country has been focused on harnessing its reserves to create higher value materials, such as inputs for EV batteries, while following green principles in production. There is room for Indonesia and other South-east Asian countries to be more involved in joining the supply chain for sustainable energy. </p><p> Inter-country energy linkages can also be strengthened. Malaysia's Sarawak state, for instance, was reported to be in talks to supply Singapore with up to one gigawatt of renewable energy by 2032. The energy would be mainly from hydropower and supplied via submarine cables. Hopefully, more of such energy linkages could happen when climate negotiators come together.</p><p> It is easy to get a little blase about the annual COP gatherings, and overall pessimistic about the fight against global warming. Research suggests that the world is not on track to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degree Celsius. Geopolitics has complicated efforts and, on the ground, the backlash against climate policies is growing. </p><p> Yet the conference is still another chance -- as messy as it may be -- to find common ground on the existential threat of climate change.

A very good morning, and welcome to the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESG) 2024.<br/><br/>2. I am excited to see so many of us gathered here today.<br/><br/>3. Over the next four days, we will welcome over 20,000 attendees and speakers from around the world to SIWW and CESG.<br/><br/>4. This year's programme recognises the importance of pursuing development in a resource- and carbon-constrained world, while adapting to the effects of climate change. It brings forth our commitment to finding solutions and seeking out opportunities amid these challenges.<br/><br/>5. At SIWW, we can look forward to a new programme pillar on climate adaptation, specifically around coastal protection and flood management.<br/><br/>6. CESG will bring together thought leaders, government officials and industry captains to catalyse solutions for a sustainable and clean environment.<br/><br/>The reality of climate change<br/><br/>7. As we gather here today, we cannot ignore the grim reality facing our planet. The Earth continues to warm, with 2023 marking the warmest year since records began in 1850. Climate change is manifesting in unprecedented weather events in cities around the world, from the record-breaking rainfall that caused extensive flooding in Dubai in April, to the scorching heatwaves blistering several parts of India recently. These extreme weather events sound a clarion call for large scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change and decisive action to protect us from its effects.<br/><br/>Building a green future amid resource constraints<br/><br/>8. The real impact of climate change reminds us that we must press on with our climate actions to keep our 1.5C goal within reach. Singapore will do our part.<br/><br/>9. In 2021, we launched the Singapore Green Plan, which charts concrete targets over the next 10 years that will position us to achieve our long-term net zero emissions aspiration by 2050. We are increasing our carbon tax rate and introducing new policies to decarbonise our economy, energy and households.<br/><br/>10. As energy consumption is the main source of carbon emissions in Singapore, we aim to transform the way we use energy, and adopt clean sources of energy to mitigate our emissions.<br/><br/>11. We are maximising solar deployment on rooftops and open spaces, such as reservoirs. In 2021, PUB completed the first large-scale floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) project at Tengeh Reservoir which has a capacity of 60 megawatt-peak (MWp). I am pleased to announce that PUB has launched a tender for its second large-scale FPV project at Pandan Reservoir. The floating solar system at Pandan Reservoir will have a capacity of 55 MWp and when completed in 2028, will generate enough solar energy to power the equivalent of 16,000 four-room HDB flats. The FPV will generate renewable energy to power PUB's operations while reducing carbon emissions that is equivalent to taking 5,800 cars off the road.<br/><br/>12. For businesses, we have the Energy Efficiency Grant to co-fund investments required to switch to more energy efficient equipment. To further accelerate the net zero transition, JTC, the government agency in charge of our industrial progress, will be launching the Decarbonisation Living Lab @ JID Innovation Call with the support of Enterprise SG today. Under this Innovation Call, businesses in the Jurong Innovation District can tap on up to $4 million of grants to trial and deploy carbon-saving solutions. The development of sustainable technologies will help reduce carbon footprint across the industry, and reinforce JTC's goal to achieve net zero emissions in its industrial areas. More details will be shared by JTC later today.<br/><br/>13. In our pursuit of sustainable development, we must lower our resource footprint. One way to achieve this is to close our resource loops and pursue better resource recovery. The successful closing of the water loop - where used water is treated and purified to produce NEWater - is a prime example in Singapore.<br/><br/>14. Building on that milestone, we are pursuing our vision of a Zero Waste Nation. We launched the Zero Waste Masterplan in 2019 to set out our goal of closing our waste loops and achieving a circular economy. I am pleased that many households and companies have joined us on our journey towards zero waste.<br/><br/>15. There has been a heartening shift towards \"reduce\" and \"reuse\". Despite steady growth in Singapore's population and economy, domestic waste generated per capita has dropped by more than 15% over the past decade, while non-domestic waste generated per $ GDP has dropped by 30% over the same period.<br/><br/>16. More households are recycling, with National Environment Agency's (NEA) survey last year showing that our household recycling participation rate increased from 64% in 2021 to 72% in 2023. However, the overall recycling rate, which includes waste from commercial premises such as factories and construction sites, decreased from 57% in 2022 to 52% in 2023, largely due to the change in the mix of waste, with the amount of construction and demolition waste which is almost completely recycled, dropping significantly last year. Even so, we have observed a decline in overall recycling rates in the past decade due to structural factors. Our local recycling market is small, and we are reliant on offtakes from other countries which are dependent on factors such as freight costs and commodity prices.<br/><br/>17. Despite these challenges, we are enhancing our efforts in recycling our priority waste streams.<br/><br/>18. On food waste, we are completing the development of the Food Waste Treatment Facility at Tuas Nexus.<br/><br/>19. For packaging waste, including plastics, we are implementing the Beverage Container Return Scheme.<br/><br/>20. And we are studying how to extend the Extended Producer Responsibility approach to other types of packaging.<br/><br/>21. We are also actively seeking ways to extract more value out of our waste. Today, the primary mode of waste disposal in Singapore is mass burn incineration. We are exploring new technologies that could generate higher value products from our mixed municipal solid waste, while reducing carbon emissions.<br/><br/>22. NEA will issue a Request for Information (RFI) for alternative disposal technologies. These technologies would involve treating mixed municipal solid waste as feedstock and processing them to generate higher value products with sustainable offtake demands, compared to landfilled incineration ash. NEA will assess the information gathered on industry's interests and the commercial viability of technologies and where suitable, conduct pilot trials to evaluate the potential of expansion to full-size disposal facilities.<br/><br/>23. I invite industry partners to join us on our zero waste journey, to explore and seek out new recycling pathways and opportunities to close our waste loop.<br/><br/>Towards a sustainable and clean environment<br/><br/>24. Even as we work on these long-term initiatives, we must continue to keep our everyday environment clean. Public hygiene is the cornerstone of a clean and green environment. This is why my Ministry has designated 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene.<br/><br/>25. The environmental services industry is our critical partner in advancing public hygiene. Faced with a shrinking workforce and higher service demands, we must continue to leverage technology to raise the bar on keeping our environment clean.<br/><br/>26. Last year, NEA facilitated cleaning service company 800 Super, and technology provider Weston Robot, to trial an autonomous cleaning robot to remove flotsam on our waterways. The fully solar-powered autonomous boat, currently deployed at Sungei Seletar, improves productivity by 80 per cent. NEA intends to work with another service provider, Chye Thiam Maintenance, to expand the initiative to two more regions later this year. Do visit the NEA Innovation Pavilion at Level 1 to learn more about the robot, among other NEA innovations.<br/><br/>Adapting to the impacts of climate change<br/><br/>27. Beyond changing our practices and habits to protect the environment, it is also important for us to plan ahead to adapt to the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>28. In Singapore, our third national climate change study (V3) has projected more wet and dry extremes and accelerating increase in mean sea levels. To protect our lives and livelihood, we have undertaken significant efforts to enhance our flood and coastal resilience.<br/><br/>29. We have invested heavily in the construction of canals, drains, and reservoirs to manage stormwater runoff effectively. Where possible, we integrate them into our urban environment so that they can double up into spaces for functional and recreational purposes.<br/><br/>30. We are looking forward to the completion of the Alkaff Lake at the new Bidadari Housing Estate.<br/><br/>31. Alkaff Lake will serve two purposes. During heavy rainfall events, it becomes a stormwater retention pond for flood control, reducing the risks of flash floods to surrounding residential areas. Under sunnier conditions, it turns into a recreational space with features such as terraced wetlands and a cascading creek for residents to enjoy.<br/><br/>32. The nearby Bidadari Underground Service Reservoir will be Singapore's first to be built on low ground and will be integrated with Bidadari Park to optimise land use. It will help fortify water supply to meet the water demand of present and future Bidadari residents.<br/><br/>33. As a low-lying island susceptible to increasing sea levels, protecting our coastline is also a priority.<br/><br/>34. I will share more about our efforts at the Coastal and Flood Resilience Leaders Summit tomorrow.<br/><br/>Innovate and collaborate for a brighter future<br/><br/>35. I am hopeful that human ingenuity, which has enabled us to confront global challenges throughout history such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, will be the key to us weathering the looming challenges of climate change and resource scarcity. Innovation drives the development of novel technology, which often has the potential for widespread scalability, allowing solutions to reach and impact large populations across the globe and in some cases, even save lives.<br/><br/>36. Today, I would like to honour Professor Gertjan Medema from the KWR Water Research Institute for his significant contributions in the field of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). His innovation enabled the use of wastewater surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic which played a key role in fighting the spread of the virus in many countries. This includes Singapore, where we have recently expanded the use of wastewater surveillance to detect the presence of Zika virus. Professor Medema is the recipient of this year's Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize, and will be giving the \"Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize 2024\" public lecture later today.<br/><br/>37. Innovation is most powerful when coupled with collaboration.<br/><br/>38. I am pleased to launch the Singapore Water Center today, a partnership between Singapore and the World Bank.<br/><br/>39. Established within the World Bank Group's Singapore Office, the Centre will serve as a knowledge hub of Singapore's experience in water management, ranging from water policies to technological and innovative practices for the water sector.<br/><br/>40. We hope that the Centre will also be a valuable source of thought leadership in urban water management for the region and beyond.<br/><br/>41. The Singapore Water Center exemplifies the spirit of what we aim to achieve here at the SIWW and CESG, which is to build partnerships and provide platforms for collaboration to advance a global agenda.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>42. Ladies and gentlemen, international events such as SIWW and CESG are crucial for bringing together thought leaders, experts and practitioners from governments, academia, and industry to exchange ideas and co-create solutions. I wish everyone a productive Summit ahead, one where you will gain new insights and forge new partnerships.

The Kyoto Protocol contained binding commitments for developed countries, whose cumulative emissions have been estimated to be as high as 92 per cent of the global total.  </p><p> The Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which allows developed countries to buy carbon credits from developing countries as a way to offset their own footprint, also inspired a number of market-based innovations. </p><p> These included the Chicago Climate Exchange -- an effort championed by former US vice-president Al Gore to create efficient mitigation projects between the United States and Brazil. Though well-intended and well-funded, it ultimately failed to live up to designer expectations and closed in 2010.</p><p> Recognition of these trends led to the Paris Agreement's consensus for greater innovations and bottom-up climate pathways that would incorporate public and private finance to spur climate-friendly markets and technological innovations. </p><p> Each country meets its Paris commitments through \"nationally determined contributions\", which include setting domestic emissions reduction targets, and a shared pledge to limit emissions to \"well below\" 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels, with aspirations of 1.5 deg C.</p><p> The agreement allows for countries and the private sector to transfer carbon credits in order to accelerate decarbonisation pathways. </p><p> This spurred DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange and Standard Chartered Bank to launch Singapore's Climate Impact X -- which was designed with a mission to create credible carbon markets while incorporating broader environmental, social and governance concerns, including biodiversity and social outcomes. </p><p> The Singapore case studyThe question emerges then: Can we expect Singapore's climate policy efforts to buck historical trends elsewhere to be both durable and effective?  </p><p> There is a very good reason to believe the answer is yes. </p><p> Why? Because Singapore is quite unique in its quest, and ability, to design policies for the long term. </p><p> Let us consider three illustrative examples. </p><p> Over 60 years ago, Singapore introduced its Housing and Development Board flat system as a means to provide housing security not only to its existing population, but for future generations. </p><p> While many see this approach as an example of infrastructure-led development, the first step was an innovative policy design mix to achieve its highly durable objectives. </p><p> Great attention was given to the nitty-gritty of policy specifications, including anticipating future effects of decisions regarding applicants' age of eligibility, the kinds of loans available, and an ability to tap into Singapore's equally unique Central Provident Fund. </p><p> The long-term implications of this policy today are profound: The ability of local citizens to buy a house is much higher today in Singapore than in other major cities around the world -- greatly reducing economic anxiety than it otherwise would have been.</p><p> Turning to more recent times, Singapore's Covid-19 management, when measured by per capita lives lost, was one of the most successful examples of any country around the world. </p><p> While some saw this as a technological and epidemiological success story, what preceded was a longstanding policy and governance design, including plans for an inter-agency committee that could be invoked for any future pandemic. </p><p> It was the design and governance of this system -- including its legitimacy to make swift decisions -- that explains why Singapore was able to deploy technology to limit the spread of the disease when so many other countries, which had access to the same technology, were unable to do so. </p><p> This forward-looking expertise is also illustrated in Singapore's sophisticated policy designs for conducting monetary policy which is managed through adjustments in the \"nominal effective exchange rate\" of a pre-established currency basket rather than by interest rates. </p><p> But it was also designed with foresight to withstand currency speculators that otherwise could have threatened its viability.</p><p> Its monetary policy is also reinforced by constitutional provisions that make it virtually impossible to respond to short-term demands for expenditures that would produce harmful long-term structural deficits.</p><p>Singapore policy officials demonstrated a strong ability to design policies in ways that anticipated long-term effects -- even when, at the time, the evidence that their expectations were accurate would not show up until far too late to inform their policy mix innovations. </p><p> What lessons, then, can we learn from Singapore's approach, and my own collaborative work over the last three decades, about how to design policies that foster durable and effective outcomes'</p><p> Lessons for climate policyFirst, advances in finance, technology, and related infrastructure developments are necessary but insufficient without innovative policy levers. </p><p> In each of the Singapore cases above, policy designers unleashed smart policy mixes that fostered long-term effectiveness that otherwise could have gone in an unintended direction. </p><p> One has to look no further than the failed experiment with US social housing projects, and infrastructure projects in North America and Europe that led to social dislocation and suburban sprawl. Likewise, Covid-19 morbidity rates in the US and Europe were vastly higher than in Singapore. </p><p> Low carbon technologies might look good in isolation, but without innovative policy designs, it is just as possible that simultaneous technological innovations might produce accelerated high carbon outcomes -- such as the high energy needs associated with Bitcoin mining -- which blindsided sustainability policymakers all around the world. </p><p> Second, policy design innovations benefit from swift and widespread knowledge diffusion. </p><p> Consider how Singapore learnt from the US' failure in public housing by tweaking policy calibrations and settings, including selling HDB flats directly to individuals, rather than providing rental subsidies. </p><p>Singapore's ratcheting-up carbon tax policy reflects similar designs in other jurisdictions, including British Columbia's efforts to foster ratcheting-up that lowers carbon emissions alongside efforts to enhance public support. </p><p> Likewise, over 160 jurisdictions around the world -- including Singapore -- have developed a policy mix first developed in Germany, known as a \"feed-in tariff\", that was designed to successfully accelerate renewable energy uptake. </p><p> The question remains: How is knowledge best integrated given its diversity and complexity? </p><p> This is highly challenging as it requires bringing together sophisticated technical knowledge, largely produced within and across the Stem (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines, with work on legitimacy, trust and good governance, which have been the focus of the social sciences in general, and the policy sciences in particular. </p><p> After all, Singapore's success on Covid-19 was not only owing to an ability to adapt to new epidemiology as the disease unfolded, but also because it enjoys high levels of trust from its citizens that their Government has the society's long-term interests in mind. </p><p> The problem is that producers of required knowledge on technical aspects of a particular problem and its solutions, and producers of knowledge relevant for generating trust and legitimacy to operate in the long run, face all kinds of difficulties in sharing knowledge among themselves. </p><p> They speak different languages, apply different methods, and do not fully understand the relevance of the other community. </p><p> As a result, there is a tendency to engage with \"like-minded\" knowledge producers, which undermines integration of all relevant forms of knowledge for generating long-term effectiveness and durability. </p><p> Third, great care must be placed on how to best nurture anticipatory policy design exercises. </p><p> We know that innovative policy mixes can emerge through multi-stakeholder policy learning dialogues that shift attention from short-term, interest-based compromises to designing policies for durability and effectiveness to solve specified problems. </p><p> The trick is how to accelerate these processes given the nature of the climate crisis. </p><p> It is well known that Singapore is an innovator when it comes to advancing finance, technology, and infrastructure for the betterment of its people and welfare. </p><p> Its innovative successes have been sources of inspiration for years as other countries seek to understand, and emulate, the Singapore miracle.</p><p> What is less known is that Singapore is also an innovator in designing policies to be both durable and effective. </p><p> If the world is to avoid the \"policy creation euphoria, implementation depression\" cycle of global climate governance, it cannot repeat business as usual by turning to climate finance, technology, and infrastructure programmes alone. </p><p> It must also draw on, and diffuse, lessons from anticipatory policy analysis capable of producing design innovations for the long term.</p><p> Benjamin Cashore is Li Ka Shing professor in public management at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) and director of LKYSPP's Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES), which emphasises policy design capacity building through research, training and dialogues. Before coming to NUS, he was a tenured professor at Yale's School of the Environment, where he researched governance innovations and co-created the term, \"super wicked\" problems to characterise the climate and biodiversity crises.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-H99KUQG</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2J-B1X1-DYX4-00NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This is when the carbon tax rate rises to S$25 per tonne of emissions, from the current S$5 per tonne.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The confirmation came at the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference in Dubai on Friday (Dec 8), as Singapore scored its first carbon credit transfer agreement with the Oceanian country, which shares a border with Indonesia. </p><p> The implementation agreement is aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which sets out a legally binding framework and processes for the generation and international transfer of carbon credits between countries to avoid double counting.</p><p> The signing means that Singapore has successfully negotiated for Papua New Guinea to give up its claims on emissions reductions or removals, which are to be sold to Singapore buyers in the form of carbon credits. Papua New Guinea will make a \"corresponding adjustment\" to its inventory, so that the climate impact represented by each transacted credit is not counted twice.</p><p> There are some unique elements built into the agreement to sweeten the deal for Papua New Guinea. </p><p> There is a clause stating that project developers will be required to cancel 2 per cent of the carbon credits authorised under the implementation agreement at first issuance, to ensure additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions. These carbon credits will not be sold, traded or counted towards any country's emission targets, and will instead contribute towards a net reduction in global emissions.</p><p> Project developers will also be required to make a contribution equivalent to a 5 per cent share of proceeds or authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Papua New Guinea. </p><p> The adaptation actions, which could include heat-resilience measures and coastal projection efforts, can help the country prepare for and adjust to climate change.</p><p> Laying these out in a joint statement on Friday, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) said that the collaboration will advance both countries' climate ambition. </p><p> It will also help to channel financing towards mitigation efforts, which would otherwise be impossible, as well as lead to projects that promote sustainable development and generate benefits for local communities, such as job creation and access to clean water, they added.</p><p> Inking at least one of these agreements by the end of the year is important to Singapore as it has announced that companies can offset up to 5 per cent of their carbon tax liabilities under its International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework from Jan 1, 2024.</p><p> Carbon credits eligible under the ICC framework must be from a country with a standing implementation agreement with Singapore. The government has indicated that it will unveil a list of eligible host countries by the end of the year.</p><p> While only one implementation agreement has come through so far, more are expected in the pipeline. Singapore has \"substantively concluded\" negotiations on an implementation agreement with four other countries so far -- Ghana, Vietnam, Paraguay and Bhutan. NCCS said on Dec 3 that the one with Paraguay is targeted to be signed in early 2024.</p><p>Singapore also signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) or letters of intent on carbon credit collaboration with more than 10 countries, including Fiji, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, with the aim of inking similar implementation agreements.</p><p> The implementation agreement with Papua New Guinea was the result of an MOU. The two countries entered into one on the sidelines of last year's UN Climate Change Conference at Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt.</p><p> Friday's statement noted that the operationalisation of the implementation agreement will be overseen by a joint committee comprising representatives from both countries. The committee -- co-chaired by NCCS director-general of climate change Benedict Chia and Papua New Guinea's Climate Change and Development Authority managing director Ruel Yamuna -- will release more information on this, it added.</p><p>Singapore Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Papua New Guinea Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change Simo Kilepa were at the signing ceremony of the implementation agreement between Singapore and Papua New Guinea. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singapore Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Papua New Guinea Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change Simo Kilepa at the signing ceremony of the implementation agreement between the two countries.

Singapore is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and has raised its climate ambition. The country has implemented a carbon tax and plans to increase it to 25 Singapore dollars per tonne of emissions in 2024. Singapore is also focused on transitioning to cleaner energy for vehicles and has set a target for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040. The country is investing in sustainable aviation fuel production and has implemented stronger emission standards for the power sector. Singapore is actively engaged in regional partnerships to unlock decarbonization potential and strengthen climate resilience. The country is also committed to global collaboration and supporting initiatives for collective and inclusive climate action. The decisions and actions taken at COP28 will have a significant impact on the future of the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p>* Singapore aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>* Singapore's carbon tax will be raised to 25 Singapore dollars per tonne of emissions in 2024 and progressively to 50-80 Singapore dollars by 2030.</p><p>* Singapore has mandated zero vehicle population growth since 2018 and aims for all vehicles to run on cleaner energy by 2040.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Dec. 2 -- National Climate Change Secretariat, Government of Singapore issued the following remarks by Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean:</p><p>Remarks by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean at Rwanda's National Carbon Markets Framework Launch at UNFCCC COP28</p><p>Her Excellency, Dr Jeanne d'Arc Mujawamariya, Minister for Environment, Republic of Rwanda</p><p>My friends from Rwanda and from Singapore, and other guests today.</p><p>Distinguished Guests</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p><p>Rwanda and Singapore are long time, steady friends and I am delighted to be here today to launch this event which marks a new phase in our good friendship. I would like to express my thanks to our friends from Rwanda for inviting me to join this occasion.</p><p>Let me start by congratulating you on this momentous first step that Rwanda is taking to participate in carbon markets aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a pernicious, global challenge. Emissions from one country affect every other country, and for this reason, international cooperation is key.</p><p>Multilateralism was the spirit in which Article 6 of the Paris Agreement was established, to allow countries to pursue voluntary cooperative approaches, and in doing so achieve greater climate ambition than they could on their own. Singapore played a small part in getting Article 6 from an Article in the agreement into the implementation phase, which will allow us to turn Article 6 into reality. We co-facilitated the discussions on implementation at the UNFCCC conferences. Carbon markets have great potential to channel investments toward additional mitigation outcomes that would not have been otherwise feasible.</p><p>Singapore and Rwanda, as fellow small states, share a close working relationship. We have cooperated in areas such as fintech and cybersecurity, and we had a very successful fintech festival in Rwanda this year. I am delighted that our countries are now deepening our cooperation through carbon market collaboration.</p><p>Singapore's approach to this emerging partnership will be underpinned by investment, interlinkages, and resilience.</p><p>First, investment.</p><p>Singapore stands ready to work with our companies to invest in Rwanda's climate future. The Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE) had earlier this year in October 2023 signed an MOU with the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, to deliver projects in areas such as carbon trading. Our companies are keen to explore carbon market projects in Rwanda. We stand ready to work with the Rwandan government to identify projects of highest impact that we can jointly explore.</p><p>Second, interlinkages.</p><p>Singapore is a vibrant carbon services and trading hub, and upholds high environmental integrity standards. We are ready to work with Rwanda to link its carbon credit supply to the global market through Singapore.</p><p>Third, resilience.</p><p>Under our Article 6.2 bilateral approaches, Singapore is prepared to contribute 5% of our share of carbon credit proceeds to support climate adaptation in Rwanda, ensuring that projects have broader sustainable developmental benefits.</p><p>As our two countries sign this Memorandum of Understanding on Article 6 collaboration today, we mark the start of a new chapter of bilateral cooperation; one that addresses our shared challenge of climate change.</p><p>Singapore looks forward to working closely with Rwanda to operationalise high-integrity carbon markets that can drive greater mitigation ambition, create new livelihoods in the green economy, and advance our sustainable development goals.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: National Climate Change Secretariat, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063346790</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69X3-YJV1-JB5M-W0NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 2, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>Business &amp;

Many countries will not have the resources to cope with the worsening impact of climate change. </p><p> The Adaptation Gap Report published in October stated that additional adaptation finance of between US$194 billion (S$260 billion) and US$366 billion a year is needed by 2030.</p><p> Finance sources come from international public finance, countries' domestic expenditure and private finance. It has been challenging to garner private finance to fund adaptation projects as these are often not profitable. </p><p> The proposed Long Island project, which will be reclaimed off East Coast Park, will not only serve as Singapore's response to the threat of rising sea levels and inland flooding, but also create up to 60,000 new homes, which will be a mix of both public and private housing. </p><p> The sea level around Singapore is expected to rise by 1m by the end of the century. When coupled with high tides and storms, this could make the Republic vulnerable to heavy flooding.</p><p> Mr Lam said during a panel discussion on Dec 9 at the Singapore Pavilion of the COP28 summit: \"Unfortunately, adaptation doesn't attract as much finance because the returns (on investments) are the prevention of losses. </p><p> \"And prevention of losses is something you don't see until the loss actually happens.\" </p><p> Multi-functional coastal protection solutions that Singapore has adopted could be viable for other cities to attract private-sector finance, he added.</p><p> To ensure more adaptation finance is given to rural communities to protect them from sea-level rise, some revenue from carbon projects involving nature-based solutions, like the planting of mangroves, can be directed to adaptation, said Mr Lam.  </p><p> Mangroves are not only coastal guardians against sea-level rise, but also huge stores of carbon dioxide, trapping the planet-warming gas in their roots. </p><p> The other panellists were Ms Hazel Khoo, national water agency PUB's director of coastal protection; Ms Meike van Ginneken, water envoy for the Netherlands; and Mr Takahiro Konami, director of international affairs office at Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.  </p><p> Ms van Ginneken pointed to the latest figures by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which found that only 9 per cent of private finance has gone to adaptation.</p><p> She suggested that the bulk of public finance be channelled to more adaptation projects, and for private finance to be used for renewable energy, which helps to mitigate climate change.  </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had launched a US$5 billion blended finance initiative to channel finance to projects that would otherwise not be profitable, such as those in clean energy, nature-based solutions, and waste and water management.  </p><p> MAS told The Straits Times that the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership is \"not precluded\" from investing in climate adaptation projects if it meets the risk-return and climate-impact criteria for the investment themes under the partnership. </p><p> Ms Khoo said multi-functional coastal protection solutions also enable Singapore to optimise its space constraints.  </p><p> \"Beyond that, we also want to see whether we can employ nature-based solutions that can be incorporated with engineering measures so that we can enhance our marine biodiversity and natural development at the same time,\" she added. </p><p>Singapore is conducting eight islandwide site-specific studies of its coastlines to determine the most suitable coastal protection solutions for each segment. </p><p> Asked whether Singapore has plans for coastal infrastructure at each of the coastlines, Ms Khoo said: \"There are a lot of opportunities for hybrid solutions, but I wouldn't say that at this point in time, we will be able to nail down specifically what works at each segment of the coastline. </p><p> \"We are learning a lot from other countries, we have learnt from Japan and we want to see what they have done there to inspire us to similarly think about the type of approach towards nature-based solutions.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Waves near the Pulau Ubin jetty.

According to the World Bank, developing countries are projected to grow just 3.9% in 2024, more than one percentage point below the previous decade's average. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by these challenges, such as how small island developing countries are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change and extreme weather events.</p><p>These challenges have also led to a significant rollback of hard-won development gains.According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), last year, about 238 million people experienced food insecurity, an increase of about 21 million from the previous year. TheSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)Report released by the UN Secretary-General in 2023 also showed that 30% of SDG targets are stagnating or declining.</p><p>As the largest grouping of developing countries at the UN, the G77&amp;China has a unique role in contributing to solutions towards the array of development challenges that we face.We are in a position to amplify the voice of the South on these issues, and work with others within a rules-based multilateral framework to find collective solutions.In particular, we must continue our unwavering efforts towards the collective achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs remain the most critical pathway for ensuring the continued progress of developing countries. The G77&amp;China should build on the SDG Political Declaration adopted at the SDG Summit in September last year. We should also seize opportunities to do more, including at the 4thInternational Conference on SIDS and the Summit of the Future this year, which will be crucial milestones to push forward the implementation of the SDGs.</p><p>Singapore remains committed to working with fellow developing countries to achieve the G77&amp;China's priorities, particularly in four key areas.First, we need to do more to address the pressing challenge of climate change.The decision by Parties at COP28 to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems - in a just, orderly, and equitable manner - is a significant and positive development. This will come as a cost - felt more acutely by developing countries. Thus, more must be done to mobilise technology and finance in developing countries so that we may enable greater ambition while supporting sustainable development. While the developed countries must lead the way in this area, there is scope for greater South-South cooperation so that no one is left behind.</p><p>Singapore will do our part to support fellow developing countries in ways that we can make a meaningful contribution. For example,atCOP28, Singapore announced various new initiatives to support and accelerate green transition in our region and beyond. This includes the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) blended finance initiative, which aims to catalyse up to US$5 billion from concessional and commercial capital providers globally. Singapore also provides technical assistance and capacity-building courses through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen close to 150,000 participants from over180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations over the last three decades. Under this programme, we have also launched theSustainability Action Package to give greater focus to the global sustainability agenda, and share best practices in climate adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Second, on trade, we welcome the G77&amp;China's longstanding commitment to an open and rules-based multilateral trading system.We also echo the G77&amp;China's concerns regarding unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO.</p><p>Third, on technology. We thank Cuba for making Technology a priority of its G77&amp;China Chairmanship in 2023.Technological advancements offer immense opportunities for development and towards the achievement of the SDGs. However, serious and concerted efforts are required to harness the benefits of technology, including by working with global and community partners to bridge technological and digital divides, and promote greater inclusion and connectivity.</p><p>Lastly, transformation of global governance.Governments should work together to build a more inclusive global governance system, including through the reform of key global institutions, to better reflect current realities and respond to emerging challenges.The UN High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism had put forth several bold and ambitious proposals, including on repurposing of the multilateral development bank system. We are pleased that some of these proposals have been incorporated in the G77&amp;China's input to the Pact of the Future. Singapore will continue to work closely with G77&amp;China to ensure that the Summit of the Future will deliver outcomes that benefit all, including developing countries.</p><p>In closing, let me reaffirm Singapore's steadfast commitment to working with fellow developing countries, to ensure that no one is left behind in our journey towards a better tomorrow. Thank you.</p><p>Photo Caption:Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister for Education and Second Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman at the Third South Summit, Kampala, Uganda, 21 January 2024</p><p>Photo Credit:Ministry of Foreign Affairs Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMFAPS-170595212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMFAPS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B5B-D9R1-JDJN-6382-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">476773</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Government of Singapore Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The effectiveness of nature-based solutions, in particular, should not be underestimated.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first \"Global Stocktake\" synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.Adaptation measures Lubo Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re, said historical estimates show that Asia has suffered the highest flood-related economic losses. Between 2011 and 2020, economic losses from flood events averaged almost US$30 billion annually.Neha Bhatia, partner for environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, also pointed out that there have been studies that estimate rising sea levels might slash between 45 per cent and 50 per cent of South-east Asia's total gross domestic product over the next 50 years in the worst-case scenario.Beyond coastal defences such as levees and sea walls, as well as flood retention areas, the preservation of coral reefs and mangrove swamps along coastlines are also among the most effective climate adaptation measures, a number of observers said.Noting that nature-based solutions are not only cost-effective, but also help to drive carbon sequestration and support biodiversity well-being, Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact, said that policymakers should focus first on preserving and restoring the ecosystems.With a better understanding and valuation of the Earth's natural ecosystems, businesses will also be better able to incorporate these resources into their decision-making, such as ensuring that there are sufficient climate resilience considerations through the environmental impact assessments of new development projects, they added.Frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures help to evaluate nature and biodiversity and contextualise the financial impact that businesses will feel should these resources not be managed.Hence, beyond governments, private entities also have a vested interest in investing in the conservation of these ecosystems as it protects their assets, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific climate and resilience hub.\"(We've) been getting these ecosystem services for free. </p><p>So it's basically payment for ecosystem services, but through the lens of disaster risk,\" he added.Echoing similar sentiments, Varbanov said that one action all companies can take is to consider nature as an insurable asset or service and understand the dependencies in the value chain, which means that it should be protected and insured like any other item of value.Besides guarding against flood risk, Bhatia also pointed out that South-east Asia is extremely prone to chronic heat and humidity.In the context of a region that is urbanising rapidly, the combined impact of rising temperatures, humidity levels and flash floods could also mean that the spread of diseases will be more intense. Hence, there is also a need to invest in healthcare systems that are able to not only put in place preventative measures, but also control the spread of disease.Adapting existing infrastructure to be more earthquake-resilient and employing appropriate construction methods in earthquake-prone areas are also important, said Tobias Grimm, head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at Munich Re.While there are some risk areas that are more urgent, observers also noted that adaptation measures have to take on a system-wide approach, unlike mitigation. Hence, it is not possible to just focus\u00c2\u00a0resources into one or two areas and neglect the others.Given limited fiscal space and competition for adaptation needs, Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore, said the priority for policymakers in South-east Asia should be to implement \"no-regrets\" measures.For example, she said that single-use grey infrastructure projects such as flood walls should be lower down the priority list. Climate-resilient developments should not only be able to absorb and retain rainwater to reduce flooding, but also act as an additional water resource to better withstand periods of drought.Investments in these measures would generate benefits in all possible climate futures, and also maximise co-benefits for other development objectives.Policy measuresImplementing these adaptation measures requires governments to undertake system-wide changes where climate resilience is integrated at every aspect of policymaking.One critical area is in urban planning, where governments should start thinking about the impacts of sea-level rises and heat stress on zoning, public transport design, and the distribution of hospitals, for example, said Willis Tower Watson's Au.This also means that, in areas that have extremely high exposure to hazards, new developments should be prevented from being built, and existing developments should not be rebuilt, said Grimm.Building codes and insurance regulations also need to start adopting a greater focus on climate resilience and risk transparency. This could mean regulations mandating the use of certain construction methods that embed flood risk resilience, or insurance cover for vulnerable regions, said Bhatia.Governments can consider transferring risk to the private sector through insurance, said Varbanov.\"Advance allocation of budgets towards risk mitigation and insurance negates the need to raise funds afterwards to manage the impacts of an event, which can take time and further negatively impact affected communities,\" he added.Observers also noted a need for more public-private partnerships to drive improvements in risk-sharing and the allocation of investments.The public sector has to see itself as a facilitator that develops a baseline of core infrastructure projects, policies and frameworks, which allows the private sector to enter at a lower risk, said Bhatia.Sharad Somani, partner and head of KPMG ESG at KPMG in Singapore, suggested that tax incentives and grants could be provided for critical showcase projects, on top of adaptation research, investment and implementation of facility collaborations.However, there remain challenges in ramping up adaptation measures. One reason is simply because it is harder to see the benefits of climate adaptation, compared with mitigation where there are visible reductions to carbon emission levels.In addition, the complex and interrelated nature of climate-related risks complicates the task of prioritising adaptation initiatives. Multiple stakeholders may have different views of the trade-offs involved in adaptation plans, said Mahieu and Steel.To identify the best solutions, policymakers need to understand how the complex array of hazards will impact the particular communities, economies and ecosystems, and determine criteria for assigning higher importance to specific areas, they added.Unlike developed markets in certain parts of the United States, where regular forest fires have led to insurers not willing to insure properties in these fire-prone areas, Au said that South-east Asia still has a chance of not locking itself into this cycle.The region still has the opportunity to improve the balance between economic development in the short-term and ensuring long-term resilience to climate change, said Mahieu and Steel.Governments in South-east Asia need to \"start thinking holistically around climate risk and opportunities, and start embedding it into every single policy and plan that they have,\" said Bhatia.\"If you fail to recognise that, the cost of not getting it right is way too much... There is just no future without investments in adaptation,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:697T-88G1-JCF2-817V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

With rapid urbanisation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/sustainable-urbanisation-decarbonising-sea-s-built-environment.html\">over 100 million people are projected to migrate to cities by 2030. While these urban dwellers will be an important catalyst for economic expansion, they will also be contributors to an unprecedented surge in energy demand - projected at a staggering</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/market-and-industry-reports/sustainable-urbanisation-decarbonising-sea-s-built-environment.html\">42 per cent increase anticipated over the next decade.</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The twin challenges of the built environment sector in SEA</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The built environment is one of the planet's most pollutive sectors. It currently accounts for approximately <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/2022-global-status-report-buildings-and-construction\">39 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Despite the urgency to address climate change, obstacles persist. Escalating energy price volatility and rising interest rates hinder investments in building decarbonisation efforts.</url></p><p>As a consequence, the sector is v <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/2022-global-status-report-buildings-and-construction\">eering off course from its decarbonisation pathway and is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 without immediate and decisive action, The gap between actual climate performance and the necessary trajectory for decarbonisation continues to widen.</url></p><p>SEA is also particularly vulnerable to climate change, facing rising temperatures and sea levels. While decarbonising buildings toward net-zero emissions remains a significant challenge, the accelerating impact of climate change on our cities and homes is deeply concerning, including rising mean and variance of temperature, increased precipitation, humidity, wind patterns, and solar radiation.</p><p>Globally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/april-2024-was-earths-warmest-on-record\">April 2024 sets a new record as the hottest month ever recorded, marking the 11th consecutive month of unprecedented global warmth. The region's extensive coastlines and low-lying areas make us susceptible to extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and heatwaves. These events pose threats to environmental degradation, exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions, impact economic productivity, and endanger human health and safety. The</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/extreme-heat-continues-to-scorch-large-parts-of-asia\">escalating temperatures drive excessive air-conditioning use, further contributing to global warming.</url></p><p>In Jakarta,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44636934\">excessive groundwater extraction is causing the city to sink, prompting the government to relocate its capital. In Singapore, the government has established a</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-first-of-coastal-protection-studies-to-commence-this-year-jurong-island-east\">US$5 billion fund to mitigate coastal erosion and flooding risks. The Philippines government's Department of Environment and Natural Resources has also completed</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechange.denr.gov.ph/\">resilience roadmaps for 16 vulnerable areas to guide disaster risk management and climate resilience efforts.</url></p><p>Regulations and certifications in built environment space</p><p>Given the significant challenges related to decarbonisation and climate resilience faced by the built environment sector, SEA lacks mandatory building regulations, contributing to slow progress in decarbonising the built environment. However, the situation is gradually changing.</p><p>Green building certifications, such as the Green Building Index, Green Real Estate, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and BREEAM are gaining traction. These certifications evaluate the sustainability attributes of buildings and provide recognition for environmentally responsible practices.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/balancing-act-carbon-balances-quest-to-tackle-climate-crises-with-tech-driven-sustainability-20240202/\">Balancing act: Carbon Balance's quest to tackle climate crises with tech-driven sustainability</url></p><p>They assess various criteria, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, waste management, and occupant health and well-being. Although these certifications are primarily voluntary, the demand for them is increasing for several reasons:</p><p>Sustainability policy of tenants: Companies and individuals are increasingly aware of the environmental impact of their actions, leading to a rising demand for sustainable practices, including green buildings. This trend is particularly driven by global Fortune 500 companies, where institutional shareholders demand greater sustainability practices that trickle down to procurement functions when in search of real estate offices. Moreover, leading regional enterprises are also adopting these practices to attract institutional investors and retain their best employees.</p><p>Availability of green loans: Building construction is a competitive and capital-intensive industry where access to affordable labour, materials, and financing is essential for profitability and success. The availability of green loans with lower interest rates encourages developers to construct new green buildings. The Malaysian government actively promotes green building investment through policies and schemes, such as the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidb.gov.my/eng/green-buildings-in-malaysia-increasing-demands-for-sustainable-practices/\">Green Technology Financing Scheme, which incentivises sustainable practices.</url></p><p>Lower operating expenses: Potential savings from efficient operations serve as an attractive incentive for tenants. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and lighting make up 60-70 per cent of energy costs. Hence, energy-efficient designs, renewable energy sources and smart technologies in these areas can reduce utility bills for occupants in the long term. In an economic environment marked by high cost of capital and cost cutting, lower operating expenditures could better retain tenants.</p><p>Green buildings, certified by third parties, represent valuable assets and attractive business opportunities. They have the potential to generate higher revenue by attracting and retaining high-quality multinational clients.</p><p>Additionally, their lower operating costs, thanks to more efficient use of energy, and reduced cost of financing, drive further demand and innovation for building decarbonisation and climate resilience.</p><p>Therefore, it is no secret that such coveted certifications are highly sought after by real estate owners like Capitaland, Ayala Land and IJM Land. A portfolio of green buildings is now considered a compelling and fast-growing business segment.</p><p>To be clear, they are not perfect either. According to a report 'Seeing is Believing, Unlocking the Low-Carbon Real Estate Market' by  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.systemiq.earth/\">Systemiq released in June 2024, it identifies two major issues with 3rd-party certifications and ratings:</url></p><p>Inconsistency with decarbonisation pathways: Analysis showed that there is no clear correlation between certified assets and better energy performance, indicating potential gaps in these independent assessments. Many of these tools do not have a target that is consistent with 1.5 degrees Celsius pathways.</p><p>Lack of transparency on carbon and energy performance: Major certification bodies offer limited insights into how their building portfolio performs against energy use and carbon emissions.</p><p>The implication is that such factors might be muting demand signals for low-carbon buildings, resulting in a lack of confidence to invest in truly sustainable buildings. However, this is changing and major certification bodies like LEED and BREEAM are updating their schemes to be more transparent and ambitious. While the progress is highly encouraging, there is still more to be done to be on track for the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway.</p><p>Decarbonising our building infrastructure</p><p>One critical area for achieving green building status involves reducing GHG emissions. These emissions from buildings can be categorised into two main aspects.</p><p>Source: Hello Tomorrow Asia Pacific</p><p>Embodied carbon emissions</p><p>These are emissions resulting from the raw material extraction, production, supply chain and installation of building materials such as cement, glass and steel structures. New building projects are estimated to generate approximately <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/system/builtenvironment/\">half of their emissions from embodied sources. Strategies for decarbonising embodied carbon emissions include offering substitutes for raw materials and adopting green building products such as green cement and steel.</url></p><p>Notably, this opportunity is massive at some US$20-30 billion in Southeast Asia, requiring significant capital expenditure and working capital. Therefore, venture capital investments alone will not suffice; debt and infrastructure funds will be necessary.</p><p>Some startups innovating in this space include:</p><p>Neocrete, a New Zealand startup, uses a proprietary additive to enhance concrete properties while reducing carbon footprint.</p><p>CarbonCure injects recycled CO2 into concrete during the mixing process and repurposes buildings as carbon storage.</p><p>H2 Green Steel is a Swedish startup that produces steel using hydrogen made from renewable energy instead of coal.</p><p>Despite their potential, these innovations currently come at a higher cost compared to conventional materials, necessitating further engineering and economies of scale to reduce costs for mass adoption.</p><p>Operating carbon emissions</p><p>These are emissions from building operations like energy consumption such as HVAC and lighting which collectively contribute to c.70 per cent of operating emissions. These operations contribute <url normalizedValue=\"https://climatechampions.unfccc.int/system/builtenvironment/\">to the other half of emissions from the built environment. Decarbonising building operations presents a combination of asset-intensive and asset-light opportunities and represents a US$10-20 billion addressable market.</url></p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/on-the-sustainability-of-ai-why-measuring-digital-carbon-emissions-is-key-to-a-greener-future-20240604/\">On the sustainability of AI: Why measuring digital carbon emissions is key to a greener future</url></p><p>New HVAC systems such as district cooling require a significant upfront investment but there are also automation and optimisation software which can enhance the efficiency of traditional HVAC systems. Artificial intelligence and automation play enabling roles in enhancing real-time human comfort, optimisation and energy consumption efficiency.</p><p>Additionally, there is potential for creating carbon-negative operations such as the installation of solar panels on building surfaces using innovative photovoltaic technology to generate excess energy beyond immediate needs.</p><p>Notable homegrown startups in the region include:</p><p>uHoo specialises in indoor air quality and temperature monitoring to measure various air quality parameters ensuring a healthy and comfortable environment.</p><p>SensorFlow measures the energy consumption of boilers and chillers and correlates the measured consumption with heating and cooling demand.</p><p>Solano Energy deploys new energy assets forming a distributed energy resource management system enabling every building owner to produce and store renewable energy.</p><p>Despite these innovative solutions, challenges related to incentives and financing remain during implementation.</p><p>Building for a new climate norm</p><p>As temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, we must rethink and enable the design of our built environment. Unlike decarbonisation, strategies to defend against climate catastrophes require a comprehensive approach involving a broader range of stakeholders and public-private partnerships.</p><p>Policymakers: City officials, particularly in areas prone to climate disasters, must prioritise upgrading early warning and communication systems using digital infrastructure. Additionally, urban vegetation and improved water management strategies can help manage heat waves while enhancing coastal defences against rising sea levels. These measures not only protect communities but also improve urban liveability.</p><p>Building Managers: Given prolonged heat waves in Southeast Asia, building managers will face increased cooling demands and peak loads. The implementation of energy-efficient cooling systems and the adoption of smart building technologies will be crucial in reducing energy consumption and maintaining occupant comfort.</p><p>Construction companies and real estate developers: Architects and civil engineers should scrutinise new building designs and review existing material selection to withstand harsher environmental conditions. Project managers must also account for delays caused by extreme weather events, adjusting timelines and budgets accordingly.</p><p>Insurers and Financiers: They need to prepare for more frequent natural catastrophes by incorporating new longitudinal climate data into their underwriting frameworks. National grants may also be made available for disaster management and relief support for affected communities</p><p>Source: The implications of a changing climate for buildings</p><p>These are a new set of challenges that come with climate change. Fortunately, there are already startup founders with long-term vision who have been already working on these problem statements to tackle such opportunities.</p><p>Komunidad harnesses the power of data and analytics to help enterprises and governments tackle the risks of climate change.</p><p>Nafas provides businesses with a flexible &amp; data-driven way to provide healthy air quality to their employees and customers against low air quality.</p><p>IBISA's parametric insurance offers end-to-end resilience to protect businesses and communities against climate change-induced natural catastrophes.</p><p>It is essential to recognise that not all climate adaptation opportunities in the built environment are suitable for venture capital investments. Nature-based projects, such as urban vegetation and mangroves, play a crucial role in defending against extreme heat and coastal erosion. Infrastructure developments, like coastal walls and drainage systems, are equally important.</p><p>Professional services, such as innovative building designs and material selections by architects and civil engineers, contribute to the total solution universe but may not align with climate venture capital investments.</p><p>How VCs are catalysing innovation</p><p>The increasing prevalence of green buildings and challenges of climate change are opening up vast opportunities for sustainable innovation within the built environment sector across all areas like,</p><p>Embodied carbon emission</p><p>Operating carbon emission</p><p>Re-thinking building in a new climate norm</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/meet-the-4-sea-startups-of-pepsicos-climate-tech-accelerator-programme-20230627/\">Meet the 4 SEA startups of PepsiCo's climate tech accelerator programme</url></p><p>Consequently, this sector is drawing substantial venture capital investments to capitalise on this trend. For example:</p><p>Proptech and real estate VC fund Fifth Wall had closed  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220721005373/en/Fifth-Wall-Closes-500-Million-for-its-First-Climate-Fund\">US$500m for its 1st climate fund in 2022, underscoring the sector's potential impact on climate solutions.</url></p><p>Australia's proptech manager, Taronga Ventures, had closed  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.perenews.com/apg-ivanhoe-backed-proptech-fund-to-close-at-200m/\">US$170m to focus on the ESG space, far exceeding its original target of US$50m. Their commitment highlights the growing interest in sustainable real estate solutions.</url></p><p>There is also no lack of successful startup stories:</p><p>Brimstone was selected by  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240325688385/en/Industrial-Demonstrations-Program-Selects-Brimstone-for-Transformational-189-Million-Federal-Investment-to-Decarbonize-Cement-Industry\">US DOE for an up to US$189m award to build a commercial-scale facility that will demonstrate the start-up's novel technology at scale for the very first time.</url></p><p>Closer to home, Accacia, an India-based decarbonisation platform for real estate and infrastructure, has closed a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techinasia.com/indiabased-accacia-bags-65m-real-estate-decarbonization-tool\">US$6.5m Pre-Series A round from Illuminate Finance, Accel and B Capital.</url></p><p>These opportunities coupled with strong macro and ESG tailwinds in Southeast Asia meant that the built environment will be one of the focus areas for our fund. Some of the key themes that are explored (non-exhaustive) may include:</p><p>Digitalisation: Deploying next-generation software to supplant outdated systems like building management systems.</p><p>AI-led optimisation and analytics: Empowering building managers to leverage AI for heightened energy efficiency, minimised waste, and optimised resource utilisation.</p><p>Material innovation: Introducing novel sustainable materials, including cooling-effect paints, transparent solar panels as glass substitutes, and carbon-negative cement.</p><p>Resource management: Covering critical areas such as energy storage, waste stream processing, indoor air quality and water conservation.</p><p>Hardtech: Investing in hardware advancements, including sophisticated sensors, IoT devices and solar panels to revolutionise the built environment.</p><p>Challenges in adopting innovative solutions</p><p>While clear problem statements, compelling business cases, and available solutions are essential, they do not always guarantee swift adoption in the built environment sector. This industry is notorious for its slow-moving momentum, which can be frustrating for startups and investors.</p><p>Some of the challenges include:</p><p>Legacy challenges: Many existing buildings and infrastructure operate on legacy systems. Integrating these systems seamlessly with new technology can be challenging. Retrofitting old buildings often proves to be more expensive than constructing new ones, especially in high-cost markets like Singapore-even after accounting for carbon emissions.</p><p>Lack of/inconsistent regulation: Inconsistent and unclear policies across the region hinder the creation of a robust incentive or penalty framework. Such a framework is crucial for accelerating the adoption of new technologies. Without regulatory alignment, stakeholders may hesitate to invest in innovative solutions.</p><p>Lengthy adoption cycles: Building materials like concrete and steel are critical for structural integrity. Replacing these conventional materials requires extensive testing to ensure strength, workability, and durability. Consequently, implementation cycles can become lengthy, delaying the adoption of alternative materials.</p><p>Economic challenges: Many new solutions haven't achieved the economies of scale necessary to compete with conventional materials in terms of cost. HVAC upgrades, for instance, are typically planned well in advance, leaving little room in the budget for exploring alternatives beyond fixed-asset schedules.</p><p>Lack of awareness: Stakeholders, ranging from building owners to occupants, may not fully grasp the benefits of green solutions or be aware of the available options. Some sustainable solutions are perceived as risky or unproven. Demonstrating their reliability and effectiveness is crucial for overcoming this perception.</p><p>In navigating these challenges, collaboration among industry players, policymakers, and investors is essential. By addressing these roadblocks collectively, we have a better chance to accelerate the adoption of innovative solutions and create a more sustainable built environment.</p><p>Partnership for win-win with Keppel</p><p>Given the aforementioned challenges and the nascency of the sector, The Radical Fund has partnered with Keppel Real Estate Group to tackle decarbonising the built environment sector.

Good morning everyone. I was just here earlier for the \"Women in Carbon\" breakfast so happy International Women's Day. To all of you, a warm welcome to Singapore. I really want to thank you for inviting me again for the second edition of Carbon Forward Asia.<br/><br/>2. At last year's Carbon Forward Asia, I spoke of the importance of moving the needle on climate change, and how Singapore can be a catalyst for carbon markets and international cooperation. Last week, at the Ministry of Trade and Industry's Committee of Supply (COS) debate, I also highlighted the need for Singapore to encourage trade flows in areas such as carbon credits. Collectively, we have made important strides both globally and regionally.<br/><br/>Strong Global Momentum on Climate Issues<br/><br/>3. On the global front, 2023 was significant for the completion of the first Global Stocktake (GST) at COP-28 and adoption of the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience as part of the UAE Consensus.<br/><br/>4. Although there was little progress on the operationalisation of Article 6.4 at COP-28, Article 6.2 remains operational since the establishment of the rulebook at COP-26 in 2021. Countries are already engaging in Article 6.2 collaboration. Most recently, the world's first Article 6.2 transaction was completed between Switzerland and Thailand. This has set the stage for more Article 6.2 transactions to come, and we are confident many more high-quality projects will continue to come from Asia.<br/><br/>Carbon Market Developments in Asia<br/><br/>5. Asia has been actively developing international carbon markets. Allow me to update you on some of these developments.<br/><br/>a. Malaysia's Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) completed its first carbon credit auction in March 2023.<br/><br/>b. Indonesia launched its first carbon exchange IDX, in September last year 2023.<br/><br/>c. Vietnam has announced plans to pilot a carbon trade exchange next year with full operations expected in 2028.<br/><br/>d. Thailand submitted its Premium T-VERS (Premium Thailand Voluntary Emissions Reduction Program) for CORSIA eligibility in May last year.<br/><br/>e. Bhutan became the first country to be fully integrated with Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust) to prevent the double counting of carbon credits. It also announced the substantive conclusion of negotiations with Singapore on a legally-binding agreement for Article 6 collaboration in Dec last year.<br/><br/>f. In January this year, Cambodia launched its operations manual for the Implementation of Article 6.<br/><br/>6. Countries are also working together for progress. In September 2023, ASEAN adopted the Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to accelerate the region's transition towards carbon neutrality. One of its goals is to develop carbon markets that are interoperable with one another and with global markets. 2023 also saw the launch of the \"ASEAN Alliance on Carbon Markets\" (AACM), the first private sector led body aiming to support the growth of both voluntary and compliance markets in the region.<br/><br/>7. We firmly believe that Asia is poised to play a pivotal role for international carbon markets, and Singapore is committed to unlock its full potential.<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Carbon Markets<br/><br/>8. On the sidelines of COP-28, Singapore signed our first Implementation Agreement, or \"IA\", with Papua New Guinea on carbon credits collaboration. I am glad I can share this here, almost one year after I met with Simo Kilepa, the Minister for Environment, Conservation and Climate Change of Papua New Guinea, who was in Singapore for the inaugural Carbon Forward Asia. The IA between Singapore and Papua New Guinea sets out a legally binding framework between two countries, to enable the international transfer of carbon credits aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>9. There are three key principles undergirding the IAs which we are working on:<br/><br/>10. First, to enable high quality carbon credits projects to be developed to generate benefits for the host country in the form of sustainable development outcomes, including bringing investments and new jobs. Singapore published our Environmental Integrity (EI) criteria last year. Our Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment has also established an International Advisory Panel for Carbon Credits (IAPCC) to advise Singapore on maintaining a robust and transparent carbon market.<br/><br/>11. Second, to enable faster time-to-market. Singapore's IAs are designed to tap on existing carbon crediting programmes and methodologies. This allows us to ramp up the operationalisation of our IAs and provides more clarity for project developers. Singapore published our List of Eligible Methodologies in December for the Papua New Guinea Agreement, which includes methodologies under Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard, American Carbon Registry and Global Carbon Council.<br/><br/>12. Third, to support climate adaptation in host countries and also overall mitigation of global emissions. Singapore's IAs support host countries by contributing a 5% share of all authorised carbon credits towards climate adaption in these countries. We will also cancel 2% of all authorised carbon credits as an additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions (OMGE).<br/><br/>Singapore's Commitment to Green Finance/Transition<br/><br/>13. Beyond these G2G agreements, Singapore is also expending efforts to address the region's growing green and transition finance needs, which are necessary for the growth of the carbon markets.<br/><br/>14. Last year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced the launch of a new Transition Credits Coalition, called \"TRACTION\". This coalition of ecosystem players will help identify barriers and potential solutions to develop transition credits as a viable market solution, such as credits from the early retirement of coal-fired power plants (CFPPs).<br/><br/>15. MAS also launched a new blended finance platform called Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or \"FAST-P\", which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk and finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.<br/><br/>Working with the Private Sector<br/><br/>16. We need to keep innovating and improving on our existing approaches to accelerate climate action. This is not something that governments can do alone.<br/><br/>17. We need businesses and ecosystem players to continue the momentum set last year. These include companies who are innovating to support the development of carbon markets. In the last few years, we have seen innovations in areas including insurance for carbon credits, such as with carbon credit insurers Kita, and ratings agencies providing independent ratings on projects such as with Sylvera and BeZero. We are glad these companies have decided to establish a presence in Singapore.<br/><br/>18. Today, we have over 120 companies in our carbon services and trading ecosystem. We welcome the incubation of more of these businesses in Singapore and are keen to be involved in the co-creation of solutions to spur on the developments of carbon markets, especially in Asia.<br/><br/>Closing<br/><br/>19. Let's work together to continue supporting a thriving and growing carbon services and trading ecosystem to capture opportunities in a low-carbon future.<br/><br/>20. I wish the organisers a successful and fruitful event.<br/><br/>21.

Singapore has actively contributed to a positive outcome for the UNFCCC and COP28, particularly in the Mitigation and Global Stocktake tracks.<br/><br/>Mitigation<br/><br/>At the request of UAE COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, Minister Grace Fu co-facilitated ministerial consultations on mitigation with Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide. This supported the efforts of the COP28 President in reaching consensus on some key actions that aim to raise global climate ambition and accelerate the energy transition in this critical decade. This included a call on Parties to:<br/><br/>* Transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems in a just, orderly and equitable manner;<br/><br/>* Triple renewable energy capacity globally and double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030;<br/><br/>* Accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.<br/><br/>This agreement is significant as it builds on the decisions at past COPs and includes for the first time a reference to fossil fuels in decision text. Amid other pressing global challenges, the agreed actions reaffirm our collective resolve to strengthen the multilateral framework of cooperation on climate change and accelerate the energy transition to keep 1.5oC within reach. They will serve as an important signal for the private sector, which we hope will lead to a virtuous cycle of greater investments and lower costs in the clean energy sector, which is necessary for the clean energy transition.<br/><br/>Global Stocktake<br/><br/>Singapore also played a key role in facilitating the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake (GST), which reviewed the collective progress towards the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our Chief Negotiator for Climate Change Mr Joseph Teo co-chaired the joint contact group for the Global Stocktake, which helped to tee-up substantive outcomes under GST that were successfully adopted as a key outcome at COP28. The GST decision will guide Parties' collective actions to achieve low-GHG emission and climate-resilient development. It will also inform the preparation of the next round of Nationally Determined Contributions by Parties due in 2025.<br/><br/>Singapore has announced various new initiatives to support and accelerate a green transition in Singapore, our region, and beyond, including:<br/><br/>*The FAST-P (Financing Asia's Transition Partnership) blended finance initiative aims to catalyse up to US$5bn from concessional and commercial capital providers globally. It will help finance and de-risk activities that are green or transitioning towards green, and help scale up blended finance capabilities and other similar financing schemes in Asia.<br/><br/>*The Singapore-Asia Taxonomy to define transition activities across various focus sectors. This will help to minimise greenwashing, while allowing financing to flow to climate-friendly transition activities.<br/><br/>*The Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION) to help ecosystem players identify barriers and potential solutions to develop transition credits as viable market solutions and accelerate the early retirement of coal-fired power plants.<br/><br/>Minister Grace Fu announced that Singapore will not be claiming from the Loss and Damage Fund. Singapore is committed to doing our part to support fellow developing countries in ways we can make a meaningful contribution, such as by sharing best practices in climate adaptation and resilience under the Sustainability Action Package under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). Under the SCP, close to 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories and intergovernmental organisations have participated in our capacity-building courses.<br/><br/>Singapore has also entered into an Implementation Agreement with Papua New Guinea and various other agreements on carbon credits collaboration with partner nations, in line with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement:</p><p>Disclaimer: Table can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2023-12-14-factsheet-singapore-participation-cop28/\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/resource-room/category/2023-12-14-factsheet-singapore-participation-cop28/</url><br/><br/>Singapore also organised the COP28 SingaporePavilion, showcasing Singapore's climate solutions, innovations and partnerships to accelerate collective climate Action. The Pavilion is a partnership with around 100 entities, including corporates, academia, international organisations and non-governmental organisations.<br/><br/>This year saw more than 6,000 unique, in-person visitors attending over 70 sessions, panels and events held at the Pavilion. 11 new announcements by Pavilion Partner Entities were also announced over the duration of the event.<br/><br/>Singapore sent our first official youth delegation to COP28, with youth delegates identified from the Climate Youth Development Programme. The Climate Youth Development Programme is an initiative co-led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS), and the National Youth Council (NYC) to strengthen partnership with the youth community in advancing climate action and sustainable development.</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063323379</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69W6-XWY1-DXMP-K1J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"987\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 14, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Contracts Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY0RTZFMzE0RjkwNDdFQUI5M0U5N0ZFMjYyREMyQzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Time for Payments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI0Mjg4MEQzOTcwNDZCM0E0QzY0Q0Q1NENCMEJFODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTVEQjIxRDAzMUY0NDUyM0E5Q0E1MDZBMEVBNzI1ODQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

I am confident that under Uganda's chairmanship, we will be able to make significant strides towards building a stronger Global South.<br/><br/>As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the G77&amp;China this year, it is timely to reflect on the strong progress that developing countries have made in human capital development over the last few decades. For example, the World Bank estimates that the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has fallen dramatically from about 50% in the 1960s to about 8.8% in 2021.<br/><br/>However, the road ahead has become more uncertain as the world faces a confluence of serious challenges. They include the lingering impact of the pandemic, greater economic volatility due to supply chain disruptions and inflation, as well as the existential challenge of climate change. According to the World Bank, developing countries are projected to grow just 3.9% in 2024, more than one percentage point below the previous decade's average. Developing countries are disproportionately affected by these challenges, such as how small island developing countries are especially vulnerable to the impact of climate change and extreme weather events.<br/><br/>These challenges have also led to a significant rollback of hard-won development gains. According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), last year, about 238 million people experienced food insecurity, an increase of about 21 million from the previous year. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Report released by the UN Secretary-General in 2023 also showed that 30% of SDG targets are stagnating or declining.<br/><br/>As the largest grouping of developing countries at the UN, the G77&amp;China has a unique role in contributing to solutions towards the array of development challenges that we face. We are in a position to amplify the voice of the South on these issues, and work with others within a rules-based multilateral framework to find collective solutions. In particular, we must continue our unwavering efforts towards the collective achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs remain the most critical pathway for ensuring the continued progress of developing countries. The G77&amp;China should build on the SDG Political Declaration adopted at the SDG Summit in September last year. We should also seize opportunities to do more, including at the 4th International Conference on SIDS and the Summit of the Future this year, which will be crucial milestones to push forward the implementation of the SDGs.<br/><br/>Singapore remains committed to working with fellow developing countries to achieve the G77&amp;China's priorities, particularly in four key areas. First, we need to do more to address the pressing challenge of climate change. The decision by Parties at COP28 to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems - in a just, orderly, and equitable manner - is a significant and positive development. This will come as a cost - felt more acutely by developing countries. Thus, more must be done to mobilise technology and finance in developing countries so that we may enable greater ambition while supporting sustainable development. While the developed countries must lead the way in this area, there is scope for greater South-South cooperation so that no one is left behind.<br/><br/>Singapore will do our part to support fellow developing countries in ways that we can make a meaningful contribution. For example, at COP28, Singapore announced various new initiatives to support and accelerate green transition in our region and beyond. This includes the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) blended finance initiative, which aims to catalyse up to US$5 billion from concessional and commercial capital providers globally. Singapore also provides technical assistance and capacity-building courses through the Singapore Cooperation Programme, which has seen close to 150,000 participants from over 180 countries, territories, and intergovernmental organisations over the last three decades. Under this programme, we have also launched the Sustainability Action Package to give greater focus to the global sustainability agenda, and share best practices in climate adaptation and resilience.<br/><br/>Second, on trade, we welcome the G77&amp;China's longstanding commitment to an open and rules-based multilateral trading system. We also echo the G77&amp;China's concerns regarding unilateral and protectionist measures that run counter to the spirit and rules of the WTO.<br/><br/>Third, on technology. We thank Cuba for making Technology a priority of its G77&amp;China Chairmanship in 2023. Technological advancements offer immense opportunities for development and towards the achievement of the SDGs. However, serious and concerted efforts are required to harness the benefits of technology, including by working with global and community partners to bridge technological and digital divides, and promote greater inclusion and connectivity.<br/><br/>Lastly, transformation of global governance. Governments should work together to build a more inclusive global governance system, including through the reform of key global institutions, to better reflect current realities and respond to emerging challenges. The UN High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism had put forth several bold and ambitious proposals, including on repurposing of the multilateral development bank system. We are pleased that some of these proposals have been incorporated in the G77&amp;China's input to the Pact of the Future. Singapore will continue to work closely with G77&amp;China to ensure that the Summit of the Future will deliver outcomes that benefit all, including developing countries.<br/><br/>In closing, let me reaffirm Singapore's steadfast commitment to working with fellow developing countries, to ensure that no one is left behind in our journey towards a better tomorrow.

Such industries include agriculture, conventional energy, manufacturing, transportation and construction. </p><p>Apac's high share of emissions-intensive industries means that millions of workers and communities depend on activities that will need to be replaced by zero-emission alternatives. For some workers, this may mean job loss and retraining. </p><p> Meanwhile, others may be able to access new pathways in other industries as engineers, electricians and managerial workers. </p><p> Most current workers will likely need to upskill, rather than completely retrain, to find a new job or remain in their current one. Nevertheless, it is important to note that labour mobility will not be seamless -- for one, high-emissions jobs are not likely to be in the same locations as low-carbon jobs.  </p><p> Deloitte cautioned that \"the workforce impacts of climate-led transformation could be severe without careful and coordinated planning\". In order to minimise job disruption, business leaders in Apac must invest in climate adaptation and mitigate the risks of unmanaged costs.</p><p> However, if Apac economies can coordinate rapid decarbonisation and undergo a just transition, the report estimated the creation of 180 million jobs by 2050 and an additional US$47 trillion to the region's economies by 2070. </p><p>Apac governments face the unique challenge of ensuring enough green talent to drive the transition, while looking out for their disrupted workers in emissions-intensive industries. Policymakers must ensure that skilling pathways and social protections are available to disrupted workers so they can better adapt to the transition. </p><p> Currently, many governments struggle with translating long-term policy ambitions into near-term action. The level of policy readiness varies widely across Asean countries, with most states making good general progress via sector-specific strategies but failing to address just-transition plans. </p><p> While green jobs in developing countries can provide routes out of poverty, the Deloitte report noted that many are \"informal, poorly paid and do not offer safe working conditions, benefits or opportunities for advancement\".</p><p> To better support vulnerable industries and workers, public policy must set ambitious decarbonisation targets, undergo active skills relocation and set up an adaptive education and skills system, it added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-1L31V7N</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68KW-PWS1-DYX4-0540-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

If greenhouse gas emissions are effectively managed, Singapore's mean daily temperatures would instead fall between 28.5 and 29.5 deg C -- slightly higher than the present 27.9 deg C mean daily temperature. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These are among the key findings of the Third National Climate Change Study (V3), released by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) on Friday (Jan 5). </p><p> V3's projections are based on three scenarios: low, medium and high emissions. The low-emissions scenario is based on net-zero targets being achieved after 2050. The medium one assumes that historical patterns of development continue, and the high-emissions scenario centres on energy-intensive, fossil fuel-based development.</p><p> Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore, said Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, who announced V3's findings at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre on Friday. </p><p> \"V3 shows that we will have to contend with more extreme climate conditions: higher temperatures, heavier rainfalls, and longer and more frequent dry spells. These climate conditions may also lead to other indirect climate challenges, including disruptions to water and food,\" she said. </p><p> Under the high-emissions scenario, Singapore's annual mean temperatures are projected to rise by 0.55 deg C per decade by 2100. This is in sharp contrast to the past 40 years, when the country's annual mean temperature rose by 0.24 deg C per decade.</p><p> \"New normal\" </p><p> In addition, \"very hot\" days, when daily maximum temperatures exceed 35 deg C, are set to become a \"new normal\", the study found. Singapore experienced 21.4 such days per year on average in the last 40 years. By 2100, the country is projected to experience 41 such days annually at best, and 351 at worst.</p><p> The island is also set to have more \"warm nights\", when temperatures exceed 26.3 deg C. From an average of 76 such nights per year in the last 40 years, Singapore could experience warm nights almost throughout the whole year by 2100. </p><p> Beyond hotter days, the study projects that Singapore could experience more extremes in wet and dry days by the century's end. </p><p> From November to January, during the north-east monsoon wet season, total rainfall is expected to occasionally exceed the historical high of 1,507 mm recorded in 2006. In April and May, there could be increases in extreme daily rainfall of between 6 and 92 per cent. </p><p> On the other extreme, during the south-west monsoon dry season from June to August, total rainfall could be significantly below the historical low of 314 mm recorded in 1997. The study expects that this could occur around once every three years.</p><p> Dry spells could also be more frequent and last longer by 2100; Singapore could experience a dry spell between every 10 months to five years. </p><p> Extreme weather will be accompanied by rising sea levels. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23 m to 1.15 m by the end of the century, and by up to around 2 m by 2150 under the high-emissions scenario.</p><p> \"This increase from the previous V2 projections -- around 1 m by end-century -- is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels,\" CCRS said.</p><p> V3's projections are consistent with global scientists' view of climate change, under the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Sixth Assessment Report. </p><p> Based on the findings, the government will strengthen its climate adaptation plans and look out for new climate risks, said Fu. </p><p>Singapore has thus far used passive design strategies to cool the environment, such as by intensifying greenery in urban areas and orienting buildings along the north-south direction to reduce heat gain.</p><p> It is now using measurements, modelling and simulation to improve city design, and to enhance knowledge of urban heat and its impact on human health. Singapore last year launched a heat stress advisory to warn the public about rising temperatures.</p><p> \"Businesses can lead the way\" </p><p> The private sector also has a part to play to mitigate rising temperatures. \"Businesses can lead the way by adopting more sustainable practices, tracking their carbon footprint and setting a net-zero target year,\" said Fu. </p><p> Professor Winston Chow, a climate scientist at the Singapore Management University, told reporters that the detailed projections from V3 can help businesses with managing operational and capital costs, which might increase in the years to come with climate hazards.</p><p> \"So it's to their interest to utilise this information to engage with the climate-science community and the modelling community, to see how the diminishing of risks can happen,\" he said.</p><p>Singapore's meteorological service will work on joint research with international entities and scientists using V3 data. The data will be shared with Asean member states at a later stage.</p><p> Separately, the National Environment Agency on Friday launched a second grant call under its Climate Impact Science Research Programme, for new research proposals on food security, impact on human health, water resources, sea-level rise and effects on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector.</p><p> Eight projects were awarded in December 2023 under the programme's first grant call. These projects will draw on V3 results to look into areas such as the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore and changes in the tropical forest landscape. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"Very hot\" days, where daily maximum temperatures exceed 35 degrees Celsius, could become a \"new normal\".

It includes the \"sponge city\" approach to addressing storms and floods, just as it includes building coastal embankments and better drainage systems. Similarly, smart forest management, for example by building fire breaks, would seek to minimise forest fires. </p><p> These adaptation techniques do not really mitigate climate change or address the root causes of excessive greenhouse gas emissions, but they ameliorate the impact of the disasters. </p><p> A few steps, however, both mitigate and adapt, such as protecting mangroves that help to absorb carbon emissions while also slowing the fury of storms. </p><p> A sponge city is a new urban model for flood management first suggested by Chinese researchers in 2000 to combat the concrete and asphalt that prevent drainage. It makes the most of natural \"sponges\" such as trees, lakes and parks that absorb water and let it drain away safely. </p><p> Cities that have embraced this approach to some degree include Shanghai, New York and Cardiff, with their inner-city gardens, better river drainage and planted footpaths. </p><p>Singapore, too, has incorporated principles of a sponge city in its adaptation efforts, particularly integrating rainwater into city functions. The Republic's 2030 Green Plan includes elements of permeable or porous sidewalks, wetland parks and underground storage tanks. </p><p> However, unrelenting downpours starting on July 29 that inundated cities in northern China put into sharp relief the limitations of the country's innovative \"sponge city\" measures amid relentless global warming. </p><p> The case of China's  sponge cityThe deluge wreaked havoc in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, unleashing over 260mm of rain water by the morning of Aug 1. Rivers swelled, bridges crumbled and flash floods ravaged communities, exposing the fragility of infrastructure. By Aug 8, 33 lives were lost, 18 individuals were missing and nearly 300,000 people were left reeling from the impact in Beijing alone. </p><p> Vice-Mayor Xia Linmao described it as \"historically rare torrential rains\", with 60 per cent of the annual average rainfall descending within just 83 hours. </p><p> It was exactly the scenario the sponge city concept was intended to tackle -- but couldn't.</p><p> The background: China is home to 16 of the 20 global regions considered most vulnerable to climate change. It is for this reason China invested substantially in recent years to fortify climate defences. The devastating 2012 Beijing flood that claimed 79 lives spurred President Xi Jinping to champion sponge cities. </p><p> In April 2015, 16 cities were identified as inaugural sponge city pilot projects. A target was set for key features of the programme in urban built-up areas: exceeding 20 per cent by 2020 and surpassing 80 per cent by 2030. Performance evaluation reports in 2019 showed impressive progress, with 920 sq km of sponge city construction across 30 pilot cities and an investment exceeding 160 billion yuan (S$29.6 billion).</p><p> These water management designs, however, were predicated on rainfall patterns three decades before 2014. They are grossly inadequate for today's amplified impacts of climate change. </p><p> In Beijing's Mentougou district, for instance, efforts centred on controlling 75 per cent of annual run-off since 2018. This equates to rainfall of just 25.9 mm within 24 hours. Yet, the recent heavy rainfall in Beijing reached an astounding 270.2mm, highlighting that the current sponge city blueprint is ill-suited for climate change-driven weather extremes.</p><p> What happened in  Canada, MauiThe limitations of the current sponge city approach also put the spotlight on the limitations of other adaptation measures, too. </p><p> Take the deadly fires in Canada and Hawaii's Maui, for example. With more than double the previous annual record for emissions from wildfires, and the release of 300 million tonnes of carbon into the air, 2023 could easily be the worst year for forest fires in Canada's history. </p><p> The scale of devastation in Maui, from the historic district to schools and homes, is tough to fathom. </p><p> The proximate reasons for these wildfires could be lightning, the careless lighting of a match, or a campfire, but the underlying reason is unusually warm weather and lack of precipitation driven by human-caused climate change.</p><p> And regarding adaptation, there were serious managerial and engineering lapses too. </p><p> The lack of preparedness for wildfires in Canada has been known for some time, especially as disaster management agencies faced budget and staff constraints and cuts. </p><p> In Maui, there were serious gaps in early warning systems and the local capacity to get people out of harm's way. </p><p> Review of current measures is neededThe cascade of unprecedented floods and storms on the one side, and deadly heatwaves and forest fires on the other, sounds alarm bells on two fronts. </p><p> For one thing, adaptation measures need to be constantly reviewed to ensure that their engineering specifications are up to date. </p><p> The second is the realisation that all the adaptation efforts will have little effect on the loss of lives and livelihoods caused by climate change unless the root cause of global warming is addressed -- carbon emissions that continue to be pumped into the atmosphere at record rates using fossil fuels.</p><p> All the adaptation efforts, including sponge cities, will fall short unless major emitters like China, the United States, India, Japan and Russia transition successfully to a low-carbon economy. </p><p> When fires decimate Maui, the Greek islands, or Northern Canada, it is natural that all the attention is on local causes, everything from the lighting of a match to the mismanagement of escape routes. But common to all is the extreme heat and bone-dry vegetation caused by global warming resulting directly from excessive carbon emissions that trap atmospheric heat.</p><p> Effecting a meaningful shift to a low-carbon growth trajectory requires substantial resource reallocation and technological advancement, particularly in energy production and consumption. </p><p> The reality is economic and political pressures everywhere in the world prioritise disaster relief and recovery way over preventative measures. Financial incentives are also tilted to favour any means of advancing short-term economic growth at the expense of environmental and disaster protection, especially at provincial or state levels across the world. </p><p> Correcting these misplaced priorities calls for astute top-level signals and policy design, coupled with an education campaign and changed incentives aligned to the requisites of a more sustainable growth pattern.</p><p> There is great urgency in investing more financial and staff resources and revising sponge city engineering design specifications, for example, to adapt and cope better with extreme floods and storms. There is also a need to look at the big picture of mitigation and prevention. </p><p> That calls for bold policy decisions that go beyond responding to immediate risks even during a crisis, and tailoring adaptability to an escalating climatic catastrophe.</p><p> While this transition to the new reality of climate change entails financial costs, it is worth remembering that the benefits -- ranging from mitigating climate-related damages to fostering sustainable green development -- are vastly larger.</p><p> Liuyang He is a researcher at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore; Vinod Thomas is a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute, and a former senior vice-president at the World Bank, and author of Risk And Resilience In The Era Of Climate Change (2023).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-JA3VCPS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:692N-YXJ1-DYX4-000X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

I am delighted to join you at this evening's Gala Dinner, which is held in conjunction with the Canada-in-Asia Conferences (or CIAC).<br/><br/>2. The CIAC was made possible by the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada and Universities Canada. Thank you for choosing to hold the CIAC in Singapore again. The inaugural CIAC last year sparked interesting dialogues on many topics of importance, such as trade and multilateralism, climate change, agri-food, health, and higher education. The CIAC exemplifies our shared vision to drive action to tackle the challenges facing our generation and future generations. It offers an opportunity for our business leaders, academia and government officials to deepen collaboration to address these challenges.<br/><br/>Climate Change and Food Systems: Two Inter-Connected Issues<br/><br/>3. This year, the CIAC is shining a spotlight on two complex and inter-connected challenges - climate change and agri-food security. Both issues are at the heart of much of my Ministry's work.<br/><br/>4. Climate change no longer exists in future projections. It is a reality that we are now experiencing firsthand. 2023 was Earth's warmest year on record. Canada and many regions in Asia experienced record-breaking heatwaves. Numerous cases of heat-related illnesses were reported across Asia. High temperatures and dry conditions contributed to unprecedented wildfires across Canada, leading to deaths, poor air quality, displacement of residents, and property damage.<br/><br/>5. Both our regions will suffer long-term negative consequences of climate change if we do not take urgent action. The latest climate change study from the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (or CCRS) projected that by the end of the century, Southeast Asia will experience annual mean temperature increases of 0.5 to 5.4 degrees Celsius. Canada is also expected to warm. In \"Canada's Changing Climate Report\" 1 , it was estimated that Canada will warm at a rate double that of the global rate, with projected increases of 0.8 to 6.3 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Rising temperatures and other changes in weather patterns will trigger many negative effects, such as food insecurity.<br/><br/>6. Canada and Asia are major food producing regions - Canada is known for producing grains, red meats and dairy, while Asia is considered the \"rice bowl\" for the world. The production of these foods is highly sensitive to the climate. One immense concern is the loss of arable land, which reduces capacity for food production. A warmer climate brings new pests and diseases that threaten crop yield and livestock health. Extreme weather events, which are projected to increase in occurrence and intensity, exacerbate crop losses and disrupt food supply chains. One immense concern is the loss of arable land, which reduces capacity for food production. A warmer climate brings new pests and diseases that threaten crop yield and livestock health. Extreme weather events, which are projected to increase in occurrence and intensity, exacerbate crop losses and disrupt food supply chains. Our food systems need to undergo significant transformation to remain functional amidst climate change.<br/><br/>7. Food systems, however, are not mere victims of climate change. They also contribute to climate change. Currently, about a third of the world's greenhouse gas emissions result from food and agriculture. Much of these emissions arise from deforestation to avail land for farming, as well as unsustainable farming practices. Production of livestock and rice - key produce from Canada and Asia - generate high levels of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. Downstream of food production, food loss and waste contributes about half of the total emissions We could do more to reduce these emissions, by adopting climate-friendly farming practices, addressing inefficiencies in thefood chain through better matching of supply to demand, and reducing unnecessary food waste.<br/><br/>Singapore's Experiences in Climate Action and Food Security<br/><br/>8. Like Canada and many ASEAN member states, Singapore is committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. We are taking active steps to transit to a low-carbon and more sustainable future.<br/><br/>9. In 2021, we launched our Singapore Green Plan 2030, a whole-of- nation sustainability roadmap to rally bold efforts and collective action to tackle climate change. We are the first country in the region to introduce a carbon tax, to strengthen the impetus for businesses to invest in decarbonisation. This year, we raised our carbon tax to $25 per tonne and will progressively raise it further to $50 to $80 by 2030. We are undertaking a comprehensive suite of climate mitigation measures. These include greening our energy mix, by increasing solar deployment and preparing ourselves to utilise low-carbon alternative fuels such as hydrogen. We are also actively decarbonising our aviation and maritime activities. We are venturing beyond our shores and seeking out opportunities for international collaboration on renewable energy imports, green technologies and carbon credits.<br/><br/>10. We have implemented measures to protect Singapore's population from rising temperatures and sea levels. To strengthen our food security in the face of climate change, we have set a goal to increase local food production. We are pursuing efforts such as urban agriculture and novel proteins, demonstrating our dedication to a greener future.<br/><br/>Leveraging Complementary Strengths for Global Impact<br/><br/>11. Platforms like the CIAC bring value in galvanising collective action across national borders.<br/><br/>12. Climate change and agri-food security are global challenges that we cannot solve alone. We will need to work together and leverage on each other's strengths to deliver solutions with greater global impact. In September last year, ASEAN member states and Canada established the ASEAN-Canada Strategic Partnership to closely collaborate in strategic areas such as climate adaptation and mitigation, agricultural trade and capacity building in agri-food research. In particular, we noted Canada is well-positioned to be a reliable supplier of clean energy and agricultural fertilisers for Asia. Singapore and Canada are like-minded countries in climate action. We are part of the Canada-led Powering Past Coal Alliance (or PPCA), which is working to advance the transition from unabated coal power generation to clean energy. We are also members of the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership (or FCLP), which aims to reduce forest loss, increase forest restoration, and support sustainable agriculture. Singapore and Canada are part of the initial group of partners to support the Ghana Country Package under the FCLP, which will pull together financial resources from public, private and philanthropic sources to fund Ghana's plans in forest and biodiversity conservation, through innovative solutions such as blended finance and high integrity nature-based carbon credits. Products and services from Canadian climate and agri-food companies have rapid scaling potential in Asia, with its burgeoning markets and increasingly climate-conscious population. In the area of agri-food, investments have been increasing between Canada and the Asia-Pacific in both directions over the past two decades. Asia's producers are eager to transform and adapt to modern climate challenges, and will greatly benefit from Canadian investments. Additionally, there are many learning points that we can draw from Canada's culture of sustainability and responsible resource management.<br/><br/>13. Amongst participants today, we have a good mix of leaders from the climate and agri-food sectors. I encourage you to make full use of CIAC to exchange knowledge, strengthen old connections and forge new networks and partnerships.<br/><br/>14. I wish you a good Conference ahead.

The event was part of the United Nations COP28 climate conference in Dubai, and SM Teo spoke on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Amid heightened geopolitical and economic uncertainty, he said, the world is far from achieving its climate goals. Instead of capping warming at 1.5 deg C, it is instead heading towards a 2.1 deg C to 2.8 deg C increase by 2100. </p><p> The first Global Stocktake -- an inventory of how countries are taking climate action -- presents a timely opportunity for the world to correct its course to keep the target of 1.5 deg C within reach, he stressed.</p><p> \"This can only be achieved if we deliver substantive, inclusive, and balanced outcomes at COP28 across mitigation, adaptation as well as means of implementation.</p><p> \"At this critical juncture, we need to foster even stronger multilateral cooperation than before,\" he said, noting that Singapore was reaffirming its commitment to domestic climate action, regional partnerships and global collaboration.</p><p> On the domestic front, Singapore has already raised its climate ambition -- with a goal of reaching net zero by 2050, and reducing emissions to 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, after peaking emissions earlier. </p><p> The previous target was to peak emissions at 65 million tonnes in 2030, and for emissions to drop to net zero by 2050.</p><p> Among a range of measures, its carbon tax will also be increased from $5 per tonne currently to $25 per tonne from 2024, and progressively to $50 to $80 per tonne by 2030, making it one of the highest in Asia, said Mr Teo.</p><p> To improve regional cooperation, the Republic is doing its part to accelerate Asia's energy transition by channelling finance to do so, and to facilitate the trade of clean energy regionally. </p><p> It will be launching a new blended finance initiative, known as the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, that will mobilise up to US$5 billion. </p><p> Blended finance refers to getting cheaper sources of funding such as grants, and non-commercial loans from the public sector, to make marginally bankable projects less risky to attract private-sector financing. Marginally bankable projects are projects which typically do not attract private-sector financing because they may not be as profitable, such as climate adaptation projects like  mangrove planting. </p><p> The US$5 billion will be directed to transition projects, which refers to measures by carbon-intensive companies to lower their emissions, and marginally bankable green projects. </p><p> It is estimated that Asia will need approximately US$1.7 trillion in climate and infrastructure investments each year through 2030 to decarbonise its economies.</p><p>Singapore has also partnered with Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam to import around 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, said Mr Teo. </p><p> In addition, the country will be sharing its findings from a local study on climate science and the regional impacts of climate change, so that countries in the region can better adapt to its impact. </p><p> \"Singapore is committed to helping forge global consensus, to achieve substantive, balanced and inclusive outcomes,\" SM Teo added.</p><p> He pointed out that Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu will be co-facilitating negotiations on mitigation with Norway, while Singapore's chief negotiator Joseph Teo will facilitate talks on the Global Stocktake -- a health check on the 2015 Paris Agreement goals -- as co-chairman with the United Kingdom.</p><p>Singapore is also supporting a range of global initiatives that call for \"collective and inclusive\" climate action, said Mr Teo. </p><p> For one, it is supporting the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge -- which refers to the tripling of the global installed capacity of renewable energy sources to 11 terawatts by 2030. </p><p> Under the pledge, the global rate of energy efficiency improvements from 2020 to 2030 must also be doubled compared to the previous decade. </p><p> In a bid to help reduce the global dependence on coal, the Singapore government is prepared to purchase transition credits if they meet local standards for high environmental integrity, said Mr Teo. Transition credits are a new class of carbon credits that can be generated from reductions in emissions when high-emitting coal-fired power plants are retired early, ahead of their lifespan, and replaced with cleaner energy sources.</p><p> This means that if it is proven to be credible, the Singapore government can purchase the credits to meet its national climate target. Companies, too, can purchase the credits to fulfil part of their carbon tax obligations. </p><p>Singapore will also be signing a number of agreements to support carbon credits and low-carbon solutions with countries like Papua New Guinea.</p><p> Said SM Teo: \"The window of opportunity to tackle climate change, the existential crisis of this generation, is small and closing quickly. </p><p> \"We must urgently grasp this chance to course-correct and take decisive action to keep the target of 1.5 deg C in sight.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-M55NI4D</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69SK-FJ31-DYX4-000R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"890\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Good evening. I am delighted to join you this evening at the EB Impact Charity Gala Dinner to witness the launch of the EB Impact Sustainability Education Grant.<br/><br/>The global climate crisis<br/><br/>2. At last December's COP28, the UN's annual climate change conference, the world came to a historic agreement following the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake to transit away from fossil fuels, triple renewable energy capacity, and double energy efficiency improvements globally by 2030.<br/><br/>3. However, the Global Stocktake was also a stark reminder that current efforts are not sufficient to keep us within 1.5 degrees Celsius of temperature rise. More than ever, countries realise the urgent need to step up efforts to reduce their emissions. Many countries around the world are impacted by extreme climate events.<br/><br/>4. Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore. As a small and low-lying island state, Singapore is especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including sea level rise. The increasing occurrence of erratic weather patterns around the world also threatens our water and food security. To better understand the impacts of climate change on Singapore, we have undertaken three National Climate Change Studies since 2007. These studies provide climate projections for Singapore and Southeast Asia until the end of this century, and shed valuable insights to help us better plan and strengthen our climate adaptation measures.<br/><br/>5. The Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, was released just last month. The bad news is, based on projections from V3, we will have to contend with more extreme climate conditions - accelerating rate of sea level rise, higher temperatures, heavier rainfalls, as well as longer and more frequent dry spells.<br/><br/>6. While end-century may seem somewhat far away, we are already feeling the impacts of climate change. 2023 was Singapore's fourth hottest year on record, and the world's warmest year on record. The impacts of climate change are very real, and we must collectively take climate action now to safeguard the well-being of our current and future generations.<br/><br/>Youths as agents of change<br/><br/>7. Our youths, as the leaders of tomorrow, play a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable Singapore. All around the world, youths are driving change.<br/><br/>8. For the first time, Singapore sent an official youth delegation to COP28, with participants identified from the Climate Youth Development Programme. The programme is an initiative co-led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), the National Climate Change Secretariat, and the National Youth Council to strengthen our partnership with the youth community in advancing climate action and sustainable development. In addition to learning more about international climate negotiations, our youth delegates hosted guests and helped to share the Singapore story at our Singapore Pavilion. They also organised programmes to profile our youth climate actions. I am heartened by their passion, and hope that their activism and commitment will inspire many more youths in Singapore to step up for sustainability.<br/><br/>9. Indeed, more youths in Singapore are emerging as agents of change to make a difference in their communities. Every positive action, no matter how small, contributes to the greater cause of environmental sustainability. Some of these youth changemakers are amongst us tonight. For example:<br/><br/>a. Ms Oh Chu Xian is the founder of Magorium, a business that transforms plastic waste into road construction material;<br/><br/>b. Ms Kong Man Jing, or more widely known as Biogirl MJ, creates accessible environmental content to educate and engage communities on climate change;<br/><br/>c. Mr Yasser Amin heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation which developed a mobile app to encourage accountability in waste cleanup efforts;<br/><br/>d. Mr Ho Xiang Tian co-founded LepakInSG, an environmental advocacy group which organises discussions with subject matter experts and members of the public on our environmental policies;<br/><br/>e. and Mr Mihir Pershad runs Umami Bioworks, a company that produces cultivated seafood using innovative production methods.<br/><br/>10. Thank you for your good work, and we look forward to your continued contributions towards our sustainability journey in your respective ways.<br/><br/>Education as a key enabler to catalyse climate action<br/><br/>11. Education is a key enabler to catalyse collective change, and our youths, equipped with the right knowledge, are an important driving force behind creating a green and resilient shared future. Under the Ministry of Education's Eco Stewardship Programme, environmental education is incorporated into the Campus, Culture, Curriculum and Community (4Cs) in our Primary, Secondary Schools and Junior Colleges to enhance our students' understanding of sustainability and climate change, and to build sustainability-conscious mindsets and habits in our younger generation. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) partner with companies, agencies and the community on research and innovation projects in sustainability, and develop new solutions that advance the national sustainability agenda. IHLs are also investing in skills for the future so that graduates and working adults can tap on new opportunities presented by the green economy.<br/><br/>12. Corporates and organisations also play an important role in nurturing our youths to become environmental stewards. The new EB Impact Sustainability Education Grant will provide financial assistance and leadership development opportunities to selected youths in Singapore aiming to achieve a higher educational degree in a sustainability-related field. I am also happy to hear about the various initiatives under EB Impact that support our youths' sustainability aspirations. EB Impact's Sustainability Exchange is a youth mentorship-programme developed in collaboration with a wide range of partners including MSE, to enable youths in Singapore to work on real-world projects under the guidance of sustainability professionals. The programme has benefitted over 130 aspiring youths to date. I encourage more corporates and organisations to engage our youths and equip them with the relevant skills to thrive in the green transition.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>13. The need to address and mitigate the worsening impacts of climate change has never been more critical. However, it is not all doom and gloom. The world is undergoing a green transition, and this opens up new opportunities in many sectors for our youths to pursue.<br/><br/>14. Let us continue to enable our youths to become agents of change, and empower them to lead the charge and contribute actively towards our sustainability development. Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063598376</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8H-CKC1-DXMP-K222-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1341\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 1, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODA1RjcwQkQzMURENDhGQjk4RjdCQTlCODk3NUNDMDc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njk4RUMyMDg4ODMwNDIwNUI1NEQwMDE0OUU3REYyOTM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

It will allow Singapore to be prepared for dry months and enhance resilience against inland flooding for very wet months, for instance, she added. </p><p> She said the Government will share some of the findings with EOS and other agencies like the Meteorological Service Singapore, as well as its South-east Asian counterparts, so that they can be better prepared for varying weather patterns arising from climate change.</p><p> The programme will be supported by a $50 million investment over seven years, with $47 million from the Ministry of Education and the remaining amount from NTU. Research will be conducted under six strategic clusters.</p><p> For instance, the programme will look at the health impact from heat and air pollution fuelled by climate change, how climate change could affect business risks, as well as novel engineering solutions for climate adaptation.</p><p> Giving some examples of the research programme, Professor Benjamin Horton, the director of EOS, said NTU has a partnership with insurance company Prudential to look into the health impact stemming from climate change and how it could affect one's life insurance. </p><p> Another collaboration with luxury brand Chanel will help the company to diversify its supply chain, as increasing extreme weather events such as drought, forest fires and severe rainfall mean it would not be ideal to have all its suppliers in one location. </p><p> Other aspects of the programme will examine how biodiversity such as flora and fauna responds to climate change, mapping out ways in which the world could get to net-zero through a negative emissions pathway, for example by planting trees, and to tackle knowledge gaps in understanding and modelling climate change. </p><p> Three cross-themes -- sustainable societies, satellite remote sensing and artificial intelligence -- will integrate findings across the six clusters. </p><p> The programme will bring together researchers across many different disciplines at NTU, and other local universities such as the National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University and the Singapore University of Technology and Design, and research centres across the globe. </p><p> It is expected to recruit 30 doctorate students and close to 45 researchers for its projects over seven years, to develop climate leaders in fields ranging from the sciences to the humanities. </p><p> Asked about the kind of knowledge gaps that the programme will seek to plug, Prof Horton told ST that while climate scientists are beginning to better understand the physical impact of climate change -- such as sea level rise, flooding and heatwaves -- it has yet to be properly quantified.</p><p> For instance, little is known about how climate change could affect natural ecosystems from rainforests to mangroves, how it could affect construction workers, as well as the world's finances and energy use.  </p><p> Therefore, interdisciplinary studies -- bringing together scientists, geologists, social scientists and business students -- will be required to find solutions, he said. </p><p> He noted that the new programme has come at a time of climate emergency -- with the first comprehensive health check of the Paris Agreement showing that countries must take more ambitious action to cut emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 deg C.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu (centre) at the Earth Observatory of Singapore's 15th anniversary celebration, with (from left) Professor Benjamin Horton, director of the EOS; Professor Luke Ong, vice-president of research at Nanyang Technological University; Ms Trina Ng, PhD student at the Asian School of the Environment (ASE) and EOS; and Associate Professor Susanna Jenkins, associate chair (faculty) at ASE.

Good morning. I am pleased to join you today to commemorate the 50th Year of ASEAN-Japan Friendship and Cooperation. Indeed, we have come a long way. I am heartened that this event is centered around the youths from the Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Programme.</p><p>2. Singapore and Japan have enjoyed a long and close friendship since establishing ties in 1966. In many ways, and at various levels, our countries have become reliable partners over the last 57 years. Our partnership has been comprehensive, substantive and mutually supportive, including through challenging times such as the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>3. Our economic partnership continues to grow strength-to strength. Singapore was Japan's top Asian investor and third largest source of Foreign Direct Investment stock in 2022. In the same year, Singapore was also Japan's third largest investment destination in Asia.</p><p>4. Beyond trade, our countries have expanded cooperation in areas such as renewable energy, climate change and green development. My ministry, MSE (Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment) signed two Memoranda of Cooperation with the Japanese Ministries of (i) Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and (ii) Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism to enhance collaboration in food security, agri-tech, climate science and climate adaptation. These partnerships will allow both sides to learn from each other and advance our respective goals of building a more sustainable future.</p><p>5. Last year, Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry also signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) with Japan Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry to deepen cooperation in long-term emissions reduction strategies and pathways.</p><p>6. At the regional level, Japan has been a steadfast partner to ASEAN for five decades. We are like-minded and committed in supporting ASEAN, and have deepened collaboration through ASEAN-led mechanisms such as the ASEAN Plus Three, East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum and ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus.</p><p>7. Singapore has consistently supported Japan's ASEAN initiatives, including:</p><p>* Japan's Strategic Partnership for ASEAN Climate and Environment (SPACE), which was recently launched in Vientiane at the ASEAN-Japan Ministerial Dialogue on Environmental Cooperation; and</p><p>* just last week at the ASEAN-Japan Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry (AMAF) meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the ASEAN-Japan Midori Cooperation Plan was also launched to enhance food security cooperation. So again, this shows a strong partnership.</p><p>8. At the international level, we also cooperate closely through key international platforms such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the International Maritime Organisation.</p><p>9. As we come together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Dialogue Relations this year, it is important to remember that trust and respect have been at the root of the ASEAN-Japan partnership. It is therefore apt to commemorate our partnership by planting trees, whose roots symbolise our strong and enduring partnership.</p><p>10. Besides that, the planting of trees is also very good for all of us, ASEAN, Japan, coming together in partnership to protect the environment and build a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generation.</p><p>11. I hope everyone of us, including the youths will be able to acknowledge the hard work it took to build this partnership, cherish it, and take it forward 50 years more and beyond.</p><p>12. With that, I wish everyone a very happy 50th Friendship and Cooperation Anniversary. Thank you again to SSEAYP for organising this. Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Partnerships and Alliances, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062699394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69C4-P621-DXMP-K43C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 7, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

The Sixteenth Brunei Darussalam-Singapore Annual Exchange of Visits on the Environment (16th BSAEV), instituted under the renewed 2022 Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Partnership in Environmental Affairs and Climate Change, was held in Brunei Darussalam on 24th October 2023.</p><p>2. The Brunei Darussalam delegation was led by Yang Berhormat Dato Seri Setia Awang Haji Muhammad Juanda bin Haji Abdul Rashid, Minister of Development, and comprised Dayang Dr. Nor Imtihan binti Haji Abdul Razak, Permanent Secretary (Planning, Land Use and Environment), and senior officials from the Department of Environment, Parks and Recreation and the Public Works Department, Ministry of Development, and the Brunei Darussalam Climate Change Secretariat (BCCS), Prime Minister's Office, Brunei Darussalam.</p><p>3. Her Excellency Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, led the Singapore delegation comprising Mr Stanley Loh, Permanent Secretary, and other senior officials from the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, the National Environment Agency and PUB (Singapore's National Water Agency).</p><p>4. During the meeting, the Ministers reaffirmed the strong bilateral relationship between Brunei Darussalam and Singapore and reiterated their commitment to foster continual progress and deepen cooperation on environmental protection and addressing climate change.</p><p>5. The Ministers noted the steady progress of existing projects and programmes of the two countries in the areas of solid waste management, air quality management, water resources management, environmental youth programmes, and climate change. Brunei Darussalam's latest initiatives in solid waste management include expanding the installation of the surveillance camera system to two other districts, namely Tutong and Belait Districts, at strategic locations, successfully identifying offenders and imposing compoundable fines; the final stages of drafting the Waste Management Regulation; and the nationwide recycling day initiative to promote awareness and inculcate the habits of recycling to the public in their daily lives. Singapore introduced various initiatives to manage e-waste and packaging waste, such as the implementation of Disposable Carrier Bag Charge from July 2023; the planned introduction of a Beverage Container Return Scheme from April 2025; ongoing studies to develop a chemical recycling value chain; and the recycling of electrical equipment under the Extended Producer Responsibility Scheme for E-waste. The Ministers welcomed the useful exchanges of information on air quality management and initiatives, including air quality monitoring and regulatory measures for industrial emissions.</p><p>6. The Ministers noted the updates on water resource management cooperation, including Brunei Darussalam's proposal for further collaboration to improve the efficiency of water treatment processes and enhance the reliability of its water supply network and system. The Ministers also noted the efforts in youth environmental programmes and activities such as the 4th ASEAN Eco-Schools Awards and the 2nd ASEAN Youth Eco-Champions Awards.</p><p>7. The Ministers noted that both sides had conducted a technical exchange to share experiences on integrating environmental considerations and assessments in the design and siting of new developments. On climate change, the Ministers welcomed the conclusion of the Establishment Agreement of the ASEAN Centre for Climate Change (ACCC) hosted by Brunei Darussalam. The Ministers also agreed to strengthen cooperation on climate adaptation and exchanged views on initiatives to increase heat resilience in the region, such as Singapore's Heat Stress Advisory.</p><p>8. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to work with other ASEAN members to promote cooperation in environmental protection, including efforts to prevent, monitor, and reduce transboundary haze, as well as addressing the impact of climate change. They noted that such cooperation was important to achieve sustainable development and ensure a healthy and clean environment in the region.</p><p>9. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to enhance cooperation and foster an even closer friendship and partnership between Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.</p><p>10 Singapore will host the 17th BSAEV in 2024.</p><p>Jointly Issued By:</p><p>Ministry of Development, Brunei Darussalam</p><p>Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Singapore</p><p>[Category: Financial/ Capital Market, Investment Banking &amp;

Global food security has become a massive problem. It is interlinked with the lengthy Ukraine war and conflicts in Somalia, Syria and elsewhere. This is over and above climate change, which brings droughts, fires and floods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than ever, urgent action is needed to forge peace, bolster the global agricultural economy and secure lower-priced nutritional produce.</p><p> Food insecurity is a staggering humanitarian tragedy. </p><p> The number of children, women and men facing starvation has risen to the highest level in nearly two decades, according to the United Nations' (UN) World Food Programme (WFP). </p><p> A record 349 million people were acutely hungry at the beginning of this year, estimates the WFP. This could reach 600 million by the end of the decade. </p><p> Conflicts and mass displacement have led to hunger, malnutrition, sickness and death in Africa, Asia, and South and Central America.</p><p> In these areas, farmers and consumers are increasingly struggling to cope with climate change's severe droughts and sudden floods. In addition, there have been recent natural disasters, such as the devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.</p><p> The lengthy Ukraine war has aggravated the crisis. Not only is there an acute shortage and much higher prices of wheat, corn, barley and sunflower oil from the Ukraine and Russian bread baskets, but Russia is a major producer of fertiliser. </p><p> What the world can doDramatic declines in fertiliser supplies are hurting grain and rice farmers in Europe, Asia, Africa and elsewhere.</p><p> Even in wealthier countries, food insecurity exists and should be tackled. Good, healthy, nutritious food should be in ready supply and promoted to the populace. </p><p> Such a diet -- in conjunction with exercise -- would lower society's obesity levels, raise productivity and ease demands on overburdened health services.</p><p> But what steps should be taken, and how much funding should be forthcoming from both the public and private sector'</p><p> The mantra of Qu Dongyu, director-general of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, is \"Four Betters\" -- better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life.</p><p> The organisation has identified 20 priority programme areas, including green innovation, equitable chances for small-scale producers, digital agriculture, healthy diets, restoring ecosystems, reducing food loss and waste, and promoting transparent markets and trade.</p><p> Its priorities extend to gender equality, rural women's empowerment, sustainable urban food systems and investment in small, medium and larger farms.</p><p> The WFP itself is a good example of how to take swift action. Last year, its directors decided to employ more full-time workers who advise and work with partner institutions to deliver emergency food, cash and nutrition assistance.</p><p> Funding still inadequateIt also provided food assistance to combat the malnutrition and hunger of nearly 160 million people, helping to avert famine in countries such as Afghanistan and Somalia; and negotiated access to several conflict zones, allowing it to provide humanitarian assistance and avert catastrophic levels of food insecurity.</p><p> These impressive achievements were enabled by funding from international financial institutions, private foundations and individuals, which donated US$14 billion in 2022, almost 50 per cent more than in 2021.</p><p> Yet unfortunately, funding is still inadequate -- not least because inflation, supply-chain disruptions and other factors raised WFP's food procurement costs by 39 per cent between 2019 and 2022.</p><p> While total humanitarian assistance has increased, there is still a US$52 billion funding gap.</p><p> This is the largest ever, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri).</p><p> \"To be more effective, food security programming needs to go beyond humanitarian assistance alone and include climate adaptation, development, peacebuilding and conflict prevention,\" stressed Simone Bunse, a senior researcher in Sipri's Food, Peace and Security Programme.</p><p> \"Peacebuilding has often been neglected and is rarely an explicit objective of humanitarian programmes,\" said Dr Bunse, who is concerned that Russia's Vladimir Putin and African warlords are using food supplies as a weapon of war and political control.</p><p> \"Food-security interventions cannot be just about providing food; they need to be part of supporting peace and helping communities to become more resilient, secure and sustainable -- and thus less vulnerable to food insecurity in the future,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-TB4D72K</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:698F-5VM1-DYX4-0021-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

These include some $2.2 billion worth of investment in the decade since 2011 to strengthen our drainage system and the establishment of a coastal and flood protection fund in 2020 with an initial outlay of $5 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Considering the stakes, it could also do more to lean into its climate adaptation strategy by \"front-loading\" the outlays on defensive structures and coping mechanisms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> For instance, shoring up coastal defence is of utmost priority, given the inexorable rise in sea levels as a result of global warming and the low-lying nature of the island. A third of Singapore, including its central business district, is less than 5m above sea level.</p><p> Another priority area is our drainage systems, which need reinforcing to withstand more intense and frequent flash floods.</p><p> Urgent attention too needs to be given to the resilience of our food supplies. Singapore is land scarce and highly dependent on imported food. This makes it vulnerable to shocks arising from crop losses in countries devastated by floods and droughts, not to mention war. Rising global temperatures are a threat to agriculture. For instance, India, currently in the grip of a killer heatwave with temperatures crossing 49 deg C in New Delhi and other places, has slapped restrictions on the export of wheat for fear of shortages ahead.</p><p> Last month, Singapore was hit with the highest temperature recorded since 1983. For densely-built up Singapore, prolonged spells of high temperatures can present health and other problems.</p><p> The government alone cannot do it all in trying to meet the many challenges arising from climate change. Greater collaboration with other stakeholders - business and civil society - is needed. Crucially, coordinated steps with neighbours are also vital for climate solutions.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;WHY SOONER IS BETTER&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Adaptation measures, such as investing in seawalls, protective land reclamation and dykes, are capital intensive and expensive. But these expenditures need to be seen alongside their rewards in the form of damage avoided.</p><p> One example is comparing the cost of constructing a seawall with the even higher losses averted from inundation, not to mention the extra value of enhanced biodiversity if the seawall was designed with that in mind.</p><p> Much of these gains from adaptation are social and environmental, for example in lives and livelihoods saved and biodiversity protected. Protecting beaches and mangrove estuaries can carry a high valuation.</p><p> It is this calculus that implicitly underlies the Government's announcement in 2019 to spend $100 billion over this century to safeguard the island from the impact of climate change. Much of the funds for climate adaptation measures goes to tackling the fallout from rising sea levels. A sum of $400 million spread over two years was set aside to upgrade drainage.</p><p> But are these measures enough? Crucial questions concern Singapore's climate adaptation plan's timing and phasing, composition, and efficiency as well as complementary steps.</p><p> Scientific reports are continuously raising the projected climate damage, one reason being the lacklustre and disappointing progress in climate mitigation globally. So, the authorities need to push the envelope further, in advancing the timing of the investments, sharpening its composition, and taking complementary measures to ensure ecological and financial sustainability.</p><p> One way is to front-load investments, that is, spend more over the next 10 years instead of waiting until the 2040s.</p><p> Clearly, there are trade-offs between investing in climate resilience and reviving the economy from Covid-19. There is merit in being flexible and looking for new technologies to lower adaptation costs. But a reason for front-loading the investments is that it is better to build resistance before the problem gets progressively worse.</p><p> Furthermore, putting a greater weight on the earlier period can also enable gains to be realised earlier and longer.</p><p> The cost of sea level defences is known to increase exponentially; in one assessment for Singapore, it went from US$0.3 million-US$5.7 million (S$416,000 to S$7.9 million) by 2050 to US$0.9 million-US$6.8 million by 2100. In this spirit, immediate outlays, including building the docks of the container terminal at Tuas more than 5m above sea level, are justified. The same could be said for installing additional pumping stations at Marina Barrage that seals off the Singapore River.</p><p> The choice of priorities for climate adaptation matters greatly. As mentioned earlier, coastal defences are vital given Singapore's geography. A project to build a barrier along 21 per cent of South Korea's coastline has shown that the benefits that accrue from building such safeguards in terms of flooding and other damage averted exceed the sizeable investment costs.</p><p> A complementary approach should be to scale up the variety of nature-based solutions that are becoming available. One example is designing seawalls that work together with natural elements such as mangroves to dissipate waves and prevent coastal erosion. It helps that Singapore has experience in nurturing mangroves in Pulau Semakau and Pulau Tekong.</p><p> Interventions are also needed to enable Singapore to withstand more intense rainfall and extreme storms. PUB, the national water agency, has made a solid start by introducing flexibility and adaptability to the drainage system. Beyond deepening and widening drains and canals, its approach incorporates solutions that slow down the flow of stormwater into the drainage system. Adopting this approach is paying off in other countries, including the Netherlands. More such innovative measures should be encouraged.</p><p> It will also be essential to co-opt the private sector and civil society as partners in the Government's efforts. Capital intensive projects, like coastal defences, with long pay-off periods will indeed require the Government's lead, but they, too, should have private sector participation. In smaller scale initiatives, local answers are best derived from societal involvement, be it ways to flood-proof subway stations or the development of green \"sponge\" areas to absorb floodwaters.</p><p> Strong collaboration with business and civil society is also crucial in finding ways to boost food security in land-constrained Singapore. For example, modern farms, such as Sky Greens, are increasingly using new technology to increase food production.</p><p> Finally, Singapore cannot go it alone in climate adaptation. Complementary actions are needed with neighbours to confront rising sea levels, sharing water and trading in clean energy. Tsinghua University projects a one-third drop in gross domestic product in Asean in the event temperatures are allowed to rise to 3.2 deg C by 2048, including from heavy agricultural losses. Singapore cannot avoid economic stress if its neighbours are battered by drought, floods and other effects of climate change. Food supply and tourism are two areas that are likely to be hit.</p><p> The Asean Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response is a modest example of regional cooperation in adaptation. Its plan for 2021-2025 sets out specific ways in which disaster agencies in member countries can better share know-how and resources in the event of floods and typhoons.</p><p> As with Covid-19, the impact of climate change does not respect national boundaries. As such, all members of Asean must step up efforts to come up with measures on shared climate adaptation.</p><p> Vinod Thomas is a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore and former senior vice-president of the World Bank.Euston Quah is Albert Winsemius Chair Professor of Economics, and director of the Economic Growth Centre at Nanyang Technological University. He is also president of the Economic Society of Singapore.</p><p>   Clearly, there are trade-offs between investing in climate resilience and reviving the economy from Covid-19. There is merit in being flexible and looking for new technologies to lower adaptation costs. But a reason for front-loading the investments is that it is better to build resistance before the problem gets progressively worse.

These funding rounds were raised by startups working on various solutions, from alternative protein to food waste.</p><p>During <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon-get-to-know-our-programs-at-the-ecosystem-booth-20230530/\">Echelon Asia Summit 2023</url> , we also learned how leading investors <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon-how-increased-emphasis-on-esg-elements-in-fund-management-will-affect-early-stage-startups-20230606/\">such as Monk's Hill Ventures</url>  have begun putting ESG elements in their consideration of a potential investment, regardless of which sector they are working on.</p><p>Apart from that, we also see <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-radical-fund-hits-first-close-of-us40m-climate-tech-fund-targets-early-stage-sea-startups-20230710/\">new funds</url>  for investments in the climate tech sectors being announced, with companies working on <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/how-circular-can-help-to-reduce-e-waste-through-its-device-subscription-service-20230731/\">different solutions</url>  to mitigate the impact of climate change operating in the market.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/demystifying-the-financial-impacts-of-climate-change-with-intensel-20230725/\">Demystifying the financial impacts of climate change with Intensel</url></p><p>All of this might sound like a great effort to tackle the greatest crisis in our lifetime. But sometimes (often), one might wonder whether we have done enough, whether there are things that are left to do. We might think that we have done and considered all the best solutions, but there is bound to be a blind spot.</p><p>Da-dum.</p><p>(I added sound effects for dramatic effects. And to hit the word count.)</p><p>Now, I understand that this is not a question that we can answer overnight-let alone in a 600-word opinion piece. More importantly, the answer might look different depending on your role in the startup ecosystem. I can only speak from my experience as a writer and editor who has been working in the community for close to a decade.</p><p>Recently, I had the privilege of attending the Sustainability Media Academy held by EB Impact. The two-day event consisted of masterclasses, workshops, and panel discussions on reporting climate change issues for journalists and content creators in SEA. During the event, I had the opportunity to meet and learn from senior journalists and editors about how to tell stories about climate change.</p><p>There are many important lessons learned over the course of two days, but one that stays with me was this line said by senior journalist and media consultant Augustine Anthuvan:</p><p>Reporting climate change is all about people and their needs, not about technology or being green.</p><p>As an editor for a publication that focuses on the startup ecosystem, this hits me deeply. Certainly, in our coverage of climate tech and sustainability, we put focus on the startups and tech solutions that they build to solve the problem. But there is a stakeholder that we have been missing out on: the humans in the story.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/following-fund-completion-eurazeo-aims-to-support-up-and-coming-leaders-in-climate-tech-20230724/\">Following fund completion, Eurazeo aims to support up-and-coming leaders in climate tech</url></p><p>This goes beyond the startup founders and investors that are involved in building and growing the company. The humans here are the people who will be directly impacted by climate change itself, the most vulnerable parts of society -those whom the tech solutions are supposed to benefit the most. Who are these people? What are their challenges? How exactly can climate change (and its solutions) change their lives? What happens when they are missing from the story?

Plastic bag charge. Rising water prices. These were some of the hottest and most significant local environment news stories of the year. Here is a snapshot of five of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 1  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On May 13 in Ang Mo Kio, the mercury spiked to 37 deg C, a temperature not felt in Singapore since 1983. The record heat came just months before El Nino, which brings hotter and drier weather, arrived in the region. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Forest fires in Indonesia's Sumatra, coupled with El Nino and another weather phenomenon called the positive Indian Ocean Dipole, contributed to the return of transboundary haze during a weekend in October. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Oct 7, air quality reached unhealthy levels for the first time since 2019, with the 24-hour Pollutant Standards Index reaching between 67 and 123 at 9pm. </p><p> Why it matters2023 has been the hottest year on record, and the risk of more frequent haze episodes, scorching weather and even heatwaves in Singapore is not far from reality as the world boils. </p><p> Climate change could fuel more intense El Ninos, and people's health will pay the price. A national heat stress advisory was launched in July to help people guard against heat-related illnesses. </p><p>Singapore did not face the full brunt of the haze in 2023 because rainfall soon cleared up the skies. </p><p>Indonesia had also been stepping up enforcement, firefighting and disaster management operations. </p><p> The next period with a higher haze risk will be during the south-west monsoon between June and October 2024. </p><p> 2  </p><p> Since July, most supermarkets have been charging five cents for a plastic bag, in a nationwide push to cut shoppers' reliance on disposables. </p><p> Many people have adapted to the change, with fabric bags and shopping trolleys becoming more of a common sight at shops. </p><p> Within a month of the charge, some supermarkets saw up to an 80 per cent drop in the number of plastic bags used. </p><p> Residents have also been urged to continue bagging their trash with alternatives such as produce bags and food packaging, instead of buying plastic bags. </p><p> Why it mattersThe Republic had, for years, resisted introducing a mandatory charge for plastic bags, but there was a need to nudge Singaporeans away from a disposables-reliant culture. </p><p> Producing plastic bags is also energy-intensive and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> Switching from disposable carrier bags to biodegradable bags was not an option because Singapore's waste is mainly incinerated.</p><p> The plastic bag charge is the first of several efforts to reduce the country's waste and increase its low household recycling rate. </p><p> From April 2025, bottled and canned drinks will cost 10 cents more, but shoppers will get the deposit back once they return the empty cans and plastic bottles for recycling. </p><p> 3  </p><p> Water will soon cost an additional 50 cents per cubic m, starting with a 20-cent increase in April 2024 and a 30-cent rise in April 2025. </p><p> By then, most households will fork out an additional $4 to $9, excluding the goods and services tax (GST), for their monthly water bill. The last water price hike was in 2017.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax will also increase to $25 per tonne of carbon emissions from 2024, up from $5 per tonne now.</p><p> If power generation companies were to pass on the full cost of the carbon tax to consumers, residents of four-room Housing Board flats could fork out $4 more for their monthly utility bills. </p><p> In the first quarter of 2024, households supplied by SP Group will see a 5 per cent increase in electricity tariffs to 32.58 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) after GST, up from 31 cents now.</p><p> Town gas tariffs will also increase by about 4 per cent to 25.23 cents per kWh, up from 24.21 cents per kWh currently. </p><p> But consumers who have standard fixed price plans with electricity retailers will not see any change in their electricity tariffs until they renew their contracts. </p><p> Why it mattersThe upcoming increase comes amid rising living costs, a GST hike and higher transport fares. </p><p> A day after news of the water price hike, the Government announced a $1.1 billion Cost-of-Living Support Package, which includes cash payouts and utilities rebates for Singaporeans and Singaporean households. </p><p> From January 2024 to December 2025, about 950,000 HDB households will receive an additional $20 per quarter in U-Save rebates, amounting to $80 a year. </p><p> Since 2017, the cost of treating and supplying water in Singapore has risen by about 30 per cent. </p><p> Climate advocates have long said that a carbon price of $5 per tonne was too low. The Government said the tax was set at a low price from 2019 to give emitters time to adjust. </p><p> 4 </p><p> Three tracts of land could be reclaimed off East Coast Park in the coming decades, creating about 800ha of land and a new reservoir. </p><p> Called Long Island, these land tracts are about twice the size of Marina Bay. This plan is in response to the threat of rising sea levels and inland flooding in the East Coast area. </p><p> Apart from Long Island, the Government also contemplated building a sea wall up to 3m tall that would stretch from Marina East to Tanah Merah.</p><p> This option turned out to be not ideal, as parkgoers would have limited access to the waterfront when the sea wall is completed. </p><p> Why it mattersLand in the East Coast area is largely less than 5m above the mean sea level, the extent that sea levels are projected to rise to by the end of this century if extreme high tides coincide with storm surges. </p><p> A new reservoir would also help to increase the country's water supply. </p><p> However, experts say measures should be taken from the start to protect sensitive marine habitats in East Coast and the Southern Islands -- less than 10km from the mainland -- against the impacts of Long Island's construction. </p><p> Sea life at East Coast Park -- which includes corals, seagrass and hawksbill turtles -- made a comeback decades after a previous reclamation.  </p><p> 5  </p><p> The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai (COP28) ended on Dec 13 with a deal supported by nearly 200 countries to transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p> This was the first time in nearly 30 years of the annual conference that the final text made a direct reference to fossil fuels. </p><p> To help channel much-needed funding towards greening the region, Singapore has launched a new blended finance initiative and hopes to raise US$5 billion (S$6.6 billion) for it. </p><p> At COP28, Singapore signed an agreement with Papua New Guinea to collaborate on carbon markets, which would allow Singapore firms to buy carbon credits from projects there to offset a small part of their carbon tax. </p><p> Why it matters The summit's final deal remained unsatisfactory for many countries that pushed for a phase-out of fossil fuels. </p><p> But the deal to transition away from the pollutive fuels means that small island states like Singapore could save a little on climate adaptation costs.</p><p>Singapore will not be claiming from a World Bank-hosted fund that compensates countries for the loss and damage from the impacts of climate change.</p><p> Instead, the Republic's roles in climate financing are to help fellow small island states tap the fund, and also channel finance to projects that would otherwise not be profitable, through the blended finance initiative. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-4267S95</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B0B-NJY1-JCF2-812C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1197\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

But this year, more so than any other year within my lifetime, there are people around the world who are suffering in conflict areas and dealing with catastrophic weather events. With so many being forced to flee their countries and the natural world in a fragile state, what could it mean to get into the holiday spirit this year? As we revel in the comfort of our homes with family and friends, I invite those who've been given the gift of privilege to contemplate how your resources can be harnessed to make the world a better place. </p><p>Whether you're curious about starting your giving journey or are an active contributor, here are five lessons I've learnt as a next-gen philanthropist.Finding your purpose takes patience and workDespite how naturally it may come to some, identifying your true calling can take time. As a child, I had the opportunity to witness my father's humanitarian work first-hand. Driven by his passion for helping others and sharing that with us, he would often take us kids out to the field. From the coastlines of the Philippines to the mountains of Thailand, I would trail after him as he interviewed villagers, conversed with aid workers and negotiated with local businesses. I saw how he channelled the fire from his poverty-stricken childhood into work that positively impacted vulnerable communities. And how, despite lacking a university degree, he relied on his resolve and passion to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, support schools and orphanages, and use microfinance as seeds of change.Even after watching my father in the field, it took me nearly eight years of exploring the ocean while scuba diving and free-diving to begin my own journey. I needed to first witness how humans are destroying the ocean and its inhabitants, to then realise that I didn't need to have a degree in marine biology or work in government to contribute towards its protection. It became clear that the only obstacle in the way of exploring the impact I could have was my own self-limiting beliefs.Good philanthropy goes beyond generosityPhilanthropy is often misunderstood as being solely tied to the depth of one's pockets. While it's true that many high-profile philanthropists are wealthy, the essence of philanthropy is far from giving a certain amount, nor is it solely about the money. Originally coined to signify the \"love of humanity\", philanthropy goes beyond generosity and is about the desire to promote the welfare of others or society as a whole. Today, good philanthropy is strategic, addresses root causes, requires commitment and collaboration, and involves systems thinking and risk-taking. True philanthropy begins with humility, and always puts the mission first.My entry into philanthropy independent of my father's started with micro grants, crowdfunding campaigns and leading ocean clean-ups. As a young person upset by the destructive trends of our world, these acts gave me a sense of agency, and the more projects I got involved in and changemakers that I met, the more experience and knowledge I accumulated to consider the wider ecosystem.Always value people and partnershipsIn a way, building relationships with non-profit partners is a bit like dating. You get to know one another, decide whether you want to commit, build an emotional connection, then journey together. And sometimes, as in the world of dating, not all experiences lead to lasting relationships. Reasons vary from misaligned values and ineffective use of funds to lack of impact, governance issues, or simply because the person you worked with in the organisation has left. People form the heart of organisations, and it's important when collaborating with non-profits to build relationships with multiple team members, while emphasising trust and respect. Today's landscape of strategic philanthropy involves engaging with various stakeholders, extending beyond non-profits and their teams to communities, governments, corporates, academia, beneficiaries and other philanthropies. Philanthropists who value people and partnerships in fostering initiatives are in a better position to scale their impact. The role of philanthropy in discovery and experimentationPhilanthropy is often referred to as \"risk capital\", and holds the potential for significant outsized impact. Tackling complex issues demands unconventional approaches and reframing what success looks like. In the realm of philanthropy, capital serves as a tool to bolster impactful programmes that lack financial viability, test innovative and early-stage initiatives that create positive social and environmental benefits, and offer seed funding to emerging entrepreneurs dedicated to solving pressing challenges.Functioning as risk capital, philanthropy assumes a distinct role alongside government and big business to address global challenges. While the size of philanthropic funding may seem insignificant next to other sources, it often has the ability to take risks that others can't, which is why its impact within the ecosystem can be outsized and transformative. The momentum for blended finance opportunities is rising where multiple stakeholders with different risk tolerances invest alongside one another in the same projects. Here, philanthropy serves as a critical catalyst to unlock large volumes of private and public sector funding to scale impactful solutions.Find like-minded communities to amplify your impact I'm grateful to be involved in amazing communities of inspiring practitioners that have helped to accelerate my journey. Two of these are the Asia Philanthropy Circle, a membership platform for Asian philanthropists to jointly grow our impact, and their Climate Collective, a close-knit community of like-minded individuals interested in learning and collaborating on climate action in Asia. With opportunities to discuss challenges and practices, these communities forged by collective dedication have sparked partnerships, nurtured personal growth and refined our giving strategies. Beyond these benefits, they provide access to a reservoir of resources and expertise. Philanthropy can be an emotional journey, so regardless of which communities you join, surrounding yourself with fellow givers not only provides a pillar of support, but also amplifies the impact of one's efforts. Embarking on your philanthropic journey may feel like a daunting task, but our broken world calls for universal collective action. Whether you seek to contribute towards education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, human rights, nature conservation, climate adaptation, animal welfare, the arts, community development, gender equality, disaster relief or the plethora of other challenges we face today, there's so much to be done. The essence of philanthropy lies not in how much we give, but in our commitment to making a difference. As the renowned author and researcher Brene Brown says: \"Leadership is not about titles or the corner office. It's about the willingness to step up, put yourself out there, and lean into courage. The world is desperate for braver leaders.

Ladies and Gentlemen, good evening.<br/><br/>2. I am delighted to join you today, to celebrate the launch of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA).<br/><br/>3. It is remarkable that we have over 150 representatives from diverse sectors gathered here - from the financial sector, corporates, industry bodies, non-governmental organisations, and government bodies. This gathering augurs well for the future of sustainable finance - where we need partnerships and a strong ecosystem of diverse players to support the region's net zero transition.<br/><br/>Singapore: A Leading Centre for Sustainable Finance in Asia<br/><br/>4. Singapore has come a long way in sustainable finance in less than 10 years.<br/><br/>a. In 2015, the Association of Banks in Singapore launched the Guidelines for Responsible Financing.<br/><br/>b. In 2017, we saw the first issuance of a green bond by a Singapore company, City Developments Limited. This was followed by DBS.<br/><br/>c. In 2019, MAS launched the Green Finance Action Plan.<br/><br/>d. And we refreshed the plan last year, with the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan, expanding our focus beyond pure green to include transition finance. This is a recognition that greening the economy goes beyond just financing green activities.<br/><br/>5. Today, Singapore is one of the leading sustainable finance centres serving the net zero transition needs in Asia and beyond.<br/><br/>a. We are ASEAN's largest market for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds and loans. In 2022, more than S$30 billion worth of such bonds and loans were originated from Singapore.<br/><br/>b. We have a vibrant carbon services and trading ecosystem of over 100 firms, the highest concentration in Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>c. We are a key centre for climate risk financing instruments. Catastrophe bond issuances in Singapore totalled S$2.5 billion over 2021 and 2022, more than twice the total from 2018 to 2020.<br/><br/>d. We also house a vibrant sustainable finance research and talent development ecosystem, comprising centres of excellence in our universities, reputable training providers, and at least 20 Asia Pacific sustainability hubs established by financial institutions.<br/><br/>6. Singapore has also stepped up in leading change and seeding solutions. We have shaped standards and guidance, and championed innovative financing approaches for green and transition finance projects, together with international partners.<br/><br/>a. In October last year, MAS was one of the first jurisdictions to propose supervisory expectations for financial institutions to have sound transition planning processes. This can in turn, enable effective climate change mitigation and adaptation measures by their clients.<br/><br/>b. Just last month, we launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, which many of you here contributed substantively to. The taxonomy is the world's first to pioneer the concept of a \"transition\" category, in recognition of Asia's needs. It will direct greater cross-broader capital flows to green and transition activities.<br/><br/>c. MAS also worked with the GFANZ Asia Pacific Network and other international partners to publish the world's first guidance to help financial institutions finance a credible phase-out of coal plants in Asia.<br/><br/>7. These capabilities and initiatives give us a good foundation to build on, to better serve the needs of our region in the transition to net zero. We can strengthen our contributions on three fronts - Standards, Solutions and Skills.<br/><br/>Strengthen Sustainable Finance Growth - Standards, Solutions and Skills<br/><br/>8. First, standards. Clarity and credibility in standards are foundational to a trusted sustainable finance centre. They can mitigate the risk of greenwashing and at the same time, provide greater confidence for capital to be channelled to legitimate green and transition activities.<br/><br/>a. For example, MAS issued guidelines for the disclosure and reporting of ESG retail funds in 2022, and an industry code of conduct for ESG Rating and Data Product Providers last year.<br/><br/>b. We are also working with international organisations such as the International Energy Agency to develop sectoral pathways that are contextualised to circumstances faced in Asia. With clearer science-based and region-contextualised sectoral decarbonisation pathways, financial institutions can develop strategies to capitalise on the financing opportunities.<br/><br/>9. Second, solutions. In mobilising private capital for the net zero transition, we must adopt innovative financing approaches to tackle marginally bankable or currently unbankable projects.<br/><br/>a. Blended finance is key to scale the financing needed for marginally bankable projects and solutions. Together with our partners, we announced a blended finance initiative called Financing Asia's Transition Partnership, to scale the financing for green and transition infrastructure and technologies in the region.<br/><br/>b. The carbon market is another tool to unlock financing. Here, MAS is piloting the concept of transition credits to accelerate the early retirement of coal plants in Asia. We launched the Transition Credits Coalition and two pilot projects last month to explore the unlocks needed for this potential financing avenue to complement other regional financing initiatives.<br/><br/>10. Third, skills. We need a deep pool of skilled and adaptable talent. We must therefore invest in the skills and capabilities of our people and organisations.<br/><br/>Deepening Cross-sector Collaboration through SSFA<br/><br/>a. MAS, the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) and Workforce Singapore have embarked on a Jobs Transformation Map to study the impact of sustainability on our financial sector workforce.<br/><br/>b. Preliminary findings suggest that most of the jobs must be augmented by upskilling to support changes in regulations, products, and processes to better serve their clients. In addition, new and highly specialised roles such as sustainability risk analysts, will be created.<br/><br/>c. We will share our detailed findings, and just as importantly, the key initiatives by the MAS and IBF to support the sector's upskilling, in April.<br/><br/>11. To make a difference through standards, solutions and skills, the financial sector and industry will need to come together to collaborate and leverage the deep expertise that resides in each domain.<br/><br/>12. The Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA) will be a key platform to achieve this.<br/><br/>a. In setting standards, SSFA can lead in developing industry best practices in areas such as carbon credits trading and transition finance. You will have a crucial role in channelling the industry's perspectives as standards continue to evolve.<br/><br/>b. In driving innovative solutions, SSFA can bring together financial institutions and industry sectors to identify more integrated approaches to address barriers in scaling the financing needed. For example, it can combine financing solutions from different asset classes, including risk mitigation tools, to improve the bankability of projects. This applies not only in climate mitigation, but also in financing less bankable projects related to climate adaptation and biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>c. In developing skills, SSFA can contribute to upskilling and capacity building initiatives by guiding the relevance of sustainable finance courses. This includes training courses offered by Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) and other training providers. In tandem, SSFA can also promote the take-up of IBF's skills certification schemes, and organise capacity building workshops in areas not readily offered by the training providers. For example, carbon markets, taxonomy application and blended finance.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>13. Sustainable finance is a key thrust of Singapore's development as a leading international financial centre. We have made a good start and are on a promising trajectory.<br/><br/>14. Let us continue to strengthen partnerships across the financial sector and with industry to support the region's low-carbon transition. The SSFA will be instrumental in coordinating this.<br/><br/>15. Everyone here today has something to offer.<br/><br/>a. Financial institutions, businesses, academia, government agencies - bringing financial or scientific know-how, decarbonisation solutions or needed funding.<br/><br/>16. I look forward to the SSFA playing a key role in galvanising partnerships and collective efforts to shape the future sustainable finance landscape for years to come.<br/><br/>17.

Please allow me to express condolences to those affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake which occurred at the start of the year. Given the fortitude and resilience of the Japanese people, I am confident that those affected by the earthquake will recover from this stronger than before.</p><p>I had the honor of addressing the 16th JSS held in Singapore last year. It is a pleasure to be here in Tokyo to speak at this distinguished gathering again. I would like to say a few words in Japanese to express my appreciation to our Japanese friends.Thank you for inviting me to the 17th Japan - Singapore Symposium. I am happy to be able to come to Tokyo during the wonderful season when cherry blossoms bloom. (Translation: Thank you for inviting me to the 17th JSS . I am happy to be here in Tokyo, especially during this wonderful season of cherry blossoms.)</p><p>Let me also wish to express appreciation for the service of the former Singapore co-chair of the JSS, Ambassador Tommy Koh. He has made many contributions to Singapore-Japan relations over the years, including as the first and longest co-chair of the JSS since its inception in 1995. However, just as the sakura bloom beckons the coming of spring and new beginnings, this year we have Singapore's former Ambassador to US, Mr Ashok Mirpuri, as our new co-chair. I have every confidence that Ashok will build on the good work by Ambassador Koh, and advance Singapore-Japan relations further through his co-chairmanship of the JSS.</p><p>Apart from having a new co-chair, this year's JSS is special for another reason. This is the first time in five years that the JSS is being held in-person in Japan. This is an excellent opportunity to reconnect with our Japanese friends and also to reach out to the wider Japanese public and deepen mutual understanding between our two countries. I look forward to the discussion on how we can strengthen bilateral cooperation and work together regionally and globally on issues of common interest.</p><p>International Outlook</p><p>The theme of this year's JSS is \"Japan-Singapore Partnership in the Regional Architecture\". It is apt and timely. This is because the world is facing a host of interconnected challenges: strategic rivalry between the US and China; the Russia-Ukraine war; the Israel-Hamas conflict; climate change; and rapid advancement in technology, particularly in bioscience and AI. These are technological changes that require strong governance. These challenges mean that we require strong governance to deal with the accompanying risks and to ensure that the benefits are distributed fairly among economies that are already grappling with inequality and challenges to a rules-based multilateral trading system. And the list of challenges goes on.</p><p>What Japan and Singapore can do together in shaping and supporting regional architecture must be informed by our appreciation and analysis of these challenges. Among them, I would like to focus on one key challenge - the state of relations between the US and China.</p><p>The relationship between the US and China is the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world with broad implications on global security and prosperity, and an outsized impact on regional stability in Asia. Tensions appear to have eased somewhat in recent months, which is a positive sign. We are encouraged that the US and China have continued to demonstrate commitment to maintaining open lines of communication and managing their relations responsibly. But this is a journey that inevitably will be challenging and comes with twists and turns. I am sure many of you will be familiar and would have noticed the recent passage of a bill in the US with serious implications on Tiktok's operations and possibly ownership. This points to the fact that fundamental divergences remain. There is still a dearth of strategic trust between both sides. In the absence of trust, both sides will only assume the worst of each other, and this can lead to miscalculation over various flashpoints and fuel escalation. This is especially worrying for both Japan and Singapore given that both our countries have valuable and broad-ranging relations with the US as well with China, and because I believe we share the view that a world in which the US and China can co-exist peacefully and work together constructively is a safer and a more prosperous environment for us.</p><p>Our region has been fortunate to have benefited from a long period of relative peace and security since the end of the Vietnam War. One of the key enablers for this has been the US' sustained presence and leadership in Asia-Pacific. At the same time, our region has also seen significant economic growth and development, including the emergence of China as the world's second largest economy and more broadly, the rise of Asia's share of the global economy, which is remarkable in being an epochal transformation that took place amidst relatively little friction. As the rest of the world becomes much more divided and dangerous, the question is whether the long and sustained period of relative peace we have enjoyed in the Asia-Pacific can endure. If the US and China are able to cooperate in areas of common interest even as they compete in other areas, this will help to address a range of security challenges. This includes the conflicts I have mentioned earlier that are raging further afield as well as potential flashpoints like Taiwan, the East and South China Seas, and the situation on the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>In the area of prosperity, the world also needs new engines of growth and innovation to solve the challenges posed by ageing societies, inequality and climate change. Societies like Singapore and Japan, which are economically mature and also aging rapidly, experience the most pressing concerns. It is projected that those aged 65 or older will account for about 35% percent of Japan's population in 2040 while 25% of Singapore's population will be over the age of 65 by 2030. Productivity growth would have to pull more and more weight in order to maintain a good standard of living for our populations since workforce growth will be limited or even negative and with older consumer populations that have greater care needs and demands but are also more price-sensitive. A well-oiled and properly functioning multilateral trading system with as few barriers as possible coupled with flexible, resilient supply chains that reflect true comparative advantages becomes even more meaningful than ever, because we need them for sustained access to competitively priced consumer goods and services. So what can be done?</p><p>Leading economies should be pooling together their resources, and jointly focusing attention to maximise the opportunities of technology breakthroughs, for example, in AI, as well as the establishment of sound governance frameworks to minimise risks and ensure that benefits are fairly and evenly spread. And also, to arrest the trend towards a more fragmented and decoupled global system to ensure that the global supply chains are strengthened while the trading system is kept free, open and rules-based so that as many as possible can benefit. Any departure from this would mean a less prosperous and more divided world.</p><p>Japan-Singapore Partnership</p><p>This is the backdrop against which Singapore and Japan can work together to build a stronger and more stable regional architecture for a secure and prosperous future. Let me offer three recommendations for consideration.</p><p>One, given our convergence of strategic outlook and shared commitment to upholding an open and rules-based multilateral trading system, we should further strengthen our close cooperation at multilateral and regional fora. We are both members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). We also work closely at the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In fact, our countries, together with Australia, are co-convenors of the Joint Statement Initiative (JSI) on E-Commerce at the WTO. We achieved substantial conclusion of a package of global digital trade rules last year, and we hope to conclude negotiations on the JSI in 2024. I hope that continued joint efforts to strengthen multilateralism and the rules-based global order will lead to a stronger, more stable and inclusive regional architecture as well.</p><p>Two, to enhance our cooperation in the context of ASEAN-Japan relations. Japan has been a steadfast and trusted partner to the region for many decades. We thank Japan for its consistent support for ASEAN Centrality. 2023 marked a major milestone for ASEAN-Japan relations as we celebrated our 50th anniversary and upgraded relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Singapore is honoured to be taking over as country coordinator for ASEAN-Japan relations this July, for the next three years. We look forward to the further strengthening of Japan's ties with ASEAN and its contribution to the regional architecture as outlined in the 2023 ASEAN-Japan Vision Statement. Singapore believes that Japan has much to contribute to regional security cooperation based on a stable, open and inclusive regional and international order. We should also work together in other areas of mutual interest such as upgrading the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP) Agreement, concluding an ASEAN-Japan Air Services Agreement, and implementing tangible projects under the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo Pacific (AOIP).</p><p>Three, while Singapore and Japan already enjoy excellent and multifaceted relations, there remains much scope for us to do more. We share mutual interests on issues such as the future economy, climate change and sustainability, and energy transition. Over the years, our economic ties have been underpinned by the 2002 Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement (JSEPA), which was Japan's first ever Free Trade Agreement and Singapore's first with a major trading partner. As the JSEPA entered into force more than 20 years ago, we should explore how we can keep this agreement relevant and updated for our businesses, including by working together on the digital economy.</p><p>On climate change and sustainability, we should work towards implementing concrete initiatives arising from the August 2023 Joint Statement on climate and environmental cooperation; and Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) on climate science and climate adaptation. On energy transition, Singapore congratulates Japan for hosting a successful Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) Leaders' Summit in December, which Prime Minister Lee attended. There is much that we can do together on decarbonisation. The MOC on the establishment of a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor signed in December 2023 is one concrete example. We can also explore joint research and development on low-carbon technologies and collaboration to facilitate high integrity carbon markets aligned to the Paris Agreement such as the Article 6 Implementation Partnership initiated by Japan.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, Singapore and Japan will mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations in 2026, which is a very significant milestone, as State Minister Tsuge had noted just now. We look forward to working closely with Japan to commemorate this anniversary not just in form but also in substance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The JSS has always been a symbol of the enduring bonds and collaboration between our two countries. In a time where profound and pressing challenges are facing our region in general, and our two countries in particular, fora such as JSS have never been more necessary. I hope that the discussion today will yield constructive ideas and insights to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation and the regional architecture. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063843337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BJM-S701-DXMP-K11W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2177\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 15, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp; FOREIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp; CONVENTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120JM</classCode><className>EMBASSIES &amp; CONSULATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000546</classCode><className>EARTHQUAKES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The draft proposal will be decided at COP28. There has, however, been contention over the World Bank's proposed role as host, and over the lack of specifics on the fund's size and who must contribute.While most South-east Asian states were relatively quiet on this issue last year, Nithi Nesadurai, director and regional coordinator at environmental non-profit Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the region's representatives are starting to get behind it given that the region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change.Carbon marketsWhile progress was made at COP27 on the Article 6 rulebook addressing double counting in carbon markets, other issues remain unresolved. </p><p>These include the treatment of legacy credits from the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol - the predecessor to the current Paris Agreement.Frederick Teo, chief executive of decarbonisation investment platform GenZero, said private sector investors are seeking clarity around both the demand of carbon credits - what the credits can be used for - and supply - what are accepted as high-quality credits.\"If you look at the recent turbulence in the carbon markets, it is all about people questioning whether or not this has impact or no impact, right? Now, (investors) are just allocating capital and investing into things. So actually, it is up to some of these multilateral organisations and governments to tell us what are the rules,\" Teo said.Echoing similar sentiments, Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors are looking forward to the resolution of\u00c2\u00a0global carbon market rules, which will further accelerate the shift in global capital towards zero-carbon projects and provide developing economies in Asia with potential revenue opportunities in green industries and infrastructure.Mitigation and just transitionHaving a clear mitigation target will help catalyse private sector investments, said Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser for global climate adaptation policy at environmental non-profit WWF\u00c2\u00a0International, although he acknowledged politics often get in the way.The outcome from the global stocktake will inform how much countries have to accelerate climate action when they submit their new climate plans - called nationally determined contributions - by 2025. If countries raise their ambitions, it would provide a signal to private investors.Central to the issue of mitigation is the use of fossil fuels. A longstanding sticking point in the final decision text of previous COPs has been whether the use of fossil fuel would be \"phased down\" versus the more ambitious \"phased out\", and it looks like this will continue at COP28.Investors are keen to see more resolve from governments on tackling the issue of fossil fuel dependence, said Viswamohanan. Expectations are slim that \"phasing out\" will take hold this year, though, especially considering COP is hosted and led this year by an oil-rich nation.COP28 president-designate Sultan Al Jaber had previously called for a \"responsible phase-down of fossil fuels\".While the phasing out of fossil fuels is not likely, the COP28 presidency's earlier call for governments to treble renewables capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030 is gaining momentum among many governments. Al Jaber has set a target of installing 11,000 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030, which would mean a trebling of the 3,629 GW\u00c2\u00a0installed\u00c2\u00a0by the end of 2022.There is also greater recognition of the need for a \"just transition\", which refers to minimising the economic and social fallout arising from a country's energy transition.The just transition work programme was established at COP27 and it will have its first high-level ministerial roundtable at COP28.All eyes will also be on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) inked between Indonesia and a group of developed countries comprising mostly the Group of Seven countries almost a year ago. The investment plan for the US$20 billion climate deal was just released a week before COP28 and updates to the first transactions under the JETP may be announced at the event.Scaling climate financeDiscussions are ongoing to increase the amount of money developed countries have to provide to developing countries to address their climate needs. Currently set at US$100 billion per year, it is set to increase after 2025 and COP28 will lay the groundwork for establishing a new climate finance goal. Beyond government-to-government financing, an increasing focus is the mobilisation of private-sector capital for climate transition projects.Viswamohanan said investors are looking for government climate commitments that are more robust and more ambitious.\"These high-level commitments on targets would be integral to unlock the capital that Asean requires to facilitate energy transition,\" she added.GenZero's Teo added that there is a need to shift away from viewing developed countries' financing towards developing countries as donor aid.Instead, these funds could be provided to impact-investment managers to generate commercial returns beyond merely environmental and social impact. The economic returns can then be recycled and channelled to another country.Nesadurai said South-east Asian countries should organise a high-level ministers meeting after each COP to discuss the outcome's implications on the region, and the positive actions they can take as a whole to facilitate investment flows. Decisions made at COP can then be sent directly to the Asean secretariat for implementation.This is because Asean is not represented as a bloc at COP, with the region broken up into several other negotiating blocs. Singapore, for example, is part of the Alliance of Small Island States, while Indonesia and Malaysia are part of the Group of 77 countries.Said Nesadurai: \"We have the infrastructure. Yet we are all in different blocks being dictated to by the priorities of other countries, some very large, some very small. So, we don't have an identity of our own.\"Follow The Business Times' coverage of COP28 at bt.sg/cop28</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>COP28 will also conclude the first-ever global stocktake - a two-year endeavour to assess the progress governments have made in cutting emissions, and make recommendations on what more needs to be done.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RR-JT81-JCF2-8004-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1192\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The draft proposal will be decided at COP28. There has, however, been contention over the World Bank's proposed role as host, and over the lack of specifics on the fund's size and who must contribute.</p><p> While most South-east Asian states were relatively quiet on this issue last year, Nithi Nesadurai, director and regional coordinator at environmental non-profit Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the region's representatives are starting to get behind it given that the region is one of the most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p> Carbon marketsWhile progress was made at COP27 on the Article 6 rulebook addressing double counting in carbon markets, other issues remain unresolved. These include the treatment of legacy credits from the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol -- the predecessor to the current Paris Agreement.</p><p> Frederick Teo, chief executive of decarbonisation investment platform GenZero, said private sector investors are seeking clarity around both the demand of carbon credits -- what the credits can be used for -- and supply -- what are accepted as high-quality credits.</p><p> \"If you look at the recent turbulence in the carbon markets, it is all about people questioning whether or not this has impact or no impact, right? Now, (investors) are just allocating capital and investing into things. So actually, it is up to some of these multilateral organisations and governments to tell us what are the rules,\" Teo said.</p><p> Echoing similar sentiments, Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, said investors are looking forward to the resolution of global carbon market rules, which will further accelerate the shift in global capital towards zero-carbon projects and provide developing economies in Asia with potential revenue opportunities in green industries and infrastructure.</p><p> Mitigation and just transitionHaving a clear mitigation target will help catalyse private sector investments, said Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser for global climate adaptation policy at environmental non-profit WWF International, although he acknowledged politics often get in the way.</p><p> The outcome from the global stocktake will inform how much countries have to accelerate climate action when they submit their new climate plans -- called nationally determined contributions -- by 2025. </p><p> If countries raise their ambitions, it would provide a signal to private investors.</p><p> Central to the issue of mitigation is the use of fossil fuels. A longstanding sticking point in the final decision text of previous COPs has been whether the use of fossil fuel would be \"phased down\" versus the more ambitious \"phased out\", and it looks like this will continue at COP28.</p><p> Investors are keen to see more resolve from governments on tackling the issue of fossil fuel dependence, said Viswamohanan. Expectations are slim that \"phasing out\" will take hold this year, though, especially considering COP is hosted and led this year by an oil-rich nation.</p><p> COP28 president-designate Sultan Al Jaber had previously called for a \"responsible phase-down of fossil fuels\".</p><p> While the phasing out of fossil fuels is not likely, the COP28 presidency's earlier call for governments to treble renewables capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030 is gaining momentum among many governments. Al Jaber has set a target of installing 11,000 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030, which would mean a trebling of the 3,629 GW installed by the end of 2022.</p><p> There is also greater recognition of the need for a \"just transition\", which refers to minimising the economic and social fallout arising from a country's energy transition.</p><p> The just transition work programme was established at COP27 and it will have its first high-level ministerial roundtable at COP28.</p><p> All eyes will also be on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) inked between Indonesia and a group of developed countries comprising mostly the Group of Seven countries almost a year ago. The investment plan for the US$20 billion climate deal was just released a week before COP28 and updates to the first transactions under the JETP may be announced at the event.</p><p> Scaling climate financeDiscussions are ongoing to increase the amount of money developed countries have to provide to developing countries to address their climate needs. Currently set at US$100 billion per year, it is set to increase after 2025 and COP28 will lay the groundwork for establishing a new climate finance goal. </p><p> Beyond government-to-government financing, an increasing focus is the mobilisation of private-sector capital for climate transition projects.</p><p> Viswamohanan said investors are looking for government climate commitments that are more robust and more ambitious. \"These high-level commitments on targets would be integral to unlock the capital that Asean requires to facilitate energy transition,\" she added.</p><p> GenZero's Teo added that there is a need to shift away from viewing developed countries' financing towards developing countries as donor aid.</p><p> Instead, these funds could be provided to impact-investment managers to generate commercial returns beyond merely environmental and social impact.

V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].<br/><br/>2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.<br/><br/>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gas emission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.<br/><br/>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century<br/><br/>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.<br/><br/>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years, Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century.<br/><br/>Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier<br/><br/>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fall significantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every three years. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.<br/><br/>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise<br/><br/>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels.<br/><br/>Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change<br/><br/>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.<br/><br/>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient. Details of the Government's current climate adaptation efforts can be found in Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/latest-climate-projections-for-singapore-show-intensifying-urban-heat-and-more-wet-dry-extremes\">https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/latest-climate-projections-for-singapore-show-intensifying-urban-heat-and-more-wet-dry-extremes</url>).<br/><br/>11.MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.<br/><br/>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR) Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.<br/><br/>13.

In Asia-Pacific (Apac), however, infrastructure means much more. It is an asset class with real growth potential, underpinned by structural tailwinds of decarbonisation, digitalisation and rising prosperity of the middle class. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In particular, Apac's demographics and growth dynamics will drive demand for transport and technology infrastructure. Healthcare infrastructure also faces strong prospects as consumers increasingly prioritise healthcare spending and populations grow older.</p><p> More broadly, the region will also need sizeable investments in industrials, utilities, waste management, renewables, data centres, education services, airports, highways and railways. Developing Asia alone will require an estimated US$1.7 trillion of annual infrastructure investment to sustain its economic development and enhance climate adaptation and mitigation, according to the Asian Development Bank. </p><p> Historically, institutional investors have accessed infrastructure assets mainly through private assets, both equity and credit. Unfortunately, this is increasingly challenging with private asset valuations reaching high multiples amid rising competition from sovereign, pension, infrastructure and private equity funds. Listed infrastructure stocks now trade at effective discounts of 30-40 per cent to private infrastructure assets, while offering comparable long-term returns. </p><p> Compelling possibilities  in public marketsThus, listed investors can have access to similar cash flows with better liquidity (allowing investors to manage their cash-flow needs) and lower operating costs versus comparable private assets.</p><p> There is certainly no dearth of choice when it comes to listed infrastructure stocks across Apac. Total market capitalisation easily exceeds US$1 trillion today and is growing rapidly. The universe of infrastructure stocks includes Australia, New Zealand, mainland China, Hong Kong, India and Taiwan, with an increasing share also originating from the fast-growing South-east Asia economies.</p><p> To illustrate the breadth of opportunities in this area, we need only look at a handful of examples from different regions and sectors. </p><p> New Zealand's leading generator of geothermal electricity is on track to deliver over 20 per cent compound annual growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation and a dividend yield of over 4 per cent over the next three years. </p><p> In India, a leading listed infrastructure trust comprising 46 grid transmission lines is delivering sustainable dividend yield of about 10 per cent, with historically low price volatility relative to the broader market. </p><p> In China, a toll road operator in the country's most prosperous province, where traffic is now materially higher than before the Covid pandemic, trades at just seven times earnings and a 7 per cent dividend yield, even though the company has never reduced its dividend per share for the past 25 years. </p><p>Indonesia's dominant mobile tower company is on track to grow net profits by over 16 per cent annually and deliver a dividend yield of over 3 per cent over the next three years, while boasting a markedly under-levered balance sheet.</p><p> Listed infrastructure assets sit somewhere near the middle of the risk-return spectrum, with limited earnings volatility because they generally provide essential services and face limited competition. </p><p> Investors can choose to compile portfolios with assets that are higher and lower on the risk curve.</p><p> Mature infrastructure providers, such as regulated utilities, and electricity or gas transmission and distribution companies, display relatively lower potential risk and returns. Such investment returns are dominated by yield, while capital growth is generally more modest. </p><p> For a slightly higher potential risk and reward, investors can pursue pro-cyclical infrastructure assets, such as airports, seaports and toll roads. These are recovering at different paces following the pandemic, and should provide returns through a mix of cash yield and capital growth.</p><p> Emerging social infrastructure -- which includes healthcare, retirement and education facilities -- is also set to benefit immensely from Asia's growth story and demographic trends. As these companies are investing cash flow into capital expenditures to drive future growth, this category of listed infrastructure usually offers higher return profiles but less dividend yield. </p><p> In Apac, investors can also balance their portfolios between developed and emerging markets to suit their risk appetite. </p><p> Emerging markets such as India, China and Indonesia are set for considerably stronger economic growth in the coming years than the global average, accompanied by a boom in mass affluence, creating robust demand for various types of infrastructure and driving returns higher. </p><p> Lower risk profileInfrastructure assets in the region's developed markets of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong benefit from their lower risk profile. This is an important consideration when investing in regulated businesses, where investors need strong government institutions and rule of law to generate stable returns.</p><p> This breadth and diversity explains why major investors are now looking beyond the private markets to take a view on infrastructure trends. As a defensive way to ride on key structural themes, such as energy transition, aspiring middle class, mobility, digitalisation and ageing, listed infrastructure in Asia-Pacific is hard to overlook. </p><p> The writer is a portfolio manager at Tribeca Asian Infrastructure Fund</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Asia-Pacific will need sizable investments in industrials, utilities, waste management, renewables, data centres, education services, airports, highways and railways.

He has been a principal investigator for the multi-institute Cooling Singapore initiative since 2017, and leads interdisciplinary research on how Singapore's urban climate risks will change as its climate warms. </p><p> The elections of various top positions were held from Tuesday and are expected to conclude on Friday in Kenya's capital of Nairobi.</p><p> In a Linkedin Post on Thursday, Prof Chow said that he was honoured to have been elected.</p><p> \"I have never shaken so many hands in my life before -- but I guess it is a testament to the strong faith many countries have in my capacity to lead this body in assessing global climate change impacts and adaptation over the next several years,\" he added.</p><p> He stressed that solutions to the climate crisis cannot be \"ad hoc or piecemeal\", and that successful climate resilience that strengthens global climate action requires inclusivity and collaboration both within and beyond the IPCC community.</p><p> Congratulating Prof Chow, Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Facebook: \"With his experience, I am confident that he will serve the IPCC well.</p><p> \"A/P Chow will contribute towards a better understanding of the impact of climate change, and the continued development of resilient climate adaptation solutions.\" </p><p> Prof Chow will work with Professor Bart van den Hurk from the Netherlands, his fellow co-chair.</p><p> The IPCC's work continues to guide the global community, especially developing countries, in their environmental response. Singapore also takes reference from the panel's Seventh Assessment Report's (AR7) findings in refining the Singapore Green Plan 2030, said Ms Fu. </p><p> Prof Chow will also work closely with British Professor Jim Skea, the newly elected chair of the IPCC Bureau, in shaping the work of AR7, which will inform global climate action, she said.</p><p> Prof Chow had said on Saturday that in an increasingly climate-vulnerable world, human and natural systems face more adaptation challenges, especially communities that did the least to contribute to climate change. </p><p> Many are facing the worst risks arising from its impacts, he noted.</p><p> This underscores the need for a strong IPCC Working Group II assessment in order to enable the right adaptation approaches, reduce risk and help enhance climate resilience, he added.</p><p> The IPCC is divided into three working groups and a task force, and publishes reports every six to seven years to ensure that the scientific aspects of climate change are continually updated according to the latest available data. It is now in the seventh assessment cycle. </p><p> Each report comprises content from three working groups. Aside from Working Group II, Working Group I looks at the physical aspects of climate change, such as temperature rise, while Working Group III focuses on ways to mitigate climate change.</p><p> There are also special reports that zero in on particular issues, such as the ocean and its related ecosystems, as well as the links between climate change and land. </p><p> Each working group has two co-chairs -- one from a developing country and the other from a developed country -- with 15 vice-chairs across all three working groups. </p><p> The Ministry for Sustainability and the Environment said in April that it had nominated Prof Chow for the post, given his extensive experience in the field. </p><p> It noted that the IPCC had decided to include a Special Report on Cities and Climate Change in the AR7 cycle, an area where he has done extensive research and field work. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As a developing country co-chair, Associate Professor Winston Chow, a climate change scientist, will contribute to the IPCC Working Group II, which focuses on climate change impact and adaptation measures.

This tracks well compared with other segments, given that OCBC's green and sustainable finance loans made up 9 per cent of total loans.</p><p> Giving the update two years into the launch of its SME sustainable financing framework on Tuesday (Nov 15), Goh said the growth accompanies a three times rise in the number of SMEs taking up this option with the bank on the year, to over 600 SMEs.</p><p> About 500 of the lot are Singapore SMEs, which are set to make up some 80 per cent of the S$3 billion in green and sustainability-linked loans issued. About half of these loans relate to the built environment, and another quarter relate to renewables and energy efficiency, Goh pointed out.</p><p> The rest is derived from OCBC's ventures into Malaysia and Hong Kong. In Malaysia, renewable energy, particularly solar, was the top sector, with potential for growth seen in climate adaptation projects, in light of its government's flood mitigation efforts. Built environment projects drew more traction among Hong Kong SMEs.</p><p> Generally, the figures show some \"good momentum\" in the take-up of sustainable financing from SMEs, signalling a growing adoption of sustainability into business strategies and operations beyond mere awareness, Goh told reporters.</p><p> This is a marked change from just 12 months ago when sustainability was thought of more as a \"good-to-have\", with SMEs mainly motivated to transition because of compliance requirements, he added.</p><p> When the framework was launched in November 2020, OCBC had said it was to make it simpler and less costly for Singapore SMEs to access sustainable financing of up to S$20 million. This works, in part, by allowing the SMEs to \"pre-qualify\" for a loan if they passed the hoops to qualify for a sustainability-related government grant.</p><p> Goh on Tuesday said this mechanism is important as SMEs continue to struggle with having the time and the funding to get their green projects accredited. \"Truth be told, the world over, the number of consultants and service providers available to help all the big companies is not even sufficient. Leave alone to say, the number of firms who specialise or focus on serving the SMEs, this is even less,\" he added.</p><p> To capitalise on the momentum, Goh said OCBC will refine the framework to broaden access to sustainable finance to support a bigger spectrum of businesses. The framework currently covers nine sectors, with the ninth category -- climate adaptation -- added in December last year. </p><p> OCBC will also embark on more industry partnerships to extend more self-help emissions measurement and reporting tools to SMEs to help them capture data and benchmark, he said. </p><p> One such partnership with the Building and Construction Authority had led to the formation of a tool that makes it simpler and more convenient to predict and improve the energy performance of property projects and facilities, providing assessments within minutes, Goh said. Precision engineering and aerospace company Coway Engineering &amp; Marketing is a client that had utilised the tool in its application for a green commercial property loan with OCBC, he noted.</p><p> OCBC also partnered the Global Compact Network Singapore, the local chapter of the United Nations Global Compact, to create a carbon and emissions recording tool, which allows companies to compute their emissions data on energy, water and waste, and use the information to guide their plans on emissions reductions. </p><p> The bank could use such data to finance capability building or decarbonisation investments, innovations and projects, and in turn extend green loans to more businesses targeting to shrink their carbon footprint, Goh said. Engineering services company Dyna-Mac Holdings is one such client that used this tool to apply for a sustainability-linked loan with OCBC, he revealed.</p><p> With these pieces in place, Goh is also looking to grow the sustainability-linked loan segment of its sustainability financing business with SMEs. Green loans, where the momentum generally is at the moment, are asset or services-based, while sustainability-linked loans require consistent measurement and tracking of targets like carbon emissions and water consumption, he explained.</p><p> \"By opening up conversations around sustainability-linked loans, we can help SMEs shift their entire business operations towards more sustainable models, beyond just green assets,\" Goh said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Linus Goh, OCBC's head of global commercial banking, says the bank is seeing some \"good momentum\" in the take-up of sustainable financing from SMEs, signalling a growing adoption of sustainability into business strategies and operations beyond mere awareness.
