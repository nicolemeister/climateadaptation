Public-private partnerships for digital learning, consultancy services for energy efficiency, and the development of a \"small and medium enterprise cluster park\" focused on agriculture were among the investment white spaces identified.\"The market intelligence generated by the map will guide private-sector investors looking to invest sustainably, profitably, and with the confidence that the sectors identified respond to the national development priorities,\" UNDP Cambodia resident representative Alissar Chaker said in a press statement at the time.Said Janette Hall, director of investment funds and special initiatives division at the Asian Development Bank: \"The UNDP platform will become particularly valuable from an Asian perspective, when it expands to reflect a growing range of opportunities in the region.\"She noted that emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific \"are less developed\", with fewer publicly listed companies and lower ESG disclosure rules.\"However, Asia offers ample opportunities for scaling up ESG investments and financing in climate-related sectors such as renewable energy,\" she told BT.Other sectors that she cited include green infrastructure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as transport and the built environment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as agri-business, health, education, and small-business financing.She also noted that \"there is significant room for expansion\" in ESG-related exchange traded funds (ETFs) for emerging Asia, given how mutual funds and ETFs let investors of all sizes \"easily gain exposure to balanced portfolios of listed ESG-related stocks\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has identified East and South-east Asia as amongst the fastest-growing regions for impact investments.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66C6-8V81-DYX4-0007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

We will not rest on our laurels, and will strive to stay ahead of the curve by doing a lot more in this relatively nascent area of investing.\"</p><p> The company's sustainability strategy is expressed through five focus areas: Being a Responsible Investor, an Accelerator of Net Zero, an Innovator for Green &amp; Good, and Building a Sustainability-Embedded Culture. </p><p> Underpinning these priorities is the company's robust foundation in governance and risk management practices.</p><p> \"We believe that collective action on all areas will allow us to address environmental and social challenges more effectively, while supporting the creation of business value concurrently,\" explains Mr Chia.</p><p> Taking meaningful actionSinglife has wasted no time in realising its sustainability ambitions since starting on this journey. </p><p> Within a year, the company became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Sustainable Insurance (UN PSI), set an ambitious target to become a net zero emissions business by 2050, and published its inaugural climate-related financial disclosure report.</p><p> This is aligned with recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) formed by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that seeks to strengthen and protect global financial markets from systemic risks such as climate change. </p><p> \"These associations provide Singlife with the guidance to adopt best practices and demonstrate our sustainability commitment,\" says Mr Chia.</p><p> Mr Chia was appointed a member of the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC) set up last year by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and Singapore Exchange Regulation to provide recommendations on the way forward for sustainability reporting in Singapore. </p><p> In addition, Mr Rosenkilde serves on the International Advisory Council for Climate Impact X -- a global marketplace, auctions and exchange platform for trusted carbon credits -- jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek.</p><p> Singlife's sustainability efforts have extended to its customer solutions. The company has launched several ESG-related products including electric vehicle insurance, rainfall protection cover for travellers, and green logistics fleet insurance under MAS' Project Greenprint.</p><p> Investing responsiblySinglife seeks to safeguard the future not only through its insurance business, but also the way it invests. </p><p> The company is of the view that the value, risks, and returns of a business which are increasingly impacted by ESG factors, must be considered carefully to achieve long-term and sustained value for all its stakeholders.</p><p> In particular, Singlife is working to reduce the contribution from its financed emissions in order to achieve its net zero emissions target by 2050. To do so, the firm is investing in environmentally responsible companies and solutions that support the transition to a greener economy. </p><p> The company is also an advocate for the \"just transition\" approach, where social implications such as employment, human rights, and inclusion are also considered as it seeks to decarbonise its portfolios.</p><p> Singlife has committed over S$500 million towards sustainable investments as at the end of December 2022. </p><p> These include investments in sustainable funds such as the Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners -- Green Credit Fund, Qblue Balanced -- Global Sustainable Leaders, BlackRock -- Decarbonization Partners, Singapore Government Green Infrastructure Bond, and the Altrium Sustainability Fund I, launched by Azalea Investment Management and coseeded by Singlife and sponsor, the Azalea Group, an indirect subsidiary of Temasek.</p><p> The company's investment approach is guided by internationally recognised principles and standards, such as the UN PSI, United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Singapore Stewardship Principles. </p><p> Singlife has appointed a sustainability data provider, Matter, to better measure the impact and performance of its global investments. In particular, the company seeks to understand how aligned its portfolio is with the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and establish a baseline against which it can track its ESG progress.</p><p> Singlife's ESG activities go beyond its business to encompass the communities it operates in. To this end, it has been actively giving back through a variety of initiatives. </p><p> In 2022, the company planted 100 trees in support of Singapore's National Parks Board's OneMillionTrees initiative, and has pledged to plant another 1,500 trees over the next five years to mitigate climate change and promote biodiversity. </p><p> Beyond that, the company is helping to shape lives for the better. Singlife is working with organisations such as Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities to run financial literacy programmes supporting individuals and their families in making informed financial decisions.</p><p> Singlife has also tied up with charity TomoWork, where its employees mentor students with special educational needs by offering advice and insights that can help guide them in their careers. </p><p> It has also begun engaging with social service organisations that work with the less privileged, with a focus on well-being for caregivers and mental wellness.</p><p> Despite the progress made so far, Singlife is keenly aware of the challenges it faces in its sustainability journey. </p><p> For one, its strategy is contingent on other players in its ecosystem -- such as their investee companies and suppliers -- being aligned with their climate action and emission reduction goals.</p><p> Says Mr Chia: \"Achieving our sustainability targets will require a collaborative effort involving our various stakeholders. It is also important that our sustainability initiatives are aligned to the business and generate long-term value for all of them.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-TC210U2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:682H-TKT1-DYX4-03WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1285\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

In addition, he said, a number of investors are investing in listed infrastructure assets for the first time. </p><p> Sovereign wealth fund (SWF) tracker Global SWF also named infrastructure as the industry of the year in its 2023 annual report released on Jan 1. </p><p> Global SWF noted that infrastructure assets retain a residual value, which makes them attractive in times of economic distress. Such assets also provide predictable long-term cashflow for state-owned investors with inter-generational time horizons. </p><p> In particular, it found that while overall investments in infrastructure assets by SWFs were largely flat year on year, allocations to transportation assets rose by US$10 billion to US$34.4 billion in 2022. </p><p> \"Interest in the aviation sector was revived in 2022 amid the lifting of lockdown restrictions as the global pandemic eased, leading to big-ticket investments,\" Global SWF said, noting that SWFs such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company have made significant investments in airlines and airports.</p><p> Furthermore, ClearBridge's Hamieh believes it will be a \"rough road ahead\" for equities as the asset class faces risks including recession fears and global political tensions. </p><p> In comparison, he said listed infrastructure assets have an asymmetrical returns profile. </p><p> Since the ClearBridge Global Infrastructure Income strategy was introduced in 2010, it has captured 0.7 of the beta upside when markets rose, but only 0.4 of the beta downside when markets have fallen. </p><p> Beta refers to a measure of how an asset moves as the stock market rises or falls. An asset that is less volatile than the overall market will have a beta of less than one, while a beta above one indicates an asset is more volatile than the market.</p><p> Lion Global chief investment strategist Lim Yuin noted that certain infrastructure assets' revenue streams tend to be unaffected by market movements. </p><p> \"If you think about toll roads and things like that, recession or not, cars will still go through. It is a very stable cashflow that you can get... the whole idea is that it's quite defensive,\" he said.</p><p> Lim added that private bank clients would likely have received recommendations to increase their allocations in alternatives such as hedge funds and infrastructure assets.</p><p> This is because the typical 60:40 equities to fixed income portfolio adopted by investors has been hit by a slowdown in economic growth and central banks hike rates to combat inflation. </p><p> For example, the Morningstar global 60:40 net return index delivered negative 17.7 per cent returns in 2022. </p><p> Similarly, BlackRock Alternatives' Apac co-head of climate infrastructure Valerie Speth said the outlook for infrastructure assets remains relatively firm, given stronger growth and lagging infrastructure supply. </p><p> \"The opportunity set is incredibly diverse, both across wealthy, well-established core markets and also rapidly expanding, emerging markets,\" she said, noting that countries such as Thailand and the Philippines have plans that could spur increased investment in renewable energy.</p><p> ESG boostAside from their relative strength in uncertain times, public policy support for green infrastructure investments could also provide a near-term boost. </p><p> Peter Meany, head of global listed infrastructure at First Sentier Investors, said he expects public policy support for infrastructure investments to remain strong globally, especially as ageing assets are replaced, electricity generation is decarbonised and natural gas markets are globalised.</p><p> \"We also expect private sector funding of new infrastructure investment to remain strong in 2023, although rising interest rates will likely see M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) activity slow,\" he said.</p><p> Meany added that he foresees a robust pipeline of capital investment opportunities for most listed infrastructure companies globally this year.</p><p> Nuveen Clean Energy Infrastructure Impact Fund co-manager Jagdeep Ghuman said US pipelines and utilities remain well-positioned in the current macroeconomic climate. </p><p> \"Clean infrastructure -- particularly assets associated with energy transition and decarbonisation -- remain an area of interest given investors' growing ESG (environment, social and governance) needs within the asset class,\" he added. </p><p> Similarly, ClearBridge's Hamieh noted that the US Inflation Reduction Act will boost the adoption of clean energy through a number of measures, including a tax credit for hydrogen produced with renewable and nuclear energy. </p><p> He pointed out that there has been an increase in investments into Europe's pipelines and utilities to support decarbonisation efforts and improve its energy security. </p><p> Still, Lion Global's Lim cautioned that not all infrastructure plays should be seen as positive.</p><p> He recommended that the fundamentals of each asset should still be considered on its own merits. </p><p> For instance, he noted that some state-owned construction companies in Indonesia have fairly stretched balance sheets, which could be concerning in a rising rate environment even if they engage in infrastructure projects. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Global SWF has named infrastructure as the industry of the year in its 2023 annual report released on Jan 1.

Its technology-enabled solutions and wide range of products and services include insurance plans and employee benefits as well as investment and advisory solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Notably, the company serves as the exclusive insurance provider for the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Home Affairs, and Public Officers Group Insurance Scheme. In 2020, Singlife merged with Aviva Singapore in a deal valued at S$3.2 billion, creating one of the largest homegrown financial services companies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Recognising the impact of sustainability on its business activities, Singlife embarked on a journey to embed ESG (environmental, social, and governance) processes and products at the heart of its operations. To guide this critical mission, the company established a Sustainability Office in September 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Sustainability presents both risks and opportunities for our business -- sustainability trends for example could pose risks to our underwriting business in the form of changes to morbidity, mortality, and longevity arising from exposure to extreme weather and increased risks of vector-borne diseases. At the same time, we recognise that integrating sustainable practices into our business and sustainable product innovation is crucial if we want to succeed in the long term,\" says Ko Wen Chia, Head of Sustainability of Singlife. </p><p> Kim Rosenkilde, Group Chief Investment Officer of Singlife adds: \"We are committed to managing sustainable impacts well and believe that investing in ESG funds will produce better investment returns over time. Our Investment Office is focused on building our portfolio of funds, and my team and I are involved in selecting and curating all the products that go onto our investment platform. We will not rest on our laurels, and will strive to stay ahead of the curve by doing a lot more in this relatively nascent area of investing.\" </p><p> The company's sustainability strategy is expressed through five focus areas: Being a Responsible Investor, an Accelerator of Net Zero, an Innovator for Green &amp; Good, and Building a Sustainability-Embedded Culture. Underpinning these priorities is the company's robust foundation in governance and risk management practices.</p><p> \"We believe that collective action on all areas will allow us to address environmental and social challenges more effectively, while supporting the creation of business value concurrently,\" explains Ko Wen.</p><p> Taking meaningful action Singlife has wasted no time in realising its sustainability ambitions since starting on this journey. Within a year, the company became a signatory to the United Nations Principles of Sustainable Insurance (UN PSI), set an ambitious target to become a net zero emissions business by 2050, and published its inaugural climate-related financial disclosure report.</p><p> This is aligned with recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) formed by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that seeks to strengthen and protect global financial markets from systemic risks such as climate change. \"These associations provide Singlife with the guidance to adopt best practices and demonstrate our sustainability commitment,\" says Ko Wen.</p><p> Ko Wen was appointed a member of the Sustainability Reporting Advisory Committee (SRAC) set up last year by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and Singapore Exchange Regulation to provide recommendations on the way forward for sustainability reporting in Singapore. In addition, Kim serves on the International Advisory Council for Climate Impact X -- a global marketplace, auctions and exchange platform for trusted carbon credits -- jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek.</p><p> Singlife's sustainability efforts have extended to its customer solutions. The company has launched several ESG-related products including electric vehicle insurance, rainfall protection cover for travellers, and green logistics fleet insurance under MAS' Project Greenprint. </p><p> Investing responsibly Singlife seeks to safeguard the future not only through its insurance business, but also the way it invests. The company is of the view that the value, risks, and returns of a business which are increasingly impacted by ESG factors, must be considered carefully to achieve long-term and sustained value for all its stakeholders.</p><p> In particular, Singlife is working to reduce the contribution from its financed emissions in order to achieve its net zero emissions target by 2050. To do so, the firm is investing in environmentally responsible companies and solutions that support the transition to a greener economy. The company is also an advocate for the \"just transition\" approach, where social implications such as employment, human rights, and inclusion are also considered as it seeks to decarbonise its portfolios. </p><p> Singlife has committed over S$500 million towards sustainable investments as at the end of December 2022. These include investments in sustainable funds such as the Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners -- Green Credit Fund, Qblue Balanced -- Global Sustainable Leaders, BlackRock -- Decarbonization Partners, Singapore Government Green Infrastructure Bond, and the Altrium Sustainability Fund I, launched by Azalea Investment Management and co-seeded by Singlife and sponsor, the Azalea Group, an indirect subsidiary of Temasek.</p><p> The company's investment approach is guided by internationally recognised principles and standards, such as the UN PSI, United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Singapore Stewardship Principles. </p><p> Singlife has appointed a sustainability data provider, Matter, to better measure the impact and performance of its global investments. In particular, the company seeks to understand how aligned its portfolio is with the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and establish a baseline against which it can track its ESG progress. </p><p> Singlife's ESG activities go beyond its business to encompass the communities it operates in. To this end, it has been actively giving back through a variety of initiatives. In 2022, the company planted 100 trees in support of Singapore's National Parks Board's OneMillionTrees initiative, and has pledged to plant another 1,500 trees over the next five years to mitigate climate change and promote biodiversity. </p><p> Beyond that, the company is helping to shape lives for the better. Singlife is working with organisations such as Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities to run financial literacy programmes supporting individuals and their families in making informed financial decisions. </p><p> Singlife has also tied up with charity TomoWork, where its employees mentor students with special educational needs by offering advice and insights that can help guide them in their careers. It has also begun engaging with social service organisations that work with the less privileged, with a focus on wellbeing for caregivers and mental wellness.</p><p> Despite the progress made so far, Singlife is keenly aware of the challenges it faces in its sustainability journey. For one, its strategy is contingent on other players in its ecosystem -- such as their investee companies and suppliers -- being aligned with their climate action and emission reduction goals. </p><p> Says Ko Wen: \"Achieving our sustainability targets will require a collaborative effort involving our various stakeholders. It is also important that our sustainability initiatives are aligned to the business and generate long-term value for all of them.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-2I1S2OU</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:681W-X3G1-JCF2-82FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The orderbook was 1.43 times the amount offered to institutional investors, down from 2.26 times the first time around. MAS raised $2.4 billion in the inaugural offering last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Officially called the Green Singapore Government Securities (Infrastructure), the green bonds were priced to yield 3.04%, unchanged from last year. The final yield was 11 basis points (bps) tighter than the initial guidance of 3.15%.</p><p>The effective yield reflects a coupon of 3% and an offering price of $99.26 per $100 in principal value. The reopened green bond matures on Aug 1, 2072, similar to the maiden offer.</p><p>Both offers contribute towards Singapore's plan to issue $35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund public-sector green infrastructure projects, as announced by Finance Minister Lawrence Wong at Budget 2022.</p><p>According to the Singapore Green Bond Framework published in June 2022, bond proceeds will fund projects that are classified as \"nationally significant\" under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or Singa.</p><p>These projects should be controlled and legally owned by the government, cost at least $4 billion, last minimally for 50 years, and support national productivity or Singapore's economic, environmental or social sustainability.</p><p>Present examples include the upcoming Jurong Region Line and the Cross Island Line in Singapore's rail network. Singa will also extend to projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, pollution prevention, climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable management of natural resources and land use.</p><p>The government is expected to share a post-issuance green bond report on the allocation and expected impact of financing these electric rail projects in the coming months.</p><p>Sustainable bond issuance to near US$1 trillion</p><p>Significant sovereign green bond issuances in 1H2023 include Germany with US$15 billion ($20.33 billion), Italy with US$13 billion, Hong Kong with US$12 billion, and the UK with US$10 billion.</p><p>According to Moody's, global sustainable bond issuance is on course to hit US$950 billion in 2023. Sustainable bond issuance totalled US$258 billion in 2Q2023, flat y-o-y and down 4% q-o-q, and made up 15% of the global bond market.</p><p>Sustainable bonds are a loose, collective term for four segments of bonds. During the quarter, there were US$156 billion of green bonds, US$51 billion of social bonds, US$40 billion of sustainability bonds, and US$11 billion of sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) - together known as GSSS bonds.</p><p>Total GSSS bond issuance reached $526 billion in 1H2023, a 7% increase y-o-y despite a decline in overall bond issuance. \"We expect sustainable bond issuance to remain fairly robust during the second half of the year, with the potential for issuance to eclipse our 2023 forecast of US$950 billion,\" reads a Moody's Investors Service report dated July 27.</p><p>The number of first-time sustainable bond issuers coming to market has fallen in recent quarters, and Moody's warns that this could potentially constrain market growth.</p><p>Following a surge in first-time sustainable bond issuers in 1H2021, when there was a global average of 77 debut sustainable bond issuers per month, the trend has reversed. New global first-time sustainable bond issuers totalled 51 average issuers per month throughout 2022, and the figure fell to 29 average issuers per month in 1H2023.</p><p>\"While some of the decline may be attributable to market conditions, other more secular factors could be holding back would-be debut issuers, including heightened scrutiny of potential greenwashing and an increasingly complex ESG regulatory and political landscape,\" says Moody's.</p><p>Energy transition, China to lead: JP Morgan</p><p>The same trend is seen within Asia ex-Japan, with GSSS bonds issued in G3 currencies down to US$19.7 billion in 1H2023, from US$32.7 billion in 1H2022, according to JP Morgan. Annualised 2023 numbers of approximately US$39.4 billion could mean an extended decline from 2021's heyday of US$70.6 billion and 2022's $48.2 billion.</p><p>That said, the share of GSSS bonds from total supply has remained somewhat stable in 1H2023 at 28.9% in Asia ex-Japan, down from 31.9% this time last year. \"This year has been challenging, primarily because interest rates have risen and there has been some volatility in the market globally, so supply is lower versus last year,\" says Puja Shah, JP Morgan's head of sustainable finance debt capital markets, Asia ex-Japan. \"But interestingly, ESG as a piece of the whole pie has remained broadly consistent as last year.\"</p><p>The energy transition will be a growth engine for GSSS bond issuance, with China in the lead, says JP Morgan in its 2023 mid-year review of ESG financing.</p><p>In 2022, green debt issuance exceeded fossil fuel debt issuance for the first time, according to JP Morgan. Green-labelled debt issuance reached US$581 billion in 2022, representing 7% of global debt issuance for the year, besting the US$531 billion issued by the fossil fuel industry.</p><p>Global investment in clean energy is on course to rise to US$1.7 trillion in 2023, with solar set to eclipse oil production for the first time, according to a May report by the International Energy Agency.</p><p>China is investing the most in energy transition globally; its annual investment grew at a CAGR of 22.1% between 2016 and 2022, higher than the US at 12.5% and Europe at 17.6%.</p><p>Within Asia ex-Japan, however, China's share of the GSSS bond market fell to 19% in 1H2023 from nearly 50% in 2022, as higher cost of borrowing has forced a large quantum of offshore financing to the China onshore bond market. Taking China's place so far this year has been South Korea, whose piece of the pie grew from 26% last year to 34% in 1H2023.</p><p>JP Morgan expects Asia bond supply to end the year at US$130 billion, with GSSS bonds forming at least 25%-30% of the G3 bond market. \"The pillars of the market would, of course, be the banks, sovereigns [and] some of the green renewable companies; they will continue to come to the market,\" says Shah.</p><p>Transition finance is gaining traction in Asia, says Shah, and with it comes greater scrutiny on the preparedness of issuers. \"[Targeting] net zero by 2050 is fine, but it's so far away that it's not as meaningful [as] providing targets for 2030.\"</p><p>Rules and taxonomies</p><p>But even the most well-intentioned issuers need a common language to justify their targets. Speaking on the sidelines of the International Capital Markets Association's (ICMA) 9th Annual Conference of the Principles on June 28, Shah emphasises the importance of taxonomies, which define criteria for economic activities that are aligned with decarbonisation targets. \"The Singapore-Asia Taxonomy and the development of other taxonomies are fantastic. They provide the right kind of tool for issuers to align to while also providing a local flavour.\"</p><p>Singapore's sustainable debt market grew \"healthily\" from about US$2 billion in 2018 to more than US$20 billion last year, says Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and National Development, in her speech at the ICMA conference. The government will update the Singapore Green Bond Framework \"to align with the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for green activities\", she adds.</p><p>The next big focal point will be the interoperability of the world's taxonomies, says Shah. \"The EU taxonomy is a single taxonomy for the entire EU region, and Asia is a combination of several countries, which have different pathways of growth and development.\"</p><p>Regulators are well aware of the challenges, she adds. \"There is greater focus on promoting the development of credible GSSS issuance markets in Asia.\"</p><p>Sovereign GSSS bond issuances encourage local markets to follow, says Shah. The Philippines issued a US$750 million sustainability bond in October 2022 with a 5.95% coupon due 2047, while Hong Kong issued a multi-tranche green bond in January worth US$5.75 billion - the largest ESG bond issuance in Asia - and followed this up in May with an institutional green bond offering worth nearly US$6 billion.</p><p>Also in May, Indonesia issued the world's first ICMA-aligned sovereign blue bond, raising 20.7 billion yen ($190 million) at 1.2% and 1.43% coupon rates for seven- and 10-year tenures respectively.</p><p>The proceeds from this bond issuance will provide a much-needed boost to Indonesia's blue economy, says the United Nations Development Programme, including coastal protection, sustainable management of fisheries and aquaculture, marine biodiversity conservation and mangrove rehabilitation.</p><p>From a policy perspective, sovereigns want to develop a vibrant onshore market, says Shah. \"At the end of the day, Asian issuers will always have the ability to move between different financing options. So, I think sovereigns are trying to make sure that ESG is pervasive in all markets.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:693N-20P1-JCF0-4000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Impact financing can be one such area, with the Republic providing leadership and cultivating a deep pool of investors for opportunities in the wider region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Apart from businesses which set up regional headquarters here to expand in South-east Asia, Singapore has attracted many family offices from around the world due to its low taxes, political stability, excellent legal regime, security and financial prowess. There are currently more than 700 family offices in Singapore, including Dalio Family Office, Vulcan Capital, and those linked to James Dyson, hotpot chain Haidilao, Li Ka-shing and Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani.</p><p> Many of these family offices show support for impact and philanthropic investing, which has helped to build up an ecosystem here. According to the Global Impact Investing Network, many regional enterprises that have received impact investment are headquartered in Singapore, as are many private impact investors that operate across the region.</p><p> Meanwhile, South-east Asia has a large young population powering its economies, but faces growing environmental and social challenges brought about by climate change, population growth and urbanisation. Singapore is not insulated from the effects of climate change, and has made sustainability a national priority to address this. In particular, the public sector has set ambitious sustainability targets under the GreenGov.SG initiative, as part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p> In view of the above, there is a unique window of opportunity where Singapore can leverage its deep network of investors -- including pro-impact investing family offices -- and emerging technology capabilities to contribute to regional impact investing in education, food security, health, green infrastructure and environmental care.</p><p> Impact and philanthropic investors generally have the risk absorption capacities required to invest in nascent and disruptive technologies. Such investors in Singapore can play a pivotal role in cultivating a pool of future impact-investing unicorns in the Republic and South-east Asia. In the process, Singapore will be well positioned to become a regional hub for startups that are focused on impact investing, and eventually, the various ESG (environment, social, governance) causes.</p><p> One recent example of impact investment in Singapore was the stake taken by publicly listed Thai President Foods in Singapore foodtech startup Alchemy FoodTech. Alchemy Foodtech's patented Alchemy Fibre technology platform replaces sugars and carbohydrates in food to reduce their glycaemic index, while delivering \"great taste and texture\". In an article by TechNode Global, Thai President Foods shared that they were very excited to be one of the first Thai impact investors supporting startups, like Alchemy, that create a positive impact in society.</p><p> The Singapore Exchange (SGX) can be a listing platform for some regional impact investors to seek a partial or full exit. It can also help these investors gain credibility and visibility, as they seek collaborations or partnerships with strategic global impact investors who want to build their footprint in the region.</p><p> With a growing impact-investing community in Singapore, global impact investors which are already listed elsewhere can seek a secondary or dual listing on SGX to profile themselves in the Republic and the region, especially after acquiring target companies in impact investments in South-east Asia.</p><p>Singapore leads the region in venture capital investment and has been home to several unicorns. However, many tech startups in the region have chosen to list on Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange or the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In a speech in 2021, Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong noted that one area in which Singapore can do better is making its public equity market more conducive for innovative growth companies. Having a vibrant home equity market becomes more pertinent as more Singapore impact investing startups mature and transform into regional and global players.</p><p> Education will be key to laying a strong foundation for an active and established impact and philanthropic investing ecosystem. Such education can provide updates on the more pressing environmental and social issues, show how technology can help address such issues, and explain how startups can seek impact and philanthropic investments.</p><p> For investors, education should include how to compare and select impact investment opportunities; how impact investing can enhance portfolio returns through diversification; and how impact investing can be a more transparent way to contribute to social causes, compared to monetary donations to charity.</p><p> Education should also cover how to organise and disclose information to assess the efficacy of impact investing. Singapore regulators themselves are actively addressing greenwashing issues by encouraging the market to enhance the quality of disclosures, and to allow access to more relevant impact investment information or data as well as promoting the consistency, comparability and integrity of such information.</p><p> To play an effective leadership role in impact investing in South-east Asia, Singapore should support the region through thought leadership; having a deep and wide pool of international impact investors and entrepreneurs to help find solutions to social and environmental challenges; and having a deep and sophisticated equity capital market where successful companies involved in impact investments may list.</p><p> Pei Sai Fan is an adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, as well as an angel investor and adviser to fintech startups.

Once, coal and other minerals made Hegang a pillar of socialist industry. When the richest seams were declared exhausted, just over a decade ago, the central government closed many mines and put its faith in green infrastructure. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Shanty towns of soot-blackened miners' huts were demolished and replaced with brightly painted apartment blocks, marching to the horizon beside new city parks. A high-speed rail line opened last December. There is proud talk of a graphite mine that will supply factories making batteries for new-energy vehicles. </p><p> Alas, for the technocrats, they could not prevent more than one in six locals leaving Hegang after 2010, fleeing low salaries, limited job prospects (especially for graduates) and long, dark, brutal winters. </p><p> Recently, that combination of a home-building drive and a shrinking population has propelled Hegang to an unforeseen distinction. It is, by some measures, China's cheapest city at prefecture level or above. </p><p> In 2019, Hegang earned online notoriety after young outsiders made viral videos and blog posts boasting of buying sizeable apartments there for as little as 46,000 yuan (S$8,900). The claim is supported by more formal surveys. Hegang's second-hand housing stock sells for 2,152 yuan per sq m on average, making property 40 times cheaper than in Shenzhen, a high-tech southern metropolis. </p><p> This backwater of 790,000 people near the Russian border has now become an online byword for a place where strivers -- as well as have-nots and misfits -- can turn modest savings into a home. </p><p> True, many give up and leave within months, often as winter temperatures plunge to minus 20 deg C. Others visit only briefly to decorate apartments bought online, before returning to lives in a factory dormitory as migrant workers in a giant eastern city. </p><p> But even that remote form of ownership is \"a form of emotional comfort\" for migrants, who may spend years in Shanghai or Guangzhou but have no hope of buying homes there, says Mr Liang Yunpeng, a Hegang estate agent. He sells perhaps 80 cheap flats a year to outsiders, typically on the upper floors of old buildings without lifts. His customers often have less than 30,000 yuan to spend. </p><p> It would be rash to predict Hegang's revival by incomers. Several successful new residents supplement local jobs by creating short online videos and posts that play on the novelty of their move to China's far north, earning millions of views for films about the cold or the cheapness of eating out. Only a limited number can become famous online for living in Hegang. </p><p> Still, this small city is a good place to observe a large trend. </p><p> China faces a cost-of-living crisis. Between 1998 and 2021, urban Chinese homes became four times less affordable, as judged by the ratio of average housing prices to median disposable incomes. </p><p> Today, a flat in Beijing measuring 100 sq m costs, on average, 6.3 million yuan, or about US$1 million. That is 34 times the average annual salary in China's capital. Unattainable housing is especially painful because property is seen as a safe, government-backed form of savings, and because a man without his own apartment will often struggle to find a wife. </p><p> It also exposes deep inequities in modern society. Some involve yawning income inequality. But others reflect encrusted privilege from the socialist era, notably after urban housing was privatised in the 1990s and sold off to state-employed workers and officials at steep discounts. </p><p> Visiting Hegang, The Economist meets the owner of a small burger bar, surnamed Hou. He is locally born, and returned from Beijing in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic halted his work as a guide taking Chinese tourists to Russia. Such holidays are not cheap: A family trip to Moscow might cost 30,000 yuan. Still, many of his clients were seemingly ordinary pensioners. </p><p> The explanation is that long-time Beijingers might own two or three apartments, bought cheaply years ago. Now, even a small flat can generate 60,000 yuan a year in rental income. In contrast, Mr Hou has noticed more Hegang friends heading home, after realising that -- as migrant outsiders to a big city -- they will never have enough capital to buy a home or start a business. He is glad to hear more customers or delivery-scooter riders with non-local accents, too. For one thing, such newcomers prop up Hegang housing prices. </p><p> Some locals resent Chinese bloggers who call the city a haven for those yearning to \"lie flat\", or drop out and abandon material ambitions. Mr Wang Dakai, who spent 10 years in big cities before returning to open a barber's shop, worries that Hegang is being called lazy. \"None of us is lying flat, everyone is hustling,\" he says. Proving his point, as his price for answering questions, he asks to film an online video pretending to cut his British visitor's hair to post on his social media channels. </p><p> Individual dreams in a  bastion of old collectivismSome fresh starts are life-changing. Buying and renovating a flat for 70,000 yuan last summer allowed a 25-year-old vlogger who uses the name \"Hua Hua\" to make a home for herself and her 10-year-old sister. Each month, she sends money to pay for her mentally impaired mother's care at home in Jiangxi province, 3,000km to the south. </p><p> She supports herself by selling pancakes and bean jelly from a street cart, house-sitting cats, working as an online customer service assistant and writing. Hegang is quiet and friendly, and has some good schools from its days as a mining centre, she says. </p><p> Also, she likes snow. </p><p> On a recent morning, she was joined in her tiny, cat-filled home by a newly arrived friend, a divorced single mother.

Thank you for inviting me to join you for PEB's annual Day of Dedication. Today is the day we welcome newly minted Professional Engineers (PEs), Specialist PEs and ASEAN Chartered PEs into our Built Environment sector family. It is also the occasion to affirm the contributions and achievements of our PEs, and for PEs to renew your passion for engineering, and your dedication to this meaningful profession.</p><p>Role and Contributions of PEs</p><p>2. Singapore's rapid transformation from a backwater of crowded tenements to a vibrant metropolis is attributable in no small part to our dedicated engineers.</p><p>3. The engineers have been at the forefront of every phase of our development. In the 1960s, housing shortage and urban renewal were of top priority. When the pioneer generation had to build homes rapidly to relocate people from crowded squatter settlements to HDB public housing, the engineers were there.</p><p>4. In the 1970s and 1980s, we needed city development to generate economic growth and jobs. When we built up our city centre and established a comprehensive transport network to support growth and development, the engineers were there.</p><p>5. In the 2000s, our development took on a global dimension. With increased international competition for talent and investment, we needed to rise beyond national development and become a cosmopolitan global city. When we took Singapore to the next level of a global city with state-of-the-art infrastructure and made it a destination of choice, to live, work and play, the engineers were also there.</p><p>6. Throughout the transformation journey, our engineers demonstrated high levels of professionalism and ethics. Your unwavering commitment to safety gave us confidence and peace of mind in the knowledge that our homes, workplaces and public spaces are safe, liveable and workable.</p><p>7. Your creativity and ingenuity enabled us to overcome our limited land and resources, and turned these constraints into opportunities. Some notable engineering accomplishments in Singapore include the Marina Coastal Expressway, Singapore's first undersea tunnel; Changi Jewel and its distinctive domed faade and 40-metre tall indoor waterfall that has earned international acclamation; and our Tuas Mega Port which has just recently opened last year. The Tuas Mega Port will reinforce Singapore's status as a leading international maritime centre, and will free up prime land for development of the Greater Southern Waterfront.</p><p>8. Through your efforts, Singapore is today a leader in urban development and our transformation is now a source of inspiration to others.</p><p>Engineering Our Tomorrow</p><p>9. Now as we build our Singapore of tomorrow, we will once again need our engineers.</p><p>10. The ForwardSG Report launched by DPM Wong last month is our roadmap to the future. A key theme we have heard is that Singaporeans want Singapore to continue to be a liveable city. This means that we will need to carefully balance land needs for economic development, public housing, as well as green and recreational spaces for today and tomorrow.</p><p>11. The professional services under the Built Environment sector will play an increasingly important role in building our future city. This includes finding new solutions and ways of building to overcome our limited land and environmental resources, as well as forming new partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the sector. Our professional services also need to transform and keep up with changing times so as to capture new opportunities.</p><p>12. One of the greatest and most pressing challenge of building Singapore for tomorrow is climate change. Climate change is an existential threat for humanity as a whole, but especially so for Singapore. As a low-lying city-state, we are vulnerable to rising sea levels. We are also already experiencing rising temperatures, compounded by our densely built-up environment. Climate change also poses risks to our food and water security, public health, and biodiversity.</p><p>13. We will have to build future Singapore in way that goes far beyond our current levels of sustainability. In order to achieve our net zero ambitions, we will once again have to call on our engineers to rise to the occasion.</p><p>14. Let me touch on two areas in which good engineering will make all the difference.</p><p>Coastal Protection</p><p>15. First, coastal protection. Singapore is a low-lying island, and 30% of our land area is less than 5 metres above the mean sea level. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore estimates that the mean sea level around Singapore could rise by up to 1 metre by 2100. Combined with extreme rainfall and storm surges, there could be serious impacts on our infrastructure, our community and our livelihoods.</p><p>16. PUB has already commenced site-specific studies for different parts of our coastlines to understand their characteristics and develop targeted coastal protection measures. They will share more about these efforts and their progress later.</p><p>17. As we work to protect against rising sea levels, there will be abundant opportunities for engineers to be involved in the design, implementation and maintenance of our coastal protection measures. This includes considering how coastal protection can be integrated with other social and recreational uses. An example of such an engineering marvel is Marina Barrage which is multi-functional. It is not only used for flood control, but also serves Singapore as a vital water source and at the same time is a lifestyle attraction.</p><p>18. We will need engineering expertise in fields such as soil mechanics, flood management and environmental hydraulics, to name just a few. Protecting Singapore against rising sea levels will require a pipeline of engineering talent over the long term. The Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore is dedicated to strengthening local capabilities and expertise in coastal protection and flood management. CFI Singapore offers a wide range of programmes, such as workforce training programmes and scientific seminars to drive collaboration across the industry.</p><p>19. I encourage all of you today to consider some of these programmes, and equip yourselves or your employees with the skills and knowledge to contribute to this important effort.</p><p>Decarbonising our Built Environment</p><p>20. Another key area is decarbonising our built environment. Today, buildings account for around 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions and more than a third of electricity consumption. Reducing our buildings' carbon emissions and building net-zero cities is an imperative if we are to achieve net zero emissions globally by mid-century to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>21. Under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, we have set three ambitious targets, or \"80-80-80 in 2030\", to green our buildings. These are to green 80% of our buildings by 2030, for 80% of our new developments to meet Super Low energy (or SLE) standards from 2030, and for our best-in-class buildings to achieve 80% improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 levels by 2030. We have seen promising progress on all of these targets but must continue to sustain this momentum.</p><p>22. I seek your support and your expertise in furthering our green building efforts. For example, as engineers, you can support our efforts to mainstream SLE buildings by challenging and moving away from conventional building design. This could involve designing for more spaces to be naturally ventilated, adopting hybrid cooling solutions and deploying rooftop and faade photovoltaics to maximise renewable energy that is harnessed onsite.</p><p>23. To do this work, I encourage you to build up your knowledge and expertise. The BCA Academy offers training courses for Built Environment professionals to increase their green building expertise. These courses cover areas such as lifecycle carbon analysis, solar modelling and energy performance modelling.</p><p>24. As engineers, you have a direct hand in building a more resilient, lower-carbon built environment. Your engineering efforts and innovations will also enable Singapore to harness sustainability as a competitive advantage and position Singapore as a sustainability hub, one where innovative and cost-effective green engineering solutions can be catalysed, developed and then exported to the region and the world.</p><p>25. Next year, Infrastructure Asia will be organising the Asia Infrastructure Forum (AIF) in June. Infrastructure Asia's role is to be a platform that connects supply and demand in infrastructure, and it provides an opportunity for our Built Environment professionals to connect with those in the infrastructure space regionally. The multilateral development banks, international companies and those who have an interest in infrastructure will be there. So I would strongly encourage PEB members to attend the AIF next year. We are looking to see if we can organise a panel discussion on professional services, in order to have sustainable infrastructure. It is something that should be quite interesting because there are leaders all over the world that will come to discuss this, and I am sure that all of you will have something very meaningful to contribute to the discussion, given Singapore's efforts in sustainability.</p><p>Recognising outstanding PEs</p><p>26. Today, we want to recognise two outstanding PEs, Er. Wong Seng and Er. Ng Choon Yeang, whose engineering innovations have led to improvements in productivity and environmental outcomes.</p><p>27. Er. Wong is the Managing Director of TW-Asia Consultants Pte Ltd. He is being recognised today for his pioneering innovation in concrete prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (or PPVC) technology using a composite shear wall system.</p><p>28. The technology involves a LEGO-like construction method where PPVC modules of the same floor are joined side-by-side, and then floor-by-floor. This innovation has not only enabled significant productivity improvements, but it also boasts many other advantages. For example, the use of thin PPVC composite walls means more usable room space. There are also notable environmental benefits such as the reduction of noise and dust pollution at the project site given that most of the construction activity is completed off-site.</p><p>29. The second recipient of the Innovative PE Award is Er. Ng Choon Yeang, Deputy Group Director for Rail Infrastructure and Expansion at LTA. He is being recognised for pioneering the use of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) for the Downtown Line 3's tunnel segments. While SFRC is traditionally used in Singapore for non-structural components, Er. Ng spearheaded studies to test and implement SFRC for permanent tunnel segments in our underground rail.</p><p>30. The success of its use in Downtown Line 3 has led to the extensive use of SFRC in LTA's subsequent MRT tunnelling works such as the Thomson East Coast Line and the Cross Island Line. Compared to the use of traditional steel bar reinforced concrete for other MRT projects, the use of SFRC has improved productivity for segment production by up to 25%, resulting in cost savings. The maintenance required is also lower as SFRC segments are more resistant to corrosion and fire damage.</p><p>31. I thank Er. Wong and Er. Ng for their innovative and can-do spirit. In the face of global challenges like climate change and increasing resource scarcity, innovation will be critical for new solutions and pathways towards a more sustainable future.</p><p>32. On this note, I encourage our engineering firms to tap on Government grants to spur innovation in your areas of work, and to drive your business transformation plans. For example, Enterprise Singapore's Enterprise Development Grant provides funding support to local companies to upgrade, innovate, grow and transform your business. The grant also supports the development of innovative technology and products with the end goal of commercialisation.</p><p>33. ESG's Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green (or EFS Green) also helps local companies access financing for sustainability-related initiatives, including the development of technologies and solutions for green infrastructure.</p><p>34. Engineering firms with ideas that push the boundaries of building energy efficiency can also consider tapping on the Green Building Innovation Cluster Programme 2.0 where up to 70% of qualifying costs will be supported.</p><p>35. I think I have spoken long enough. Let me conclude by sending my warmest congratulations to the newly registered PEs, Specialist PEs and ASEAN Chartered PEs, as well as the award recipients today.</p><p>36. To our engineers in the room, we owe so much of what we enjoy today - our quality housing and our efficient transportation systems - to all of you. Thank you for doing what you do.</p><p>37. The challenges ahead also present new and exciting opportunities in the field of engineering. Building our future Singapore is something we cannot do without you, so the 4G team and I look forward to building our future Singapore with you. Thank you all very much.</p><p>[Category: Construction &amp; Materials, Engineering &amp; Construction, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063132867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69KY-XK61-DXMP-K25F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2349\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 9, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Business &amp;

On the last day of Ecosperity Week 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the financial industry announced they would establish the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA will initially focus on initiatives to scale voluntary carbon markets, transition finance and blended finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) is leading the coordination and set-up of the SSFA. According to MAS, the SSFA will include representatives from financial institutions, financial industry associations, relevant corporates and service providers, such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating agencies.</p><p>Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, also chairman of MAS, says he does not see carbon taxes \"coming in time\" to meet global net-zero targets. \"If we don't have carbon taxes rising to adequate levels globally, without lots of free-riders, [then] we need financial regulation as a major public policy tool, and we must use it. Otherwise, the markets will be too slow.\"</p><p>Many of our banks are taking a forward-looking view, says Tharman, but there is \"a lot of unevenness\". \"The leading banks and financial institutions have to be provided clear guidance, so none of them has to move ahead of the rest and feel [a] competitive disadvantage. That's why we need guidance across the board.\"</p><p>The government is exploring how to develop a new vehicle to catalyse blended finance in Asia by working with regional partners, says Tharman. This ranges from collaborating with government agencies to Singapore-based infrastructure financing vehicles like Clifford Capital and Pentagreen Capital, as well as commercial banks and multilateral development banks like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, he adds.</p><p>Along with other government agencies, MAS says it is collaborating with industry players to explore platforms to channel blended finance at scale into transition and green infrastructure projects in the region. \"MAS aims to bring together patient, concessionary capital from philanthropies, multilateral development banks, development finance institutions and donor partners. This will help crowd more conventional infrastructure financiers, including banks and institutional investors.\" MAS says further details will be announced, \"when the plans are more developed\".</p><p>Compared to the jam-packed conferences of years past, this year's edition - which wrapped on June 8 - was a quieter affair, until the end. Tharman, who gave the keynote address at the inaugural Financing Asia's Transition (Fast) Conference - held as part of Ecosperity Week 2023 - announced his intention to quit politics after the close of the main event on June 8.</p><p>He will resign from the People's Action Party and step down from his ministerial posts on July 7, to run for president in the upcoming election.</p><p>Private sector and climate resilience</p><p>There are US$7 trillion ($9.4 trillion) worth of benefits on the table if private sectors invest in climate resilience by 2030, but at this moment, only 7% of investments are channelled into adaptation and resilience, says Lauren Sorkin, executive director of the Resilient Cities Network.</p><p>At the same time, more than half the world's emissions come from Asia. This makes the region a core part of the problem and the solution, says Isabel Chatterton of the International Finance Corporation (IFC).</p><p>Panellists at Ecosperity Week agree that public-private partnerships have a huge potential in tackling net zero but cite the same hurdles in realising such collaboration.</p><p>Those in the financial sector looking to fund nature-based climate solutions say such ventures are still too risky, as there needs to be a consistent, comparable metric to link physical climate with financial risk. While there have been successful examples of using nature-based solutions to solve climate issues in cities, the industry needs more concrete data points to prove a solid business case for investing, say experts.</p><p>While there is much interest in funding new green technologies, the bigger challenge is getting money to flow into emerging markets and then scaling those solutions, which require much more capital, says Temasek chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani. He believes it boils down to stable regulatory policies and frameworks that can mitigate risks and give investors the confidence that what is being done can be delivered.</p><p>But not all governments have been completely transparent or open to adopting nature-based climate solutions, says Zoe Knight, group head of the centre of sustainable finance at HSBC. She says there are still difficulties in ironing out frameworks without more transparency from policymakers on how they might want to implement resilience and adaptation through nature-based solutions and ecosystem services.</p><p>William McGoldrick, regional managing director for The Nature Conservancy's Asia-Pacific division, says there is a \"bias, or some sort of psychological barrier to even begin thinking [of] or taking it seriously\". The goal is incredibly difficult, \"like trying to fix a Rubik's cube\", Claire Perry O'Neill offers. The former UK Minister for Energy and Clean Growth adds that the world cannot wait for a perfect solution to achieve zero-carbon cities. Instead, all players must experiment very quickly with different models at small city levels, which will eventually cascade into the future, says O'Neill, the sustainability advisor for Singapore-headquartered climate-tech venture Terrascope.</p><p>Fellow panellist Wang Tianyi, the former chairman of China Everbright Environment Group, summarises the partnership between public and private sectors, describing it as \"a lasting marriage, not a short wedding ceremony\".</p><p>Jakarta's big move</p><p>Without major policy announcements this year, much of the buzz at the conference came from Indonesia's leaders who attended in person. President Joko Widodo was the conference's headliner, and his speech on June 7 started light-heartedly: \"I would like to take the opportunity to ask you: Who will win next year's Presidential election?\" The 61-year-old will end his second and final five-year term in 2024.</p><p>Around the time Joko leaves office, Indonesia hopes to complete the first phase of its new capital city Nusantara in East Kalimantan, Borneo. About three times the size of Singapore, the project was announced three years ago and is reportedly estimated to cost IDR466 trillion ($42 billion). Joko started the project in his second term. The pilot stage is due for completion in August 2024.</p><p>Indonesia's government has committed to finance 20% of the project but will need other investors to fund the balance. Japan's SoftBank pulled out of the project in March 2022. \"Your investment in Indonesia will continue to be safe and also the continuity of the Nusantara new capital city,\" says Joko. \"Everything will be fine, don't worry.\"</p><p>His 11-minute speech and a separate panel discussion between Nusantara project chairman Bambang Susantono and Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin were dedicated to showcasing the new capital city's investment potential.</p><p>Bambang says five countries are in a \"serious due diligence process\" to invest in Nusantara: South Korea, Japan, China, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. Joko announced in July 2022 that South Korea has agreed to pledge a total investment of US$6.37 billion.</p><p>A first look at the new capital city may be ready next August, but Nusantara will only be fully complete by 2045, and Indonesia aims to house 1.9 million residents there. Between now and then, governments, laws and even the constitution will be changed, says Haslinda. How can Indonesia ensure the project reaches completion?</p><p>Bambang replies: \"The owner of the city is the one that moved there. The city's owner is the one that [is] also doing a lot of business there.\" He adds that investors of all sizes, even micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, will be the city's owners. \"They will be the one[s] that guarantee the city's sustainability in the future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FR-DGN1-DYX1-T007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

The focus has shifted from setting sustainability targets to funding decarbonisation in real economy sectors, such as energy, transportation and real estate.KPMG projects that decarbonisation will be a key pillar of the economy, contributing up to 7 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050. In Asean, new low-carbon activities could open up to US$10 trillion in investment opportunities over the same period. That comprises US$5 trillion in the renewable energy and power infrastructure sectors, US$4 trillion in energy efficiency and US$1 trillion in fossil fuel power plant retirement.The green transition represents both a challenge and an opportunity. While the pace of energy transition from fossil fuels to low carbon and green solutions will depend on technological innovation and policy frameworks, an initiative to facilitate blended finance availability can go a long way in catalysing the transition. </p><p>An orderly and just transition will be critical, and this requires the involvement of all relevant stakeholders - financiers, regulators, utility players, customers and employees.This presents a great opportunity to Singapore to further leverage its position as a regional financial hub. The upcoming Singapore Budget 2023 should look to promote structuring, raising and deployment of public, private and foundation capital to fast-track green investment plans. No single source of financing will be able to meet the enormous investment of over a trillion dollars per year required to address the climate challenge.Levers to spur green financeGovernments, financial institutions (FIs) and regulators need to step up collaboration to accelerate green finance, particularly as FIs grapple with the cost and operational complexities of incorporating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into business and risk management.FIs are increasingly aware of the consequences of inaction on climate change - there is growing societal expectation that FIs should avoid financing projects that give rise to high carbon emissions, while future government regulations may also see restrictions imposed to curtail their ability to finance the highest emitters. Nonetheless, more can be done to drive home the message. This may include deeper engagement and education to help FIs appreciate that financing a company with a high carbon footprint will soon be no less acceptable than banking with one that fails basic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules. This will create a stronger impetus for FIs to lend their influence to redirect more capital to sustainability-focused projects.One key lever will be using a mix of public and private finance, especially for marginally bankable green projects. Blended finance structures such as multi-layered investment vehicles, social bonds and blended guarantees can help provide additional investor \"patience\" for longer payback periods than more traditional investments. Public funds and development guarantees can also help reduce risks to encourage private capital participation.Green bonds are also a key instrument, and the government has an important role to play in facilitating access to them. Sustainable bond issuers would welcome an extension of Singapore's Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme beyond its current validity of May 31, 2023. This scheme offsets up to S$100,000 of additional expenses for external reviews of eligible green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds and promotes adoption of internationally accepted standards. Lowering its minimum issuance size from the current S$200 million would also bring in more issuers. Singapore is also developing its ESG ecosystem to accelerate sustainable and green financing for the country, and as a regional and global hub. For instance, the government is supporting provision of ESG data platforms and services to help fill gaps in the data required to make funding and risk pricing decisions, while keeping the costs of providing green financing down. This is driving the development of sustainable financing in new customer segments, such as small- and medium-size enterprises (which account for 48 per cent of Singapore's GDP), and financial services, such as sustainable supply chain financing, and sustainability-linked short-term working capital lending.The government could further encourage FIs into the green arena through a tax concession on interest income from green bonds or loans. For example, a 5 or 10 per cent concessionary corporate tax rate could be provided on interest income from loans used to fund the acquisition and \"greening\" of older properties.Exploring asset recycling and alternate funding optionsAsean countries are realising the urgency of shifting from brownfield infrastructure such as fossil-fuel power plants to the likes of wind and solar energy. Singapore's geographic position at the nexus of regional logistics, pipelines, and power grid infrastructure makes it a valuable base from which FIs can reach such markets. KPMG's new Asean Decarbonisation Hub is offering expertise across the region for capacity building and financial structuring, bringing together government and private actors to accelerate decarbonisation efforts.This can help to generate greater financial and environmental value by promoting a strategic and programmatic approach to monetising brownfield assets in capital markets. Establishing an Energy Transition Mechanism fund could further mobilise capital for asset recycling. For example, numerous ageing fossil-fuel plants could be bundled together using grants and commercial financing in order to buy down their cost. This will help to bring in private sector innovation, investment and efficiencies to operate, or early-retire ageing infrastructure, freeing up public capital for other decarbonisation projects.New advances in energy technology are paving the way for South-east Asia's shift from fossil fuels; Singapore should now position itself to provide the innovative financing to unlock these opportunities at scale.The writers are partners with KPMG in Singapore.

The focus has shifted from setting sustainability targets to funding decarbonisation in real economy sectors, such as energy, transportation and real estate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> KPMG projects that decarbonisation will be a key pillar of the economy, contributing up to 7 per cent of Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050. In Asean, new low-carbon activities could open up to US$10 trillion in investment opportunities over the same period. That comprises US$5 trillion in the renewable energy and power infrastructure sectors, US$4 trillion in energy efficiency and US$1 trillion in fossil fuel power plant retirement.</p><p> The green transition represents both a challenge and an opportunity. While the pace of energy transition from fossil fuels to low carbon and green solutions will depend on technological innovation and policy frameworks, an initiative to facilitate blended finance availability can go a long way in catalysing the transition. An orderly and just transition will be critical, and this requires the involvement of all relevant stakeholders -- financiers, regulators, utility players, customers and employees. </p><p> This presents a great opportunity to Singapore to further leverage its position as a regional financial hub. The upcoming Singapore Budget 2023 should look to promote structuring, raising and deployment of public, private and foundation capital to fast-track green investment plans. No single source of financing will be able to meet the enormous investment of over a trillion dollars per year required to address the climate challenge.</p><p> Levers to spur green financeGovernments, financial institutions (FIs) and regulators need to step up collaboration to accelerate green finance, particularly as FIs grapple with the cost and operational complexities of incorporating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations into business and risk management.</p><p> FIs are increasingly aware of the consequences of inaction on climate change -- there is growing societal expectation that FIs should avoid financing projects that give rise to high carbon emissions, while future government regulations may also see restrictions imposed to curtail their ability to finance the highest emitters. Nonetheless, more can be done to drive home the message. This may include deeper engagement and education to help FIs appreciate that financing a company with a high carbon footprint will soon be no less acceptable than banking with one that fails basic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules. This will create a stronger impetus for FIs to lend their influence to redirect more capital to sustainability-focused projects.</p><p> One key lever will be using a mix of public and private finance, especially for marginally bankable green projects. Blended finance structures such as multi-layered investment vehicles, social bonds and blended guarantees can help provide additional investor \"patience\" for longer payback periods than more traditional investments. Public funds and development guarantees can also help reduce risks to encourage private capital participation.</p><p> Green bonds are also a key instrument, and the government has an important role to play in facilitating access to them. Sustainable bond issuers would welcome an extension of Singapore's Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme beyond its current validity of May 31, 2023. This scheme offsets up to S$100,000 of additional expenses for external reviews of eligible green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds and promotes adoption of internationally accepted standards. Lowering its minimum issuance size from the current S$200 million would also bring in more issuers. </p><p>Singapore is also developing its ESG ecosystem to accelerate sustainable and green financing for the country, and as a regional and global hub. For instance, the government is supporting provision of ESG data platforms and services to help fill gaps in the data required to make funding and risk pricing decisions, while keeping the costs of providing green financing down. </p><p> This is driving the development of sustainable financing in new customer segments, such as small- and medium-size enterprises (which account for 48 per cent of Singapore's GDP), and financial services, such as sustainable supply chain financing, and sustainability-linked short-term working capital lending.</p><p> The government could further encourage FIs into the green arena through a tax concession on interest income from green bonds or loans. For example, a 5 or 10 per cent concessionary corporate tax rate could be provided on interest income from loans used to fund the acquisition and \"greening\" of older properties.</p><p> Exploring asset recycling and alternate funding optionsAsean countries are realising the urgency of shifting from brownfield infrastructure such as fossil-fuel power plants to the likes of wind and solar energy. Singapore's geographic position at the nexus of regional logistics, pipelines, and power grid infrastructure makes it a valuable base from which FIs can reach such markets. KPMG's new Asean Decarbonisation Hub is offering expertise across the region for capacity building and financial structuring, bringing together government and private actors to accelerate decarbonisation efforts.</p><p> This can help to generate greater financial and environmental value by promoting a strategic and programmatic approach to monetising brownfield assets in capital markets. Establishing an Energy Transition Mechanism fund could further mobilise capital for asset recycling. For example, numerous ageing fossil-fuel plants could be bundled together using grants and commercial financing in order to buy down their cost. This will help to bring in private sector innovation, investment and efficiencies to operate, or early-retire ageing infrastructure, freeing up public capital for other decarbonisation projects.</p><p> New advances in energy technology are paving the way for South-east Asia's shift from fossil fuels; Singapore should position itself to provide the innovative financing to unlock these opportunities at scale.</p><p> The writers are partners with KPMG in Singapore.

Rising interest rates, which could kick in as early as next month, is another aspect for prospective home buyers to consider when making purchasing decisions.</p><p> Analysts from Maybank reckon the 3 local banks will benefit from the S$500 million Jobs &amp; Business Support Package as it minimises the threat of non-performing loans from the SME sector, while more loans may emerge thanks to the expanded Enterprise Financing Scheme for mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, up to S$35 billion of green bonds could be issued by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects, which bodes well for fee income and puts the Republic in good stead to be a regional green hub.</p><p> In the transport sector, initiatives aimed at encouraging the use of public transportation, driving the transition towards a car-light society and the rollout of infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs) could give public transport operator ComfortDelGro a lift.</p><p> \"Plans to further accelerate EV adoption by building more charging points would be positive for ComfortDelGro,\" according to a research note from RHB, which highlighted that a consortium backed by ComfortDelGro had already won the pilot tender awarded by the government to set up EV charging infrastructure.</p><p>Singapore is extending its zero annual growth rate for cars and motorcycles until 2025, while vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) will be phased out by 2040.</p><p> On the other hand, higher carbon taxes is seen as potentially impacting technology hardware manufacturers and industrials. Tighter labour restrictions could also weigh on all sectors.</p><p> A report from Citi flagged that measures under Budget 2022 - such as tighter foreign worker policies and wage pressures as well as the phased hike in the GST rate and carbon taxes - raise the risk of elevated inflation beyond 2022, even as it reduced the risk of an uplift in inflation in the short term. In previous inflationary cycles in 2007-2008 and 2011-2012, telcos and consumer stocks were among the outperformers.</p><p> Stubbornly high inflation translates to a \"bias for a stronger SGD outlook\", which will be positive for \"certain yield names, such as Reits\", while those with overseas operations may feel the impact of currency translation in the face of a muscular Sing dollar, Citi analysts highlighted.</p><p> Investors sifting through the Budget measures for investment themes will also need to take into account the broader re-opening theme as Singapore continues on its path towards endemic living.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Initiatives aimed at encouraging the use of public transportation, driving the transition towards a car-light society and the rollout of infrastructure for EVs could give ComfortDelGro a lift.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-388814</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64V6-C941-DYX4-00N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Climate change, as described by the United Nations, has become the greatest threat to human security, and has evolved beyond just an environmental problem. Sustainability has grown to become an increasingly urgent focus for businesses, with many implementing a \"triple bottom line\" framework \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which integrates social, environmental, and financial outcomes to evaluate sustainability.There has been a surge in eco-conscious investors in the Asia Pacific region, with 70 per cent claiming sustainability is a significant factor in their investment strategy, compared to 57 per cent just a year ago. Sustainability also influences consumers' purchasing decisions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 60 per cent of consumers globally rate it as an important purchase criterion.Businesses can no longer get away with being oblivious to the impact they have on the environment and communities they operate in, nor should they delay implementing sustainable practices to mitigate them. </p><p>This extends not only to large enterprises, but to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who make up the overwhelming majority of businesses worldwide.Oftentimes however, many SMEs lack the fundamental information or guidance on how to successfully implement environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. According to UOB's SME Outlook Study 2022, 3 in 5 small businesses in Singapore agree with the importance of incorporating sustainable practices in their businesses, but remain unsure of how to start.Using energy-efficient office equipment, recycling materials, or going paperless are small wins that SMEs can make regardless of where they are on their sustainability journey. For some small businesses, sustainability additionally inspires and drives product innovation. gush, a local Singaporean company specialising in sustainable paints and advanced building materials, invented a paint that transforms walls into passive air purifiers. Their products are odourless and have anti-mould, anti-bacterial and humidity-regulating properties.The founders both suffered from childhood asthma, exacerbated by the annual haze season. This shared experience inspired them to find a way to improve air quality indoors, and make spaces healthier for building occupants. Another brand making a difference in the world is Luxe Botanics. The beauty brand invested over 18 months on research and development to launch its line of all-natural, cruelty-free and and highly efficacious skincare products. The brand also opts for eco-friendly packaging, minimising the use of plastic, and their products are free from animal- or petrochemical-derived ingredients and synthetic fragrances. Working with partners that share the same sustainability ethos can be an easy initial step. Xero is one such partner, committed to making a positive impact on the environment and societies it operates in and assisting small businesses to meet their sustainability goals.Xero achieved carbon neutrality in 2021 and has further committed to various ESG initiatives to support local businesses and communities, including providing SMEs with sustainability guides and resources, as well as offering charities and non-profit organisations 25 per cent off their subscription fees. Leading the region, the Singapore government has announced that it will issue S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund green infrastructure projects. This initiative will provide SMEs with more opportunities to collaborate with government agencies or large corporate enterprises on green projects, as well as learn about green technologies that can potentially transform the business.Financial institutions are also lending a hand, with the DBS Foundation recently launching a new grant programme available for SMEs dedicated to creating innovative sustainability solutions.In a tough economic climate, SME owners are often preoccupied with the bottom line, but incorporating ESG initiatives can lead to new business opportunities, creative, groundbreaking strategies and an increased competitive edge.In a world where stakeholders are demanding that businesses be more accountable for their impact on the environment and their communities, doing good can also be good for business. And with support from the government, financial institutions and partners like Xero, it is the perfect time for SMEs to take that first step towards sustainability.Joseph Lyons is managing director of Xero Australia &amp; Asia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In a tough economic climate, SME owners are often preoccupied with the bottom line, but incorporating ESG initiatives can lead to new business opportunities, creative, groundbreaking strategies and an increased competitive edge.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65VX-7K61-DYX4-031W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

will be given a greater weighting in financial institutions' performance evaluations.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China's State Council has issued a new guideline aimed at accelerating the development of green finance and a low carbon economy.</p><p>The guideline, published on Monday (22 February), includes efforts by policymakers to ensure green finance intiatives at financial institutions are given a greater weight in how they are evaluated and assessed.</p><p>The move is part of efforts by Chinese policymakers to meet a nationwide target of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.</p><p>The PBOC (People's Bank of China) had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulationasia.com/pboc-to-step-up-efforts-to-advance-green-finance-agenda/\">indicated earlier this month</url> that it would be using green finance performance evaluations to incentivise financial institutions to increase their allocations towards green assets.</p><p>At the time, PBOC's Research Bureau Director Wang Xin said the measure will strengthen environmental risk management and help enhance the financial industry's ability to support green and low-carbon development.</p><p>In January, the Ministry of Finance also issued revised <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulationasia.com/china-implements-new-bank-performance-evaluation-mechanism/\">performance evaluation rules</url> for state-owned and state-controlled banks, which includes an indicator on how well they support green industries and companies.</p><p>The new State Council's guideline also requires that standards for green bonds be unified and standards for rating such bonds be created.</p><p>According to the guideline, green insurance and green credit will also be further developed, financial institutions will be aided in efforts to obtain green financing on the international market, and qualified green companies will be further supported in efforts to raise money in the capital markets.</p><p>Policymakers will also promote the convergence of international green finance standards in China and promote the two-way opening of the country's green finance market, the guideline says.</p><p>Other measures mentioned in the guideline include policy efforts to improve green pricing mechanisms, enhance fiscal and tax support for green infrastructure, speed up the construction of a green product certification system, and further develop <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.regulationasia.com/china-launches-national-carbon-emissions-trading-scheme/\">carbon rights trading</url> mechanisms.</p><p>The full guideline is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2021-02/22/content_5588274.htm\">available here</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting from

The initial momentum was fuelled by positive surprise around the pace of China's post-Covid re-opening, macro data and return of investment flows into the Hong Kong/China markets. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Northbound inflows via the Hong Kong-China Stock Connect into the China A-share bourses rose to a record US$20.88 billion last month, which is US$6 billion above the previous monthly record in December 2021. </p><p> With the sharp rally in Hong Kong/China equities, can this investor optimism and momentum carry on? We articulate two key reasons why the equity market revival is in its early phase, and how investing in China has changed course after the bruising experience of 2022.</p><p> 1. Upside economic surpriseSince China's abrupt zero-Covid policy reversal in November 2022, public health officials estimated that herd immunity has been achieved. Activity data in China has rebounded more sharply compared to other economies like India and Taiwan. Over the Chinese New Year holidays, national domestic tourism traffic and revenues were back to 89 per cent and 73 per cent of 2019 pre-pandemic levels, respectively. </p><p> A stronger than anticipated fourth quarter 2022 gross domestic product (GDP) prompted Bank of Singapore to raise our forecast for China's 2023 GDP growth from 4.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent, rebounding from 3 per cent growth in 2022. </p><p> China's policymakers are re-focusing on economic growth priorities in 2023, after addressing leadership transition and regulatory issues last year. We expect a broadly supportive stance across fiscal and industrial policies to reboot growth in 2023, as well as policy follow-ups from the key priorities announced at the Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) last year. </p><p> These will aim to boost domestic demand; accelerate industrial development, support public and private enterprises; boost foreign investment and manage economic and financial risks.</p><p> 2. Attractive set-up of fundamentalsUltimately, valuations of Chinese equities will need to be supported by earnings growth and fundamentals. Leading indicators of corporate profitability, such as manager surveys, are turning positive, and broadly signal an inflection point for earnings of Chinese companies. We believe that the stage is set for a sustainable bull market in Hong Kong and China equities in 2023, as we start from a relatively low base in terms of earnings expectations. </p><p> In particular, we favour sectors such as consumer, technology, renewables, green infrastructure and electric vehicles. These are areas exposed to the cyclical recovery that accompanies China's reopening, as well as sectors exposed to structural themes that will benefit from policy tailwinds in areas of economic development. </p><p> However, we expect near-term volatility as investors may tactically take profit, given the sharp rally year-to-date. We also caution that the overall investment thesis for global investors has been scarred after the bruising experiences of the past year. </p><p> The unwelcome mix of zero-Covid policies, regulatory and policy risks, as well as US-China geopolitical risks that caused sharp market corrections may have impacted the modus operandi for investors in China. </p><p> PositioningHow should investors be positioned to re-enter the China market'</p><p> 1) Watch the geopolitical risks: Relations between the United States and China are fraught with immense complexity as tensions between both sides ebb and rise. A recent illustration: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's previously scheduled meeting with his counterpart China Foreign Minister Qin Gang revived hopes that ties were set to improve. This has been dashed following the recent appearance and subsequent shooting down of a Chinese balloon flying across North America. </p><p> Such events weigh on Hong Kong/China markets, as investors actively price in greater downside risks should conflicts escalate. On the other hand, these episodes also help to create attractive entry points for well-prepared investors armed with rigorous analysis, sufficient dry powder and sufficiently long-term horizons. </p><p> 2) Increase in risk premium: The rise in volatility due to geopolitical and policy uncertainties weigh on investors' risk appetite for investing in China. Hence, investors may demand a higher rate of return going forward. Investors should also focus on higher quality companies in terms of their business models, earnings power and resilience amid global economic uncertainty and recessionary risks.</p><p> 3) Portfolio diversification across sectors and industries: While China's equity indices are skewed towards large-cap sectors such as technology and financials, the experience of the past two years has demonstrated the idiosyncratic risks of being overly exposed to individual sectors and companies. This was the case with China's property, after-school education and Internet platform sectors. </p><p> 4) Beneficiaries of China's economic recovery: In addition to direct beneficiaries, companies in the US, Europe and Asia are also potential investment candidates for investors seeking exposure to China's recovery. These include sectors that benefit from China travel and consumption trends, as well as global manufacturers as global supply chain linkages normalise. </p><p> Global impactOn the flip side, we are watchful of the global impact of China's re-opening on commodity prices and the complications it could pose for the Federal Reserve's inflation fight. </p><p> We remain overall neutral in our equities positioning, with an overweight position in Asia ex-Japan offsetting an underweight position in Europe. Within Asia, we remain constructive on markets across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</p><p> We continue to be broadly cautious of credit, as expressed through our underweight position in developed markets high yield (HY) bonds. In emerging markets, we are neutral on both investment grade and HY given the overall neutral risk-reward in terms of pricing and fundamentals. Bottom-up credit selection in this space remains key. </p><p> After journeying through a period of trying conditions, China's time in the sun has finally arrived. A mix of macro, regulatory, valuation and positioning tailwinds make Chinese markets increasingly attractive to global investors once again. </p><p> Investors are now keenly aware that there remain areas where extra vigilance is needed, such as geopolitical risks. </p><p> However, there are ample opportunities in China, especially compared to the challenging investment landscape for a number of major developed markets this year. </p><p> The writer is chief investment officer and head of portfolio management and research office, Bank of Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Screen displaying the Hang Seng stock index outside Hong Kong Exchanges.

The theme reflects how the global energy community has accelerated the pursuit of a greener future. Following the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) last year, there is strong momentum for countries to do more to decarbonise their economies and ride the green wave to reduce emissions. Recent events have also shown how sensitive energy markets are to geopolitical events, pushing energy security to the forefront of the global agenda. Asia, which accounts for almost half of the global energy demand, faces urgency to accelerate the deployment of renewables, fortify grid infrastructure, strengthen supply chain resilience of key fuels and develop regional interconnections to enhance security while keeping electricity accessible and affordable. Massive investments into regional grid connections, green infrastructure, electrification, green financing, technologies and supply chains for hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation, and storage would be needed to support the clean energy transition.</p><p>3. Against this backdrop, SIEW 2022 will discuss how the global energy community can ensure secure, diverse and resilient energy supply even as the world undergoes an energy transition. There will also be a focus on how governments and industries will work together to catalyse regional grid development and global supply chains for low carbon solutions such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and advance the development of renewable energy solutions such as geothermal and nuclear. SIEW will also address how to create an enabling environment to enhance innovation, research &amp; development, and global collaboration in the energy transition. The event will also discuss the opportunities and challenges as the region scales up investments for a green economy, and what roles can investors and financiers play.</p><p>4. The SIEW 2022 theme was announced at the hybrid Global Launch event featuring speakers from the International Energy Agency (IEA), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Siemens Energy, Sembcorp and SMBC. It also saw the launch of the Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2022 report by IEA, and the World Energy Transition Outlook report by IRENA. Highlights at SIEW 2022</p><p>5. SIEW 2022 marks the 15th edition as Asia's premier energy event. To commemorate this milestone, SIEW is launching a new podcast series, 'SIEWCast'. The SIEWCast series will feature energy thought leaders sharing their views on the energy transition through to 2050 as well as their strategic insights into our energy future.</p><p>6. SIEW will also feature exciting elements to welcome more delegates back in-person. Attendees can expect a line-up of exhibitions, networking receptions and a SIEW 15th Anniversary showcase this year to enhance their onsite experience. New this year, SIEW will introduce Techtables to complement the successful Thinktank Roundtable series. SIEW Techtables will focus discussions on the latest energy innovations and technologies.</p><p>7. SIEW's anchor events, the SIEW Opening Keynote Address and the Singapore Energy Summit, will also bring together energy ministers, industry captains and international organisation chiefs to address timely topics to set the scene for discussion across the week including: (i) Securing a Sustainable and Resilient Energy Future, (ii) Accelerating Low-Carbon Solutions and (iii) Mobilising Greener Financing for Energy Infrastructure among others.</p><p>8. Singapore will also partner international energy organisations to host key events. These include the: (i) Singapore-IEA Ministerial Roundtable that will focus on Energy Security in a Low Carbon World and (ii) 2nd Singapore-IRENA High-level Forum on energy investments, green financing and the launch of the end-user electrification report.</p><p>9. SIEW 2022 will also welcome the return of the Asia Clean Energy Summit (ACES), Asian Downstream Summit (ADS), Future of the Grid, and LNG and Hydrogen Gas Markets Asia as partner events.</p><p>10. SIEW 2022 will take place in Singapore from 25 to 28 October 2022. Delegates can register their interest to attend the event on the SIEW website (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siew.gov.sg\">www.siew.gov.sg</url>). More updates will be shared when registration opens in July.</p><p>Source: Energy Market Authority of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Energy, Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0058631208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65H2-MN91-DXMP-K2VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 18, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS335110 ELECTRIC LAMP BULB &amp;

Technology is a powerful enabler. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We speak to the experts about the opportunities in climate-related tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Q: What is the opportunity set in climate tech for investors, and what types of innovation are most promising? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Xiaying Zhang: We believe the market opportunity for mitigation- and adaptation-related climate solutions is enormous and necessary. While some individuals and companies may be willing to make trade-offs for more climate-friendly solutions, it is unlikely that society will accept trade-offs at the scale needed. People are unlikely to stop travelling and consuming, and businesses are unlikely to stop producing. </p><p> Regulation will be essential, but ultimately, solutions will need to be market-driven and stand on their own to be truly scalable.</p><p> The range of investable climate solutions continues to broaden and expand. We continue to see declining costs and increased market adoption in areas such as renewables and electric vehicles (EVs), and this is likely to ramp up over time with ongoing scientific and technological innovation -- for example, advances in solar materials and battery technology.</p><p> Regarding adaptation, improved near-term weather and longer-term climate forecasting should help companies adjust their operations in real time to account for extreme weather events and to incorporate future climate risks into long-term asset planning. Parametric weather insurance is emerging as a way for businesses and consumers to hedge their revenue or asset risk around weather-related risks. </p><p> Together, these combine into a wide range of potentially high-return, high-impact opportunities, particularly within growth-stage climate-tech companies.</p><p> We also think several secular trends support disruptive climate-focused entrepreneurs. For example, as the list of countries and corporations committed to net-zero emissions grows, we expect high levels of global infrastructure spend, creating a foundation for innovative, asset-light companies to build on. </p><p> In addition, consumers are demanding transparency and choices that match their climate-related values, and companies are in search of innovation that can help them meet that demand. </p><p> In our view, this creates an enormous opportunity for innovations and technology that address climate change while delivering a superior user experience without trade-offs. We see all of this reflected in the growth of climate-related investments across public and private markets.</p><p> Rachel Teo: Based on the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 report -- which sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 -- the investable opportunity until 2050 in the scenario where net zero is indeed achieved by mid-century is approximately US$126 trillion, or US$4.2 trillion a year over the next 30 years. </p><p> However, even in a Stated Policies Scenario, as the IEA calls it, there is still significant momentum behind green solutions because of favourable conditions -- such as existing and committed climate actions by governments, and the fall in climate change-related technology costs. </p><p> The opportunity set for investors when it comes to technology solutions that aid the transition lies both within transition assets and green solutions providers. </p><p> The former focuses on supporting high-carbon businesses that are credibly transitioning towards low-carbon business models, while the latter is about funding companies that are providing decarbonisation solutions for transitioning businesses and the economy at large. In both categories, the opportunity set for investors is broad -- spanning public and private markets and across the full capital structure.</p><p> Among six sectors that climate technologies can be categorised into (such as electricity, transport, buildings, industrial processes, low-emission fuels, and agriculture, forestry and other land use), electricity and transport represent the largest investment opportunities. </p><p> Some technological solutions are already well established, such as solar and wind. But many are still nascent or early-stage, such as direct air capture (DAC), green hydrogen and nuclear fusion. </p><p> While we do see many promising innovations, GIC's investment decisions are based on value creation and returns, including factors such as attractive risk-reward proposition and a good path to commercialisation. </p><p> At GIC, we invest across both the entire technology spectrum and various stages of a company's growth because of our long-term orientation, flexible capital, and multi-asset portfolio. Our investments range from private equity (in technologies such as carbon capture or green steel) to infrastructure (in a company building EV charging infrastructure) to public equity (in an environmental, social and governance or ESG data provider), to debt financing (for companies working on geothermal energy solutions). This breadth allows us not only to invest in multiple innovative solutions, but also to support firms at various stages of development.</p><p> Mathieu Forcioli: As a bank, we have a leading role to play in mobilising the transition to net zero by supporting our customers in their own transition to lower emissions. This involves helping companies access sustainable finance and expertise, and investing in climate solutions in collaboration with our partners and investors all over the world to scale up new technologies and approaches at pace.</p><p> The global race to net zero presents an opportunity for investors, such as opening up new asset classes and products targeting, for example, technology and green infrastructure. At this stage, however, it is estimated that around half the technologies needed to meet the challenge are not yet commercially deployable and require rapid scaling-up. </p><p> To date, the major focus in terms of decarbonisation has been low-carbon power generation, but we know this will not be enough to meet targets. Reducing emissions in the transport sector is another focal point, helping to drive substantial disruption in the auto and mobility industries from new competitors and technologies. </p><p> Therefore, one pertinent theme for investors today is \"future transport\". The IEA estimates that 6 per cent of cumulative emission reductions in 2021-2050 could be achieved by using hydrogen-based fuels. Globally, government policy is driving both infrastructure development and vehicle transition via fuel standards, emission targets and incentives. Major vehicle manufacturers are accelerating their push to launch zero-carbon electric truck models, based both on battery and hydrogen fuel cell drivetrain technologies. </p><p> And, more broadly, the convergence of mobility and technology underscores the structural importance of semiconductors and software. This is an exciting opportunity for investors. </p><p> Cutting-edge, smart technologies and tech-based solutions can also help preserve nature, thereby indirectly contributing to net-zero emissions. </p><p> We see many compelling examples of this, such as the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to convert food waste into insect-based animal feed, thereby helping reduce waste, carbon emissions and deforestation, and the use of agricultural methane detection technology to help cut emissions, reverse forest loss and regenerate biodiversity. </p><p> In addition, the application of financial technology to the climate change challenge is bringing new investment solutions and opportunities to the VC space, which are all important in the transition towards net-zero emissions.</p><p> Q: Venture capital is an avenue for investors to get exposure to climate tech. What are some of the challenges investors face when investing in climate tech'</p><p> Zhang: The climate crisis represents a useful example whereby many venture-stage companies are developing new technologies, which may play a key role in helping every sector of the economy transform by reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency, and making global energy supply more sustainable. </p><p> At the same time, investors should not overlook that investing in these more illiquid private companies comes with specific risks. Therefore, this is only appropriate for investors who can take a long-term approach, as exiting an investment in the event of financial or sustained underperformance may be difficult. Moreover, transparency and governance may be more limited compared to investments in publicly listed companies. </p><p> Overall, some of these management teams may have less experience with public shareholder scrutiny and engagement than existing public companies.</p><p> Investors need to ensure that the investee companies ultimately deliver real-world solutions in the fight against climate change -- meaning the rigorous measurement of actual impact is critical when identifying and monitoring investments.</p><p> However, impact measurement in private markets -- particularly in VC -- has specific considerations, including data availability and uncertainty, given that many of these companies are innovators and disrupters aiming to transform the industry. </p><p> Further, if the investment thesis involves an innovative company with a new, first-to-market solution that is expected to be widely adopted, it is important to consider both the individual company and the potential ecosystem change.</p><p> Teo: Given the early-stage nature of venture investing, there are many challenges for investors, particularly in evaluating the technology and the commercialisation risk. For some climate technologies, the solutions are still pre-commercialisation or scale-up. These require significant upfront capital and potentially years of research before any revenue is generated. </p><p> In some cases, there may be significant asset management requirements to help company management teams develop business strategy, support growth, and monitor performance. For investors, the bar for domain expertise to be able to evaluate opportunities is thus very high.</p><p> Additionally, business models may not be proven yet, and investors face significant uncertainties regarding the supporting ecosystem or infrastructure, including policies and regulations. </p><p> The upshot, however, is that a climate tech startup which successfully achieves commercialisation is likely to have deeper competitive moats, making it tougher for competitors to replicate its products.</p><p> Climate technology presents unique organisational challenges for investors. As climate tech covers a wide range of sectors and markets, investment teams require broad-based sector and regional experience. Furthermore, a long-term mindset is required to understand the full value of climate-tech solutions, as well as patience to support companies in their scaling-up. </p><p> The climate-tech ecosystem is a quickly evolving one, with new companies having the potential to disrupt incumbents. Engaging early in this space in a considered and controlled manner allows GIC to understand the evolution of these promising technologies and better discern the winners. All investments, however, still carry risks. We look at these very carefully, put them through our stringent investment due diligence process, and subject them to risk controls which include starting with small investments and scaling up only when investments are sufficiently de-risked.</p><p> Forcioli: By some estimates, over a quarter of all VC funding goes into climate technology, with strong growth over the last decade. Still, the amounts we are speaking about represent a fraction of total flows into private equity and VC, and fluctuate each year, which may impact the sustainability and growth of the climate-tech ecosystem. Thus, challenges remain along the road to fulfilling the climate objective. </p><p> For example, while the long-term nature of private market investments lends itself to investing in technology, the illiquid nature of the investment and the uncertainty of cash flow generation later in life may suit a smaller pool of investors from a risk-return perspective. </p><p> Factor in the time and risk involved in research and development -- and, in many cases, a fund's lack of track record -- and it is reasonable to see how this combination of longer time frames and unproven technology does not work for many VC investors, who typically want to see returns in five to seven years. On top of this, investors can find it challenging to monitor impact outcomes or assess the alignment of sustainability objectives to a portfolio company or fund manager due to a lack of benchmarks and data, which makes reporting and disclosure more difficult.</p><p> But with challenges come opportunities. We see promising structural growth opportunities in clean energy and green technologies, including in innovations in solar, wind and hydrogen power, EVs, and green infrastructure such as flood walls which increase resilience of urban areas to natural disasters. Nature-based solutions in \"climate smart\" city planning can benefit city dwellers, reduce the carbon footprint and promote biological diversity.</p><p> Q: In climate tech, how should impact be measured and tracked; and how do you set investor expectations for the likely outcomes'</p><p> Zhang: We believe there are a few best practices that may help companies and investors navigate the unique challenges of measuring impact in this constantly evolving space. In setting investor expectations, there are four ways to authentically measure the progress companies create: </p><p> Teo: At a baseline level, tracking the financial performance and subjecting the company to the same standard of financial discipline as non-climate-tech companies are important and a key focus at GIC.</p><p> Impact measurement is an evolving space and best practices are still developing. Some possible measures could include activity-based metrics, such as the amount of fossil fuel-powered energy usage the technology replaces (or has the potential to replace), or the amount of clean energy generated. </p><p> We could also look to emissions-based metrics, including avoided emissions, which is something that GIC is evaluating. For solutions such as DAC, the relevant metric could be how much carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere. </p><p> Metrics could also be revenue-based, such as measuring the percentage of green revenues generated by the company based on globally accepted taxonomies. </p><p> Forcioli: Investors are looking for a greater level of transparency in portfolio companies and a higher utility level from deployed capital. The measurement and tracking of impact largely depends on the level of disclosure from portfolio companies and the availability of data. In general, impact measurement can be conducted via quantitative assessment and mission-alignment measurement. </p><p> For a quantitative assessment, a manager may employ a proprietary impact assessment tool to identify and assess ESG objectives, which are tracked using indicators such the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals or other climate-related science-based targets. For example, corporates may report active emission-reduction targets by years or Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> Alternatively, an investment manager may select bespoke KPIs for each investment to align mission and measurement. However, this approach may limit the ability to make comparisons across different investments, as the metrics can differ. </p><p> With the rapid development of climate tech, investment managers have also evolved their own measurement methodologies with the help of sustainability consultancies and agencies, but industry standardisation remains a work in progress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-611ETQQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67GV-5N21-DYX4-00N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Climate change, as described by the United Nations, has become the greatest threat to human security, and has evolved beyond just an environmental problem. Sustainability has grown to become an increasingly urgent focus for businesses, with many implementing a \"triple bottom line\" framework -- which integrates social, environmental, and financial outcomes to evaluate sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There has been a surge in eco-conscious investors in the Asia Pacific region, with 70 per cent claiming sustainability is a significant factor in their investment strategy, compared to 57 per cent just a year ago. Sustainability also influences consumers' purchasing decisions -- 60 per cent of consumers globally rate it as an important purchase criterion.</p><p> Businesses can no longer get away with being oblivious to the impact they have on the environment and communities they operate in, nor should they delay implementing sustainable practices to mitigate them. This extends not only to large enterprises, but to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who make up the overwhelming majority of businesses worldwide.</p><p> Oftentimes however, many SMEs lack the fundamental information or guidance on how to successfully implement environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. According to UOB's SME Outlook Study 2022, 3 in 5 small businesses in Singapore agree with the importance of incorporating sustainable practices in their businesses, but remain unsure of how to start.</p><p> Using energy-efficient office equipment, recycling materials, or going paperless are small wins that SMEs can make regardless of where they are on their sustainability journey. For some small businesses, sustainability additionally inspires and drives product innovation. </p><p> gush, a local Singaporean company specialising in sustainable paints and advanced building materials, invented a paint that transforms walls into passive air purifiers. Their products are odourless and have anti-mould, anti-bacterial and humidity-regulating properties.</p><p> The founders both suffered from childhood asthma, exacerbated by the annual haze season. This shared experience inspired them to find a way to improve air quality indoors, and make spaces healthier for building occupants. </p><p> Another brand making a difference in the world is Luxe Botanics. The beauty brand invested over 18 months on research and development to launch its line of all-natural, cruelty-free and and highly efficacious skincare products. The brand also opts for eco-friendly packaging, minimising the use of plastic, and their products are free from animal- or petrochemical-derived ingredients and synthetic fragrances. </p><p> Working with partners that share the same sustainability ethos can be an easy initial step. Xero is one such partner, committed to making a positive impact on the environment and societies it operates in and assisting small businesses to meet their sustainability goals.</p><p> Xero achieved carbon neutrality in 2021 and has further committed to various ESG initiatives to support local businesses and communities, including providing SMEs with sustainability guides and resources, as well as offering charities and non-profit organisations 25 per cent off their subscription fees. </p><p> Leading the region, the Singapore government has announced that it will issue S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund green infrastructure projects. This initiative will provide SMEs with more opportunities to collaborate with government agencies or large corporate enterprises on green projects, as well as learn about green technologies that can potentially transform the business.</p><p> Financial institutions are also lending a hand, with the DBS Foundation recently launching a new grant programme available for SMEs dedicated to creating innovative sustainability solutions.</p><p> In a tough economic climate, SME owners are often preoccupied with the bottom line, but incorporating ESG initiatives can lead to new business opportunities, creative, groundbreaking strategies and an increased competitive edge.</p><p> In a world where stakeholders are demanding that businesses be more accountable for their impact on the environment and their communities, doing good can also be good for business. And with support from the government, financial institutions and partners like Xero, it is the perfect time for SMEs to take that first step towards sustainability.</p><p> The writer is managing director of Xero Australia &amp; Asia.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In a world where stakeholders are demanding that businesses be more accountable for their impact on the environment and their communities, doing good can also be good for business.

There is a joint understanding among the 27 member states that only if all the member economies pick up more or less at the same time can the single market be strengthened.\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;FUNDING THE GREEN TRANSITION&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Of the (EURO)800 billion, some will be spent on accelerating digitalisation, but at least 30 per cent, or around (EURO)250 billion, will be earmarked to support a \"green transition\". Comprising both loans and grants, the funds will be directed to help build the infrastructure, develop technologies and support projects to accelerate decarbonisation throughout the EU. \"The disbursement of funds is conditional on meeting certain milestones and targets,\" Dr Hahn explained. \"We only pay if these are fulfilled - not on the basis of assumptions, but actual deliveries.\"</p><p> There are clear definitions of what investments are \"green\" and sustainable, he said, based on recommendations by the International Capital Markets Association as well as second opinions. The EU has also developed its own reporting guidelines, and information on the projects that are supported is published and has been updated every week since March. By the end of the year, the information will be updated every day. \"So you can see exactly in what areas the investments have taken place,\" said Dr Hahn. \"Market players need to know that what they are investing in is really 'green'.\" Thus, he claims that NGBs are a game changer in that, besides providing the resources for the EU's green transition, they are transparent and credible and set international standards.</p><p> So far, the EU has issued around (EURO)28 billion worth of NGBs, including an issue of (EURO)12 billion in a single day in October, which was oversubscribed, which means that demand exceeded supply. \"Recently, we had an issue that was oversubscribed by 10 times,\" Dr Hahn pointed out. \"So there is huge interest.\" He added that the EU's green bonds also enjoy a premium, which he called a \"greenium\", of around two basis points compared with other green bond issues, which means that they can pay a lower yield.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SINGAPORE AS A REGIONAL HUB&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Many other countries, including Singapore, are also interested in issuing green bonds. The Singapore Government plans to issue $35 billion worth of such bonds by 2030 to finance green infrastructure projects. The fact that Singapore is positioning itself as a regional hub for green bond issuance is \"a very positive development\", said Dr Hahn. \"So we are, in a way, allies, and that is why I have chosen Singapore as my first destination in the region, because I know it's a fertile ground for these ideas.\"</p><p> While in Singapore, Dr Hahn met Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director Ravi Menon, Temasek CEO Dilhan Pillay and GIC CEO Lim Chow Kiat. After Singapore, he travelled to Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bangkok.</p><p> So far, around half of all green bonds are denominated in euros, \"which shows who is leading the process\", he pointed out. \"But what is positive is that there are more issuances in other currencies as well.\" The total issuance of green bonds worldwide amounts to around (EURO)1 trillion. \"That sounds like a lot, but the issuance in the bond market overall is around (EURO)130 trillion,\" said Dr Hahn. \"So there is still a lot of potential.\"</p><p> However, green bonds are taking off at a time when interest rates are rising, including in the euro zone. Last week, the European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, by 50 basis points. Rates around the world have also risen and are likely to go up further in the face of inflationary pressures. Rising interest rates depress bond prices, which can discourage issuance.</p><p> \"Whenever you introduce something new, there's always a question mark around whether it's the right time,\" said Dr Hahn. \"We need to be pragmatic and flexible about how fast we go ahead. But about the direction, there can't be any doubt. As (former UN secretary-general) Ban Ki Moon said: 'There is no plan B for this planet, because there is only one planet.'\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SHORT-TERM ENERGY CHALLENGES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;But while green bonds will play a vital role in financing the move to green infrastructure and more sustainable business practices in the medium to long term, the world has to grapple with shortages of mostly fossil-fuel-based energy in the short term. The challenge is especially acute in Europe, where many countries - including its largest economy, Germany - are heavily dependent on natural gas from Russia to meet their energy needs.</p><p> Recently, gas supplies were interrupted for two weeks because of maintenance problems related to the pipeline Nord Stream 1, which is the biggest gas link between Russia and Europe. Although supplies resumed last week, the flows are limited to around 40 per cent of the pipeline's capacity. Many analysts fear that supplies could continue to be interrupted periodically by Russia - especially during winter, when energy demand is high - under the pretext of maintenance problems, as a form of retaliation by Moscow against EU sanctions on Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine. Indeed, this week, Russia's energy giant Gazprom announced a further cut in gas supplies to 20 per cent of Nord Stream 1's capacity, citing technical problems.</p><p> Dr Hahn pointed out that Europe has done a lot to offset the potential loss of energy supplies from Russia. For instance, it has increased its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by about 75 per cent since the outbreak of the war, including by tripling imports from the United States. It has created energy partnerships with Egypt, Israel, Algeria and Azerbaijan and obtained more oil from Norway. And it is exploring joint procurement of gas to reduce import costs, as well as increasing its storage capacity.</p><p> The EU is also planning to roll out measures to promote energy savings with a view to reducing energy consumption by at least 40 per cent by 2030, relative to 2007 projections. \"For instance, it can make a big difference if you reduce the average temperature for heating by even one degree centigrade in the winter in public buildings and cool less in the summer,\" said Dr Hahn. \"So we have done what a business leader would have to do, which is to diversify risks and increase risk sharing,\" he pointed out.</p><p> He acknowledged that there were challenges. For instance, different EU countries have different needs when it comes to energy infrastructure. Some have LNG terminals, while landlocked countries, like Dr Hahn's native Austria, have to depend more on pipelines. The energy mix also varies from country to country, with some still using coal, some more dependent on gas and oil, and others depending on nuclear energy. \"I am nevertheless confident for this winter,\" he said.</p><p> Dr Hahn expects energy prices to remain elevated. \"They may come down a bit, but they will definitely be higher than before the war.\" The high prices have triggered discussions in some of the EU's member states to put price caps on electricity bills. \"Politicians are challenged to help people in these difficult times because in many countries electricity bills have doubled since last year,\" he pointed out. \"But the most realistic approach is to provide targeted support to those who are in need,\" he said. \"It doesn't make sense to subsidise high-income people. Also, capping prices won't encourage energy savings. This is also linked to our climate goals - looking beyond the current crisis, we need to motivate people to invest in energy savings.\"</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;NO 'SANCTIONS FATIGUE'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Dr Hahn sees little danger of \"sanctions fatigue\" whereby EU citizens, hard-pressed by higher energy prices and inflation, would clamour for the punitive measures against Russia to be relaxed.</p><p> \"Look at the solidarity of people on the issue of Ukraine,\" he pointed out. \"We have received more than seven million refugees, which is far more than during the refugee wave in 2015. The readiness of people to even host refugees in their own homes is really unique and gives support to politicians taking the decisions.</p><p> \"Sanctions have their justification; they're about respecting territorial sovereignty, which is not negotiable,\" he pointed out.</p><p> He believes the sanctions will be effective. \"We know that the Russian people are used to suffering more than Europeans, but over time there will be an impact. Russia is finding it difficult to get spare parts for aeroplanes, has less access to electronic equipment and other technologies, and is excluded from the Swift payments messaging system. All this will have an impact in the medium and long term. Besides, once sanctions are in place, it's done and people accept it, including the business sector. The biggest challenge was to get the sanctions approved.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1070992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6615-NBF1-DYX4-02CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Governments are looking to enact policies and strengthen their mitigation measures for climate change even as they continue to drive economic development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This growing momentum towards sustainability is particularly important in Singapore and the rest of South-east Asia, where the impact of climate change is expected to rapidly intensify.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Launched last year, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 lays out a national road map towards sustainable development and net-zero emissions.</p><p> With countries transiting towards a low-carbon future, the pressure to transform will in turn impact the industry level. </p><p> Businesses face heightened pressure from customers, investors, employees, regulators and other stakeholders, to adopt sustainable practices and integrate sustainability into their business strategies and operations.</p><p> Innovation key to solving sustainability challengesThe global demand for green solutions is expected to grow, presenting new business opportunities for startups, enterprises and corporates alike to build competitive advantages, innovate, and develop new green and sustainable solutions.</p><p> As a key hub in Asia, Singapore is well placed to support these sustainability efforts. We offer international partners and companies a suitable base from which to plug into the sustainability needs of the region, to innovate, and scale up.</p><p> There are various initiatives in place to drive this. </p><p> The government's Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan supports the development and commercialisation of innovative solutions in areas such as clean and renewable energy, circular economy, and low-carbon solutions.</p><p> Last year, Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) introduced a S$180 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP) to support companies to incorporate sustainability across their business operations and build capabilities in areas such as resource optimisation and standards adoption. Innovative businesses looking to develop products and services to address our climate and sustainability challenges can also leverage this.</p><p> Green finance as an enabling toolWith significant financing and investments needed to enable the green transition and decarbonise the global economy, the demand for green financing will only continue to rise. </p><p> A recent report by Bain and Temasek on South-east Asia's green economy indicates that the demand for green finance in the region is set to reach more than US$3 trillion by 2030.</p><p> Access to such financing will enable enterprises to capture emerging opportunities in the green economy, such as to conduct research and development activities and eventually commercialise new innovative solutions.</p><p> Crucially, for businesses seeking to obtain green loans or investments, demonstrating their environmental, social and governance efforts will allow them to raise the chances of unlocking capital from a wider pool of financiers who are aligned with their sustainability goals.</p><p> The good news is that the banks and investors here are also placing greater emphasis on sustainability projects, integrating sustainability into their loan and investment evaluation frameworks and processes. </p><p> Financial providers, including commercial banks, multilateral development banks and impact investors, are taking measures to provide clarity on the requirements to qualify for green financing, including relevant green standards or certifications.</p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also established the Green Finance Industry Taskforce to develop a taxonomy that aims to set out clear definitions and criteria about what activities can be considered green, or in transition towards green. </p><p> This provides a common language required to provide clarity and confidence to financiers for green projects.</p><p> Increasing access to green financingVarious government agencies have stepped up efforts to enhance enterprises' access to green financing.</p><p> For example, the MAS offers grant schemes that defray the incremental costs of corporates taking up green and sustainable bonds and loans.</p><p> Alongside the ESP, EnterpriseSG launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme -- Green (EFS-Green) last October to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to better access green financing and support the development of technologies and solutions to reduce waste, resource use and greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p> By providing a 70 per cent risk-share, EFS-Green aims to catalyse lending from our partner financial institutions -- DBS, UOB, OCBC, HSBC and CIMB -- to SMEs in sectors such as clean energy, circular economy, green infrastructure and clean transportation. This has seen good response since the launch of the scheme. </p><p> Close to S$100 million in green loans has been catalysed for more than 30 SMEs, spanning areas in solar energy, energy storage, energy efficiency technologies, electric-vehicle technologies, green maritime solutions, green construction technologies, as well as recycling, re-utilisation, remanufacturing and refurbishing of materials and waste.</p><p> Through a green loan by DBS, solar energy developer Novasix was able to capture new opportunities by developing the SolarNova Phase 6 Project with the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB). </p><p> It will deploy solar panels across close to 1,200 HDB blocks and 60 government sites. With a solar capacity of 70 megawatt-peak, the project will accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in Singapore, contributing to the nation's efforts to develop smart estates by harnessing green energy.</p><p> Some local enterprises have tapped EFS-Green to scale their innovative green technologies abroad. </p><p> An example is sustainability artificial-intelligence (AI) company Evercomm Singapore, which designs and provides innovative AI-driven Asset Performance Management solutions. </p><p> Its Internet-of-Things devices help buildings and infrastructure assets assess and track energy use to improve their energy consumption and operational efficiency. </p><p> The company received an EFS-Green loan from OCBC, which will enable it to scale up its hardware deployment to capture demand in regional markets such as Malaysia and Thailand.</p><p> Riding on the growing global demand for green solutions, there is no better time for enterprises to step up and harness green financing to push the boundaries of innovation.</p><p> This in turn will accelerate the industries' adoption of green solutions and technologies to solve their sustainability challenges and bring us closer towards our climate goals and a low-carbon future.</p><p> The writer is assistant chief executive officer, Enterprise Singapore. He oversees the Urban Solutions, Sustainability &amp; Enterprise Finance portfolios.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>With significant financing and investments needed to enable the green transition and decarbonise the global economy, the demand for green financing will only continue to rise.

Governments are looking to enact policies and strengthen their mitigation measures for climate change even as they continue to drive economic development.This growing momentum towards sustainability is particularly important in Singapore and the rest of South-east Asia, where the impact of climate change is expected to rapidly intensify.Launched last year, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 lays out a national road map towards sustainable development and net-zero emissions.With countries transiting towards a low-carbon future, the pressure to transform will in turn impact the industry level. Businesses face heightened pressure from customers, investors, employees, regulators and other stakeholders, to adopt sustainable practices and integrate sustainability into their business strategies and operations.Innovation key to solving sustainability challengesThe global demand for green solutions is expected to grow, presenting new business opportunities for startups, enterprises and corporates alike to build competitive advantages, innovate, and develop new green and sustainable solutions.As a key hub in Asia, Singapore is well placed to support these sustainability efforts. We offer international partners and companies a suitable base from which to plug into the sustainability needs of the region, to innovate, and scale up.There are various initiatives in place to drive this. </p><p>The government's Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan supports the development and commercialisation of innovative solutions in areas such as clean and renewable energy, circular economy, and low-carbon solutions.Last year, Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) introduced a S$180 million Enterprise Sustainability Programme (ESP) to support companies to incorporate sustainability across their business operations and build capabilities in areas such as resource optimisation and standards adoption. Innovative businesses looking to develop products and services to address our climate and sustainability challenges can also leverage this.Green finance as an enabling toolWith significant financing and investments needed to enable the green transition and decarbonise the global economy, the demand for green financing will only continue to rise. A recent report by Bain and Temasek on South-east Asia's green economy indicates that the demand for green finance in the region is set to reach more than US$3 trillion by 2030.Access to such financing will enable enterprises to capture emerging opportunities in the green economy, such as to conduct research and development activities and eventually commercialise new innovative solutions.Crucially, for businesses seeking to obtain green loans or investments, demonstrating their environmental, social and governance efforts will allow them to raise the chances of unlocking capital from a wider pool of financiers who are aligned with their sustainability goals.The good news is that the banks and investors here are also placing greater emphasis on sustainability projects, integrating sustainability into their loan and investment evaluation frameworks and processes. Financial providers, including commercial banks, multilateral development banks and impact investors, are taking measures to provide clarity on the requirements to qualify for green financing, including relevant green standards or certifications.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also established the Green Finance Industry Taskforce to develop a taxonomy that aims to set out clear definitions and criteria about what activities can be considered green, or in transition towards green. This provides a common language required to provide clarity and confidence to financiers for green projects.Increasing access to green financingVarious government agencies have stepped up efforts to enhance enterprises' access to green financing.For example, the MAS offers grant schemes that defray the incremental costs of corporates taking up green and sustainable bonds and loans.Alongside the ESP, EnterpriseSG launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme - Green (EFS-Green) last October to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to better access green financing and support the development of technologies and solutions to reduce waste, resource use and greenhouse-gas emissions.By providing a 70 per cent risk-share, EFS-Green aims to catalyse lending from our partner financial institutions - DBS, UOB, OCBC, HSBC and CIMB - to SMEs in sectors such as clean energy, circular economy, green infrastructure and clean transportation. This has seen good response since the launch of the scheme. Close to S$100 million in green loans has been catalysed for more than 30 SMEs, spanning areas in solar energy, energy storage, energy efficiency technologies, electric-vehicle technologies, green maritime solutions, green construction technologies, as well as recycling, re-utilisation, remanufacturing and refurbishing of materials and waste.Through a green loan by DBS, solar energy developer Novasix was able to capture new opportunities by developing the SolarNova Phase 6 Project with the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB). It will deploy solar panels across close to 1,200 HDB blocks and 60 government sites. With a solar capacity of 70 megawatt-peak, the project will accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in Singapore, contributing to the nation's efforts to develop smart estates by harnessing green energy.Some local enterprises have tapped EFS-Green to scale their innovative green technologies abroad. An example is sustainability artificial-intelligence (AI) company Evercomm Singapore, which designs and provides innovative AI-driven Asset Performance Management solutions. Its Internet-of-Things devices help buildings and infrastructure assets assess and track energy use to improve their energy consumption and operational efficiency. The company received an EFS-Green loan from OCBC, which will enable it to scale up its hardware deployment to capture demand in regional markets such as Malaysia and Thailand.Riding on the growing global demand for green solutions, there is no better time for enterprises to step up and harness green financing to push the boundaries of innovation.This in turn will accelerate the industries' adoption of green solutions and technologies to solve their sustainability challenges and bring us closer towards our climate goals and a low-carbon future.The writer is assistant chief executive officer, Enterprise Singapore.

Good morning, thank you for inviting me. It is my pleasure to join you this morning at the 36th CIO workshop. I am heartened by the organising team's choice to bring together this group to talk about issues of environmental sustainability. And I think the opportunity to discuss the best practices; share ideas of prevailing challenges that we all face, such as how to bring this industry and the environmental sustainability agenda forward, is going to be very useful.</p><p>2. In this room, we recognise the potential for innovative technology solutions to catalyse transformation within our organisations; industries; and business models. That technologically driven transformation allows us to deliver our missions more effectively and productively. However, not all would have developed as deep an understanding of the potential for technology solutions to uplift our organisation's environmental sustainability and resilience.</p><p>3. Today, I will share some thoughts on the opportunities at the convergence of technology and environmental sustainability, and how we can strategically position ourselves to unlock opportunities for our organisations, Singapore, and the world.</p><p>4. Sustainability has always been part of Singapore's DNA, even before the term \"sustainability\" became common. Once, during a certain age, the term \"green\" in Singapore was always preceded by \"clean and\". We were talking about greening our city for a long time. There was this recognition in our society, governance and development. But the idea that \"we are not just small, but also constrained\" - that resource output, carbon output, the factors of production - were always limited for us. This meant that we had to think about \"being green\" before we scientifically understood the environmental cost. We find ourselves now in transition, where much of the world has understood the same challenges.</p><p>5. In 2022, we renewed this commitment through our Green Plan to achieve net zero by 2050. The public sector is committed to lead this via our GreenGov.sg initiative. To achieve this, we will continue to develop innovative solutions and changes in how we operate.</p><p>6. We have made progress in sustainability of the built environment through infrastructure improvements which promote walking, cycling and public transport, enhancing energy efficiency such as through the use of LED and energy saving devices, and cultivating communities to care for the environment.</p><p>7. As an ICT community, we are powering the digitalisation and transformation across sectors. Therefore, if we take active steps across our value chain to enable this increasingly Green ICT and unlock ICT for Green, we can bring very significant benefits to all. While this is a nascent space, it is timely to think about what our approach might be and what we should put effort and priority on.</p><p>8. Green ICT could take many forms such as:</p><p>i. adapting data centres to be more energy efficient,</p><p>ii. adopting green software and software development practices that minimise energy consumption and</p><p>iii. exploring green ICT products and services with lower emissions profile.</p><p>9. To catalyse these efforts, we have prioritised sustainability as a key theme in our Next Bound of Digital Government. We have recently launched our Digital Connectivity Blueprint (DCB) detailing some of the things we will need to do in the next 5 to 10 years to make sure of infrastructure that supports our technology and ICT transformation here in Singapore is - robust, resilient, fit for purpose - and you will find throughout that document, repeated commitments to an increasingly green infrastructure standard. Green ICT will also be a consideration in our procurement practices. We cannot do it on our own and need industry to widen the range of cost-effective sustainable products and services.</p><p>10. Green ICT has to be harnessed as a means of pursuing sustainability. This includes:</p><p>i. using modelling and simulation tools to optimise planning and design options which leads to reduced emission pressures - such as building configurations that optimise environment factors requiring less energy for cooling and locating EV chargers to promote adoption of EVs,</p><p>ii. implementing smart systems in buildings, such as smart lifts which are both energy efficient and reliable and</p><p>iii. employing sustainability monitoring and reporting tools to help households reduce energy consumption and businesses to access green financing.</p><p>11. We see these starting to manifest in our new towns, such as Punggol, which is greener. We have the Punggol Digital District, developing jobs in this ecosystem and industry. Punggol as a town is also greener. We have made a deliberate effort to make sure the environment has that ecological footprint. We have used micro-climatic simulation which informed the town layout during the planning stage improving wind flow; and smart lifts, utility meters, lighting, pumps, irrigation are deployed within the estate today. These technologies have improved over the last few decades and HDB has done this over 20 - 25 years and you can see different stages of these implementations, informing us how we might take these technologies and implement around field sites across Singapore. These solutions, together with changes in business models have the potential to scale across both brownfield and greenfield sites, and potentially offer good returns on investment.</p><p>12. In this space, we can't get things done without data. We need fit-for-purpose data to drive the above innovations; the tools alone will not deliver the desired outcomes. Simulations rely on representative data as inputs to the studies; smart systems will depend on timely and accurate data to inform decisions, and reporting standards requires reliable and efficient data sources if the reporting standards were to play their part as adequate safeguards.</p><p>13. These are unfortunately not easy to address, as data may at times be costly to collect and manage; there may also be different interests between the data owners and data consumers. Having robust governance mechanisms to facilitate data sharing among public and private stakeholders, is one of the means that we believe can help overcome the challenges.</p><p>14. For example, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and the National Research Foundation (NRF) have set up the Super Low Energy Building (SLEB) Smart Hub to aid building owners and developers to assess the cost-benefit of solutions. This centralised resource is a one-stop platform to access information on green building technologies and performance data. It is also equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, to provide personalised recommendations tailored to the specific needs of building owners.</p><p>15. As part of our national Research and Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) efforts, we are building a new platform to facilitate the safe sharing of government data in the Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) domain. This will streamline the search and access of data needed for USS research and enable more insights and innovation to be unlocked.</p><p>16. To foster Green Financing, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been driving Project Greenprint to facilitate flow of consistent and reliable ESG data among financial institutions, investors, and green technology solution providers. This collaborative framework focuses on putting verifiable data in the hands of financiers, to allow investments and loans to flow towards firms that are keen to leverage technology in their sustainability journeys. This also supports financial institutions' own efforts to decarbonise their portfolios, creating a win-win situation for all involved.</p><p>17. For the above to happen, partnerships are key, and are essential in our way forward. We need to pool together our collective wisdom and efforts of the public sector, industry, institutes of higher learning (IHLs), professional bodies and our communities.</p><p>18. In places like Punggol Digital District and Jurong Lake District, we are experimenting not only with new smart and green technologies, but also new models of partnerships. In PDD, JTC and SIT formed a Living Lab to enable like-minded partners to jointly build a talent pipeline, co-innovate and do test-bedding, and drive entrepreneurship to scale these models. In Jurong Lake District, IMDA, SNDGO and URA launched an Innovation challenge to invite solutions from industry and researchers to address challenges in waste and water management, promote a car-lite lifestyle, and enable low-carbon solutions.</p><p>19. Other than these industry partnerships, community driven initiatives also have a role in engineering sustainability and community spirit. Efforts by Engineering Good has ensured that vulnerable communities such as those who are low-income or have disabilities also have access to these empowering technologies. They do this by salvaging and upcycling laptops to provide devices to those in need, thus making sure that no one gets left behind in this digital age while also tackling the issue of e-waste.</p><p>20. There are many things to be done in this space. Things for Government, things for the private sector and things for the community. Many challenges and tasks to be addressed - how do we green our infrastructure, data and governance, development processes, how we bring together new models and how do we bring together tools to govern all of this. This means that there are plenty for us to do and hopefully this means there is lots of opportunity in this space.</p><p>21. I urge all of us in the ICT professional community to bring together our expertise and experience to chart the future approach of Green ICT and ICT for Green together. This will serve our generation and future generations well, as we continue to harness the growing capabilities of ICT, developments from AI and autonomous systems, and our ambitions in smart cities and smart urban solutions.</p><p>22. I wish all of you a fruitful time in the workshop.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Communications and Information, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Energy, Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0061240621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NS-0MN1-DXMP-K4WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1847\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 11, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;

sustainability-linked bonds - has gained momentum, following the establishment of the sustainability-linked bond principles by the International Capital Market Association in June 2020.</p><p> The principles lay out the guidelines for issuing sustainability-linked bonds.</p><p> These are bonds with terms tied to specific environment, social and governance (ESG) goals.</p><p> Here are the different green financing options and the returns they offer to investors.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;1 Green bonds are similar to regular fixed-income securities.&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;They usually pay out a fixed coupon or interest semi-annually.</p><p> There is one key difference between green bonds and regular fixed-income securities though.</p><p> Companies can issue green bonds only to fund projects that are environmentally friendly, such as those related to renewable energy, infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, and recycling.</p><p> In Singapore, up to $35 billion of green bonds will be issued by 2030 to fund public-sector green infrastructure projects.</p><p> Last September, the National Environment Agency raised $1.65 billion in its first green bond issue.</p><p> Proceeds will be used for projects such as Tuas Nexus, the Republic's first integrated water and solid waste treatment facility.</p><p> Earlier last month, the Housing Board raised $1 billion through its first green bond issue.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;2 The returns from green bonds are generally lower than the returns from conventional bonds because there is usually a higher demand than supply (oversubscribed) for green bonds.&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A higher demand pushes up prices of green bonds, which in turn lowers yields.</p><p> Mr Samuel Gan, head of debt capital markets at Singapore Exchange Group, said that for this reason, green bonds trade at a \"greenium\", or green premium, versus conventional bonds.</p><p> He said the greenium does not necessarily equate to lower yields for investors, as there is research which shows that green bonds are more liquid and perform better in the secondary market than conventional bonds.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;3 Sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs) are another green financing option.&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Mr Alvin Chow, chief executive of financial education company Dr Wealth, said SLBs are more flexible when it comes to the use of bond proceeds, unlike green bonds, where the proceeds have to be used solely for green purposes.</p><p> But, Mr Kim Yoon Young, cluster president for Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei at Schneider Electric - an energy management and automation company that provides solutions to improve energy efficiency, said SLB issuers will still have to commit to some ESG-related indicators.</p><p> He added that if they fail to do so, SLB bond holders will receive additional interest payments.</p><p> SGX's Mr Gan said that the interest payment is typically about an additional 0.25 per cent.</p><p> He added that, increasingly, there are also some SLBs that allow a coupon step-down, where the issuer pays lower interest to the bond holders if the ESG targets are met.</p><p> Infrastructure consulting services firm Surbana Jurong was among the first to issue an SLB, in February last year.</p><p> Mr Andy Atkin, group chief financial officer of Surbana, said an SLB issue suited the company better, as the proceeds raised can be used for general corporate and working capital purposes.</p><p> He added that Surbana would not have been able to issue green bonds, as it is an asset-light company that provides consultancy services only.</p><p> An SLB issue, therefore, allows Surbana to align its ESG and financing objectives, Mr Atkin said.</p><p> On April 20, Ascott Residence Trust (ART) issued its first SLB, raising $200 million.</p><p> ART is the first hospitality trust globally to issue an SLB, and the first listed real estate trust in Singapore to do so.</p><p> The SLB issue is tied to a sustainability performance target of greening 50 per cent of its total portfolio by the end of 2025.</p><p> SGX's Mr Gan said SLBs represent approximately 15 per cent of the total ESG bond market as at last year.</p><p> To date, there are more than 300 green, social and sustainability bonds, including SLBs, listed on the SGX.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1045128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65C8-3WM1-JCF2-8022-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It makes policy recommendations based on academic research findings.</p><p> Countries ringing the Pacific Ocean are home to the world's longest coastlines that billions live along.</p><p> The region is vulnerable to rising sea levels and ocean warming caused by climate change.</p><p> From large fisheries to small-time fishermen, livelihoods and food on the table depend on the ocean, which is also being overfished in developing countries.</p><p> ASFRC member Maria Socorro Gochoco-Bautista, a professor of economics at the University of the Philippines, noted that most of the regional bloc, with the exception of nations such as Nepal and Laos, have a coastline.</p><p> \"The effect of climate change on the oceans is something that's been overlooked in the literature on the role of finance in climate change,\" she said. \"That's one thing we wanted to focus on, because it really impacts us directly.\"</p><p> The Asian Development Bank estimates that the cost of adapting to climate change for Asia and the Pacific is in the order of US$40 billion per year between now and 2050. However, multilateral development banks in the Asia-Pacific have currently allocated only US$2.5 billion for the region.</p><p>The Asia Climate Fund could help countries better implement fishing quotas to avoid overfishing, or help accelerate the coal-dependent region's transition to renewable energy sources, said committee member Jonathan Batten, a finance professor at Monash University in Australia....<br/> If fishing quotas were to be imposed on the fisheries sector of South-east Asia to prevent the depletion of the oceans, funds may be needed to develop alternative livelihoods for the fishermen.</p><p> While the policy statement did not give specifics on the kinds of projects the fund could support, \"blue and green\" infrastructure generally refers to projects that could help communities develop in a way that does not harm the land or ocean environment.</p><p>                For example, the Asia Climate Fund could help countries better implement fishing quotas to avoid overfishing, or help accelerate the coal-dependent region's transition to renewable energy sources, said committee member Jonathan Batten, a finance professor at Monash University in Australia.</p><p> The fund could be financed by the issuance of bonds by member governments, for example.</p><p> But one key difference between the proposed fund and other financial mechanisms is that the former would look beyond individual infrastructural developments, such as the construction of a wind farm, said Dr Batten. \"There are issues that are much broader than just building a desalination plant to address the lack of water,\" he added.</p><p> For example, if fishing quotas were to be imposed on the fisheries sector of South-east Asia to prevent the depletion of oceans, funds may be needed to develop alternative livelihoods for the fishermen, he said.</p><p> If implemented, the Asia Climate Fund, which has a focus on blue infrastructure, could be the world's first fund focusing on climate change impacts on the ocean, noted the experts.</p><p> The ocean is an important aspect of the climate system. As the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration puts it, the ocean is the \"largest solar energy collector on earth\".</p><p> Due to the high heat capacity of water, the ocean can absorb large amounts of heat without a large increase in temperature.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-652339</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYX-M8S1-JCF2-82FS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

Good morning. I am very happy to join you for this year's Global Insurance Forum - finally, back in Singapore, in-person, after three years in a virtual format. It's good that we have the chance to meet face-to-face. Let me also extend a very warm welcome to all our overseas guests.</p><p>2. Since we last gathered in Singapore, the global economy and risk landscape has seen some pronounced shifts.</p><p>a. We are moving from a period of benign globalisation to a new era of great power competition.</p><p>b. We can see this around us - in Europe, an ongoing war in Ukraine; in the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which threatens to widen into a regional conflict, which will have risks to food and oil supply. In Asia, fortunately, we still have peace and stability. But as we all know, there are flash points in the South China Sea, where accidents and miscalculations can easily happen.</p><p>c. In this new era, the global consensus around free trade, unfortunately, has been fraying. Countries are prioritising geopolitical risks and national security above free trade.</p><p>d. That's why global supply chains are being reconfigured along geopolitical lines rather than economic logic.</p><p>e. On the macroeconomic front, governments and companies are also adapting to higher interest rates, which we expect to be higher for longer. Higher interest rates will in some ways reduce market distortions after going through more than a decade of easy money. It will also reduce the misallocation of capital that we had seen during that time. But there will certainly be painful adjustments in the path towards the new normal. Governments that have been used to deficit financing with large deficits and high levels of debt must find it very hard to sustain that with interest rates at new highs.</p><p>3. Amidst this more challenging backdrop, we also have to consider other major trends. There are two which l will highlight:</p><p>a. Climate change and the transition to net-zero, and</p><p>b. The adoption and evolution of game-changing technologies like artificial intelligence.</p><p>4. As we grapple with all of these changes around us, the insurance industry will play a key role, because you are experts in understanding, mitigating and financing risks. All of you in the insurance industry are important partners for businesses and policymakers. Together, we will have to navigate the risks in this new world, tackle the challenges and also seize new opportunities that will arise from these developments.</p><p>5. Today, I will touch on three themes to unlock and accelerate the value of insurance. These are the three \"Ts\" of Transition, Technology and Talent. Let me take them in turn.</p><p>Transition to Net-Zero</p><p>6. First, on the transition to net-zero. The climate crisis is worsening and requires collective and urgent action. Global temperatures are rising, and this has already impacted food and water security in many parts of the globe. We are experiencing more frequent weather changes, and more fatal extreme heat events. We are in a race to reach net-zero by 2050, to avoid irreversible global climate damage. Year-by-year, when we look at the events around us, we worry that we are lagging behind in achieving this target.</p><p>7. Asia will be the key battleground in this race to net-zero. Asia accounts for half of global greenhouse gas emissions, as most of its energy needs today are being met through fossil fuels, including coal. Moreover, much of Asia is developing, and its energy needs are rising. There are still millions of people in Asia without basic access to electricity and water.</p><p>8. But it is going to be very expensive for Asia to decarbonise. For instance, carbon-intensive infrastructure needs to be upgraded or replaced, and new low-carbon energy infrastructure needs to be put in place. The insurance industry can be a powerful enabler for such transition finance.</p><p>9. As underwriters, the industry can develop insurance solutions for renewable energy infrastructure and emerging technologies with promising decarbonisation potential.</p><p>a. These solutions can help mitigate risk and help crowd in much-needed private capital.</p><p>b. For instance, renewable energy infrastructure like solar and wind plants can have variable returns due to weather-dependent energy output. To mitigate the variability of returns, some renewable plants can benefit from parametric insurance covers, which pay out when energy output falls below pre-agreed thresholds.</p><p>c. Future fuels like green hydrogen hold huge promise for decarbonisation. Innovative risk management and insurance solutions can help to mitigate the risks involved in the storage and transportation of hydrogen, enabling larger scale production on a commercial scale, and attracting private capital into this new area of energy infrastructure.</p><p>10. As investors, insurers can allocate more capital to address the infrastructure needs of emerging Asia, particularly green infrastructure.</p><p>11. The scale and investment characteristics of infrastructure line up well for insurers' investment needs.</p><p>a. Insurers hold significant investment capacity relative to the infrastructure investment need. According to the World Bank, a 5% allocation of insurers' gross written premiums into infrastructure investments could close half of the world's annual infrastructure investment gap [1]</p><p>b. Infrastructure assets have long duration and can potentially match well with the long-term liabilities of life insurers.</p><p>c. Infrastructure finance is typically structured to keep pace with inflation, which can provide risk diversification and serve as an alternative asset for insurers' investment portfolios.</p><p>d. To support insurers' investments into infrastructure assets, MAS has been closely monitoring international standards in the insurance industry and studying available data relating to infrastructure assets. We will soon issue a public consultation on the proposed capital treatment for insurers' investments in infrastructure assets.</p><p>12. Given the natural fit between insurers' investment needs and infrastructure assets, why don't we see larger allocations by insurers?</p><p>13. The simple answer is the bankability of projects - only 10% of projects in Asia's emerging economies are bankable [2] . This clearly constrains the available pipeline of investible opportunities for insurers.</p><p>a. In this regard, blended finance can be the solution to bring marginally bankable infrastructure projects within the investment risk appetite of insurers and other private investors.</p><p>b. Through blended finance, we use a limited pool of concessional capital from public or philanthropic sources, to crowd in multiples of private capital.</p><p>14. That's why Singapore has been actively supporting and promoting this space.</p><p>a. We have platforms that aim to scale infrastructure investments and blended finance. One example is Bayfront Infrastructure Management, which acquires infrastructure debt from banks and repackages them as Infrastructure Asset-Backed Securities (IABS), providing institutional investors including insurers, access to a diversified portfolio of infrastructure exposures.</p><p>b. In addition, Singapore is working closely with key partners to develop a blended finance platform that will invest in green and transition energy infrastructure in the region. The platform will allow commercial participation alongside concessional and catalytic capital, to channel financing to projects that would otherwise be only marginally bankable.</p><p>c. The insurance industry can invest in the commercial tranches, and also provide risk mitigation solutions to bring more energy infrastructure projects to market.</p><p>15. This morning, I am also pleased to share that MAS is working on a pilot with the industry to support the flow of life insurer investments into sustainability-related infrastructure projects in Asia. This pilot will testbed a customised package of risk guardrails, risk-appropriate regulatory treatment and capability building facilities to enhance insurers' familiarity and comfort with infrastructure investments, while putting in place suitable investment caps. We hope this initiative can provide an impetus for insurers to allocate some of their investment portfolio to infrastructure projects with promising decarbonisation potential, and play a role in our region's net-zero transition.</p><p>16. Besides your role as underwriters and as investors, insurers have close relationships with your underwriting clients and investee companies. By integrating physical and transition risks as part of the underwriting process and sharing their insights on material areas of risk exposure and resulting economic impact, insurers can nudge their clients to transition to a lower carbon footprint.</p><p>a. To facilitate this process, MAS recently proposed guidelines on transition planning for banks, insurers and asset managers in Singapore. Part of an insurer's transition plan will involve stewarding their clients and investee companies to transition in an orderly manner, through engagement and facilitating transition activities, rather than indiscriminately cutting ties with clients or investee companies deemed to be of higher climate risks. A structured process, active engagement, and a risk-proportionate approach taking into account sectoral as well as firm-specific factors will be important aspects of transition planning.</p><p>b. To do this well, insurers and brokers need to develop the right capabilities and solutions. On this note, I welcome the launch of the WTW Asia-Pacific Climate Risk Centre in Singapore. The centre will develop risk advisory, analytics and risk financing solutions to support transition efforts of firms in hard-to-abate industrial sectors key for Asia's growth. The WTW centre adds to the growing community of Asia-focused climate financing capabilities across the financial sector, academia and professional services based in Singapore. I encourage strong collaboration between these teams, so that we can all accelerate the green transition in Asia.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence</p><p>17. The second \"T\" is technology. There are many areas of technology, but I will focus on artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular what everyone is excited about: Generative AI (Gen AI).</p><p>a. Several insurance players have begun experimenting with how Gen AI can transform their business functions.</p><p>b. For now, there are limited use cases of strong impact. But as with all technology waves, we tend to overestimate the potential in the short-term, and underestimate the potential in the longer-term. There is usually a lot of hype going into a new technology, and a lot of disappointment after the hype. Later on, as the technology matures and with greater adoption, we should see more promising use cases.</p><p>c. In time to come, I have no doubt that the models will get better, and will be applied across a wider range of applications and functions, and will bring about the transformation in finance and insurance. At the same time, we will have to grapple with deep ethical issues, and consider how AI systems can be imbued with human context and human values.</p><p>18. MAS is supporting the use of Gen AI in the industry in two ways. First, in facilitating the development of a governance framework for responsible AI, to harness its benefits while mitigating the downside risks.</p><p>a. A Gen AI model failure, while may be rare, could result in widespread damage if the model is fully trusted in the wrong scenario. One may say that the chance of a model failure is only 1%, but that 1% failure can have widespread implications if it is applied wrongly. Guardrails are necessary so that financial institutions can adopt Gen AI in a responsible manner that keeps consumers, businesses and the broader economy safe.</p><p>b. MAS has also launched Project MindForge to promote the responsible use of Gen AI. MindForge provides a platform that pools data resources from the financial industry with Gen AI technologies to test use cases, like managing complex compliance tasks, against comprehensive risk frameworks. This iterative process will generate learnings to improve the industry's overall resilience, and provide a controlled approach towards the safe adoption of Gen AI. We hope to onboard insurers as we develop MindForge further.</p><p>19. Second, MAS is supporting efforts to build an adequate base of tech and AI talent for the financial services sector, including for insurance.</p><p>a. MAS has launched several programmes in this area. The Financial Sector Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Talent Development Programme involves the industry working with training providers and institutes of higher learning in Singapore to curate programmes that meet the needs of the financial sector and the insurance industry.</p><p>b. Insurers have also tapped on MAS' grant support to develop use cases focussed on improving customers' claim journey, detecting fraud in claim submissions, and improving customer experience. All of which demonstrate the concrete value that AI can bring to the insurance value chain.</p><p>Talent Development</p><p>20. This brings me to my third \"T\" on talent. Beyond the specific talent development programme for AI, addressing Asia's growing insurance needs will require a strong base of Asia-savvy talent, with the required linguistic skills, recognising the diversity of Asia, in-market experience, networks, and insurance aptitude. This remains a gap in the market.</p><p>21. The industry needs to have a well-thought-out strategy, and come together in a more systematic manner to attract and cultivate such talent. Key to this will be efforts to attract younger people, including from our polytechnics and universities.</p><p>a. There is stiff competition for talent everywhere, in all sectors of the economy, and especially in finance. So the insurance industry will need to redouble efforts to attract its share of talent.</p><p>b. Today, if you do a survey of young people thinking of career choices in finance, most of them, top-of-mind, will think about jobs in a bank, an asset management firm or a family office.</p><p>c. We want them to also think about the wide range of attractive and exciting career prospects and pathways in insurance, as all of you can attest to.</p><p>22. There have been promising results when industry comes together to generate interest among young people.</p><p>a. The Global-Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP), for example, organises an annual case study challenge which has drawn more than 570 tertiary students across disciplines to develop innovative solutions to address real-world problems faced by the insurance industry.</p><p>b. Students not only get a chance to apply their resourcefulness and pitch their solutions to industry veterans, they also stand a chance to secure internship opportunities from leading insurance firms. There needs to be more of such collaborative efforts between industry, students, universities to develop the future leaders of the insurance industry.</p><p>c. Singapore is committed to supporting the talent needs of our insurance industry. We have developed a range of programmes including internships and apprenticeships with polytechnics and universities, work-study programmes, leadership development programmes, as well as postings to the region. We are prepared to do more and are prepared to work with the industry to build up capabilities and talent for insurance. I encourage all the key companies in the insurance industry to actively take up these programmes, work closely with MAS in this area, and let us all come up with new ways to strengthen the talent pipeline for the insurance industry, not just for Singapore, but for the region and the world.</p><p>23. Talent development and innovation will continue to be key drivers of value and it is apt that GIF is focusing on these areas through its \"Leaders of Tomorrow\" and \"Global Innovation Awards\". I encourage you to advance this good work, so that we together we can nurture more talents for the insurance industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>24. I spoke about three \"Ts\": transition, technology and talent. But I should also end with the final \"T\", that is trust. Without trust, everything is a challenge. When there is trust, we can achieve many things together. For Singapore, trust is our most precious asset. Trust, we believe, is built by drops, but lost in buckets. We take trust very seriously. We uphold trust within our country, working very closely with partners like all of you in the industry. Together, we hope that we can continue to develop Singapore as a reliable and trusted hub for finance and for insurance, in the region and in the world.</p><p>25. To conclude, the insurance industry's ability to manage large, complex and evolving risks will enable the global economy to flourish, despite the many new risks we face. I am confident that the insurance industry will further deepen its value to society in supporting the climate transition, in harnessing the use of technology, and developing the talent needed to make these possible.</p><p>26. I wish all of you a very fruitful and productive forum, and a good time here in Singapore. Thank you very much.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] World Bank Report on Insurance Companies and Infrastructure Investments (June 2021)</p><p>[2] Oliver Wyman Report on Closing The Infrastructure Gap (2017).</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Insurance, Property &amp;

I am very happy to join you for this year's Global Insurance Forum - finally, back in Singapore, in-person, after three years in a virtual format. It's good that we have the chance to meet face-to-face. Let me also extend a very warm welcome to all our overseas guests.</p><p>Since we last gathered in Singapore, the global economy and risk landscape has seen some pronounced shifts.</p><p>We are moving from a period of benign globalisation to a new era of great power competition.</p><p>We can see this around us - in Europe, an ongoing war in Ukraine; in the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, which threatens to widen into a regional conflict, which will have risks to food and oil supply. In Asia, fortunately, we still have peace and stability. But as we all know, there are flash points in the South China Sea, where accidents and miscalculations can easily happen.</p><p>In this new era, the global consensus around free trade, unfortunately, has been fraying. Countries are prioritising geopolitical risks and national security above free trade.</p><p>That's why global supply chains are being reconfigured along geopolitical lines rather than economic logic.</p><p>On the macroeconomic front, governments and companies are also adapting to higher interest rates, which we expect to be higher for longer. Higher interest rates will in some ways reduce market distortions after going through more than a decade of easy money. It will also reduce the misallocation of capital that we had seen during that time. But there will certainly be painful adjustments in the path towards the new normal. Governments that have been used to deficit financing with large deficits and high levels of debt must find it very hard to sustain that with interest rates at new highs.</p><p>Amidst this more challenging backdrop, we also have to consider other major trends. There are two which l will highlight:</p><p>Climate change and the transition to net-zero, and the adoption and evolution of game-changing technologies like artificial intelligence.</p><p>As we grapple with all of these changes around us, the insurance industry will play a key role, because you are experts in understanding, mitigating and financing risks. All of you in the insurance industry are important partners for businesses and policymakers. Together, we will have to navigate the risks in this new world, tackle the challenges and also seize new opportunities that will arise from these developments.</p><p>Today, I will touch on three themes to unlock and accelerate the value of insurance. These are the three \"Ts\" of Transition, Technology and Talent. Let me take them in turn.</p><p>Transition to Net-Zero</p><p>First, on the transition to net-zero. The climate crisis is worsening and requires collective and urgent action. Global temperatures are rising, and this has already impacted food and water security in many parts of the globe. We are experiencing more frequent weather changes, and more fatal extreme heat events. We are in a race to reach net-zero by 2050, to avoid irreversible global climate damage. Year-by-year, when we look at the events around us, we worry that we are lagging behind in achieving this target.</p><p>Asia will be the key battleground in this race to net-zero.

But as with all technology waves, we tend to overestimate the potential in the short-term, and underestimate the potential in the longer-term. There is usually a lot of hype going into a new technology, and a lot of disappointment after the hype. Later on, as the technology matures and with greater adoption, we should see more promising use cases.</p><p>In time to come, I have no doubt that the models will get better, and will be applied across a wider range of applications and functions, and will bring about the transformation in finance and insurance. At the same time, we will have to grapple with deep ethical issues, and consider how AI systems can be imbued with human context and human values.</p><p>MAS is supporting the use of Gen AI in the industry in two ways. First, in facilitating the development of a governance framework for responsible AI, to harness its benefits while mitigating the downside risks.</p><p>A Gen AI model failure, while may be rare, could result in widespread damage if the model is fully trusted in the wrong scenario. One may say that the chance of a model failure is only 1%, but that 1% failure can have widespread implications if it is applied wrongly. Guardrails are necessary so that financial institutions can adopt Gen AI in a responsible manner that keeps consumers, businesses and the broader economy safe.</p><p>MAS has also launched Project MindForge to promote the responsible use of Gen AI. MindForge provides a platform that pools data resources from the financial industry with Gen AI technologies to test use cases, like managing complex compliance tasks, against comprehensive risk frameworks. This iterative process will generate learnings to improve the industry's overall resilience, and provide a controlled approach towards the safe adoption of Gen AI. We hope to onboard insurers as we develop MindForge further.</p><p>Second, MAS is supporting efforts to build an adequate base of tech and AI talent for the financial services sector, including for insurance.</p><p>MAS has launched several programmes in this area. The Financial Sector Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Talent Development Programme involves the industry working with training providers and institutes of higher learning in Singapore to curate programmes that meet the needs of the financial sector and the insurance industry.</p><p>Insurers have also tapped on MAS' grant support to develop use cases focussed on improving customers' claim journey, detecting fraud in claim submissions, and improving customer experience. All of which demonstrate the concrete value that AI can bring to the insurance value chain.</p><p>Talent Development</p><p>This brings me to my third \"T\" on talent. Beyond the specific talent development programme for AI, addressing Asia's growing insurance needs will require a strong base of Asia-savvy talent, with the required linguistic skills, recognising the diversity of Asia, in-market experience, networks, and insurance aptitude. This remains a gap in the market.</p><p>The industry needs to have a well-thought-out strategy, and come together in a more systematic manner to attract and cultivate such talent. Key to this will be efforts to attract younger people, including from our polytechnics and universities.</p><p>There is stiff competition for talent everywhere, in all sectors of the economy, and especially in finance. So the insurance industry will need to redouble efforts to attract its share of talent.</p><p>Today, if you do a survey of young people thinking of career choices in finance, most of them, top-of-mind, will think about jobs in a bank, an asset management firm or a family office.</p><p>We want them to also think about the wide range of attractive and exciting career prospects and pathways in insurance, as all of you can attest to.</p><p>There have been promising results when industry comes together to generate interest among young people.</p><p>The Global-Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP), for example, organises an annual case study challenge which has drawn more than 570 tertiary students across disciplines to develop innovative solutions to address real-world problems faced by the insurance industry.</p><p>Students not only get a chance to apply their resourcefulness and pitch their solutions to industry veterans, they also stand a chance to secure internship opportunities from leading insurance firms. There needs to be more of such collaborative efforts between industry, students, universities to develop the future leaders of the insurance industry.</p><p>Singapore is committed to supporting the talent needs of our insurance industry. We have developed a range of programmes including internships and apprenticeships with polytechnics and universities, work-study programmes, leadership development programmes, as well as postings to the region. We are prepared to do more and are prepared to work with the industry to build up capabilities and talent for insurance. I encourage all the key companies in the insurance industry to actively take up these programmes, work closely with MAS in this area, and let us all come up with new ways to strengthen the talent pipeline for the insurance industry, not just for Singapore, but for the region and the world.</p><p>Talent development and innovation will continue to be key drivers of value and it is apt that GIF is focusing on these areas through its \"Leaders of Tomorrow\" and \"Global Innovation Awards\". I encourage you to advance this good work, so that we together we can nurture more talents for the insurance industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I spoke about three \"Ts\": transition, technology and talent. But I should also end with the final \"T\", that is trust. Without trust, everything is a challenge. When there is trust, we can achieve many things together. For Singapore, trust is our most precious asset. Trust, we believe, is built by drops, but lost in buckets. We take trust very seriously. We uphold trust within our country, working very closely with partners like all of you in the industry. Together, we hope that we can continue to develop Singapore as a reliable and trusted hub for finance and for insurance, in the region and in the world.</p><p>To conclude, the insurance industry's ability to manage large, complex and evolving risks will enable the global economy to flourish, despite the many new risks we face. I am confident that the insurance industry will further deepen its value to society in supporting the climate transition, in harnessing the use of technology, and developing the talent needed to make these possible.</p><p>I wish all of you a very fruitful and productive forum, and a good time here in Singapore. Thank you very much.</p><p>[1] World Bank Report on Insurance Companies and Infrastructure Investments (June 2021).</p><p>[2] Oliver Wyman Report on Closing The Infrastructure Gap (2017).</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p><p>[Category: Insurance, Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063133762</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69M0-K371-JB5M-W0FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3081\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 7, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

This is because such skills are not only in demand, but have also been found to be highly transferable across different jobs and industries, a report published on Tuesday (Nov 22) by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) has shown. The government agency that is driving the national movement to promote a culture of lifelong learning is refreshing its course offerings from next year. The second edition of the Skills Demand for the Future Economy Report aims to give insights on the jobs and skills that workers need to stay competitive, based on the roles that are likely to be in demand. The report's findings are based on SSG's database of job types and listings, business, labour and market intelligence, as well as contributions from experts. Similar to the inaugural report last year, the report continues to spotlight three growth areas - digital economy, green economy and care economy - that are in tandem with Singapore's economic priorities in the coming years. </p><p>\"These growth areas remain important as they heavily influence the emergence of new skills demand across many different industry sectors,\" the agency said. The latest report includes an analysis of skills associated with the increasing adoption of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, which integrate automation and data exchange in sectors such as manufacturing. SSG said that it has mapped out 60 \"priority skills\" associated with these technologies. \"There is a fair degree of overlap with priority skills associated with digital and green economies, as digitalisation and sustainability are key themes for I4.0,\" it added. \"Companies looking to implement I4.0 will need to upskill or reskill their workforce, as manufacturing processes become more digitalised, connected and sustainable.\" GREEN ECONOMY The report found that many existing jobs will require green skills as companies across sectors adopt more environmentally sustainable practices and set sustainability targets for compliance and reporting, in tandem with nationwide efforts. Environmental, sustainability and compliance-related skills are the most transferable across sectors and job roles. Among the emerging domains with high demand growth are: Green infrastructure and mobility (demand growth of 194 per cent from 2018 to 2021) Energy, resource circularity and decarbonisation (129 per cent) Sustainable finance (1,550 per cent) The report highlighted the emerging area of sustainable finance, as the financial services sector is beginning to introduce green investments, loans and financial instruments to support companies tapping green economy opportunities. Skills in urban farming, food technologies and novel food development are also a nascent trend, the report read. This is in line with Singapore's aim to safeguard food security by producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. DIGITAL ECONOMY Riding on the post-Covid-19 wave, digital economy jobs and skills continue to see high demand. In particular, software development skills see the highest demand growth and high transferability. Other skills with high demand growth are: Solution architecture (108 per cent) Radio frequency engineering (166 per cent) Software testing (100 per cent) More job roles will require skills in e-commerce and digital marketing as well as artificial intelligence, data and analytics, the report found. This is because Singapore's growth in e-commerce sales is expected to reach S$19.6 billion by 2027, it noted. CARE ECONOMY To cater to the needs of an ageing population and workforce, there is an increasing need for preventive and community care, adult education, and workplace learning and development. Skills in collaborating with stakeholders are among the fastest growing, while those in person-centred care, and teaching and learning domains have the highest transferability. Other skills with high demand growth are: Community partnership (200 per cent) Professional consultation (105 per cent) Family and caregiver engagement (100 per cent) Demand for skills in the health and wellness domain has also risen significantly since 2019, the report found. Skills related to health, hygiene and nutrition for children, which are needed in job roles such as enrolled nurses and early intervention educator, have seen demand growth of 159 per cent. NEED TO OFFER SUITABLE COURSES Business management and human resource experts who spoke to TODAY said that more can be done to improve the availability of suitable programmes needed for people interested to make the switch, particularly for roles in the green economy. Professor Boh Wai Fong, deputy dean of Nanyang Business School at Nanyang Technological University, said that there are some course offerings in this sector, but \"we are not there yet in terms of adequate supply\". She added that these roles involve skill sets that are not widely known and that not many institutions here can provide the requisite training. Ms Carmen Wee, chief executive officer of human resource advisory services firm Carmen Wee and Associates, said that the pace of developing and curating the courses would need to match the growth rate of the green economy sector, adding that the industry here has only a \"few hundred\" individuals in corporate roles. Turning to courses in the IT sector, experts said that some of these courses may not be suited for those without any background knowledge, unless they have existing skills or competencies that can help them tackle new IT knowledge. Associate Professor Guan Chong, deputy director from the Centre for Continuing and Professional Education at Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that bite-sized, just-in-time training coupled with workplace learning would work well for talents with highly \"adjacent skills\". \"For instance, if an employer can't find someone who knows natural language processing (a machine learning technique), he or she should consider hiring someone who knows Python (a popular programming language). Such a person is more likely to learn natural language processing faster than someone who doesn't,\" he added. Agreeing, Associate Professor Song Zhaoli from the department of management and organisation in the National University of Singapore Business School said that several of these professional jobs require a longer period of acquiring special knowledge and skill. It would be unrealistic for instance, to expect that someone with zero background to complete a crash course on Python with SkillsFuture and perform the role of a data analyst. \"Such a role most likely requires at least a bachelor's degree and preferably a post-graduate degree in relevant fields,\" he said. Yet, for other roles within the IT sector such as a talent analyst, Assoc Prof Song said that it is possible for someone such as an experienced human resource professional with no IT background to take a Python crash course and become work-ready. \"For senior jobseekers, it is important to leverage their own past work experience and then a relatively short SkillsFuture course can provide them with new job perspectives,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-2052541</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66XJ-3V31-DXPH-P0C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1210\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 22, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>SkillsFuture</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jobs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

The general insurance company arm of Seadrif is licensed in Singapore.</p><p> Insurers also provide coverage for emerging green infrastructure.</p><p> \"In doing so, they basically encourage the development of such green initiatives, promote green innovation and ultimately also support the transition to clean energy,\" Mr Wang said.</p><p> For example, insurer Chubb Singapore provides coverage for renewable fuels like solar or wind energy, and helps to insure companies involved in energy storage, the smart grid and transport.</p><p> Other players such as NTUC Income and MSIG Singapore offer mileage-based motor insurance and coverage for electric vehicles.</p><p> These are all part of Singapore's efforts to strengthen the financial sector and its resilience to environmental risks while also grasping opportunities in the move towards a low-carbon future, said Dr Darian McBain, MAS' chief sustainability officer.</p><p> \"What we want as a regulator and as a country, and also within the region, is that we can have an orderly transition. So it's very important that we make sure that the financial system is able to take any potential shocks,\" she said.</p><p> Dr McBain also said that there has been a huge global increase in sustainable financing on a fast trajectory.</p><p> Within the region, China leads with the most sustainability bond issuances. But Singapore is leading the way when this is narrowed down to just Asean countries, she noted.</p><p> Players in the insurance industry agreed that they have an increasingly crucial role in moving the needle and even developing Singapore as a green insurance hub.</p><p> Mr Khor Hock Seng, president of the Life Insurance Association, Singapore, said: \"The liabilities of life insurance contracts are very long. We are talking about a term of over 20 years or even longer than that, depending on the type of product.</p><p> \"The fact that there is a long-term liability means the impact of climate change becomes quite critical.\"</p><p> He said that the insurance industry can also invest in more diverse investment portfolios that include sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations.</p><p> Mr Ronak Shah, president of the General Insurance Association of Singapore, said that general insurance companies also take guidance from what happens elsewhere in the world, as they promote sustainability and also contribute to the movement by going green in their internal functions.</p><p> Some insurers also set an example by reinvesting some of their premiums into sustainable investments.</p><p> \"So what we see going forward is insurance contributing to that entire ecosystem of sustainability,\" Mr Shah said.</p><p> Ms Karine Kam, Singapore College of Insurance chief executive, said: \"We need to move from just embedding sustainability within the insurance value chain, including lending and investment decisions, to a point where this becomes the standard practice across insurers.\"</p><p> In February, the MAS and The Institute of Banking and Finance laid out 12 skills needed in sustainable finance to guide professionals in being ready for the green future.</p><p> Prudential Singapore also said it would roll out organisation-wide ESG training for employees and financial consultants from this month to ensure everyone knows how they can incorporate ESG principles in their roles.</p><p> And at the end of the day, consumers themselves will be the ones pushing insurers to be more green and accountable, Ms Kam said.</p><p> \"There will be a growing awareness of sustainability among our insurance consumers. And increasingly, they will influence (insurers). We have already seen the pattern in Europe and the United States, where they influence the insurance products that are designed.\"</p><p> The experts also said that as an insurance hub, Singapore can lead the way for the region, which is often seen as lagging behind other areas in terms of sustainability.</p><p> Mr Shah said: \"This allows us to drive the green practices, not just here, but also to implement them across the rest of the region.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1040222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:657V-JWM1-DYX4-016K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The push towards this goal and the transition present a challenge that has many implications for Singapore, given that GVC activities and trade have been our economic lifeline. With trade that is more than three times our GDP, many of our companies - together with multinationals - are all engaged in value chain activities of some kind.</p><p> The role and evolution of GVCs, together with challenges and implications regarding carbon emissions, are spelt out in the latest publication by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Sustaining Global Value Chains, to be released at its annual meeting next week.</p><p> We estimate that more than 70 per cent of Singapore's exports are GVC-related. As companies come under increasing pressure from governments and consumers to decarbonise, it stands to reason that Singapore will need to act quickly.</p><p> The pressure is on as GVC products and activities embed a significant amount of carbon emissions, which are then traded across borders.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;HOW OUR EXPORTS WILL BE AFFECTED&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; True, by gross emissions embedded in trade, Singapore is not significant because of the relatively small size of our economy.</p><p> But when emissions are priced at a conservative US$40 (S$54) per tonne (the lower level recommended by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices) and expressed as a percentage of Singapore's GDP, net emissions exported are around 0.7 per cent of GDP annually.</p><p> This is not Singapore's emissions alone, but the net emission exported through trade. Furthermore, carbon prices are expected to go up to US$50-US$100 per tonne by 2030, as recommended by the commission.</p><p> If emissions are not controlled, border tax adjustments by other countries might follow, and Singapore's exports will be affected.</p><p> The European Union, for example, is already planning such border taxes on carbon-intensive imports.</p><p> As well, GVC activities are transport-intensive. Intermediate goods have to flow from multiple locations, often crossing borders several times in different stages of production, before reaching final destinations.</p><p> Looking at our wholesale trade and transport sectors, Singapore not only benefits from its own GVC exports but also from trade activities passing through its airport and ports. Transport related to international trade now accounts for more than two billion tonnes of emissions a year and is expected to rise quickly. Emissions will be even higher if local freighting is included. This, too, will not be sustainable without emission controls.</p><p> In short, the transition towards net zero emissions will present disruptions for Singapore, both from our position as a hub for companies and as a hub for transport. Singapore needs to urgently prepare for this.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SO HOW TO PREPARE'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; For renewable energy generation, Singapore naturally begins with a disadvantage, given its small size and lack of renewable energy endowments.</p><p> Our recent investments into utility-size floating solar farms are necessary and encouraging, but will be far from sufficient to meet the needs of GVC activities.</p><p> Yet Singapore sits in a region that is relatively well endowed with renewable energy potential, and electricity generated by renewable sources can be imported when transmission lines and grids are connected.</p><p> Such import of electricity naturally raises some concerns over energy security.</p><p> In principle, imported electricity does not give rise to any more long-term security risks than imported fossil fuel - both depend on international cooperation that underpins well-functioning energy markets.</p><p> The additional risks for imported renewable electricity are its intermittency and zero time lag in the event of operational disruptions.</p><p> Furthermore, disruptions may occur in other jurisdictions, making remedy more challenging.</p><p> There are no easy solutions to energy security, but this can be mitigated through a mix of various present and likely future technologies - standby power generation capacity, battery storage, and transitioning to clean hydrogen or biofuels which can be stored.</p><p> Realistically, Singapore will also have to accept that some energy intensive industries will have to be relocated closer to renewable energy sources in the longer run.</p><p> Away from production of energy intensive goods, Singapore has a better set of circumstances. There is a certain clustering benefit and \"stickiness\" to GVC activities. With a strong history of hosting international companies, it is well positioned to work with companies to organise these value chains for greener production, to provide greater data transparency, and to offset GVC emissions.</p><p> As a financial centre, it is also well-positioned to be a centre of green finance and ensuring high financing standards.</p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore has rightly been an early advocate on this. Infrastructure Asia's efforts to catalyse sustainable infrastructure in the region will also indirectly help Singapore.</p><p> On aviation and sea transport, two growing but hard to abate sectors, it should be noted that Singapore does not face any particular disadvantage compared with other hubs as far as green fuels are concerned. The key is to implement fast when the technology and economics allow.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;PLANNING FOR HIGHER PRICES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; While the carbon tax in Singapore is still low in the interim, Government and companies will have to plan as if a very high carbon price is already upon us, with a tight constraint already in place.</p><p> This realisation and mindset must be the first step in our net zero transition. Large companies, with their sizeable GVC operations, have a particular responsibility on this, given their emissions and their ability to influence the rest of the supply chains, often across multiple jurisdictions.</p><p> Infrastructure plans for various scenarios will also have to be made ready, to allow companies and sectors to transit to different fuel sources once the economics for hydrogen and biofuels make these commercially feasible.</p><p> The ingenuity of GVCs is to allow each production step to be shored to a location with the greatest relative advantage, before coming together for the final product.</p><p> This is the source of its tremendous economic efficiency. But less recognised is the fact that fossil fuel, given its storability and transportability, has been the secret \"dirty\" ingredient that allows humanity to decouple production from where the fuel is found.</p><p> Because of fossil fuels, economic geography has not been tied to energy geography. Singapore's small size and lack of energy resources have not constrained its prosperity.</p><p> The phasing out of fossil fuels thus poses a severe challenge to GVCs and their model of distributed production.</p><p> Falling transport costs, which have facilitated the dramatic rise in international trade that benefits open economies like Singapore, will have to rise. Singapore will be deeply affected.</p><p> Our energy mix, industrial production, transport, and infrastructure will need to change significantly over the next three decades.</p><p> While technology around renewable energy production, storage and transport holds much promise, the transition towards net zero promises to be difficult, as seen in recent disruptions in energy markets.</p><p> Economies that provide green production opportunities will gain an advantage and become attractive hosts to GVC activities.

Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Singapore @ Nor-Shipping Seminar.</p><p>2. This marks the tenth time that Singapore is participating in Nor-Shipping. I was glad to see Singapore companies showcasing their innovative products, solutions and capabilities at the Singapore Pavilion, which we launched yesterday. We are deeply honoured that His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Norway had paid the Singapore Pavilion a visit yesterday.</p><p>3. It is fitting that this year's theme focuses on #PartnerShip. Amidst the changing landscape of the maritime industry, strong partnerships across nations, organisations, companies and individuals are more important than ever. We need to collectively address the challenges faced by the industry, and see how we can make the best use of our resources and tap on new opportunities.</p><p>4. I am glad that Singapore and Norway have a strong and longstanding relationship, especially in the maritime domain. This partnership has enabled our countries to jointly innovate and explore opportunities to transform the maritime sector.</p><p>5. Today's seminar by the Singapore Norway Chamber of Commerce, in partnership with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Singapore Maritime Foundation, Nor-Shipping 2023, Norwegian Business Association Singapore and Innovation Norway is testament to the close collaboration between both countries.</p><p>Partnering in Decarbonisation</p><p>6. Decarbonisation is a key focus for many countries, including Singapore and Norway. Maritime Singapore has been actively working with different partners on initiatives to decarbonise the maritime industry. By this, I mean both in port operations and also in shipping - which includes both domestic harbourcraft and international ships.</p><p>7. MPA is working with industry partners, institutes of higher learning and organisations like the Maritime Energy and Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence, and the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation on efforts to develop, trial and deploy maritime decarbonisation solutions in Singapore.</p><p>8. Norway has been a key partner in our decarbonisation efforts. At the port level, MPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Port of Rotterdam in August last year to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor. The corridor will pilot the deployment of digital solutions, support investment in green infrastructure, and develop enablers to accelerate low and zero carbon shipping.</p><p>9. We are exploring similar collaborations with other ports around the world. MPA had also signed an agreement with the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in the USA, to establish a Green and Digital Shipping Corridor. During the Singapore Maritime Week in April this year, we had also shared some of these updates.</p><p>10. At the country level, we are working closely with like-minded partners to accelerate the deployment of solutions to reduce carbon emissions. In March this year, the International Maritime Organization, the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Norway and MPA signed a MOU to bring together Norway's GreenVoyage 2050 project and Singapore's NextGen Connect Initiative. This collaboration will allow us to better support developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions from ships and in ports.</p><p>11. Just a few weeks ago, MPA worked with the Embassy of France in Singapore and Innovation Norway to convene a scenario-based workshop on ammonia bunkering safety. Over 70 participants from 12 countries, including port authorities, emergency response agencies, maritime classification societies, research institutes and knowledge partners, fuel suppliers, shipping lines and charters, attended this fruitful session.</p><p>12. Today, I am happy to announce that Norway and Singapore will be taking a further step to strengthen our longstanding maritime partnership. I look forward to signing the Maritime Transport MOU with Minister Bjrnar Skjran.</p><p>13. The MOU affirms the close partnership between Singapore and Norway, and I believe this will further enhance our cooperation and knowledge exchange in areas such as maritime decarbonisation, digitalisation and innovation. This MOU goes beyond decarbonisation, because it also allows us to work together on other important areas like digitalisation and innovation, and these areas are all interconnected.</p><p>Collaborating in Digital and Technology Innovation</p><p>14. We want to, for example, through digitalisation and innovation efforts, to improve the efficiency of ship operations. When we visited DNV yesterday, they made a point that often the first step to helping shipowners reduce their carbon emissions is just to make ship operations more efficient. This is something that all of us can do, but we need to work together to find solutions.</p><p>15. In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore trialed the Maritime Drone Estate, an initiative by MPA. This was partly driven by obstacles faced in that period such as limitations on people going on board ships. We tried to think of a different way of solving the problem rather than doing nothing - so we used drones to deliver supplies and send 3D-printed spare parts to the ships in our anchorages. It turned out to be quicker, better, faster, and also cheaper.</p><p>16. This is something that I hope we can do in order to innovate together, using digital solutions and technologies, and also to review our rules and regulations, to allow the implementation of new solutions. Safety is paramount, we do keep that in consideration, but we are also finding new breakthroughs that will allow us to push the boundaries.This would not be possible if Governments and industries do not work together. In order to support innovation, Governments need to be aware of the technologies that industry partners are interested in deploying, and industry partners would not be able to implement their solutions without adapting to existing rules and regulations, overseen by Governments.</p><p>17. This partnership between Governments and industries is crucial, and this is something that I hope we can do together with our friends from Norway, and industry partners from both countries.</p><p>18. We will also continue to develop a vibrant ecosystem to support innovation and partnerships that benefit the maritime industry. MPA and the Research Council of Norway (RCN) first signed a MOU in 2000 to collaborate on Research and Development, Education and Training in areas such as maritime environment, sustainable energy technology, offshore and marine engineering.</p><p>19. The MOU was renewed for the eighth time in April 2021 and was expanded to include more areas of collaboration such as information communications technology. MPA also launched the Maritime Innovation and Technology Fund (the MINT Fund) in 2003 and the PIER71TM Smart Port Challenge in 2017 to encourage and support the development of innovative solutions for the industry. I know many of the Norwegian companies have participated in some of these efforts, and have benefitted from the funding as well.</p><p>20. Since then, MPA has committed S$325 million under the MINT Fund, supported over 100 Marinetech start-ups, attracted over S$50 million investments and forged collaborations with over 50 maritime corporate partners under PIER71TM.</p><p>Talent is Key</p><p>21. Underpinning our efforts to decarbonise and innovate, is talent. And talent includes both men and women. We want to make sure that the maritime sector remains inclusive, and we want to attract talented individuals to join the maritime industry, because they are going to be the drivers of the future of maritime. At the same time, there is also a large pool of existing workers that we want to upskill and we want to help them to make this transition, so that we prepare them for the future.</p><p>22. MPA offers the Global Internship Award for students to gain on-the-job training and global exposure at reputable international maritime companies in Singapore and overseas, including Norway. When I visited Wilhelmsen earlier this week, I came across two fellow Singaporeans. One of them, Jessica, was posted here to work in Oslo for two years. Her colleague, Gareth, is based in Singapore but is currently here on a work assignment.</p><p>23. Be it a longer-term attachment or short-term work assignment, these exposures are wonderful ways for our young people to learn more about one another's work culture, and to experience the dynamism of different places and people. This is something that I hope, under the MOU, we can also support.</p><p>24. We already have good collaboration on these areas, but there is space to go further. The Maritime Leadership Programme also seeks to nurture global thinking and leadership competencies for senior maritime professionals through seminars and local and overseas learning journeys. Such programmes are crucial to develop maritime talent and enable the exchange of knowledge and ideas, so that we can collectively address the evolving needs of the industry.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>25. I have covered just a few of the possibilities where Singapore and Norway can work together on, and I hope I have managed to give you a sense of some of the exciting possibilities of collaboration between our two governments, but also more importantly, between our companies. Not to forget our people - our young men and women, our existing maritime workers, or even people who are looking to the maritime industry for new opportunities, I hope you will make maritime your port of call.</p><p>26. The theme of today's session is, \"Ocean of opportunities\", and it is really something that I hope we can tap on through our strong partnerships, and may the longstanding, positive collaborations between Singapore and Norway continue to flourish in the years to come.</p><p>27. I wish everyone a fruitful seminar ahead. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Transport, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Transportation Infrastructure, Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0060895359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68DP-9FC1-DXMP-K4HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1808\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 8, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Admiralty &amp;

Along the way, President Joko Widodo's vision for it has grown. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The original case was that Indonesia needed a replacement capital city for Jakarta which, as Mr Widodo explained in 2019, \"was doddering under its own weight for being the centre of government, finance, business, trade and services all at the same time\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But now he wants to develop the new capital into an Asian fintech hub as well. </p><p> Mr Widodo made his fintech dream known in an interview with Nikkei Asia last November. He said Nusantara should not only serve as the political and administrative centre of the country, but also as its economic and financial heart. </p><p> To realise that dream, the government is considering incentives such as corporate tax exemptions for banks and insurance companies, and those in Islamic finance. Income tax breaks for financial sector workers, the streamlining of business registration and confidentiality guarantees on data are the other measures being considered.</p><p> Under pressure to have the new capital functional by 2024, Mr Widodo is pulling out all the stops when it comes to promoting it. Eighty per cent of the funding for the new capital is expected to come from overseas.</p><p> The President's fintech plug certainly has the appearance of being a marketing move, aimed at promoting the Nusantara vision, of which there have been a few iterations.</p><p> So far, for example, we have heard that it is to be a brand new, purpose-built administrative capital rather like Malaysia's Putrajaya as well as the epitome of futuristic urban living: a smart green city running on renewable energy. It has even been launched on Indonesia's own virtual platform Jagat (meaning universe), where a talking avatar of Mr Widodo invites visitors to stroll through the virtual capital.</p><p> Just marketing or not'One can either dismiss them as gimmicks or admire the creativity behind Indonesia's Nusantara pitch. But how realistic are these sometimes contradictory visions'</p><p> Mr Budi Kurniawan, deputy project manager for construction, was reported in the Jakarta Post in March as saying that progress at that site had so far reached just 8 per cent. Construction is set to ramp up in 2023, and environmentalists have expressed fears about deforestation.</p><p> Separately, Jakarta-based financial analyst Adi Wijaya thinks it is unlikely that Nusantara will become a fintech hub because of difficulties in attracting talent and infrastructural issues. He says there is no guarantee of a flood of private investments, while noting that thus far only government facilities are on the drawing board or being constructed.</p><p> He believes Balikpapan, a city some 90km away from the new capital, is better suited for such a role. Balikpapan can cope with existing infrastructure as it has been a centre of industry, trade and commerce for a long time. Furthermore, Balikpapan is closer to the submarine Internet cable network directly linked to both Japan and the United States, he said.</p><p> The scramble to promote Nusantara suggests there is a palpable concern in Jakarta that the project has fallen short of its objective in securing foreign funding.</p><p> Nusantara's woes began when Japanese giant Softbank pulled out of the project in March 2022, knocking some wind out of investment prospects for the mammoth project. The scramble to rope in other potential investors began in earnest after the Softbank pullout.</p><p> In March, Nusantara Capital City Authority (NCCA) secretary Achmad Jaka Santos Adiwijaya announced that 150 prospective investors from Europe, the Middle East, China, Malaysia and South Korea, among others, had submitted letters of intent (LOIs) to take part in the construction of the new capital.</p><p> Difficult to assessAssessing real interest in Nusantara is difficult because investing in it is as much a political decision as a business one. Touted as Mr Widodo's signature legacy project, the new capital has inadvertently become a conduit through which different countries hope to leverage their soft power over Indonesia.</p><p> Investing in Nusantara is akin to a vote of confidence in Indonesia's future prospects. Its promotion has, in a way, become a new central focus of Indonesian economic diplomacy.</p><p> It is no wonder that foreign governments feel, out of respect for Indonesian sensibilities, a need to express at least tentative interest in the project.</p><p> During a February meeting with the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, Mr Widodo made another pitch for Nusantara, to which the former responded by saying China would \"expand its investment in Indonesia in the areas of green infrastructure and the digital economy\", albeit without mentioning Nusantara specifically.</p><p> Several Chinese consortiums were indeed among those who sent their LOIs to NCCA, including China Harbour, CSSC (Hong Kong) Shipping Company, China Communications Construction Company, China National Technical Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC), Sinopec, Power China, China State Construction Engineering, China Urban Rural Holdings Group, State Power Investment Corporation and China CCK Power Indonesia.</p><p> Chinese companies are also expected to invest in another of Indonesia's mega infrastructure projects, North Kalimantan's 30,000ha Green Industrial Park, claimed to be the world's largest site for the production of sustainable energy sources. With total investment estimated to be worth US$132 billion, the park is scheduled to be operational by 2024. </p><p> For geopolitical reasons, Indonesia is seeking to diversify funding sources for Nusantara, mostly because it is keen to avoid over-relying on any particular country.</p><p>Russia has also waded into the project. Its ambassador to Jakarta, Ms Lyudmila Vorobieva, told Indonesian media in December 2022 that her country wanted to play a role in Nusantara's development, suggesting technology transfer from Moscow was on the cards.</p><p> Whether Indonesia will succeed in projecting a semblance of non-alignment in relation to Nusantara remains to be seen. </p><p> Mr Widodo's overture to the Chinese foreign minister was a two-way bait. While Chinese investment is always welcome, it may have the advantage of eliciting counter-bids from those opposed to Chinese interests. </p><p> The tug-of-war between Japan and China in the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Train project is well documented.</p><p> In 2015, Japan lost out to China after the former's offer of a US$6.2 billion loan package was trumped by China's US$5.5 billion bid. Built under China's Belt and Road Initiative, Mr Widodo's first high-profile infrastructure project was supposed to have been finished by 2019 but has run into difficulties, including a temporary halt during the Covid-19 pandemic. By 2022, its estimated cost had also ballooned to US$7.5 billion, much to Indonesia's dismay and frustration.</p><p> Less than two weeks after President Widodo's meeting with Mr Qin Gang, an Indonesian delegation was in Tokyo lobbying the Japanese Business Federation (Keidanren).</p><p> The newly appointed NCCA deputy fund manager Agung Wicaksono and the Ministry of Public Works' NCCA task force head Danis Hidayat Sumadilaga presented the case for Nusantara. Mr Wicaksono noted on his Instagram post that Japan had always been a long-time development partner for Indonesia. </p><p> Little to show so far Indonesia's Nusantara investment outreach so far has little to show by way of concrete results.</p><p> Only three corporate entities are currently involved in construction projects in Nusantara: China Construction First Group Corp (CCFG)-Risjadson Burnsfield Nusantara Consortium, tasked to build 60 apartment towers to accommodate Indonesian military personnel, Indonesian property developer Summarecon Agung, which has been allotted six towers, and Korea Land and Housing Corp, 23 towers.</p><p> These are, however, contractors rather than investors since the cost of their projects, which could total up to US$2.7 billion, will be borne by the state.</p><p> Prospective investors will likely wait and see until the country's 2024 elections are over before making any decision. Mr Widodo will have to leave office in 2024 at the end of his second and final term under the Constitution.</p><p> Two of the three leading contenders to succeed him -- Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto and Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo -- have been unequivocal in their support for the continuation of the project. Former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, who opposed it in the past, has recently changed his tune, saying that if he is elected president, he will see it to completion.</p><p> The clock, however, is ticking for Indonesia. Building a new capital city from scratch is no easy feat. Nevertheless, Mr Widodo insists the new presidential palace will be ready for all to \"celebrate Indonesia's Independence Day (on Aug 17)\" in the new capital in 2024, and for the handover of power two months later.</p><p> Johannes Nugroho is a journalist and political analyst from Surabaya, Indonesia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Directions at ground zero Nusantara, the future capital city of Indonesia, in East Kalimantan.

From the news stories on the impact of rising sea levels and temperatures and biodiversity loss, to realisations of increasing costs of fuel and groceries at the petrol station or supermarket. Or even when we walk out the door and complain about the unbearable heat. The world is literally on fire, yet it seems that we are not quite doing enough to stop it.In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released in April, United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres gave a stark assessment of global progress towards tackling climate change. </p><p>\"This report of the IPCC is a litany of broken climate promises. It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world\", he said.Here in South-east Asia, climate change is a crucial issue we must tackle. The region remains exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, from environmental degradation, erratic weather and natural catastrophes to rising sea levels and temperatures and resultant forest fires that destroy homes and habitats. These climate events affect South-east Asia's key sectors such as agriculture, fishing and tourism, with the region facing a risk of losing more than 35 per cent of its gross domestic product by 2050.The whole ecosystem must work towards a just transition The world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a key benchmark in limiting global damage caused by climate change. To do so it will require a transformation of the global economy from one that has been powered by fossil fuels to one that no longer depends on them.However, South-east Asia has been reliant on fossil fuels to drive massive economic expansion, urbanisation and industrialisation in the past two decades. An unbalanced shift towards decarbonisation in the region can result in tradeoffs with real-life consequences.A just transition to net zero for our region means ensuring continued operations for economic development in tandem with replacing high-emitting technologies with low-emitting or carbon-free alternatives. Our priority must be to deliver environmental commitments that incorporate energy security as well as economic and social equity and quality.There needs to be leadership, collaboration and action from all stakeholders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c governments and regulators, consumers, investors, financial institutions and the real economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to ensure a sustainable future.Singapore to lead the way in financing South-east Asia's net zero transition The exponential growth of the region's green financial ecosystem has shown us that the transition to a net zero economy is a priority for key stakeholders here. This is not just about managing environmental risk: decarbonisation is a generation-defining business opportunity.Singapore has an opportunity to lead this just transformation through connecting people and businesses within Asean. We have seen this leadership take shape in the financial ecosystem.Singapore is home to the Asia-Pacific arm of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions that aims to help bridge global investors' net zero concerns with the actual needs of South-east Asia. One of GFANZ's key focus is to shape regional net zero sectoral pathways that will be recognised by investors adhering to established standards and taxonomies.Such pathways provide a useful benchmark for financial institutions to shape their investments and financial services to be in line with the net zero transition in particular sectors, which can create fundamental shifts on an industry scale. This will help enable more private capital to be channelled from developed markets to drive sustainable development of the region and facilitate a just transition to net zero.In particular, transition financing will be crucial to support the transition of high-carbon and hard-to-abate sectors, such as oil and gas, including the decommissioning of existing assets without leaving their operations stranded in the process.Further, public-private partnerships will play a critical role in fostering collaboration and managing private-sector risks and public-sector costs. According to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) estimates, Asean governments will need the private sector to fund 40 per cent of infrastructure investments. The ADB's Asean Catalytic Green Finance Facility Fund, which targets to attract US$3 of commercial capital per dollar of public capital spend, is one such example.A report by Microsoft and Temasek estimated that more than half of the US$2 trillion investment needs in the region will likely be in sectors such as renewable energy, transportation and the built environment. With investors increasingly seeking high-quality assets and projects that meet international sustainability standards, making South-east Asia's green infrastructure projects bankable will be critical.Collective efforts critical to building our net zero future in Asean This green industrial revolution won't happen through the efforts of one sector, one company or one individual. The end goal of transitioning to a net zero economy is to ensure that people can lead better lives while securing the sustainability of their future. If a zero carbon economy can only be possible at the expense of the livelihoods of our local communities, it would hardly be counted as a victory for the path towards net zero.As a bank, it is not just about bringing our financing portfolio to net zero. Even if we do so but the real economy does not achieve net zero, then collectively as a global community we have failed. To achieve real impact, we need to drive sustainability that is inclusive and progressive. By making a collective effort to support our clients through advisory and provide access to sustainable financing and green solutions, we will help companies in the region with their transition to net zero.As the saying goes, if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. Our success depends on how we work together to build a sustainable future for the people and businesses within Asean, and those connecting with the region.The writer is the Chief Sustainability Officer at UOBBrought to you by</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a key benchmark in limiting global damage caused by climate change.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>As a bank, it is not just about bringing our financing portfolio to net zero.

Over the last two years, an average of around 3,840 firms were deregistered each month, similar to the period of 2017-2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, an average of more than 5,000 new firms were registered each month over the last two years, reflecting an increase in the total number of businesses operating in Singapore, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>2. In the last two years, the Government has committed substantial resources to help our businesses weather the immediate impact of COVID-19. We are also helping our businesses prepare for post Covid-19 recovery and continuing to enhance Singapore's position as a business hub in several ways.</p><p>3. First, we are strengthening both our physical and digital connectivity. For example, we are gradually and carefully reopening our borders to more countries through arrangements such as the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). Our ports are kept operating throughout the pandemic to ensure supply chain resilience. We will continue to enhance both our air and sea connectivity.</p><p>4. The Government is similarly extending Singapore's digital connectivity by establishing a network of Digital Economy Agreements (DEAs) with like-minded partners. We are also investing in digital infrastructure and capability building for our businesses and workers to access such opportunities. For example, the Grow Digital initiative helps SMEs tap on established e-commerce platforms to better access global markets, while the Enterprise Development Grant encourages SMEs to transform and strengthen their capabilities. In addition, we are partnering industry stakeholders in this endeavour. An example is the SGTraDex, which is a common data infrastructure that enables businesses to transit into the digital domain. It also builds a stronger and more robust supply chain ecosystem for international trade flows.</p><p>5. Second, we are supporting our businesses in capturing new and emerging opportunities, such as those from the green sector. As part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030 announced this year, we will help our enterprises and workforce harness sustainability as a competitive advantage, and develop innovative solutions for the green economy. These include, among others, carbon trading and related services, low-carbon solutions, green finance, and green infrastructure. Enterprise Singapore recently launched the Enterprise Sustainability Programme which supports businesses, especially SMEs, to build capabilities and capture new opportunities in this exciting space.</p><p>6. Third, we are helping businesses transform for the future economy, sector by sector. The Future Economy Council is currently refreshing the Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) to meet the accelerated changes brought about by COVID-19. For each of the 23 ITM sectors, we are working with our tripartite partners to update our sectoral strategies to seize new opportunities, as well as improve the productivity and wages of workers through digitalisation, innovation, internationalisation, upskilling and job redesign.</p><p>7. These are the fundamentals which underpin our competitiveness and ensure that Singapore remains as a global-Asia node for technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>8. I am confident that through close partnership with Singaporeans and the business community, we will be able to emerge stronger together.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Trade and Industry, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0057332937</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6424-CJB1-DXMP-K0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 3, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D43B</classCode><className>BUSINESS CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CC</classCode><className>COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000593</classCode><className>EMISSIONS CREDITS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

From the news stories on the impact of rising sea levels and temperatures and biodiversity loss, to realisations of increasing costs of fuel and groceries at the petrol station or supermarket. Or even when we walk out the door and complain about the unbearable heat. The world is literally on fire, yet it seems that we are not quite doing enough to stop it.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released in April, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres gave a stark assessment of global progress towards tackling climate change. \"This report of the IPCC is a litany of broken climate promises. It is a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track towards an unliveable world\", he said.</p><p> Here in South-east Asia, climate change is a crucial issue we must tackle. The region remains exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, from environmental degradation, erratic weather and natural catastrophes to rising sea levels and temperatures and resultant forest fires that destroy homes and habitats. These climate events affect South-east Asia's key sectors such as agriculture, fishing and tourism, with the region facing a risk of losing more than 35 per cent of its gross domestic product by 2050.</p><p> The whole ecosystem must work towards a just transitionThe world must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a key benchmark in limiting global damage caused by climate change. To do so it will require a transformation of the global economy from one that has been powered by fossil fuels to one that no longer depends on them. </p><p> However, South-east Asia has been reliant on fossil fuels to drive massive economic expansion, urbanisation and industrialisation in the past two decades. An unbalanced shift towards decarbonisation in the region can result in trade-offs with real-life consequences. </p><p> A just transition to net zero for our region means ensuring continued operations for economic development in tandem with replacing high-emitting technologies with low-emitting or carbon-free alternatives. Our priority must be to deliver environmental commitments that incorporate energy security as well as economic and social equity and quality. </p><p> There needs to be leadership, collaboration and action from all stakeholders -- governments and regulators, consumers, investors, financial institutions and the real economy -- to ensure a sustainable future.</p><p>Singapore to lead the way in financing South-east Asia's net zero transition The exponential growth of the region's green financial ecosystem has shown us that the transition to a net zero economy is a priority for key stakeholders here. This is not just about managing environmental risk: decarbonisation is a generation-defining business opportunity.</p><p>Singapore has an opportunity to lead this just transformation through connecting people and businesses within Asean. We have seen this leadership take shape in the financial ecosystem.</p><p>Singapore is home to the Asia-Pacific arm of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a global coalition of leading financial institutions that aims to help bridge global investors' net zero concerns with the actual needs of South-east Asia. One of GFANZ's key focus is to shape regional net zero sectoral pathways that will be recognised by investors adhering to established standards and taxonomies. </p><p> Such pathways provide a useful benchmark for financial institutions to shape their investments and financial services to be in line with the net zero transition in particular sectors, which can create fundamental shifts on an industry scale. This will help enable more private capital to be channelled from developed markets to drive sustainable development of the region and facilitate a just transition to net zero.</p><p> In particular, transition financing will be crucial to support the transition of high-carbon and hard-to-abate sectors, such as oil and gas, including the decommissioning of existing assets without leaving their operations stranded in the process. </p><p> Further, public-private partnerships will play a critical role in fostering collaboration and managing private-sector risks and public-sector costs. According to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) estimates, Asean governments will need the private sector to fund 40 per cent of infrastructure investments. The ADB's Asean Catalytic Green Finance Facility Fund, which targets to attract US$3 of commercial capital per dollar of public capital spend, is one such example. </p><p> A report by Microsoft and Temasek estimated that more than half of the US$2 trillion investment needs in the region will likely be in sectors such as renewable energy, transportation and the built environment. With investors increasingly seeking high-quality assets and projects that meet international sustainability standards, making South-east Asia's green infrastructure projects bankable will be critical. </p><p> Collective efforts critical to building our net zero future in AseanThis green industrial revolution won't happen through the efforts of one sector, one company or one individual. The end goal of transitioning to a net zero economy is to ensure that people can lead better lives while securing the sustainability of their future. If a zero carbon economy can only be possible at the expense of the livelihoods of our local communities, it would hardly be counted as a victory for the path towards net zero. </p><p> As a bank, it is not just about bringing our financing portfolio to net zero. Even if we do so but the real economy does not achieve net zero, then collectively as a global community we have failed. To achieve real impact, we need to drive sustainability that is inclusive and progressive. By making a collective effort to support our clients through advisory and provide access to sustainable financing and green solutions, we will help companies in the region with their transition to net zero.</p><p> As the saying goes, if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. Our success depends on how we work together to build a sustainable future for the people and businesses within Asean, and those connecting with the region.</p><p> The writer is the Chief Sustainability Officer at UOB </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-V9Q7HQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66S8-SDY1-DYX4-0552-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1056\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Leveraging on these insights, and with the addition of strong partners like MPA and \"K\"LINE to the MOU, we are confident that we can meaningfully progress the development works and target to be among the first to commence ammonia bunkering business in Singapore.''</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related</emphasis>: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/smw-2022-mpa-inks-collaborations-to-accelerate-maritime-decarbonisation/\">SMW 2022: MPA inks collaborations to accelerate maritime decarbonisation</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related</emphasis>: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/singapore-mpa-and-yara-international-in-ammonia-fuelled-tanker-joint-development-project/\">Singapore: MPA and Yara Intl in Ammonia-fuelled tanker Joint Development Project</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related</emphasis>: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/singapore-players-in-feasibility-study-for-first-green-e-methanol-plant-in-s-e-a/\">Singapore: Players in feasibility study for first green e-methanol plant in S.E.A.</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related</emphasis>: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/mpa-blueprint-prepares-marine-fuels-sector-for-multi-fuel-bunkering-transition/\">MPA blueprint prepares marine fuels sector for multi-fuel bunkering transition</url></p><p>Photo credit: Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd.<br/> Published: 17 May, 2022</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com/news/mou-signed-to-develop-ammonia-bunkering-in-singapore/\">MOU signed to develop ammonia bunkering in Singapore</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com\">Manifold Times</url>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.manifoldtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANFLD-18747</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANFLD2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65P4-WT01-F039-818S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">481973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><timeReceived>4:59 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Manifold Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Manifold Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37684\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 17, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R7M</classCode><className>KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0004MSP</classCode><className>A P MOELLER-MAERSK A/S</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000292W</classCode><className>SUMITOMO CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002SLL</classCode><className>AMERICAN BUREAU OF SHIPPING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS483111 DEEP SEA FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS488320 MARINE CARGO HANDLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS483113 COASTAL &amp;

The offering will comprise S$2.4 billion of bonds -- the maximum of the S$1.9 billion to S$2.4 billion range provided by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) -- on the back of a S$5.3 billion order book. The bookrunners are DBS, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, OCBC and Standard Chartered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MAS said the bonds were placed with \"a diverse mix of high-quality institutions\". </p><p> \"The strong orderbook affirms investors' confidence in the government's plans to build green infrastructure for a financially and environmentally sustainable future,\" MAS deputy managing director for markets and development Leong Sing Chiong said in a statement. \"In addition, the extension of the sovereign yield curve to 50 years will further develop the Singapore Dollar bond market and support longer-tenor corporate issuances.\"</p><p> The effective yield of 3.04 per cent reflects a coupon of 3 per cent and an offering price of S$98.976 per S$100 in principal value. The offer amount includes S$50 million of bonds that will be set aside for the public, which can begin to apply for the bonds from 9am on Aug 5 to noon on Aug 10. The remainder of the bonds will be placed with institutional and other investors. MAS may reallocate unsold bonds from the public offer to the placement tranche.</p><p> Besides being the first sovereign green bonds issued by Singapore, the offering also set a precedent as the first 50-year Singapore Government Securities (SGS) with a maturity that falls on Aug 1, 2072. The previous longest tenor for an SGS was 30 years. </p><p> Clifford Lee, global head of fixed income at DBS, noted that the new notes would be the longest-dated green bonds ever issued by any sovereign globally. That ability to borrow at such long maturities reflected the country's credit strength, he explained, highlighting that Singapore is 1 out of only 9 sovereigns globally, and the only 1 in Asia, that has been rated AAA by all three ratings agencies. </p><p> Sovereign bonds are often used in bond markets to provide pricing benchmarks from which yields are determined for other debt instruments. Having a 50-year yield will therefore give the Singapore-dollar bond market a new data point for pricing longer-term debt.</p><p> \"It will test the depth of the investor base for such long-dated Singdollar bonds and open up the market for further deepening of the Singdollar bond market to stretch the tenors and extend the Singdollar bond yield curve,\" Lee said. </p><p> Wong Tze Hong, director of bonds portal Bondsupermart, said pricing indicated \"very strong demand\" from institutional investors, which allowed MAS to reduce the yield on the bonds from marketing guidance.</p><p> One reason for the strong demand for the bonds could be due to the lack of alternatives in the market for institutional investors, he said. The only other Singapore-dollar denominated bond with a tenor of 50 years in the market is issued by state investor Temasek, which priced S$1.5 billion worth of bonds at a 2.8 per cent yield in Aug 2021. The bond had an indicative bid yield of about 3.8 per cent on Bondsupermart late Thursday.</p><p> Jerome\u00a0Tay, investment analyst for fixed income at asset manager abrdn, said that the extension of the yield curve could make it easier for corporates or quasi-sovereigns to issue long-dated bonds. </p><p> However, Maybank Securities' head of fixed-income research Winson Phoon pointed out that Temasek and the Land Transport Authority were already able to price bonds with a maturity period beyond 30 years. The transport agency had sold S$1.4 billion worth of 35-year bonds in May 2019.</p><p> \"The price discovery for quasi-sovereign bond pricing was working just fine without the 50-year SGS as a reference point,\" Phoon said. </p><p> With a rising rate environment, bond yields have gone up and are looking attractive for investors. Tay noted that the market has already priced in further rate hikes at least until the end of this year, regardless of whether policymakers are able to tighten monetary policy that leads to a soft landing in the event of an recession. </p><p> \"I'll argue that if recession does happen, policymakers will eventually have to stimulate the economy again, and that will be positive for bonds,\" he added. </p><p> While inflation still remains a key risk, Phoon thinks that the market appetite for duration has been improving gradually amid growing concerns about a recession in the United States. </p><p> Besides the green SGS coming with a 50-year yield, pricing is also being set by syndication for the first time, a process that provides some flexibility for the timing of pricing. Previous Singapore government bonds were priced via auctions that followed a strict calendar.</p><p> A key aspect of the green label for these green bonds is that proceeds will be used to finance expenditures in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, including 2 new MRT lines -- the Jurong Region Line and the Cross Island Line. </p><p> These are the first in a series of expected sovereign green bonds issued under the Singapore Green Bond framework. The Singapore government has indicated a pipeline of up to S$35 billion of sovereign and public sector green bonds that will be issued by 2030.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The proceeds raised from these bonds will be used to finance expenditures in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, including 2 new MRT lines -- the Jurong Region Line and the Cross Island Line.

It is part of the curriculum, and many schools have programmes to help our students learn to be environmentally conscious,\" he said.</p><p>\"Beyond specific policies, we also want to instil a broader mindset change and new environmentally-conscious habits. These will take time to take root in our society. We must start young and inculcate them in our students through education.\"</p><p>To achieve this, the ministry will pilot sustainability features in four schools: Elias Park Primary School, Mee Toh School, Commonwealth Secondary School and Tampines Secondary School.</p><p>The pilot will run from April this year to 2023. It will focus on:</p><p>Developing policies and programmes to help schools reduce their carbon footprint</p><p>Raising students' awareness of their carbon footprint and what they can do to reduce it</p><p>Developing and trying out lesson resources that either feature sustainability initiatives or are integrated with green infrastructure within the school environment</p><p>Enhancing sustainability infrastructure within the school campus to reduce each school's carbon footprint. These features could include solar panels, LED lights and direct-current fans.</p><p>ECO STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMME</p><p>From 2021, all primary, secondary and pre-university schools will also introduce a programme focused on raising awareness of environment and sustainability issues.</p><p>The Eco Stewardship Programme seeks to \"inculcate in students a deeper sense of environmental consciousness to guide their habits and behaviours\", said MOE in a statement.</p><p>Among the features of the programme are:\u00a0</p><p>An enhanced curriculum that weaves in sustainability issues. For example, social studies lessons at the primary school level will be revised to teach students about the importance of using resources wisely to protect the environment. At the pre-university level, the emphasis will be on the importance of sustainable urban development</p><p>Green features on school campuses such as more trees and energy-efficient technologies such as LED lights and direct-current ceiling fans</p><p>Enhanced school policies in areas such as energy and water conservation, as well as waste management</p><p>More environment-related volunteering and enrichment opportunities for students, and lessons to raise awareness about future \"green jobs\", such as in urban design, renewable energy, sustainability technology, water management, food sustainability, urban farming, and green financing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-10652401</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:624M-DGR1-DXPH-P1MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 4, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTM4N0UwOUZFNzc0NDhDOUIzNDNCODU4Mzg5NDE1REQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001938</classCode><className>EDUCATION &amp;

The roll-out of vaccines should help contain the spread, but that will be a prolonged process. It will not be until well into the second half of 2021, at best, that the pandemic may possibly be brought under control. In these circumstances, economies will need continued fiscal support from governments. US lawmakers agreed on a new US$900 billion (S$1.2 trillion) package of relief measures - which President Donald Trump has now rejected - on top of the more than US$2 trillion passed earlier. This would have brought the total fiscal support this year to more than 13 per cent of gross domestic product. The incoming administration of president-elect Joe Biden has pledged even more stimulus next year.</p><p> Many European countries which are reeling from repeated lockdowns will also almost certainly need to step up fiscal assistance from already record levels. In October, the International Monetary Fund cautioned that one of the biggest risks in responding to the economic impact of the pandemic would be a premature withdrawal of fiscal support. That is even more true now.</p><p> It also applies to Singapore. Although the Government has pledged close to $100 billion in spending in response to the pandemic - equal to about 20 per cent of GDP - and is likely to run a record fiscal deficit of more than 15 per cent of GDP this financial year, there is a case for continued fiscal support. With the economy starting to recover, this would need to be carefully targeted. For example, while there is no case for providing broad-based wage subsidies, the Jobs Support Scheme which tapers off in March may need to be extended for sectors likely to remain hard hit, such as aviation and tourism-related sectors, the prospects for which are still bleak.</p><p> The Jobs Growth Incentive, under which the Government co-pays salaries of new local hires and which will expire in February, may also need to be selectively extended. And with unemployment likely to remain high, the Covid-19 Support Grant - which provides temporary assistance to those who suffer involuntary job and income losses, and applications for which end on Dec 31 - will need to be carried over into 2021.</p><p> On top of providing reliefs, the Government must also continue to maintain public investments in health, education, training and green infrastructure, which can be both job creating and boost sustainability and resilience in the economy. There will come a time when the Government will need to rebuild its fiscal position. But for now, fighting the impact of Covid-19 must continue to be the priority.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-759873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61KS-RFT1-DYX4-01B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

Ahead of Feb 14, The Edge Singapore gathered predictions and wishlists from consultants, corporates and advocates that are specific to Singapore's sustainability agenda. From climate adaptation strategies to tax incentives on green buildings, they emphasise a need to balance decarbonisation goals with support for businesses amid the green transition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At last year's Budget, Wong, who is also the deputy prime minister, announced Singapore's plans to reach net-zero emissions by or around 2050, bringing the previous timeline forward by up to 50 years. The government updated this plan in October 2022 to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Taimur Baig, managing director and chief economist at DBS Bank, Budget 2023 will mark a shift from emergency spending and allocation to deal with the pandemic to a more conventional one. The government had committed around $100 billion to support the economy when Covid-19 hit.</p><p>\"The country's current target is to reduce emissions to around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, after peaking emissions earlier,\" says Baig. \"We expect these high-level targets to inform all budgets going forward and we anticipate more announcements on initiatives advancing decarbonisation.\"</p><p>Last year, Wong also announced that by 2030, Singapore's government and statutory boards would issue up to $35 billion in green bonds to fund public sector green infrastructure projects, such as charging points for electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p>To further encourage the adoption of EVs, input tax should be claimable on GST incurred for related expenses, says Yeo Kai Eng, EY's Asean indirect tax leader. \"Likewise, expenses incurred on EVs by businesses should be fully tax-deductible and capital allowances claimable on the purchase of EVs.\"</p><p>Industry and transport are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, says DBS's Baig, and Singapore, as a key global transportation node, has \"a major role\" in decarbonising the shipping and aviation sectors. \"Recent budgets contained measures to facilitate private adoption of cleaner energy vehicles; we expect to see more such announcements this year.\"</p><p>Among last year's announcements was a hike in carbon taxes, with Singapore's carbon tax rate set to rise up to 16 times the current rate of $5 per tonne of emissions by 2030. The first hike to $25 per tonne is expected in 2024, after Parliament passed the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill on Nov 8, 2022.</p><p>While the carbon tax rate hike is a \"welcome move\", Baig calls for targeted technical and financial support to further ease the transition for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p><p>Woo Qiyun, sustainability consultant at Singapore-headquartered climate-tech start-up Unravel Carbon, hopes the government can encourage companies of various sizes to measure and report their emissions, particularly from their supply chains. \"This would mean increased support for SMEs to begin embarking on this effort, and also to develop strong standards to encourage comparable, verifiable and robust sustainability reporting.\"</p><p>For residents, carbon taxes may lead to a \"modest rise\" in household utility bills, says DBS's Baig. \"Some cash support or rebates would help to cushion those in the lower-income bracket.\"</p><p>Woo hopes gains from carbon taxes can be apportioned to vulnerable groups. \"While there are GST vouchers, it would be timely to consider ringfencing a portion of environmental taxes, such as the carbon tax, towards supporting communities who will bear the brunt of increased living costs.\"</p><p>Post-pandemic, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has been updating its Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs), which outlines strategies for 23 major industry sectors to adapt and grow. First launched in 2017, Wong unveiled the revised 2025 roadmap for the financial sector in October 2022. The National Environment Agency announced the most recent ITM update on Jan 17, for the environmental services sector. Woo hopes the ITMs can integrate sustainability across all sectors to include \"strong, quantifiable environmental goals\".</p><p>Energy transition</p><p>In the coming months, businesses will grapple with tough decisions as the world faces bearish economic conditions, warns Schneider Electric's Yoon Young Kim. Investments in green technologies and emission-reducing initiatives may face cost-cutting measures, he adds. \"Nonetheless, we believe that now is especially not the time to dial back on driving sustainability and decarbonisation.\"</p><p>Continued support for businesses is crucial, says Kim, Schneider Electric's cluster president of Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei. \"Carbon tax amounts are not small but can be reduced through carbon-limiting technologies or improving a building's energy efficiency. A large portion of the costs of these upgrades can be offset through grants. Hence, we expect Budget 2023 to expand on the support to encourage companies to make the green transition.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the energy transition will continue to be a key focus area, says Xylia Sim, energy and infrastructure counsel at global law firm Linklaters. \"Green hydrogen has the potential to be a low-carbon alternative to promote the decarbonisation of high-carbon sectors. In Singapore, this could help with decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, such as shipping and aviation, while supporting Singapore's energy security.\"</p><p>Singapore launched its national hydrogen strategy last October, estimating that the low-carbon fuel could supply half of the republic's power needs by 2050. Sim adds: \"With its strengths in research and development, Singapore is well-positioned to capitalise on the nascent stage of hydrogen technologies to support the development of a hydrogen economy.\"</p><p>Green buildings</p><p>With Singapore's tourism sector poised for a strong recovery in the coming months, CapitaLand Investment (CLI) hopes to see tax incentives for hotels to green their buildings.</p><p>But not everyone is on a level playing field on this decarbonisation journey, says Beh Siew Kim, chief financial and sustainability officer, lodging, at CLI. \"Financing and tax incentives can therefore be introduced to bridge this gap, especially for businesses that are committed to sustainability.\"</p><p>More explicitly, KPMG calls for incentives to bridge a demand-supply gap for green buildings, including a 200% tax deduction on financing costs and rental of green properties, a 30% property tax rebate and a 50% exemption on taxable gains from green building sales.</p><p>\"Singapore can lead the development and implementation of asset recycling frameworks to refinance brownfield infrastructure,\" says Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, partner and head of tax at KPMG in Singapore. \"These mechanisms will optimise private sector innovation, investment and efficiency in operating infrastructure assets while freeing up capital that can be deployed to other priority greenfield infrastructure projects.\"</p><p>Carbon credits</p><p>From 2024, the government will allow businesses to use \"high-quality, international carbon credits\" to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. By purchasing carbon offsets, businesses compensate for unavoidable emissions by funding projects that remove, avoid or reduce emissions.</p><p>To facilitate future carbon trading, Singapore is home to two initiatives. In December 2022, the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), the World Bank and the Singapore government launched the Climate Action Data Trust (CAD Trust), a platform to share information about carbon credits and projects.</p><p>CAD Trust will integrate data from multiple global registries, such as Verra, Gold Standard, AmericanCarbon Registry and Global Carbon Council; and make this information available to the public in 1Q2023.</p><p>Last November, Singapore-based carbon exchange and marketplace Climate Impact X (CIX) held its first major carbon credit auction. Launched in 2021, CIX is a joint venture between DBS Bank, the Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek.</p><p>CIX will leverage Nasdaq's matching technology to power its spot trading platform, set to launch in early 2023 for financial institutions and institutional investors worldwide.</p><p>Businesses welcome greater clarity on carbon taxes and carbon credits, says Beh, who is also The Ascott's managing director of Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Japan and Korea. \"Expanding on grants and schemes in this regard will be a welcome initiative to help organisations shoulder the financial burden from higher carbon taxes and accelerate their green transition.\"</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore stated in 2021 that global demand for voluntary carbon credits is expected to grow 15-fold to 2 billion tonnes in 2030. Hence, EY hopes Singapore can include carbon credits as designated investments for funds' tax incentive schemes, which will offer tax exemptions.</p><p>Desmond Teo, EY Asean private tax leader, says: \"We observed that investors are taking a keen interest in the carbon market to achieve sustainability objectives for their portfolios. To facilitate the trading liquidity of carbon credits, we suggest that carbon credits be included in the list of designated investments.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67GW-3K31-DYX1-T002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1531\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

They are tradable certificates that allow its holder to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. Companies with any unneeded credits may sell them to others that need them; or they can pay for green projects elsewhere to offset their own emissions.</p><p>With the carbon information tracked in the tokens, issuers and investors can have visibility of the carbon footprint (or lack thereof) of their production activities and investment portfolios, CTX said. \"This will help them to align their fundraising and investing activities with their commitment to promote sustainable business practices.\"</p><p>The three Chinese entities that will partner with CTX are: CECEP Green Carbon Investment and Development Co, a subsidiary of China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP); Jinmao Capital, a subsidiary China Jinmao Holdings; and China Taiping InsuranceSingapore.</p><p>CTX, backed by the USD 2 billion Asia Green Fund, said its CNTs would pave the way for carbon credits to be transferred across international borders, which to date has not been possible due to protracted disagreements among signatories to the Paris Agreement regarding Article 6 of the landmark pact on climate change.</p><p>Article 6 sets out rules for the workings of a global carbon market. Under the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to meet their \"nationally determined contributions (NDCs)\" within a timeframe and in a manner they are sovereignly determined.</p><p>The NDCs comprise emission reduction targets, policies, and measures to mitigate climate change. The Article 6 dispute has mostly centred on how to avoid \"double counting\" of internationally traded carbon offsets, as well as whether to transfer pre-2021 issued credits to the new offset system.</p><p>Dr Bai Bo, co-founder and executive chairman of CTX is hopeful the innovation behind CNT will help pollutive industries reduce their emissions in a sustainable manner. Dr Bai is also chairman and founder of Asia Green Fund, one of Asia's first impact private equity funds.</p><p>\"We were able to engender trust at a time when the crypto market was going through uncertainties because CTX is regulated by the MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) and built on the robust trading and market surveillance technologies of Nasdaq,\" he said.</p><p>Dr Bai disclosed that CTX is also in talks with institutions in Europe and North America to issue tokens on its exchange. \"Chinese-backed tokens will initially be dominant because of the size of its carbon credits market but our ambition is to develop CTX into a global marketplace for green investing.\"</p><p>MAS recently licensed CTX as a Recognised Market Operator. It also holds a Capital Market Services License but is exempted from the Payment Services.</p><p>CTX, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Cyberdyne Tech Services, will kick-off trading next month with bitcoin, which it expects will be a popular medium for settlement on its exchange. A direct exchange between bitcoin and fiat currencies is allowed on CTX, with each bitcoin carrying a carbon emission value.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REGSIA-64831</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REGSIA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637M-WS91-JB24-N1SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><timeReceived>11:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 inAsia Media Pte Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Regulation Asia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 27, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000DN0L</classCode><className>CECEP SOLAR ENERGY CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009A5Z</classCode><className>BANG &amp;

Buildings in the city-state account for over 20 per cent of the country's emissions and are responsible for over a third of its total electricity consumption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Greening its buildings is hence a key strategy in achieving its sustainability ambitions under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, and in fulfilling its international commitments on climate change, says the nation's Green Building Masterplan.</p><p> And these efforts were given a boost in Singapore's latest Budget announcement earlier this month.</p><p> The latest iteration of the Green Building masterplan set \"80-80-80 in 2030\" targets: greening 80 per cent of Singapore's buildings, by gross floor area, by 2030; having 80 per cent of new developments, by gross floor area, be Super Low Energy buildings from 2030; and achieving 80 per cent improvement in energy efficiency for best-in-class green buildings by 2030.</p><p> \"The goal is an ambitious one, and will need full public, private and people partnership to achieve it,\" says Charles Lim, leader, South-east Asia, at Johnson Controls.</p><p> A green building, according to the Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC), is one that is resource-efficient and environmentally responsible throughout its life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. The SGBC notes that green buildings are also increasingly taking occupant health factors into consideration.</p><p> Green buildings here are certified through the Green Mark Scheme, administered by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), while the SGBC certifies green building products and materials that play a complementary role to the national green building rating tool.</p><p> Kamya Miglani, director of research, Work Dynamics, Asia-Pacific, at JLL, says Singapore's Green Mark scheme lays a clear emphasis on energy and water conservation through a mix of design and technology features and is now recognised and used not only in Singapore but across the region.</p><p> She notes that the Republic has already greened 43 per cent of its buildings, which is more than half of its national target, and that the corporate sector here is aligned with the government's net-zero ambitions.</p><p> Wong Heang Fine, group chief executive officer of Surbana Jurong Group, says the efforts are ongoing - with the BCA and SGBC actively working with key stakeholders on the next iteration of the masterplan, \"paying particular attention to design, including supply chain and procurement of raw materials through to delivery, in which assets are operated and maintained sustainably through smart city management tools\".</p><p> Measures announced in this year's Budget will serve to boost the nation's efforts.</p><p> Yoon Young Kim, cluster president, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei, at Schneider Electric, says that Singapore's move to raise the carbon tax will help to accelerate the green transition. \"Putting a higher price on carbon will urge more companies to realise the costs of inaction, and take more aggressive steps in decarbonisation. In doing so, companies should leverage innovative technologies more extensively to optimise performance in emissions, as well as to measure and achieve sustainability targets.\"</p><p> Wong believes the carbon-tax increases will move the needle on decarbonisation, saying: \"Major emitters and industrialists, mid- to heavy-duty transport sectors may accelerate their electrification or even adopt hydrogen as fuel. Petroleum &amp; chemicals, iron and steel, cement and other major GHG (greenhouse gas) emitters will see more value in adopting renewable energy, electrifying their processes and/or introducing new energy alternatives in their operations.\"</p><p> Lim also points out that Singapore is rolling out other measures and schemes to support its net zero ambition, such as a planned issue of up to S$35 billion in green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects.</p><p> Schneider Electric is said to be heartened by the government's plans to put in place a transition framework that would support firms making the adjustments, while enabling them to manage their competitiveness. Yoon adds that Singapore can strengthen its role as a sustainability hub - providing the knowledge and expertise in the area of green buildings and sustainable development.</p><p> Miglani believes the measures in Singapore's Budget 2022 will create opportunities for new technology such as carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen, which can create investment and business opportunities as well as jobs of the future. \"Concrete steps taken by the Singapore government in the form of policy, incentives, taxes and collaboration is creating an ecosystem that will help Singapore achieve its net zero ambitions well within the timeline of mid-century.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>As in many parts of the world, the built environment in Singapore plays a significant role in its decarbonisation efforts.

This is our business. This is what we do. We invest in renewable energies, we invest in energy transition, and we have been doing this for a long time, and we want to do this going forward, so we are not a pure financial investor.</p><p> \"We are here not just to get in itself. We are here for the long run, the next decades... In terms of shareholder structure, we are coming in and maybe taking the place of other shareholders, and that's because we have a common view.\"</p><p> Adding that it is part of the \"normal evolution of companies\" that shareholders sometimes get substituted by others, he said: \"In this case, clearly, the good thing about this is that we are joining forces, and combined, I think we can do a lot more.\"</p><p> In a joint press statement, the two companies said the plans to set up a Singapore headquarters are in line with EDPR's strategy for the region, which it identified as the world's fastest-growing renewables market. The region accounted for 55 per cent of global capacity additions this decade, with solar representing 65 per cent of the growth, they noted.</p><p> Together, the companies will embark on renewable energy projects across the Asia-Pacific region, specifically solar and wind projects, they pointed out. There will also be opportunities for cooperation in energy storage and green hydrogen, among others, they said.</p><p> Sunseap's founders will be part of the region's top management team that will lead the business, as EDPR intends to tap their regional knowledge and strong distribution generation track record, they added.</p><p> Currently, EDPR has access to markets with growth in renewables of over 120 gigawatts a year, a figure that represents approximately 75 per cent of the expected global growth between 2020 and 2030.</p><p> Sunseap has a pipeline of close to 10 gigawatt alternate current of solar energy projects across Asia, and its solar energy systems are used in more than 3,000 buildings in Singapore, including in public housing estates.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CEO Frank Phuan says Sunseap\u00a0is shelving its IPO plans because fundraising \"can take the backseat\" now that EDPR is a majority shareholder.\u00a0</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-389429</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64VV-8XH1-DYX4-02JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

ESP builds on current environmental efforts in all schools, from primary to pre-university levels, through the 4Cs - Curriculum, Campus, Culture and Community.</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20210304-learn-for-life-equipping-ourselves-for-a-changing-world-nurturing-stewards-of-the-environment\">https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/20210304-learn-for-life-equipping-ourselves-for-a-changing-world-nurturing-stewards-of-the-environment</url>)</p><p>(B) Pilot Sustainability Features and Related Concepts in Four Schools</p><p>3. We will step up plans to harness solar energy, reduce energy usage and waste generation in our schools, and work towards a two-thirds reduction of net carbon emissions from the schools sector by 2030. We will also aim for at least 20% of our schools to be carbon neutral by 2030, with the rest to follow.</p><p>4. We will pilot sustainability features and related concepts in four schools that already adopt a holistic school-wide approach to environmental sustainability: Elias Park Primary School, Mee Toh School, Commonwealth Secondary School and Tampines Secondary School. The pilot will run from April this year till 2023.</p><p>5. The pilot will focus on:</p><p>i.developing school-based environmental policies and programmes to help schools reduce their carbon footprint;</p><p>ii. trialling lesson packages to raise students' awareness of their carbon footprints, and how they can reduce them;</p><p>iii. developing and trialling lesson resources which either feature sustainability initiatives or are integrated with green infrastructure within the school environment; and</p><p>iv. enhancing infrastructure and campus to reduce each school's carbon footprint.</p><p>(C) Champion Public Education on Sustainability Through the New Science Centre</p><p>6. Science Centre Singapore will also partner schools to enhance their programmes, including conducting sustainability-themed learning journeys and mentoring students to lead their peers. In addition, the new Science Centre, to be developed at the Jurong Lake District, will showcase innovative sustainability technologies, through programmes and exhibits to continue to engage youths and the public to inspire sustainable lifestyle changes.<br/><br/>(D) Build on Existing Sustainability Efforts by IHLS</p><p>7. Our IHLs have also been strong supporters of environmental sustainability, embarking on similar efforts spanning the 4Cs. In the area of curriculum, they contribute towards building capability for sustainability efforts, through specialised courses[2] as well as common modules. They are also committed to building \"greener\" campus infrastructure and environment; promoting sustainable living initiatives on campus; and leveraging their unique strengths such as engaging in IHL-industry partnerships to provide opportunities for applied learning and contributing to sustainability-related research.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>[1] SolarNova is a Whole-Of-Government effort led by Singapore Economic Development Board, and Housing and Development Board, to accelerate the deployment of solar panels in Singapore.</p><p>[2] Examples of specialised courses include a diploma or degree in Environmental Studies.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Education, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0055743602</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:628D-H691-JB5M-W0XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 4, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTM4N0UwOUZFNzc0NDhDOUIzNDNCODU4Mzg5NDE1REQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00097CG</classCode><className>EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001938</classCode><className>EDUCATION &amp;

There is no better reminder of our shared future as one humanity than this pandemic. The theme of this EXPO - to jointly build a shared future - is most timely. Trade between ASEAN and China have flourished since dialogue relations were established thirty years ago. Despite COVID-19, trade grew in 2020 and is now worth more than US$500 billion. We are now each other's largest trading partners.</p><p>Looking ahead, ASEAN and China will benefit further from closer economic integration, especially with a fast-growing digital economy and an expanding middle class.</p><p>The Corridor</p><p>In particular, we can explore how ASEAN and China can collaborate on the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor. Started as an initiative between Singapore and China, the Corridor has the potential to benefit the wider region as an alternative trade route. During my visit to Chongqing in 2019, I witnessed first-hand the extent of the Corridor's network and its immense potential. By providing a more direct link between Western China and Southeast Asia, the Corridor reduces the time and cost for the movement of goods and the provision of services between these fast-growing regions and beyond. Last year, despite COVID-19, we saw a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in trade volume along the Corridor. We can further build on this growth momentum.</p><p>Strengthening Trade</p><p>Beyond the Corridor, ASEAN and China should continue our cooperation to strengthen the rules-based multilateral framework for trade and investments. We should work towards upgrading the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement to further reduce non-tariff measures and address new priorities to keep up with the times. Digital collaboration will be a key building block. By leveraging on existing platforms such as the ASEAN Smart Cities Network, we can make faster progress.</p><p>We should also rebuild our air links and further liberalise the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement to boost regional connectivity. Air travel in the post-pandemic world will be different. But strong air links will remain critical to economic recovery, and in deepening mutual understanding between our peoples. Beyond ASEAN and China, the RCEP promotes greater integration in the region. Singapore and China have ratified the RCEP, and we look forward to the RCEP coming into force. Through greater economic cooperation, we can grow our companies and improve the lives of people in the region.</p><p>Sustainable Development</p><p>Apart from economic cooperation, sustainable development is another important area of partnership. We designated this year as the ASEAN-China Year of Sustainable Development Cooperation. Southeast Asia is home to the world's largest blue carbon stock and has significant potential to contribute to nature-based solutions for carbon sequestration. Initiatives such as the ASEAN-China Environment Cooperation Strategy and Action Plan, and the BRI International Green Development Coalition can catalyse knowledge exchanges, joint projects, and investment opportunities. Within ASEAN, the Catalytic Green Finance Facility provides loans and technical assistance for green infrastructure projects. With a focus on sustainable development, we can leave behind a greener planet for our children.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The relationship between ASEAN and China has grown from strength to strength since formal dialogue relations began three decades ago.</p><p>Let us work closely together to broaden and deepen this cooperation, and do our part in the global community, in the next 30 years and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0056912555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63K2-VGB1-JB5M-W1CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 10, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Reducing emissions will require massive investment to increase South-east Asia's renewable energy and storage capacity.

Photo: EY</emphasis></p><p>This year, we can expect ongoing regulatory change to support the rise of a new South-east Asia green investment market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c building on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ey.com/en_sg/singapore-budget-2022\">Singapore Budget 2022</url> and the Singapore's Green Finance Action Plan. Last year, Indonesia's financial regulator set up a sustainable finance task force to develop the country's sustainable finance ecosystem. In Malaysia, a new capital market masterplan is focusing on the use of sustainability-related factors in investment decision processes, transparency of environmental, social and governance (ESG) data providers, as well as disclosures and governance among credit and ESG ratings agencies.</p><p>At the same time, we will see ever-increasing government, consumer and investor pressure on businesses to divest high carbon assets, acquire green technology, publish and track progress on their step to net zero. In order to achieve net zero emissions by mid-century, the Singapore government will raise carbon tax progressively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it will be S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030.</p><p>\"With the coming increase in carbon taxes in 2024, businesses will need to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to pivot towards a low carbon and energy-efficient solution,\" says Ms Amy Ang, EY Asia-Pacific Financial Services Tax Leader. </p><p>For financial services, the accelerating demand for carbon transition finance (precipitating both carbon savings and excellent returns), climate risk insurance and sustainable investments, will be a game changer. We'd like to see the banks, insurers and asset managers collaborate to map investment needs, channel capital into sustainable initiatives and support their clients to achieve their net-zero ambitions.</p><p>Also, because sustainability data will need to be produced with the same rigour, quality, global comparability and assurance as financial data, financial services institutions will have a role in assisting business customers to be transparent, accurate and timely with their carbon reporting. </p><p>2. Reimagine the employee experience </p><p>The pandemic has forced all businesses to embrace workforce agility and focus on new kinds of business continuity and resilience strategies. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ey.com/en_sg/news/2021/07/majority-of-surveyed-southeast-asia-sea-employees-prefer-not-to-return\">EY 2021 Work Reimagined Employee Survey</url> found South-east Asia employees wanting to work anywhere (32 per cent), work remotely (29 per cent) or hybrid work arrangements (23 per cent). Nine in 10 employees want flexibility in where and when they work. Notably, three in five would consider leaving their jobs if these options aren't available after the pandemic.</p><p>As new Covid-19 variants continue to emerge this year, institutions will need to manage a dual workforce of on- and off-site workers, with staff empowered to transition to new ways of working at a moment's notice. Apart from the technology needed to ensure a seamless employee experience, this will also require a focus on fairness to diffuse the inevitable \"us and them\" mentality.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/adobe-stock-333194282.jpg\">https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/adobe-stock-333194282.jpg</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">According to the EY 2021 Work Reimagined Employee Survey, nine in 10 employees want flexibility in where and when they work.

They must also proactively support workers whose traditional roles are being automated to upskill and take on higher value activities.</p><p>\"The workforce of the insurer needs to be reimagined and changed. While traditional skills in risk management, actuarial and finance continue to be critical, marrying the power of people and technology will be a vital ingredient for a successful insurance enterprise of the future,\" says Mr Brandon Bruce, EY Asean Insurance Leader.</p><p>In this environment, D&amp;I (diversity and inclusiveness) must expand to become DE&amp;I \u00e2\u20ac\u201c  where the \"E\" stands for \"equity\". This represents equity of experience, equity of opportunity and equity of reward. </p><p>A key lesson from the pandemic is how easy it is for businesses and markets to become disassociated from their employees and customers. Institutions must remember that, ultimately, they rely on the ingenuity, hard work and loyalty of real people. </p><p>To both retain scarce talent and support their social licence to operate, institutions must redesign their employee value propositions to provide a fertile environment for career development, a competitive compensation package and a strong emphasis on well-being, spearheaded by empathetic leadership.</p><p>3. Enable hyper-personalisation, empower your customers </p><p>Many of South-east Asia's banks have been cautious during the pandemic, resulting in increasingly commoditised products and services. No wonder our latest <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ey.com/en_sg/banking-capital-markets/how-can-banks-transform-for-a-new-generation-of-customers'WT.mc_id=10469416&amp;AA.tsrc=display\">Global Consumer Banking Survey</url> found that 35 per cent of Asia-Pacific consumers have relationships with neobanks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by far the highest rate of adoption in any region in the world. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/getty-865596966.jpg\">https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/getty-865596966.jpg</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EY research has shown that Singapore consumers value personalised services and are motivated to expand their relationships with financial providers who understand them and offer customised products that meet their individual needs. Photo: EY</emphasis></p><p>Our region's consumers are becoming highly sophisticated, with new generations especially expecting a seamless integration of financial services into their daily lives. EY surveys of South-east Asia's wealth and banking consumers, including small businesses, all highlight growing demand for a slick experience that integrates all their financial services across providers as well as extend to non-financial offerings.</p><p>\"EY research shows that Singaporean consumers particularly value personalisation that helps maximise functional benefits linked to products, such as loyalty programmes. Other valued personalised experiences include communications that show their provider knows them, the right product offers at the right time and the ability to customise products. Respondents say such offers would motivate them to expand their relationship with their preferred financial providers,\" says Mr Andrew Gilder, EY Asia-Pacific Banking and Capital Markets Leader.</p><p>To meet this need, institutions must shift from product-focused delivery and look at customer journeys from a human-centric perspective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c understanding that personalised experiences drive consumption. It's not about banks selling consumers a generic mortgage or a motor loan, but providing people with the right finance at the right time to purchase their home or car. </p><p>The starting point is to automate and realign workflows. But this is not just about streamlining onboarding and accelerating decision-making. Institutions will also need to employ hyper-personalisation to serve customers' requirements and address financial pain-points. </p><p>It's time to use big data analytics on transactional and behavioural information to enhance segmentation, provide tailored value propositions, and deliver the right levels and types of engagement. </p><p>Incumbents also have a significant opportunity to be the unifying point for consumers' multiple financial relationships via a super app \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially given their trust advantage when it comes to protecting personal data.  </p><p>Unshackling from legacy systems has become critical in 2022</p><p>While the focus of the above three changes is about people, their enabling force is technology. Intelligent automation, artificial intelligence, analytics, blockchain and super apps will all be needed to support new business strategies. </p><p>We therefore expect that 2022 will be the last year where financial services incumbents can continue to rely on legacy systems. </p><p>\"To remain relevant, institutions have no option but to embrace digital transformation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c building, buying, or collaborating with fintechs to rapidly develop agile operating models with automated workflows supported by rich data insights,\" says Mr Brian Thung, EY Asean Financial Services Leader.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2\">Futurists predict</url> that three-quarters of the industry's larger enterprises in the S&amp;P500 could be displaced in the next five years. The urgency of this transformation cannot be overstated. Those who hesitate will not survive.</p><p>Place purpose at the centre of your firm </p><p>To identify and seize the opportunities of 2022, leaders must ensure their strategy and transformation plans are conceived together, so design and delivery inform each other at every stage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and employee well-being is factored in as an ongoing priority. They must embed environmental responsibility as a critical component of their business operations and reframe sustainability as a value-driving innovation opportunity. And they must put purpose at the centre of their organisations, demonstrating authenticity by tangibly measuring its impact on all stakeholders.</p><p>This is what's needed to create the high-performing financial services industry that will be essential to support a green recovery in our region.</p><p>This article was written by Mr Brian Thung, EY Asean Financial Services Leader.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ey.com/en_gl/financial-services-asia-pacific'WT.mc_id=10469855&amp;AA.tsrc=display\">Access EY's latest thinking and learn about its capabilities</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"http://mailto:fso.asean@sg.ey.com\">subscribe to the EY newsletter</url> to stay updated.  </p><p>The views reflected in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organisation or its member firms. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/brought_to_you_by_template_ey_0.png\">https://static.businesstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/image/2022/02/21/brought_to_you_by_template_ey_0.png</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>2022 brings new opportunities for financial institutions in South-east Asia to perform better than before.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64WG-6GT1-JCF2-80S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
